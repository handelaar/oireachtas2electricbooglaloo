      <P>Before we come to deal with questions I wish to announce for the information of the House that I have received notice in writing from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ray Burke, today that he is resigning his membership of Dáil Éireann.  In accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 159 the resignation takes effect upon receipt of the notice.</P>
      <P>I ask Members to reserve any comments they may have until we come to deal with the Order of Business, in view of the strict time limit that applies to Question Time.</P>

      <P>It is with profound regret that I have today accepted, on behalf of the Government, the resignation of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Raphael P. Burke.  It is a double tragedy for Ray and his family that he should feel compelled to tender his resignation at a time of bereavement and great personal stress.  In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution I am advising the Presidential Commission to accept the Minister's resignation.</P>
      <P>Pending the appointment of a successor to the Minister I, as Taoiseach, will assume responsibility for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is also with further regret that I accept his decision to resign his seat as a Member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His outstanding record of service as a public representative for 30 years as a councillor and TD as well as the remarkable 29 years' service of his late father, Paddy, demonstrate in real terms the <Col N="3" /> commitment of the Burke family to the constituents of North Dublin and county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, on taking up office as Taoiseach I made substantial changes in departmental responsibilities and organisation of functions to reflect my commitment to advancing the policies set out in the programme for Government. These changes have brought together the functions that naturally belong together or complement each other.</P>
      <P>This is a sensible arrangement, and one which will ensure that all of the important issues are dealt with within a context which helps us to see the overall rationale for the activities.</P>
      <P>While responsibility for western development and rural renewal was formerly allocated to a Minister of State at my Department, this was one of the areas I reviewed on taking up office as Taoiseach.  I am conscious of the great need for development which maintains the fabric of rural life and the population necessary to underpin the provision of vital services in rural areas.  The rural development portfolio within the Department of Agriculture and Food supports the process of regenerating rural communities which are, of necessity, diversifying away from dependence on traditional agricultural employment.  I see western development as tackling the same issue in seven western counties.  Essentially, the Western Development Commission was set up to focus on a regional response to the problems of the west through economic and social development.  While the commission's brief relates to the west, the lessons emerging from its approach can be applied throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the overlapping nature of the issues which I have just outlined, I have decided that the western development and rural renewal functions should be added to those of rural development within the Department of Agriculture and Food. A Minister of State, Deputy Noel Davern, has been assigned special responsibility for co-ordinating <Col N="4" /> rural and western development, and I am satisfied that he will do an excellent job.</P>
    <P>In respect of the specific question on staffing levels in my Department, formerly there were three officials assigned to work on western development and rural renewal.  These officials did not work exclusively in this policy area but also covered islands development.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Department of the Taoiseach should be directly engaged in ongoing operational functions which take away from its key role of providing the Taoiseach and the Government with policy advice which is central to the process of government.  However, while my Department will no longer deal directly with western development, I intend to maintain a personal interest in the matter.  I want to place on record my commitment to supporting the work of the Western Development Commission which will work alongside the communities and agencies in the west to promote regional development.  I will meet the commission next week to discuss its work, and I intend to hold further meetings with them from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>As a west of Ireland Deputy I am disappointed the Taoiseach did not re-appoint a Minister with responsibility for western development. Not alone did he not appoint a Minister, he took that responsibility away from his own Department, gave it to the Department of Agriculture and Food, and appointed a Deputy from another constituency who has no understanding of the west.  Deputy Donal Carey did wonderful work as Minister of State, and I compliment him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider his decision and reclaim this responsibility for the Department of the Taoiseach as was done under Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach?  The previous Government gave a commitment that all State agencies &mdash; such as the IDA which showed scant regard for the west for many years &mdash; would account to the Taoiseach every year.  I ask the Taoiseach to reclaim those powers for the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the work of the Western Development Commission and hope it will continue.  Western development and rural renewal are not far apart; most of the issues are the same.  The Minister of State with responsibility for this area has a deep understanding of rural Ireland.  He is not from a western constituency, but neither was Deputy Donal Carey from a Border county although he had responsibility for the Border area.  I assure Deputy Ring that the commitment, the work and my interest in the commission will continue.  I have already arranged to meet the commission shortly, and it has asked me to meet it on an ongoing basis.  It has been suggested by the Minister of State, <Col N="5" /> Deputy Davern, and others that a ministerial committee should be established comprising Ministers from the west, Deputies de Valera, McDaid, Ó Cuív, Moffatt and Molloy, to discuss issues of concern to the west.  That will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Is the Taoiseach aware that on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;, this morning attention was drawn to the fact that parents queued overnight in secondary school yards in Dublin to enrol their children for the year 2003, that during Energy Awareness Week it took an hour and a half to travel from Leinster House to the western bypass and that today in the House we will debate the issue of rezoning of hundreds of acres of land to build thousands of little boxes, one on top of the other, in a city choked by pollution, crime and unemployment at a time when schools, sub-post offices and shops are being closed in rural areas?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Is the Taoiseach also aware that the population of the west declined by 200,000 between 1926 and 1991?  Is he further aware that the strength of the western development initiative initiated by the previous Government lay in the fact that every Minister and departmental secretary was directly answerable to the Taoiseach on a daily basis, that the chief executive of every State agency reported directly to the Taoiseach and that by specifying aims and targets the west was kept in sharp focus?  Does he accept that by transferring responsibility to the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment and Local Government he has neutralised the thrust of the approach adopted and effectively abandoned western development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the work of the Western Development Commission and aware of its aspirations.  I look forward to working with it.  I recognise the need for urban and rural renewal.  I am delighted to have a Minister of State of the quality of Deputy Davern who has extensive experience in Europe, Government and this House spanning several decades.  Without taking from any of his predecessors, it will be acknowledged that he is a Minister of the highest quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In transferring responsibility for the Western Development Commission from his Department to a line Department is the Taoiseach making a statement that a particular line Department will have exclusive responsibility and that there will not be a co-ordinating role, given that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is one among equals and that we are talking about a multi-functional body?  In reply to a supplementary question the Taoiseach regarded western <Col N="6" /> development as being akin to rural development. Will he indicate why, having taking the decision to transfer responsibility from a central to a line Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food was chosen rather than the renamed Department of Environment and Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues involved in western and rural development are similar.  There are additional aspects which will be dealt with by the Western Development Commission.  I am due to meet it shortly to discuss them.  The issues involved can be dealt with successfully by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The Minister concerned will have a co-ordinating role.  The Minister for Public Enterprise has reached agreement with An Post that no further sub-post offices will be closed.  The Minister for Education will ensure that schools in the west will remain open and that there will be two rather than one-teacher schools.  The Minister for the Environment is involved in a number of related issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the general election the Taoiseach made a statement that he would abolish the post of Minister of State with responsibility for western development.  He has now done that and for the first time since the foundation of the State we have no senior Minister in Connacht.  Now that there is a vacancy, the Taoiseach might consider appointing a senior Minister for Connacht to show he has some commitment to the west.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I paid my first visit to Northern Ireland, as Taoiseach, to address the biennial conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a few days after coming into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and myself, together with our <Col N="7" /> officials, have had a wide range of contacts with representatives of all traditions and parties in the lead up to the talks.  These contacts will continue as the talks progress.  I envisage, of course, paying further visits to Northern Ireland, particularly with a view to assisting the talks process, whenever suitable opportunities arise.</P>
    <P>I said last week that the move into substantive negotiations which will comprehensively address the totality of relationships is an historic breakthrough and an historic achievement.  I also said that the Government's negotiating position and the national interest will be based on, and served by, the Downing Street Declaration, the Joint Framework Document, the Mitchell principles and the draft report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  I do not believe that it would be appropriate now to expand further on the Government's position outside the talks framework.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I said last week in calling for all the participants to maintain the momentum of progress achieved since July and to join with both Governments in moving forward to reach an agreed settlement as quickly as possible in the interests of all the people of these islands.  I would, of course, be delighted if agreement could be achieved rapidly, but this will depend on the ability of those of us engaged in the talks to work to build compromise and agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government have any specific proposals on North-South bodies over and above the general description of those agreed in February 1995 in the Framework Document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton knows, the strand 1 process started this morning and the other strands will follow during the course of the day.  In each stage it is our intention to put forward a paper &mdash; although not a very comprehensive one at this point &mdash; setting down our aspirations, while keeping them within what is already in the Framework Document and other documents.</P>
      <P>At some levels we have already put forward proposals on North-South bodies concerning the areas and kinds of agreements which we believe could usefully be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the central role the Minister for Foreign Affairs will play in these talks, and having regard to the fact that they are now at a critically sensitive point, can the Taoiseach indicate when he proposes to fill the vacancy of Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue the earlier question of North-South bodies.  Would the Taoiseach agree with me that there is not a great deal of thinking in the Administration on this side of the Border on the detailed work that could be <Col N="8" /> done on a North-South basis?  There are many aspirational ideas about how good it would be to co-operate on this or that, but there are not many concrete specifics ready to be put into action.  Part of the scepticism about North-South bodies on the Northern side of the Border derives from the belief that on this subject we are strong on rhetoric but not strong on hard-headed practical ideas that would be of benefit to everybody in all parts of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last few years detailed work has been done in the Department of Foreign Affairs on this issue.  A range of areas has been set out where co-operation could usefully move forward in the early stage, as well as other areas that would take more time.  On his appointment, the outgoing Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately prepared an extensive document on how the North-South dimension could move forward, building on areas that have previously been mentioned.  Many of them are familiar, such as agriculture and fisheries, as well as arts, culture and tourism.  Approximately 40 areas are not new but over the past few years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more like a laundry list than a list of concrete proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the Deputy calling it a laundry list when he was Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a laundry list.  The list of proposed North-South bodies is comprehensive, yet aspirational because negotiations are only starting.  It has been developed to a certain extent, but it must be developed further during the talks process.  An extensive amount of work has gone into its preparation.  The economic bodies in the North, which represent business and community interests, have given their views on these matters.  Negotiations are only starting but this is an adequate list which has been in existence for some time.  Many people have worked hard during its preparation, but more work will be done as the talks progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is factually correct when he says there is a long list of topics. However, would he agree there is a lack of concrete proposals on how things can be done rather than on topics which can be discussed?  Would the Taoiseach agree to a debate in the House on North-South co-operation in which the Government and Opposition could make specific proposals on how things could be done on the island about which there might not be any political contention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty listening to suggestions and proposals from this House but I do not want people to think the list is a wish list. This list was mentioned during the 1991 talks and many suggestions have been made by CBI and <Col N="9" /> other groups since then.  There is a requirement to develop those proposals.  The list is comprehensive and represents more than a starting position. I support the work done in developing it.  I have no difficulty agreeing to a discussion in the House where people could put forward proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the British Prime Minister has indicated an interest in attending the Northern Ireland peace talks? Has he considered the possibility of attending the talks with the British Prime Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been discussions about that.  It was thought we might do so today but both of us felt that would be inappropriate.  It will take a little time for the talks process to find its feet and both of us will be closely involved.  If a suitable time is found, either one or both of us will attend.  In the meantime, there is close contact between Prime Minister Blair and myself and the key officials involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we have put so much emphasis on executive functions between North and South, would the Taoiseach agree it is important to know what functions we would like to give to these cross-Border institutions?  I will give the Taoiseach an example of my experience as a Minister in the Northern Ireland power sharing executive.  When we were considering functions for the Council of Ireland, my departmental secretary attended a meeting with his counterpart in the South.  Afterwards he asked if the people in the South were serious about the Council of Ireland and about giving it meaningful functions because he said he was given a list by Departments in the South which dealt with animal diseases. I know animal diseases are important but to place so much emphasis on them in a long list of functions for the Council of Ireland is ridiculous. We must ensure that the functions we agree to transfer are meaningful, otherwise discussions will prove to be a nonsense.  From his long experience of holding high office in Government, does the Taoiseach agree that people have an inclination to retain functions rather than transfer them to others?  Does he agree this is not the time for building or retaining empires of that nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  &ldquo;Turf wars&rdquo;, as they are commonly known in administrations throughout the world, occur in cases where people wish to retain the powers they possess. During recent years, Departments and agencies &mdash; both statutory and non-statutory &mdash; have been developing and working closely together on a range of North-South issues.  In recent months I encouraged Ministers to work comprehensively on that list so that the understanding will develop, over a period, that we must not list something simply for the sake of listing it.  There must be a reason that people want these functions developed on a North-South basis.  We want to <Col N="10" /> ensure the development of fair, meaningful and comprehensive arrangements.</P>
      <P>I note the Deputy's concerns about the past but the situation and many of the agencies involved have moved on.  The level of contact is much better than it was five years ago and we must continue our work on it.  The difficulty will be to encourage people on all sides to see the benefits of these developments and reach agreement about the issue of the executive.  At this stage, we are well armed to begin the process and we must continue to develop issues listed in recent years.</P>

      <P>I wish to pursue the Taoiseach's point about giving practical expression to North-South co-operation.  Does he accept that the example of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation was appalling?  Apparently, without any reference to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, the Minister scrapped an agreed all-Ireland logo.  The Taoiseach must insist that Ministers should ensure that full practical expression is given to this principle of co-operation otherwise our friends in Northern Ireland will not take us seriously.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the IBEC conference, Irish Business in the Information Age, which was held on Friday, 26 September at which I made the opening address.  As the Deputy will be aware, my speech as delivered was released to the press.  I have also laid it before the House.</P>
      <P>Given the theme of the conference and the fact that my address was followed directly by a keynote address from Mr. Nicholas Negroponte, one of the world's foremost minds on the information age, my speech touched on a number of key issues for the development of the information society in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In summary, I spoke about Ireland's strategy for the information society, the establishment of the information society commission and the very important role it will play in mapping out for us as a nation the structures and policies we need to put in place to maximise the potential of the new technologies for Ireland.  The commission is reporting directly to me.</P>
      <P>Given the focus of the conference, I also spoke about some of the issues that have been identified as central to the development of the enterprise sector in the information society.  In addition, I referred to the importance of the provision of an appropriate telecommunications infrastructure and drew the attention of the audience to the necessity of working together at a national and international level to ensure the development of an inclusive information society.</P>

      <P>Some months ago, across the floor of the House, arising out of exchanges between us, I suggested to the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, that I would support the idea of holding a State reception, on an all-party basis, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1997 in Dublin Castle.  This will be an historic commemoration and it is my intention that it will be as inclusive as possible to honour all the people who made a contribution to the establishment of national independence and the foundation of the State, and to bring together in a spirit of harmony different political traditions in this State.</P>
      <P>My office will be in touch with Deputy John Bruton and other Opposition leaders about the more detailed arrangements in due course, as I intend it to be a politically ecumenical occasion.</P>
      <P>The Government also intends to hold a State reception in honour of the newly elected President in Dublin Castle on the date of the Presidential Inauguration which will take place on Tuesday, 11 November 1997.

      <P>In my address I commended the Small Firms Association on its initiative and success in organising the exhibition.  I also thanked the commercial sponsors who had given their resources, both in terms of finance and expertise, to ensure the success of the venture.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, for the past ten years or so we have managed to change the enterprise culture.  We now have far more small businesses starting up.  Regrettably, we still continue to have a high proportion of business failures.  We are endeavouring to achieve far closer communication and co-ordination among all State agencies to assist companies in need.</P>
      <P>There are a number of measures which will help them.  Last year's Prompt Payments Bill is one, as is training, and helping them to structure their companies to move into export markets.  For many years the small business sector has highlighted the fact that it is tied up in businesses, that these are often family businesses involving only one or two persons or a single person enterprise and that they are not available to take time off for training and other experiences, and that they need special assistance.  That is what both the Tánaiste and I indicated at that conference.  Having set up a high proportion of small industries, we must address the issue of assisting them in their development, particularly in the early years.</P>

The Commission advised that the majority of the topics listed in the first programme have now been dealt with in its published reports, consultation <Col N="14" /> papers and working papers.  Details of these are contained in appendices to the Commission's annual reports, copies of which are available in the Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Opposition spokesman on Agriculture and Food.  As a Corkman I wish another Corkman well in the post.  I also take the opportunity to wish members of his family well on their expedition and wish them safety on their journey.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to clarify the position with regard to allegations which have been repeated on a number of occasions in the recent past of the illegal export of UK beef as an Irish product.  Over the last two months the EU Commission has undertaken two separate investigations into the illegal export of UK beef.</P>
      <P>The first investigation arose from the discovery of beef with UK markings in Dutch and French cold stores.  Some of this beef bore veterinary control labels indicating an Irish origin.  An investigation was jointly undertaken by my Department and by the EU Commission's anti-fraud unit.  The conclusions were that there was no evidence whatsoever of any Irish involvement.</P>
      <P>The most recent investigation arose in connection with seizures of beef by the customs authorities in France and Germany.  Ireland was one of the several member states whose assistance was sought.  The conclusions of the investigations undertaken in Ireland by both the special investigation unit of my Department and the EU Commission were that the beef in question was shipped illegally from the UK using false Irish documentation.  I would like to emphasise that there is no evidence of fraudulent involvement of Irish beef or Irish meat export plants nor is there evidence that the beef was shipped through Irish territory.  I should also make clear that none of the beef seized bore Irish health marks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The controls on the production and movement of Irish beef are very stringent and ensure that only product which is clearly identifiable as Irish beef produced in export approved plants in Ireland under official supervision receives the necessary official veterinary certification to allow it to be exported.  In addition there are extensive controls at the Border with Northern Ireland to prevent illegal imports of cattle or beef.  The Army operates controls on a 24 hour basis.  The Garda Síochána has a series of static and rolling <Col N="18" /> checkpoints.  The customs authorities and my Department staff are on call on a 24 hour basis.  I am satisfied, therefore, that there are no grounds for questioning the integrity of beef exports from Ireland.</P>
    <P>To counter any possible damaging effects of the publication of allegations, such as those which appeared recently, my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia continue to clarify the position regarding Irish beef in all markets of importance to us.  I have made the position clear to my German and French ministerial colleagues in whose countries the reports first appeared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind remarks.  In a radio interview about a week ago a German importer of Irish beef who was obviously well disposed to that product emphasised that an erroneous perception could constitute a setback to our marketing efforts on the German market. Has the Minister or Bord Bia any plans to promote, advertise or by other means get across the message he did so comprehensively here today in an effort to alleviate the concerns of German consumers resulting from this dastardly act by people who are certainly not well disposed to this country or its products?  Does the Minister intend taking any steps to maintain a high profile for Irish beef and to entirely dissociate himself and this country from that activity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Coveney has said, that the image of any food product is vital and that any wrong or erroneous perception causes great difficulty in the marketplace.  I have availed of the opportunity to apprise all our embassies of the position so that they may clarify any specific queries raised and obtain any favourable media coverage in the countries concerned. In addition, Bord Bia is undertaking a similar promotion and information campaign.  I met the German and French Ministers for Agriculture individually.  They totally accept, as does the entire European Commission, that there was no Irish involvement nor was Irish territory used for the transportation of illegal beef.  Nonetheless I have availed of the opportunity to ensure that all the agencies involved are fully apprised of the precise position and will use their good offices to ensure the maintenance of the high reputation of Irish beef throughout the marketplace.</P>

      <P>There is a wide range of policies already being implemented by my Department, including direct payment programmes for farmers, aids for &ldquo;on farm&rdquo; investment, structural improvement and environmental protection in addition to the Leader programme to support rural communities.  It is also envisaged that rural development will form a very important element of Agenda 2000 in addition to which the European Union Commission has undertaken to present detailed proposals.  I will seek to ensure that a coherent and integrated rural development package forms a central part of any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Moreover, I will shortly submit proposals for consideration by Government on the scope of a White Paper on Rural Development which will address the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>While the decline in farm numbers and those employed in agriculture will continue unabated in the absence of radical policy initiatives and changes affecting agriculture generally, does the Minister agree that increasing emphasis is being laid on alternative enterprises in the case of suitable farms and greater &ldquo;off farm&rdquo; employment?  Is the Minister aware the current drift from farming runs at an average of some 5,000 to 6,000 persons per annum; that whereas in the late 1950s in excess of 300,000 people were engaged in agriculture, that figure has dropped to 100,000 and continues to drop to the extent that, presumably over the next decade, it will reach an all time low of some 30,000 farmers? What is worrying is that if this continues it will create problems in urban areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prefacing my question.  Will the Minister implement a rural renewal scheme similar to the urban renewal scheme?  Will he also consider giving special taxation incentives to entrepreneurs and business people who locate much needed industry in those areas?  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to ensure support for the maximum number of family farms and to achieve a more equitable distribution of support payments by reforming the direct payments scheme.  Has the Government taken any action to implement that?  Reform of the direct payments scheme is fundamental if farmers are to remain in rural Ireland.  Has the proposal put forward by the Irish Cattlebreeders and Stockowners Association been given any consideration by the Minister?</P>

      <P>In the past three years, over £2.35 million has been spent on rural development.  The Leader programme, for technical rural development, has £88 million in funds to be disbursed.  A rural renewal scheme is a matter for the White Paper and I suggest the Deputy and any others <Col N="20" /> have as much input in it as possible.  The Land Act, 1965, stated that 45 acres was an economic holding.  The White Paper will be important and will be shortly discussed by Government.  I hope everyone will have an input to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers was one of the submeasures operated under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99. The programme had an indicative budget of £17 million and was launched in December 1994. It was expected that about 3,000 young farmers would participate.  Due to the high level of demand, the scheme was suspended with effect from 7 August 1997 in respect of new applications. By 1 October 1997 a total of some 3,240 young farmers had been paid about £18 million under the scheme.  In addition there are about 600 other applications being processed currently with a potential grant commitment of about £3.5 million. <Col N="21" /> As part of the operational programme the independent analysis and evaluation unit carried out a detailed evaluation of the scheme during the term of office of my predecessor.  It indicated that the scheme should be terminated as it was not meeting the main objective of encouraging the earlier transfer of farms.  The Department of Agriculture and Food, as part of its submission to the mid-term review, sought additional funds to enable the continuation of the scheme.  This was additional to funds sought in other areas where the level of applications had already exceeded the level of funds available.  The mid-term review took on board the views of the independent evaluation report and a report prepared by consultants on the operation of the first half of the operational programme, both of which recommended the suspension of the scheme, and accordingly did not make any additional funds available for the continuation of the SIA scheme.  The scheme was consequently suspended on 7 August 1997.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that there are currently in excess of 6,600 farmers participating in the scheme of early retirement from farming.  While this money is not going directly to young farmers, the benefits of the earlier transfers along with other national aids have greatly assisted in the improvement of their position.  In addition, An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises the need to support young farmers by ensuring adequate provision for access to quota or production rights by qualified young farmers and stamp duty exemption for young farmers taking over family holdings.</P>
      <P>I am considering the matter and will be closely monitoring progress of other large-scale projects in the Community Support Framework as a whole in early 1998 to see if savings are likely to be identified in any area.</P>

In view of this and the refusal of his predecessor to discontinue the scheme despite recommendations made to him, how can the Minister justify his change of mind in such a short space of time to young farmers?</P>

I have a copy of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> from 14 December 1996 in case there is any doubt about this.  The newspaper, under a heading saying that installation aid is to be dropped, reports the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who was attending a young farmers' conference in Cork as saying that delegates applying for the scheme should do so sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>Since others are interested in quoting, I wish to cite a memorandum which Fianna Fáil sent to Macra na Feirme on 21 May regarding the installation aid scheme.  It states, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil is committed to the continuation of this scheme which is very important not only to young farmers but to the general profile of agriculture&rdquo;. How can the Minister say that within a matter of months he has changed his mind?  He was aware of the response of the previous Minister and of the relevant reports.  I do not see how he can justify this decision and, as he is an honourable and decent politician, he should reverse it.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that there was inadequate funding when I arrived in office to allow the continuation of this scheme.  It is a good scheme and every encouragement should be given to young farmers.  We must be mindful of the prudent management of the national finances and prioritise how money is spent.  Cognisance has to be taken of the findings of any evaluation of schemes.  The consultant's report into this scheme indicated statistics which show that most young farmers commencing farming now are under 35 years of age regardless of their access to the scheme; changes in national tax laws have succeeded in removing the main costs associated with the transfer for the majority of younger farmers; very large farmers are in receipt of aid under this scheme which means that resources are not concentrated on those who most need it; and young farmers should be supported with grant aid for on farm development instead of once off lump sums.  It concluded that the scheme should be suspended. I had no option in the face of inadequate funds but to suspend the scheme from 7 August.</P>
      <P>I will be seeking to provide resources and to encourage younger farmers in every way possible to set up in farming and to optimise their potential.</P>

      <P>The Action Programme for the Millennium commits the Government to the establishment of an independent agency to administer FEOGA and other payments such as a premia to farmers.  I am preparing for early submission to Government, proposals to set up the <Col N="23" /> agency.  I hope to be in a position to proceed with its establishment within weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister will implement this programme because if one looks at other questions tabled today, one will note the concern of rural Deputies about payments from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  We will keep a watchful eye so that weeks do not become months in this case.  I hope, as the Minister said, it will take weeks to implement the programme. If not, further questions will be raised about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>On what basis will this independent agency be established?  Will some staff in the Department of Agriculture and Food be seconded to the new agency?  How many people will be involved?  What commitment will be given to farmers on the charter of rights?  If payments are not made on time, will the Department take responsibility?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give us an insight into the Food Safety Board, another independent agency? At what stage are the Governments deliberations with the Food Safety Board?  How many staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food will move to the new board?  Is it expected this new agency will employ 1,000 or 100 people? While this does not relate to the question tabled, people want to know what is happening with the Food Safety Board.  Many people do not understand the need to set up a new agency.  Will the same apply to the payments board and how many people will be involved in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand a separate question has been tabled on the proposed food safety authority, I will be glad to answer questions on it.  The FEOGA and direct payments agency will be established.  The proposal has not yet gone to Government so I am not in position to give the final detail.  However, it will go to Government within weeks.  It will be an independent autonomous agency under the control of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, a sizeable body with staff numbers well in excess of 1,000. The body will be responsible for FEOGA payments, intervention, export refunds, headage payments, premia and agricultural structures.  A considerable number of payments will be involved. For example, up to £1 billion per annum is paid in direct payments under FEOGA and support arrangements for the industry.  Total payments reach £1.5 billion per annum so we are talking about the involvement of a sizeable number of staff which will entail discussions with the social partners, the unions and staff associations, in particular, which are ongoing.  I expect to be in a position to go to Government in regard to this agency within a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of setting up the agency is to streamline the payments system, to ensure there are adequate controls and discipline within the <Col N="24" /> system and to free up senior Department staff to give policy advice, which is their core function. Senior staff must have sufficient time to give the best possible advice to the Minister, particularly given the prospect of Agenda 2000 and another GATT round.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton raised the question of the efficiency of the payments system.  By and large, the system is relatively good, apart from applications which contain errors.  The commitments in the charter of rights have largely been met.  As far as I am concerned, if it is possible to improve the system we will ensure that is done. There is a continual improvement in the information technology systems there.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is also the major question of the controls required by Brussels on the payment of such large amounts of money.  That will be a major function of this new unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage this independent agency operating a number of local units, or at least a number of regional units, as opposed to one centralised agency?  That would allow farmers to sort out problems face to face with the relevant officials, rather than getting entangled in a bureaucratic nightmare in which they could be disallowed payments to which they were entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing network of offices throughout the country will be maintained.  I hope access to them will be improved and that the very good rapport which farmers and producers have with those offices will be maintained.  However, it will be a separate unit within the Department, with individual responsibility for the making of FEOGA and direct aid payments and the vitally necessary controls of those payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so &mdash; it is in relation to payments to farmers.  The most important thing is to get the cheque.  I know people who have been waiting six and eight months for a reply from the Department.  I received an apology from one of the Minister's officials yesterday because I received a reply last week to a query which I submitted last February.  That is not good enough. Can these matters be dealt with more speedily, particularly when people's livelihoods depend on those cheques?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can identify totally with what Deputy Ring said because, in common with most Members present, I represent a rural constituency. We have a fair amount of interaction with our constituents who regularly bring to our attention <Col N="25" /> innocent errors in their applications.  There has been a considerable improvement in the standard of applications over the years because the forms now have improved information notes and people take greater care in filling them out.  Nonetheless, bottlenecks and delays occur from time to time.</P>
      <P>During my last period as Minister I set up an inquiry unit for Members of the Oireachtas, which has worked very well.  The staff of that unit work very hard and any Member to whom I have spoken about it has received a response within 24 hours, although it might not always have been a positive response.  My predecessor set up an appeal system in an effort to examine applications with which there were difficulties and to deal with them separately.  That system works relatively well.</P>
      <P>However, there is a plethora of schemes and payments &mdash; ten and 22 month payments, deseasonalisation payments, the ewe premium, headage payments, area aid schemes and digitalisation &mdash; with changes being made to them, combined with percentage, final and top-up payments. The staff are working flat out and as anyone who visits or contacts the offices in Castlebar or Portlaoise will be aware, the staff are courteous although they are under a fair amount of pressure.  When this arrangement of schemes was introduced in 1994 they had to make many repayments. They have done a particularly good job and they are subject to audit by the Department and the EU.  They cannot make payments willy-nilly but must have supporting evidence.  We will ensure the efficiency of the payments system as far as is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's compliments to the staff.  Can anything be done about the problem with the area aid maps before the payments are made for 1997?  I know he and the Minister of State are aware of this problem which is causing great difficulties.  If the maps are not deemed to be correct the farmers will not be paid.  Will the Minister give a commitment to the many farmers who have problems with maps that their cases will be examined shortly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is the subject of another question.  I called to Hume House some time ago to see the system being operated.  Since there have been difficulties with the harvest I asked the staff to make a particular effort to get the payments out as quickly as possible this year.  I am confident a large number of payments will be made from 16 October.  I expect that a high percentage of payments will be made on and from that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy is, as set out in its Action Programme for the Millennium, to have the REP scheme extended for a further ten years.  Officials in my Department are in discussion with the European Commission on our proposal to extend REPS.  Indications are they will receive favourable consideration as they have a positive environmental impact.  In the context of the Santer proposals REPS will provide a ready vehicle to facilitate the implementation of environmental measures in Ireland and will be an appropriate channel for Community funding in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to extend the time period involved?  The contract between the farmer and the Department is for five or six years.  Is it envisaged by the European authorities that after the year 2000 the contract will be for a ten year period?  The protection of the rural environment is so important that when farmers enter into such a contract they should know their plan will be implemented over a ten year period and that they will receive the relevant grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention to have the period extended to ten years giving rise to a 15 year period overall.  It would be for a period of 15 years because it makes sense that if one does environmental work for five years, to take away the payments that kept that environmentally friendly attitude and work in place would be a waste of time.  It must be on the basis that people will be in this plan for 15 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's intention to extend the plan.  As Deputy Connaughton said, many have joined this scheme and it is important they be given an indication of the length of time it involves.</P>
      <P>One problem is that there is sometimes a delay in payments to those who have secured additional acreage since their original application.  Can the Minister of State ensure that the Department issues a directive on this issue?  I agree with the Minister of State that this is important for the environmental sustainability of agriculture.  Given that the first step has been taken, will the Minister take the second step and bring back the control of farmyard pollution scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up the matter of extra acreage with the Department.  Regarding the extension of the REP scheme, there are conditions in that scheme that are sometimes ignored by planners.  They seem to take an <i>á la carte</i> approach to the effect that without fertiliser and too much phosphate, the situation is fine.  That must stop and planners who advise farmers badly in this way, leading perhaps to total loss of REPS payments, will be severely dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an update on the Department's proposals on payments to farmers approved under REPS when some of their lands are designated as national heritage areas? Will the Department honour the agreement made by the farming organisations and the Department earlier this year or will the Government renege on the agreement on the levels of payment per acre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 130,000 farmers in the REP scheme, which is about 18 per cent of the national total.  The agreements that were made earlier this year concern the rate of pay determined by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It is a separate area payment.  I am sure that any agreements that were made will be kept, although I am unsure of exactly what those arrangements were.  All payments under the REP scheme will be made and extended with the Commission's permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>REPS has been the most successful scheme the Department has brought in for many years, particularly in the west where many farmers have entered it.  One ongoing problem, which I raised with the previous Minister, is in relation to leased commonage.  Every reply one gets on this matter states that it is being taken up with the EU Commission.  Some applicants have not received one payment, although they have done nothing wrong.  That must be dealt with as quickly as possible in Europe.  Does the Minister of State see REPS becoming compulsory in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's position as I have the same problem in my area in relation to commonage.  European regulations demand the ownership or title of rights to those lands and this is a difficult issue.  Those affected have my full sympathy and that of Department officials and the Minister.  We are trying to sort out the problem as quickly as possible, though it affected the previous Government also, which shows it is not easy to solve.  Everyone involved is trying to solve the problem on behalf of those in commonage areas.</P>

The Minister of State managed to side-step the question by saying it was a matter for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and, technically speaking, he is correct.  However, in the last Administration &mdash; and I assume the Minister's is no different &mdash; there was a great deal of consultation between the two Departments.  As the Department of Agriculture and Food pays the initial tranche of this money, can I take it that farmers who have portions of land within the NHAs or the SACs will receive the payment promised to them before the general election? They will not care which Department pays the money but, by and large, they will expect the Department of Agriculture and Food to be batting for them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Central to keeping people in rural areas and stopping the drift from the land is a reasonable income and security for small farmers and their families.  Is the Minister aware that the sharp cutbacks in EU premia on ewes in the past two years due to the increased price of French lamb is causing enormous difficulties for small farmers in disadvantaged mountain areas?  Is he aware also that the relatively low lambing rate of sheep breeds suitable for the mountains and their lower weights mean that the higher prices are not benefiting small farmers in mountainous areas?  In west Kerry, for example, the income from family farms has decreased in the past two years by as much as £1,500 per annum.  That is a crippling blow and does not provide any incentive for young people to remain working on the land.  Will the Minister agree that in this context so-called economic prosperity is benefiting only the big ranchers while having the opposite effect on small farmers?  Furthermore, is he aware the most powerful farmer organisations with which he is usually in contact represent the interests of ranchers and do not highlight the difficulties of small farmers in disadvantaged areas? Will he carry out an urgent investigation into this matter as a contribution towards assisting people to stay on the land and have a reasonable future in rural Ireland?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his interest in rural Ireland and I am glad he has not forgotten it.  I agree that the system for mountain lamb is unfair.  The decision by the EU on lamb prices affects the premia paid to mountain farmers in particular.  Because their lambs are lighter, mountain farmers do not get the same support as other farmers despite the fact that they are in most need of that support.  I agree with the Deputy about that anomaly. On farmer representation, that is a matter <Col N="31" /> for the able members of the farming community on the opposite side of the House who are proactive in that area.  As part of the national anti-poverty programme, it is the Government's policy to publish a White Paper on Rural Development, one of the three main recommendations from the national anti-poverty conference.  Real poverty is being experienced in rural areas and that problem needs to be addressed.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I note the Minster's recognition of the problem but given the need to keep people on the land will he carry out an investigation into this very concrete difficulty for small farmers in disadvantaged areas and put forward short-term proposals to address the fall in incomes which he acknowledged has taken place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the drift from rural areas and, in particular, the land has accelerated since the abolition of the land commission?  Smaller and younger farmers cannot get additional allotments or acreage to increase the size of their farms.  Is it envisaged to set up a land agency to help people in such circumstances and thereby stem the flight of 5,000 people from the land every year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals to re-establish the land commission in any shape or form.  Deputy Penrose will remember that the last farm was bought in the late 1970s-early 1980s when an acre cost £3,000.  People were willing to pay the price but unfortunately they cannot pay it back today.</P>

      <P>The Government, by order dated 12 July, transferred to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources the functions in relation to forestry which until then had been exercised by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. No functions have been transferred to either the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
      <P>These decisions were made by the Government in order to ensure that Ministers have coherent packages of functions and powers which are best adapted to advancing the development of the relevant sectors of national economic and social activity.</P>
      <P>Certain functions in relation to food safety are to be transferred to a food safety authority to be established under the aegis of the Minister for Health and Children.  The functions concerned have not yet been precisely delimited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the responsibilities of the various Departments.  Is it envisaged that the independent food safety authority will take over most of the functions of the Department of Agriculture and Food or as it will come within the remit of the Department of Health and Children will social welfare officers carry out the functions carried out at present by agriculture officers?  What will be the size of the unit and is it proposed to transfer 1,500 civil servants to it?  I understood that the authority was to have monitoring functions similar to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Are we talking about a much bigger animal and, if so, will the Department be reduced to being policy driven only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton asked me to clarify matters.  A definitive decision has not been taken other than to establish such an agency.  The detail of it has not been decided yet.  There is a food safety authority in existence and it is a monitoring authority.  Dr. Hill was appointed chief executive to that body fairly recently.  It is now envisaged that body will be given additional powers under the aegis of the Minister for Health and Children and staff currently employed by the Department of Agriculture and Food, the health boards and the local authorities will continue in their positions.  They will be asked by the new body to carry out their duties by way of contract. This will be a big body because a large number of people are employed in inspectorates.  They include environmental health officers, veterinary officers employed by county councils and the Department of Agriculture and Food and AOs also employed by that Department.  There are a large number of people employed by a range of agences, but they will remain in their Departments <Col N="33" /> or agencies and carry out duties under contract.</P>
      <P>Similar to the FEOGA agency, any changes will be brought about in consultation with the staff associations and unions concerned.  The reason for the establishment of this authority is to give greater assurance to consumers that the food available is safe to eat, contains no harmful residues and to guarantee the safety and quality of Irish food for our export markets.  Strengthening the present body will add greatly to confidence in Irish food and will maintain it having regard to food scares that occur from time to time</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it the staff to be employed by the new food safety authority will be more or less the staff already there but they will take their orders from a different commander?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing staff will continue to work in the same Departments or agencies, but they will be contracted by the new body to work on food safety and quality.  The detail of how that works out must be decided in consultation with the staff associations because of the sensitivity involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates's question raises the issue of the justification for these changes.  It is curious that responsibility for forestry, which is a land based activity largely though not entirely carried out by farmers, should be moved from the Department of Agriculture and Food with which it is a natural match to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources which deals with water based resources and activities.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister, but does he believe the furtherance of Irish forestry will be better served outside his Department?  This is a curious mismatch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy does not believe I would give a negative reply to that question. Responsibility for forestry has been transferred to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  Forestry is a natural resource industry.  It is a fine industry with tremendous potential and major development in plantation and processing has taken place in recent years. We have some of the best processing facilities in the world.  The added value will be significant for the future.  It does not give me any great pleasure to see responsibility for forestry being passed from one Department to another down through the years.  Responsibility for it has rested with the Departments of Energy, Fisheries and others and I would like it to have a permanent home at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the setting up of the new food advisory group?  He is talking of staffing in the same places but simply under different bosses.  As producers, consumers and exporters we want to be certain that the quality <Col N="34" /> of our food is beyond question.  It does not make sense to talk of an independent body whose staff will work within the existing framework.  I understand the difficulties which arise when inspectors and other personnel perform different tasks at different times but that should have been considered before the announcement.  The Minister is fulfilling an election promise but in reality there will be no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a major natural resource industry with exports of almost £5 billion pounds per annum.  It is important that customers and consumers at home and abroad have total confidence in our products.  My predecessor established a food safety authority.  I am strengthening that authority to ensure that when questions arise about the quality of food and the efficacy of food processing there will be total and absolute confidence in the certification agency concerned with these matters.</P>
      <P>This new authority is a science-based body.  Food scares arise from time to time.  The largest such scare in recent times concerned BSE which led to a substantial fall in the consumption of red meat.  From time to time similar concerns arise in relation to other food products and there is a need for a science-based body offering a comprehensive, coherent and rapid monitoring system to ensure confidence.  It was generally agreed that the Department of Health should have the primary role in this matter.  The then Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was seen as supporting developments at farm and processing levels. The new, science-based body is a radical development and it will be very helpful in relation to our exports and domestic consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the decision of the Ceann Comhairle to give us some minutes to make a few remarks.</P>
      <P>Let me repeat briefly what I said at 2.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is with profound regret that I have today accepted on behalf of the Government the resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Raphael P. Burke, and his resignation from Dáil Éireann.  Pending the appointment of a successor I, as Taoiseach, will assume responsibility for the Department of Foreign Affairs <i>pro tem.</i></P>
      <P>It is a double tragedy for Ray and his family that he should feel compelled to tender his resignation at a time of bereavement and great personal stress.  His outstanding record of public service over the past 30 years, first as a county councillor and later as a TD, as well as the remarkable 29 years service of his late father, Patrick J. Burke, demonstrate in real terms the deep commitment of the Burke family to the people of Dublin North and Dublin county.</P>
      <P>In recent times, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, he was deeply involved on behalf of the nation in the difficult and demanding search for agreement in the Northern Ireland peace process.  Ray Burke showed all the superb professional skills of organisation, communication and vigour for which he was so rightly renowned.  He and his family can feel immensely proud of the major role he played in Government in successfully achieving the breakthrough which resulted in today's historic achievements in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank him for the consummate professionalism with which he also fulfilled his ministerial duties.  Ray Burke always distinguished himself in the ministries to which he was appointed by his <Col N="41" /> great managerial capabilities and his high work rate.  He introduced a series of initiatives in law reform and structural changes while in the Department of Justice, as well as tackling the whole area of serious offences against children. He opened up a whole new era of local broadcasting when he legislated for the now successful local radio network which has changed the face of Irish broadcasting.  He stood four square with the strategically important development of Dublin Airport in good times and when times were tough.  He was, in turn, an excellent Minister for the Environment, for Energy, for Communications, for Justice and for Foreign Affairs.  He brought distinction to his proud family tradition, to his family, his friends, his colleagues and his constituents.  This country owes him a debt of gratitude for his work on behalf of the nation and his constant commitment to quality performance in his allotted tasks.</P>
    <P>Those who choose politics as a profession know from the outset that they are putting their lives on the line in their determination to serve the public. They have to accept the criticism which attends their decisions and their every action.  Their families too learn to take the brunt of stinging remarks which often overstep the boundaries of civility and courtesy.  In the case of Ray Burke, I see a much more sinister development, the persistent hounding of an honourable man to resign his important position on the basis of innuendo and unproven allegations.  Some who would class themselves as protectors of basic civil rights have harried and hounded this man without according him the basic right of due process which deems us innocent unless proven guilty.  The according of due process is not just a basic right but the very essence of common decency.  There has been a sustained campaign of incremental intensity. When this debate first began there were calls for Ray Burke to make a public statement.  There were demands for a Dáil statement followed by questions and answers, but when it was agreed that a special tribunal would deal with all the issues fairly and comprehensively, that was still not enough.  There comes a time when even the strongest shoulder bows, the stoutest heart falters and the very best can resist no longer.</P>
    <P>I regret the resignation of Mr. Burke, my party colleague for over 20 years and my Cabinet colleague for most of that period.  I deeply regret the reasons for his resignation and the pain and anguish caused to his wife Anne, family and friends.  It is an indictment of those involved in forcing him to this pass that they clamoured for his resignation without giving him the proper opportunity of proving his case before a properly constituted tribunal or otherwise.  I have always found him to be a proud, honourable man, loyal, true, persevering, principled, caring and committed but tough and a person who lost friends easily. On behalf of the Government but in particular on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I thank him for his distinguished years of service to his constituents and his country.</P>

      <P>I will repeat what I said as the Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, chose to interrupt my statement.  I regret the circumstances which have led to Mr. Burke's resignation at a difficult time for him personally and on a sad day for his family.  I regret that he felt it necessary to bring to an end his 24 years of unbroken service in this House.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Justice he showed himself to be resolute in defending the security of the State.  When he made his personal statement in the House we, on this side, were criticised by many, including some on the Government side out of the side of their mouth, for not going hard enough on him and for not jumping to conclusions on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I note what the Taoiseach had to say about innuendoes.  Both he and his party are masters of innuendo.  I will not deal extensively on this occasion with what I have repeatedly said in recent days is the core issue.  The Taoiseach knew about all the matters involved before he appointed Mr. Burke as Minister and Mr. Burke's sacrifice of himself and his political career does not detract in any way from the Taoiseach's knowledge of and responsibility for the events which have led to this day.</P>

      <P>I learned earlier today that Mr. Burke had resigned from the Government.  In view of the additional revelations and allegations which appeared over the weekend I was not surprised. No Minister could have sustained that pressure indefinitely, particularly when there was every indication that the pressure would continue or that there could be further allegations.  I did not suspect however, nor did anyone else, that Mr. Burke would resign from Dáil Éireann.  The pressure on him since his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs was immense and it showed no sign of relenting.  It was not confined to him but extended to his immediate family at a time of a family bereavement.  I am not entirely surprised therefore by his decision to resign from Dáil Éireann.  Clearly the pressure on him and his family had become unbearable.  It is an indication for the public and the media of the difficulties in public life and how those difficulties have been intensified in recent times.</P>
      <P>Mr. Burke has made the correct decision in the interests of the country.  His responsibilities and the state of the talks in Northern Ireland were such that he could not do the job required of him while these matters were engulfing him.  I regret, however, that in deciding to resign from this House he did not choose to make a comprehensive statement on the exact reasons he not only resigned from the Government but also from Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact, contained in the statement, that he intends to co-operate fully with the investigations of the Moriarty Tribunal, which will be conducted in due course.</P>
      <P>The Government finds itself in a difficult position. Its minority position has been further eroded and its confidence is visibly shaken.  The Taoiseach has assumed responsibility for foreign affairs, but we do not know for how long he will retain that responsibility.  Bearing in mind that the Northern Ireland talks are at a critical juncture, it is absolutely essential that a new Minister for Foreign Affairs be appointed without further delay.  That person, whoever he or she may be, must be given the maximum support in order to familiarise himself or herself with a complex and complicated brief.</P>
      <P>All the matters we are discussing today, and the speculation that has brought them to a head, could have been avoided at the outset of the formation of this Government if the Taoiseach had displayed leadership, courage and judgment in the composition of his Government.  Sadly for former Deputy Burke, he did not do so but, more importantly, the interests of the country have been damaged as a result.</P>

      <P>: This is clearly a sad day for former Deputy Burke, his family and colleagues.  It is particularly sad because of the family bereavement which he has had to endure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> This morning his brother was laid to rest.  Former Deputy Burke has done the right thing from his own point of view and that of his family and the Government.  Being in Government is certainly demanding.  As he said himself in the statement he issued this afternoon, being involved in the Northern Ireland talks, in particular, at this historic juncture required his total focus.  He was not in a position to give it his total focus because of the ongoing controversy that has surrounded his term as Minister for the past 14 weeks.</P>
    <P>While I did not know former Deputy Burke well, I admired him, particularly for the stand he took against the men of violence over a long period both as a Minister and Opposition Deputy. During the past 14 weeks I got to know him better. I respected the fact that he had an enormous command of his brief and he worked tirelessly to bring about peace in Northern Ireland.  On the night the Government was appointed, he told me that Foreign Affairs was the one ministry he had always wanted.  He worked in that Department with a great sense of excitement and determination. In so far as he could, notwithstanding the controversy, he worked extremely hard.</P>
    <P>I also sat with him on two Cabinet sub-committees; one on Northern Ireland, the other dealing with European affairs.  I saw at first hand what a sharp mind he had and how determined and tough he was.  It is all the more regrettable that he had to resign in these circumstances.  We have lost out because, if circumstances had been right, he had the capacity to deliver a lasting political settlement thanks to the kind of negotiating skills I saw him display over the past number of weeks.</P>
    <P>I wish former Deputy Burke and his wife Anne well.  In recent months his family has suffered much illness, which has added to the enormous personal pressure he has had to endure.  I saw him this morning and he is a shaken man.  Over the next few weeks I hope he will have an opportunity to take stock, have a rest and perhaps to reflect on what has happened.  I hope that in whatever career he now chooses to follow, he will have success and will get the kind of delight and satisfaction he got from politics both in Opposition and in Government.</P>

      <P>Ray Burke's position as a Minister had become untenable and, therefore, he took the correct course in resigning from Government.  It had become increasingly obvious that he could not operate effectively as a Minister, especially giving the crucial talks in Northern Ireland the attention they need, with the controversies that were raging around him.  It is essential that a full-time Minister for Foreign Affairs should now be appointed as a matter of urgency to take up those negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resignation of former Deputy Burke raises serious questions about the political judgment of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  Why did the Taoiseach appoint him to such a senior and sensitive position when he was aware of the extraordinary circumstances of the acceptance by Mr. <Col N="45" /> Burke of a donation of £30,000 in 1989, and when he had initiated a series of inquiries into the Minister's role in the sale of passports in 1990?</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has serious questions to answer.  Within two months she moved from a position of total and unqualified support for Mr. Burke, to frantic efforts to distance herself from him over the past few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Does the Tánaiste still stand over the statement she made on 7 August when she said she had total faith in the Taoiseach's judgment in relation to Fianna Fáil members of the Cabinet?</P>
      <P>While Mr. Burke's resignation as a Minister had been generally anticipated, there will be widespread surprise at his decision to resign from the Dáil.  I heard nobody calling for his resignation as a Deputy.  Time will probably reveal what went on within the Government parties which led him to resign from the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Certainly, it is difficult to understand why the Taoiseach voted down the Democratic Left amendment that would have permitted an inquiry by the Moriarty Tribunal at the preliminary stage, and then proceeded to announce, out of the blue, the establishment of a totally new and separate tribunal.</P>
      <P>On a personal level, everyone, including Members of the Opposition, will have sympathy with the situation in which former Deputy Burke found himself.  The Deputies opposite are, presumably, the only people in this House who have any human feelings at all.</P>

      <P>This is obviously a personal tragedy for former Deputy Burke and his family. I think it was John Hume who once said that all politics ends in tears.

These tensions could well be exacerbated by today's events.</P>

      <P>On that day when former Deputy Burke answered questions in the Dáil he was obviously under severe pressure and I found it excruciating.  I went to a Fianna Fáil colleague afterwards who was advising the Minister and I asked him to pass on the message that this was not to be taken personally. His response was a noble one.  He said: &ldquo;Never apologise for doing your parliamentary duty&rdquo;.  On occasion, it is hard to avoid feeling like a member of a firing squad, but we are in an adversarial system.</P>

      <P>I would like to mention the 30 years of service that former Deputy Burke gave to the constituency of Dublin North.  That excellent service was maintained by an office based in Swords.  The Taoiseach outlined former Deputy Burke's tremendous record in every ministry he held, particularly the Department of Justice where the great deal of reforming legislation he introduced will stand the test of time.  For over 12 years as a party colleague I soldiered through thick and thin with former Deputy Burke.  At all times we had an honest personal relationship which culminated in the last election with an excellent result for Fianna Fáil in winning two seats.  One opinion poll which matters for everyone in politics is the electorate.  On each occasion that former Deputy Ray Burke stood in Dublin North on behalf of Fianna Fáil, the people made him their poll topper.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Sinn Féin, I want to record our appreciation of the positive role played by former Deputy Ray Burke in the peace process.  He helped to steer the process towards the substantive talks which have finally come to pass.  The priority for Sinn Féin and for everyone concerned with the success of the peace process should not be the personalities of the Irish Government delegation at Stormont but the policies and principles they advance there.  It is essential that the national interest is promoted at the talks.  The Government's priority in the talks should be the failure of partition, the need for fundamental political and constitutional change, the constitutional imperative to move towards Irish unity and sovereignty and the need to end the Union with Britain.  This will be the task of whoever is chosen to succeed Mr. Burke.</P>
      <P>We must put the controversies which have precipitated this resignation in perspective.  Citizens have been told by successive Administrations that they are cleaning up their act and that they want to restore the reputation of politics and politicians in the eyes of the public.  The current series of revelations exposes a political culture where the wealthy are rewarded for their connections with those in Government and <i>vice versa.</i>  It is not a question of certain politicians giving all the rest a bad name.  The issue is one of policies and practices which favour the haves against the have nots.  It is unfortunate that this resignation has overshadowed the commencement today at Stormont of the most important talks since partition on the future of this country.  The success of the negotiations should be the continuing priority for us all.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathy and that of my colleagues at all levels in the party to Mr. Burke on his recent bereavement.</P>

    <P>Dear Mr. Gogarty,</P>
    <P Just="Center">PROPOSALS FOR DISCUSSION</P>
    <P>Re: Your lands at Finglas, Ballymun, Donabate, Balgriffin and Portmarnock, Co. Dublin.</P>
    <P>I refer to our many discussions regarding your following six parcels of land: &mdash;</P>
    <P>Lot 1: 100 acres (approx) at North Road, Finglas, including &ldquo;Barrett's Land&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Lot 2: 12 acres (approx) at Jamestown Road, Finglas. <Col N="53" /> Lot 3: 100 acres (approx) at Poppintree, Ballymun.</P>
    <P>Lot 4: 255 acres (approx) at Donabate (Turvey House and Beaverton House).</P>
    <P>Lot 5: 250 acres (approx) at Balgriffin.</P>
    <P>Lot 6: 9 acres (approx) at Portmarnock.</P>
    <P>I submit the following proposals for your consideration:-</P>
    <P Just="Center">PROPOSAL No. 1 &mdash; Purchase Proposal</P>
    <P>Lots 1, 2 and 3 Purchase Price £4,000 per acre 10% deposit payable on the signing of the contract</P>
    <P>Completion 1 year from date of contract.</P>
    <P>Lot 4: Purchase Price IR£1 Million</P>
    <P>Deposit 10% on contract</P>
    <P>Completion 2 years from date of contract.</P>
    <P>Lot 5: Purchase Price IR£750,000.00</P>
    <P>Deposit 10% on contract</P>
    <P>Completion 3 years from date of contract</P>
    <P>Lot 6: Option to be granted for nominal consideration (£100.00)</P>
    <P>for a period of 2 years at a purchase price of £30,000.00 per acre.</P>
    <P>PROPOSAL No. 2 &mdash;</P>
    <P>Participation Proposal As an alternative to the outright purchase proposal above I am prepared to deal with Lots 1 &mdash; 5 (inclusive) above on the basis that I would be given a 50% share in the ownership of the said lands in exchange for procuring Planning Permission and Building Bye Law Approval.  The time span which I would require to be allowed to obtain the Permissions and Approval and my anticipated financial expenditure (apart from my time input) in respect of the different lots would be as follows:-</P>
    <P>Lots 1, 2 and 3</P>
    <P>A period of 2 years within which to procure a buildable Planning Permission and Building Bye Laws Approval for mixed development including housing, industrial and commercial.</P>
    <P>My financial expenditure up to a figure of £150,000.00 (to include Architect's fees, Consulting Engineer's fees, Planning and Bye Law charges etc.).</P>
    <P>Lots 4 and 5</P>
    <P>Time requirement &mdash; 3 years.</P>
    <P>Financial Expenditure &mdash; up to £150,000.00</P>
    <P>In considering the above proposals the following points of information should be borne in mind by all parties:-</P>
    <P>1.  From the point of view of obtaining Planning Permission the entire lands (lots 1 to 6 inclusive) have the following shortcoming:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> NO zoning for development purposes</P>
    <P>NO services.</P>
    <P>NO proposal in current draft development plans (City and County) for the zoning of the lands or any part thereof for development purposes.</P>
    <P>2.  We face a very severe uphill battle to arrange for the availability of services and for the ultimate procurement of Planning Permission.</P>
    <P>3.  The steps to be taken on the way to procuring a buildable Planning Permission and Building Bye Laws Approval are notoriously difficult, time-consuming and expensive. Material Contravention Orders must be obtained and this involves the procurement of a majority vote at 2 full Council Meetings at which 78 Council Members must be present and it also involves satisfactory compliance with extensive requirements and pre-conditions of the Planning Authority and the inevitable dealing with protracted Appeals to an Bord Pleanala.</P>
    <P>4.  It is essential that the Planning Application should be brought in the name of an active housebuilding company which enjoys good standing and good working relationship with the Planners and the Council Members and in this regard I confirm that in the event of our reaching agreement regarding the within proposals that all Planning Applications would be made by one of my Companies which meets the said requirements.</P>
    <P>5.  In the case of all of the lands the applications will be highly sensitive and controversial and we can realistically expect strenuous opposition from private, political and planning sectors.  One of my active companies will have to take the limelight in such applications and withstand the objections and protests which will inevitably confront it.  Apart from the anticipated financial expenditure as outlined above it should be borne in mind that I will personally have to give extensively of my time and efforts over the entire period of the applications including the necessary preliminary negotiations in regard to services and zoning. It must be borne in mind that I will have to abandon other projects which would be open to myself and my companies in order to give proper attention to this project.  If I am successful in changing your lands from their present status of agricultural lands with very limited potential even for agricultural use into highly valuable building lands I would have to be rewarded with a minimum 50% stake in the ownership of the lands.  Our advisors would have <Col N="55" /> to work out the details as to how this can be effected in the most tax-efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing from you in relation to the above proposals.  In the case of the first proposal which relates to the outright purchase of the lands (excluding Lot 6) I would not be adverse to a proposal which would involve the vendors retaining a participation stake of up to 20% in the purchasing company if you felt that an ongoing interest in the future development of the lands would be more acceptable to the present owners.</P>
    <P>MICHAEL BAILEY.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jim Gogarty,</P>
    <P>Clontarf,</P>
    <P>Dublin 3.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>An tAire Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil</i>
    </P>
    <P>I join with the Taoiseach and other Members of the House in extending my sympathy to former Deputy Ray Burke and his family on their bereavement.  I also express my regret that he felt it necessary to resign from his position as Minister for Foreign Affairs and from this House.</P>
    <P>The Government decided at its meeting on Tuesday last to move a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas establishing a tribunal of inquiry. The decision was taken to meet public concern created by the recent publication of a letter referring to planning permission and its procurement. That letter was the latest in a series of moves which have gone a long way towards destroying public faith in the planning process as a key aspect of our democratic system.  The Government believes it is vital to deal finally and conclusively with the public concerns raised.</P>
    <P>I am glad to put before the House today a motion incorporating comprehensive terms of reference which are the product of extensive consultation with the Opposition parties and on which a considerable degree of agreement has been achieved.  Under these terms the tribunal will examine in detail the planning history of six parcels of land, adding up to 726 acres, dealt with in the letter.  Not only will it examine the planning history, it will also examine the servicing and by-law approval involved.  In addition, if the tribunal as it goes about its business, becomes aware of other issues suggesting corruption in the planning system even if they are not directly connected to the lands in question, it will have the power and the right to consider those issues.  When the tribunal finishes its business, the Government, and I am sure the House, wishes that the doubts around this specific case and the planning system will have been dealt with and cleared up.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to argue today the issues which are more properly addressed by the tribunal. However, I want to raise as a longer term issue with all Members of this House the balance between whistle blowing and public confidence in <Col N="56" /> the democratic institutions, the tension between the fearless pursuit of wrongdoers and the destruction of an individual by the manipulation of public opinion.  Democracy cannot function at local or national level if people have no confidence in the workings of democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>Trust is the essence of all government, whether local or national.  Such trust is based on free elections, open discussion and clear procedures followed by public servants and public representatives of strong ethical standards.  This is not a naive or idealistic trust.  Just as in the private sector where there is evidence of corruption, there are methods by which that corruption can be exposed and rooted out.  Those methods must change with the times.  What goes unquestioned in one decade may emerge, at a later date as a serious loophole allowing, even fostering, corruption. When that happens, the system must change utterly and quickly.  Where systems fail to serve the public, it is frequently the whistle-blower who reveals the failure.  This can be someone who has suffered or someone who has benefited but who is later unhappy at having benefited.</P>
    <P>Members will agree that to cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo; to corruption, name names, produce evidence and admit to even a small involvement in past corruption requires courage.  Let us never underestimate the courage required to blow the whistle on corruption particularly if in the process, a powerful and popular person, party or group is accused. That courage is essential to the maintenance of trust because, ultimately, the specific case can be speedily addressed and answered, wrongdoers subjected to the process of the law and the system strengthened by the removal of flawed individuals from within it.  However, that is not what we have witnessed in the past number of weeks and months.</P>
    <P>What we have seen in the past few weeks and months, regardless of the side of the House on which we sit, must be recognised by all Deputies as deeply threatening to ourselves, the system we serve and the civil rights of the people we serve. The threat lies not in the accusation but in the method of accusation.  What we have seen is an infinitely clever erosion of a reputation based not on upfront accusation and production of evidence but on instalments of venom.  We have not watched the relentless rooting out of corruption; we have watched a soap opera, with an unseen scriptwriter doling out the dramatic scenes to different producers.  The timing of this has been chillingly exquisite.</P>
    <P>What we have witnessed in the recent weeks is the feeding of prejudice against an individual.  At no stage has enough evidence been offered to justify that steady feeding of prejudice.  However, because of the timing of the instalments and their placement, the exercise has been remarkably effective.  It has been so effective because the public mind is a busy and preoccupied one.  Someone ensures that what reaches that public mind is a series of soundbites, beginning with a soundbite about a large financial donation.  If members of <Col N="57" /> the public are then asked if they trust the person about whom they heard this sequence of course they will say that they do not.</P>
    <P>This proves the effectiveness of not coming straight out with an accusation but dribbling it out in hints and suggestions over a long period of time.  I am not sure the nation benefits from learning that lesson.  I am not sure we in this House, regardless of the side on which we sit, will benefit from it either.  It may not cost us a thought when this planned poisoning is carried out against someone from another party.  However, a weapon which proved so deadly in its effectiveness will be used repeatedly.  It is a matter of time before any one of us finds himself or herself baffled with rage and frustration, unable to pin down the accuser or the accusations, unable to prove ourselves innocent and filled with terror at the thought that we must do so; that a cornerstone of our democratic system has been removed, leaving us without the protection in which we trusted and in which the citizens of this State trust.</P>
    <P>When we hear people saying &ldquo;sure didn't we always know&rdquo; what we are hearing is the abandonment of a central principle on which the justice system of this country is predicated.  When we hear allegations treated as evidence and insinuations treated as proof, we would do well to be worried because, regardless of whether the person at the centre of the storm is a friend or an opponent, we are hearing the death rattles of trust.  When trust dies, no democratic institution has value.  When trust dies, none of us has firm ground from which to work because that work is founded on the trust of individual voters who have chosen us to represent them.</P>
    <P>The words used in recent days have the ring of an excited bloodsport rather than an examination of standards and ethics.  Everyone has seen the words to which I refer in print and the phrase &ldquo;bringing him down&rdquo; has been used continually. In the event that my contribution is distorted outside this House, I wish to make it clear that I am in favour of exposing corruption and tightening whatever safeguards will prevent corruption; rejecting attitudes and behaviour which, in any way, damage the trust our people have in their systems and the people who work those systems; seeking out evidence, insisting that a case be answered; and convicting an individual if, in the process of an investigation, that person is proven to have acted unethically, improperly or illegally. In other words, if the process results in &lsquo;bringing him down&rsquo;, so be it.  However, &lsquo;bringing him down&rsquo; it is not and should not be the first objective for anyone inside or outside this House &mdash; it is the end result of a democratic process which strengthens rather than demeans democracy.</P>
    <P>The recent accusations have found themselves a welcome which may emerge from a number of motivations.  The context for some of them may have been set by disapproval on environmental grounds of some decisions taken by councils and the suspicion that they can only be explained by personal gain.  In some cases, that suspicion has <Col N="58" /> caused ghastly hurt not only to the families of people in this House, but to former colleagues. The aspersions cast on the late Deputy Seán Walsh, which proved to be completely groundless, provide a classic example.  The story moves on, there is a shrug about the fact that it proved to be untrue, and neither the accusers nor those who carried the accusations care about the rights of a dead man or the agony of his family.</P>
    <P>It is time to put an end to this corrosive cruelty dressed up as principled investigation.  The tribunal of inquiry with the proposed terms of reference should be the instrument to do so and, in the process, will protect the integrity of those who serve our political institutions.  In the long-term, the solution lies not in a tribunal but in the suggestion mooted by the Taoiseach when in Opposition that a commission be established on a permanent basis to which this kind of issue can be referred at any time.  This would be the most effective method of dealing with such matters and the Government is bringing forward this legislation to effect it.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will be an historic and pivotal procedure if it can remove the lingering doubts about the planning process.  If doing so means that someone stands fully accused and is proven to have taken a bribe, distorted the integrity of the system or been involved in other illegal activities, that will be welcomed by the Government and acted upon immediately.  We are all entitled to that.  There is no one in this House who has not felt the referred contempt resulting from perceived failures of individuals.  It is simply not fair on those of us, whether public representatives or public officials, trying to do a difficult job, if we find that job complicated by malicious, unjustified rumours.  We must ensure that when councillors take decisions, they do so for the common good and the good of their constituents, not because they, personally, stand to gain financially.  It is because of that imperative that the terms of reference will enable the tribunal to deal with all of the issues emerging from the planning history of the lands referred to in the Bailey letter.</P>
    <P>The Government strongly believes that this flexibility, in addition to the capacity vested in the tribunal to deal with any acts which, in its opinion, are corrupt, is vital if the tribunal is to isolate wrongdoers, if any exist, make specific and actionable what has been vague and without consequence and restore vital trust in the systems established to serve the citizen.  It is significant and regrettable that, at this point, the word &ldquo;rezoning&rdquo; has a pejorative ring to it.  The minute one sees a headline with the word &ldquo;rezoning&rdquo; in it, the assumption is that the rezoning should not have happened and probably only did so as a result of someone lining their pockets with illgotten gains.  It is a deeply satisfying theory, but it is quite simply wrong.  The fact is that rezoning is part and parcel of the normal process of change.  Things change, needs arise, the population grows and new industry is set up to serve the employment needs of that population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> The uses to which land and buildings were put ten or 15 years ago may now be out of date.  It may be absolutely appropriate to review and rezone in order to reflect the reality of change in the economy and social circumstances.  It is simple &mdash; people need houses.  At the moment, the housing supply does not match the demand and the result is price increases which are prohibitive to many.</P>
    <P>An adequate supply of suitably zoned and serviced land for development is, and will continue to be, necessary if we are to meet the rapidly expanding housing needs of the population.  That is a fact.  It is also a fact that there is nothing sinister about either the word &lsquo;rezoning&rsquo; or the reality it expresses, provided that rezoning is done for the proper motives and in a way that is clearly straight and honest.  I do not agree with the notion that every decision in development planning where elected councillors have a role must agree at every point with official advice.  If that were the case, we would not need councillors to have independent minds, indeed we would not need councillors at all.</P>
    <P>We have councillors not just to rubber-stamp official recommendations but to balance the many issues involved in what is always a complex process.  That is why the law gives responsibility to people who are fully accountable to the electorate. However, some of those who are responsible to the electorate wear as a badge of honour their opposition to all rezoning, as if it proved their integrity that they were unwilling to respond to the changing needs of the populace.  It is time these people were forced to get real and to admit that rigid adherence to the zoning of decades ago is no virtue in the face of today's needs.</P>

      <P>Without rezoning, house prices would be even higher than they are, as the previous Government recognised when it decided to commission a study into house prices last May and also decided that the preparation of regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area would deal with the need for serviced land for housing development.  Incidentally, I note that Dr. Garret FitzGerald wrote recently in his column in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the urgent need to rezone more land for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members of this House know, local planning authorities must review their development plans at least every five years.  This has not happened in County Dublin because the then council failed to meet its statutory obligations.  As a result <Col N="60" /> of this failure, the 1993 Dublin county development plan was adopted ten years after the adoption of the previous plan.  The Fingal county manager's report, which will be presented to the tribunal, points out that it is not surprising land use strategy in north county Dublin would need to be radically re-examined given the major industrial, commercial and residential development taking place in the area.  Long delays in updating developing plans will inevitably lead to this sort of pressure especially at times when the economy is booming.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the past, steps must be taken speedily to ensure that this kind of delay does not and cannot happen in future.  These delays impair good planning.  The Government's programme completely updates and consolidates our planning laws and will go a long way to eliminate some of the problems of the past couple of decades.  I have started this already by initiating a comprehensive review of planning legislation.  I am consulting widely with the general public, all local planning authorities and a wide range of groups affected in one way or another by the planning system and how it operates.  I have made it clear that a priority of mine is to increase public participation in the development plan review process.  I would like to introduce greater consultation, to make the adoption of development plans as inclusive as a process of that kind can possibly be.  I want the public to be consulted earlier in that process. When people are included and information is widely shared, there is less fertile ground for rumour, suspicion and chronic doubt.  I aim to revise the present system to minimise that chronic doubt.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the reasoning behind the setting up of a separate inquiry, apart from the tribunal under Judge Moriarty, to deal with the current issues.  The Moriarty Tribunal follows directly from the earlier tribunal and because it is a consequence and continuation of it, it is bidden to deal with the affairs of people who were found guilty of wrongdoing by that earlier tribunal.  The inclusion by name of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Deputy Burke, in that context would inevitably create guilt by association. This would be grossly unfair and would infringe on the basic rights of such an individual.  It would also indicate an abandonment of fair-mindedness on the part of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons for a separate tribunal. Let us imagine that any one of the clouds of accusations currently in circulation proved worthy of further investigation.  If that were the case, the Moriarty Tribunal would not be able to follow the trail.  These accusations deserve a dedicated tribunal with a tight focus.  In addition, there is one point on which accusers, accused and bystanders agree &mdash; that justice be urgent, not postponed or protracted.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty Tribunal already has the task of looking into matters of considerable detail and complexity and would be hard put to give the <Col N="61" /> urgent attention to a wider brief that is so very necessary.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference before the House reflect the urgency I am talking about; the belief, shared by us all, that this sorry situation should be cleared up in the shortest possible time.  Those terms of reference allow the tribunal to look into the circumstances of the letter sent by Mr. Bailey to Mr. Gogarty in June 1989.  They allow the tribunal to investigate the planning history of all the land detailed in the letter and to inquire into all councillors, Oireachtas Members and officials who were directly or indirectly involved in any way in matters related to those lands.  They give the tribunal the right to inquire into money paid out and to find out if those moneys had any effect on the planning history of the land involved.  The terms of reference also propose the tribunal should investigate applications for planning permission related to these lands since June 1985, the date of the previous local elections.  It is also appropriate that the tribunal consider land servicing and ask whether anybody attempted to improperly influence decisions on providing infrastructure.</P>
    <P>However, the terms of reference do not stop there.  Building by-law approval was required for all new buildings constructed in the Dublin area before June 1992.  The procurement of this approval was mentioned in the letter, so the tribunal will investigate whether there was anything untoward in the grant either of by-law approval or of fire safety certificates for the buildings on the land in question.  Nor will the tribunal deal only with housing land.  It will be required to examine the designation of some of the land in question as an enterprise area.  Enterprise areas are vital in creating employment.  The tax system acknowledges that and the designation of land can bring substantial tax benefits to the owner. This, too, will come under scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will have the power to discover all relevant documentation.  Under &ldquo;relevant documentation&rdquo; I include information which Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly Solicitors say they hold.  Clearly, it is essential that such documentation be placed at the disposal of the tribunal and, given the statement by the solicitors that their unnamed clients are motivated by a desire to have a public inquiry into allegations of land rezoning corruption in County Dublin and elsewhere, no doubt they will give the tribunal their fullest co-operation.  I express this confidence because, since the firm of solicitors in question is based beyond the jurisdiction of the State, it must be hoped that the tribunal should not be forced into the minefield of legal complexities implicit in the enforcement of powers of discovery in this context.  I hope that their clients, who have been described as &ldquo;concerned environmentalists&rdquo; and who have a strange desire to remain anonymous, which is unusual for concerned environmentalists, will co-operate fully and facilitate the tribunal by releasing all the <Col N="62" /> information they have to it directly or through their solicitors, Donnelly, Neary, Donnelly.</P>
    <P>If the tribunal points up deficiencies in the operation of the planning Acts, I assure this House that I will have such issues properly and speedily addressed.  Recommendations will be built into all future planning.  In addition, the programme for Government commits us to introduce provisions parallel to those in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 which will apply to local authority members and officials.  Deputies can be in no doubt that this will be a thorough and rigorous investigation covering any possible aspect of the lands in question giving rise to public concern, one with appropriate terms of reference and a tight focus.  It is time we forced people who corrode public confidence to put their evidence on the table and support the accusations they make. It is time we cut away the undergrowth of rumours and nudge nudgery, and rebuilt public confidence in the institutions where trust is essential. Rebuilding that trust is not a matter we can delegate to any tribunal.  This tribunal should give us some clarity based on which we can begin this task but the task relies on the work of this House. None of us must ever conceal wrongdoing or collude with a colleague whom we know to have broken the law but, equally, none of us must ever, for the thrill of a quick headline, destroy an individual's reputation without real evidence and in the process further erode confidence in the institutions of which we are a central part.  Accordingly, I commend this motion and the terms of reference to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. <i>a</i>1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph A.3(ii), after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, past or present,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister respond to my amendments and other amendments which have been tabled when he replies to the debate later this evening?  He has not referred to the concerns underlying those amendments and if he is not responsive at this stage, we will have more trouble with this motion and what it sets out to do.</P>
      <P>I share the feelings of a great many Members of the House that there is a remarkable harshness in debating these issues at a time when the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, has suffered a very sad family bereavement and on a day when he has taken the action of resigning both from the Government and this House.  I should make the point that timing is a matter for the Government and in this case the timing on the Order Paper today was decided by the Government.  If the Government had adopted a more open-minded approach at any time in the past week, the matter would have been concluded before today and before Mr. Burke suffered such a sad bereavement.  I put that on the record because there were references to crocodile tears on the other side of the House earlier which were unworthy even of anybody on that side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> It has taken a week of argument and 12 drafts of these terms of reference to get a debate on this motion.  From its initial position of being unwilling to have any consultation on the issue with the Opposition, the Government has been forced, with great difficulty, to concede important amendments.  Its proposal still requires clarification and amendment.  That is why I tabled the amendments in my name and they are not the only ones before the House.</P>
    <P>The Government's first approach was to propose very broad terms of reference framed in such a way as to cause us to believe that the activities of Mr. Burke in 1989 might fall outside the scope of the tribunal.  It was our strong view that this was an obvious ploy to cast the net wide in the hope of finding other unspecified matters which would divert attention from the main issue. Indeed, as Deputy John Bruton pointed out on several occasions during the past week, the Taoiseach reinforced this view when he spoke vaguely of other unspecified allegations which might emerge and even went so far as to put a number on them &mdash; he referred to six possible allegations which might emerge.  Such was the nature of that as to give us the strong feeling that our suspicion was well founded and that part of the ploy in setting out such wide terms of reference was to divert attention from the main issue.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it was with some scepticism &mdash; although I am glad to note that the Minister has changed his position quite considerably on this &mdash; that I heard the Minister refer this afternoon to the fact that the accusations which have been at the base of all this deserve &ldquo;a dedicated tribunal with a tight focus&rdquo;.  Nobody on this side of the House objects to broad terms of reference but we insist they must make perfectly clear and put beyond doubt that the specific case of Mr. Burke will be properly investigated.</P>
    <P>The Minister's presentation this afternoon represents a coloured retrospect of what actually was attempted because it was not until there had been deep, detailed and acrimonious discussions between the party whips that we got to the point where references were included specifically in these terms of reference which made it clear that specific issue would be addressed as well as all the other issues which the Minister raised.  We have achieved that at the suggestion of Deputy John Bruton by providing a specific reference to payments made by the individuals concerned in all of this and to the cash donation of £30,000 made in June 1989 to Mr. Burke, which was debated in this House on 10 September.  It took an enormous amount of argument to get to the point where those references were included but I am glad that we have succeeded in frustrating the Government's attempt to muddy the waters.  I tabled two other amendments today which are designed to put that beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Questions have arisen in the context of the issues under discussion about the adequacy of legislation on corruption.  I have tabled an <Col N="64" /> amendment one of the effects of which will be to ask the tribunal to make recommendations on amendments to this legislation if it sees fit to do so.  The amendment also covers electoral legislation and legislation on freedom of information.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the tribunal will not make recommendations regarding these areas of legislation or the other ones referred to in the Government's text.  However, to be complete, we should draw its attention to the fact that questions have arisen about the adequacy of legislation on corruption and we should ask it to deal with this if, in the course of its deliberations, it finds that it can usefully add to what is on the Statute Book or can recommend additions to it.</P>
    <P>I have also tabled an amendment to deal with the situation where the tribunal, on initial private inquiry, finds that there is insufficient evidence about a given matter to proceed to a full public inquiry.  The fear has been expressed in the context of the Moriarty tribunal that this might provide a means by which an individual might avoid answering questions on the grounds that the available information is not sufficiently focused. Should that arise, the amendment makes it clear that the Dáil will be given full information as to why the tribunal might conclude that there is not a <i>prima facie</i> case.  This would at the least allay any public fear of a cover up and might also provide a basis for defining new approaches to a problem if it turns out that the difficulty arises only from the construction of the terms of the reference of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. <i>a</i>1 proposes that in paragraph A.3.(ii) the words &ldquo;, past or present,&rdquo; be inserted after the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo;.  This arises because the person whom this clause was designed to include has today ceased to be a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 proposes to add, at the end of paragraph A.3.(ii), the words &ldquo;, or who received payments from any of the person or companies referred to at (i) above&rdquo;.  The objective is to make it clear again the characteristics of the specific case from which this exercise has flowed.  A doubt has been expressed that the drafting of subparagraph (ii), even its reference to Members of the Oireachtas and with the addition of the words &ldquo;past or present&rdquo;, might not cover the situation adequately because it is conceivable that were these terms of reference to be put into operation a Member or a past Member of the Oireachtas could say that he or she was neither directly nor indirectly involved in making representations or voting or abstaining from voting. We want to make it clear that there is in this case a specific well identified former Member of the Oireachtas who has questions to answer about this issue.  The additional words I propose puts that beyond doubt.  I will later explain the reason for moving this amendment in this way.  I also propose to repeat the proposed amendments to paragraph A.3.(ii) in paragraph A.4.(a).</P>
    <P>In paragraph A.5 I propose an amendment which would add the words &ldquo;or inducement&rdquo;<Col N="65" /> after the words &ldquo;.  ..which involve attempts to influence by threats or deception.  ..&rdquo;. In the specific case which we wish to address, which does not preclude dealing with any other possible cases, it has not been alleged at any stage that there was any attempt to influence by threat or by deception. It may be, and this is what must be investigated, that there might have been an attempt to influence by inducement.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me that the amendment is redundant because the proposed terms of reference refer to the possibility that the tribunal might find something which, in its opinion, might amount to corruption and that the legislation dealing with corruption makes it clear that inducements are what is involved.  However, the reference here is not to the legislation dealing with corruption; it is to corruption in the dictionary definition of the term.  To be sure, and because it adds to certainty and does not reduce clarity, I propose that the words &ldquo;or inducement&rdquo; be added to make it clear that we are looking at all possible forms of interference or improper influence on the processes in question.</P>
    <P>In paragraph A.6 I propose that the words &ldquo;and Ethics in Public Office&rdquo; be deleted and the words &ldquo;, Ethics in Public Office, Electoral, Freedom of Information and Prevention of Corruption&rdquo; substituted.  I have already referred to the reasons for the inclusion of the words &ldquo;Prevention of Corruption&rdquo; substituted.  Members of the House are aware that the legislation has been criticised for being out of date and that we need to look again at the formulation of its definitions.</P>
    <P>In addition to that legislation and the legislation already referred to in the terms of reference, it is not inconceivable that the tribunal might find that it wanted to make recommendations regarding electoral legislation where new provisions have been recently enacted regarding campaign financing, contributions, etc., and that it might also wish to make a reference to or recommendations regarding legislation on the freedom of information.  The Minister stated the laudable ambition of ensuring that the planning process, including the process of reviewing planning and making changes to plans, should be made as transparent as possible to the public.  In that context it may be that there would be a gain from having modifications or appropriate extensions made to the scope of the legislation on freedom of information.  This is, therefore, an appropriate place to propose such an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy proposes that specific legislation be included in the terms of reference. If specific legislation is mentioned, I am concerned that the tribunal may consider it necessary to examine such legislation.  I have no difficulty with the tribunal making specific recommendations regarding legislation, for example, with regard to the Electoral Acts.  Would the Deputy consider the wording &ldquo;any other relevant legislation&rdquo;?  To specify Acts may divert the tribunal down <i>cul-de-sacs.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the Minister's remarks.  I will consider his suggestion if he will consider my proposals.  Perhaps we may have an opportunity to discuss matters between now and when he replies this evening.  I have a preference for clarity and specificity but take the point the Minister for the Environment has made, that we do not want the tribunal to be tempted to go off in all directions although the evidence so far is that the most recent tribunal was well able to resist the temptation to venture up side alleys.</P>
      <P>The next amendment I propose is to add paragraph B.(iv):</P>
      <P>and the Clerk of the Dáil shall thereupon communicate the tribunal's report in full to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This deals with the case where a tribunal finds there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry when, for understandable reasons, it has conducted an initial inquiry on a private basis.  The paragraph in the Government's proposed terms of reference, as it stands, would require the tribunal to report to the Clerk of the Dáil, in such a manner as the tribunal thinks appropriate, on the steps it has taken to determine what evidence, if any, existed.  I do not know what happens thereafter but it would be very useful if we could provide that, since the Dáil has gone to the trouble of setting up this tribunal, we should be informed in full of the thinkings and findings of the tribunal even in cases where it feels there is no <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
      <P>I make that comment for a number of reasons. First, if it is known that the tribunal has investigated a particular allegation and has concluded there is no reason to proceed to a full public inquiry, the public and this House deserve to know why.  Second, once we have received the conclusions of the tribunal, it would be important to be fully informed of what it has investigated, and this amendment would help in that exercise. Third, there may well be cases where, in spite of the care taken here, the manner in which the terms of reference are written simply might not suit.  If the tribunal reported that under its terms of reference it had found, on initial inquiry, that it did not deem it justified to carry out a full public inquiry, this House should be able to return to the issue and ascertain whether it was simply a matter to do with the casting of its terms of reference and, so to speak, mend its hand.  If on the other hand, the merits of the case did not justify an inquiry, the House would be very happy to know any fears that might have been expressed were fully allayed.  That amendment would clarify the work of the tribunal and what we would do with its deliberations once presented to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of reasons I urge the Government to agree with the kind of specificity that I propose adding to these terms of reference by way of the amendments I have tabled.  In the debate on 10 September last Deputy Raphael Burke raised as many questions as he answered. If not fully investigated by the tribunal these <Col N="67" /> issues will continue to cause problems.  If they are not specifically identified for the tribunal difficulties of the kind the Minister present, with some justification, complained of in the course of his remarks will arise.</P>
    <P>I refer Members to the Official Report of 10 September.  As reported at columns 620 and 621 Deputy Ray Burke said he was not involved in any way in making representations in favour of certain actions taken in 1989 then being examined by the House.  However, he went on to say that in the period between 1991 and 1993 he found he had an objection to certain things being proposed in Dublin County Council, that at the time he wrote to a prominent Fianna Fáil member of the council and went so far as to lead a delegation to meet the then Minister for the Environment.  That may well have been the case and was well-motivated action on his part but nonetheless it creates a problem in accepting, at face value, what he said in the earlier part of his statement.  Having said he had had no involvement in these matters because he was not a member of Dublin County Council, he then went on to illustrate how he had been involved at a subsequent date, one contemplated by the terms of reference of this tribunal. That needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ray Burke then went on to speak about the donation of £30,000 he had received &mdash; I refer Members to column 618 of the Official Report of 10 September 1997 &mdash; and said he had given £10,000 to the Fianna Fáil Party at national level.  He did not say that the £10,000 given to the Fianna Fáil Party at national level was part of the £30,000 he had received in that donation.  I see the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Noel Dempsey, shaking his head, but I must emphasise that these are legitimate questions.  Deputy Ray Burke further went on to say he had given £7,000 to the Fianna Fáil Party organisation in his constituency of North Dublin.  Again, he did not say whether that £7,000 were part of the £30,000 donation he had been given.  He also said in that speech that he had received other donations during the course of the election campaign which he was not going to detail in this House because he felt they were not proper matters for inquiry by the House.  I do not think too many people disagreed with that comment, but he did not say whether those sums of £10,000 and £7,000 were part of the £30,000 he had received by way of this very generous donation.</P>
    <P>That gives rise to certain questions and to a further series of consequential questions.  If those sums came from the £30,000, what happened to the remaining £13,000 of which he did not give an account?  If they were not part of the £30,000 donation, what happened to it?</P>
    <P>The explanations given by Mr. Burke on that day and his references to his personal financial position and overdraft did not help to clarify what was done with the £30,000 donation he had received.  That should be enough to indicate there are sufficient questions to justify accepting <Col N="68" /> amendments which put beyond any shadow of doubt that this specific case will be closely examined.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when he said he hoped that Messrs.  Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly Solicitors, will make available to the tribunal what information they have at their disposal.  I very much share that hope; it is most important that they do so.  The letter sent by that firm of solicitors to Deputy John Bruton and other Members of the House dated 30 September 1997 contained some rather curious phrases.  Speaking of 52 allegations concerning planning and rezoning around the country but particularly in Dublin, they said the following:</P>
    <P>Some of these allegations are frivolous and most do not lead me to believe that criminal proceedings would be likely to ensue.</P>
    <P>They went on to say:</P>
    <P>. some of them seem <i>prima facie</i> to give cause for concern.  Six of these have been forwarded to the Garda but more warrant proper investigation.</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of some person with a typical lawyerly indecipherable signature, writing on behalf of Messrs.  Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly. I do not know who that person may be, he or she may well be a very eminent solicitor but it is not his or her business to decide what, in our jurisdiction, amounts to improper or illegal conduct and what does not.  It is not the business of that person to decide which allegation is frivolous and which is not.  That is the job of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is not the business of that person to say that some of these allegations <i>prima facie</i> give cause for concern and that some do not. That is the business we propose to hand to a tribunal properly established under the legislation of this State.  Six of these allegations have been forwarded to the Garda and that is a very public spirited thing for Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly to do.  However, it is not their business to decide what is put to the Garda and what is not.</P>
    <P>While Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly, and the people they represent, those who came together some time ago to offer a reward of up to £10,000 for information, may have been well-intentioned in doing what they did, they have taken the wrong road in getting results.  I say this for several reasons.  They have allowed Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly, to take unto themselves the functions we expect the Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor to carry out.  Second, they have gathered information and made allegations in a way which leaves the rest of us in the dark as to their substance, the motivation of those who made them and their readiness to provide the information our legal system and the British one require to substantiate a charge brought before a duly constituted court of law.  I do not criticise these people for their views and concerns; <Col N="69" /> it is just that they have chosen a route which is fundamentally flawed.  Given that we are going to the trouble of establishing this tribunal, they should make available to the tribunal all their information, regardless of whether or not they think it is frivolous, so it can be handled by a body properly constituted to do so.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has no political credibility left after her statement today in response to the former Deputy Ray Burke's resignation.  I was appalled &mdash; I invite those on the other side of the House who spoke of crocodile tears to have a discussion with the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney &mdash; by what she said, the manner in which she said it, and her conduct over the past week or so prior to saying it.</P>
    <P>The Government has been hugely damaged by what has happened over recent weeks.  It has been damaged by the way the Taoiseach handled this affair and by the hesitation and vacillation shown by the Tánaiste in dealing with it.  The forced resignation of a Minister after a lengthy period of controversy can only damage a Government. The Taoiseach's judgment is in question because that period of controversy was lengthened by his failure to take the kind of action demanded and needed some time ago.  He has been dogged by this business, as was the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the United States, Belfast and here.  Recently the Taoiseach went to the launch of a worthy project, the Sail Chernobyl campaign.  All that achieved publicity on the national airwaves was this affair and not the very worthwhile enterprise undertaken by five fine young people who have shown great courage and dedication.  That is only a small example of the damage done to the Government by this affair.</P>
    <P>I wondered until last weekend whether the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, had taken a vow of silence or joined a contemplative order of nuns, because there has not been a word from her.  The only thing we heard came last weekend when she suddenly spoke about the passports affair.  It seems the Tánaiste knew of this last July, if not earlier, but omitted to tell her party colleague. One third of the members of the Progressive Democrats in Cabinet were not informed of this and similarly for one half of those members who are Ministers of State.  That indicates a Government which has serious problems with internal communication and a fatal difficulty in understanding how its actions, or in this case its lack of action, are seen by the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult debate for all in this House with the backdrop of the family bereavement of a central character.  As party Whip of the Labour Party, I contacted the Government Whip yesterday and asked that this debate be deferred until tomorrow so as not to intrude on the private grief of the family today.  I regret that that was not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the opening passages of his contribution, the Minister spoke of the essential protection of the <Col N="70" /> planning system.  As a former Minister for the Environment, I also regard that as being of extreme importance and one of the fundamental rocks of our democracy.  People should know that under the planning system everyone is treated equally, the merits of any proposal are judged on planning criteria alone, and the laws enacted by this House are the only guidelines followed by statutory bodies, be they locally elected authorities, An Bord Pleanála, or any other.  There has been a huge and unfortunate erosion in public confidence in the way the planning system works and this is not a recent development.  We have sought over decades to refine, improve and make more transparent the planning system, but there is still a major deficit in public confidence in the working of the system.  In my time in office, I sought to have made public the reports of inspectors in the planning system.  Some held the view that it would bring the sky down, that people would not be able to write objectively if they knew it would be made public.  However, the demand was obvious and it is right we have complete openness concerning the treatment of citizens by any statutory agency.</P>
    <P>The reason the planning system has come into such sharp focus is the obvious one mentioned by the Minister, the potential to make enormous profits arising from planning decisions.  That is especially true in the hinterland of our capital city, where zoning decisions, planning approvals, or material contraventions can change the value of a portion of land by an enormous factor.  For that reason, we must be particularly transparent in how the mechanisms of the State, be they local or national, deal with such applications.  All of us have had representations to assist people with projects requiring planning permission and representations from people aggrieved by planning decisions.  Aggrieved applicants often reach the conclusion that they were not subject to fair play. Often it is difficult to decide if an aggrieved person has a basis for making an accusation or if they are disgruntled because they did not get the decision they wanted.  Anybody who makes a planning application, as is the case with anybody involved in legal proceedings, cannot be sure of the outcome.  The only certainty is that there will be winners and losers.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are specific issues which have finally forced the Government to recognise the need to establish this tribunal.  The issue is not the soundbite, as described by the Minister, regarding the handing over of a large financial contribution to an individual, but the fact that a political contribution of £30,000 was made to an individual and the allegation that, a number of days prior to this, one of those involved in making the contribution suggested that he could procure planning approval for certain designated lands. Anybody interested in the protection and transparency of the planning system would be alarmed at such a development.  It demanded an independent inquiry.  This is the genesis of the new tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Initially, those of us in Opposition simply sought a sifting of these facts.  We were unaware of the suggestion which subsequently came to light that Mr. Bailey could procure planning permission. During the debate on the Moriarty tribunal we sought to include a sifting of the facts regarding the contribution to the former Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, within its terms of reference. Unfortunately, that was voted down by the Government with the assistance of some Independent Deputies.  It was a dreadful mistake for the House, the Government and Mr. Burke.  If a decision had been made some weeks ago to include a sifting of the facts within the remit of the Moriarty tribunal, the issues could have been left to it and the truth would have been divined in the proper setting.  However, that did not happen and instead more vignettes of information became available until the Taoiseach eventually went on national radio on a Sunday at lunchtime to announce a new tribunal to investigate the issue of planning.</P>
    <P>I welcome this tribunal and there is some logic to having a separate tribunal to examine these matters.  We had a week of argument concerning the terms of reference now before us.  As whip of the parliamentary Labour Party I was directly involved in those negotiations.  The Labour Party wanted terms of reference which would work effectively and not result in a situation where the full facts would not be elicited or where the people would not have their trust restored in our ability to do the job we are sent here to do, namely, ensure fair play for every citizen and transparency in local and national government. We genuinely did not want controversy, division or rows either inside or outside this House.  By presenting our own draft text we wished to address issues put forward by the Government, including that of fairness.  The Government did not want the former Minister, Deputy Burke, mentioned by name.  The leader of the Labour Party put forward a form of words that encompassed anybody who received contributions.  This was a reasonable and balanced amendment which was accepted by the Government and which ultimately formed the core of the resolution before us as set out in paragraph 4(a) of the present terms of reference.</P>
    <P>By and large the terms of reference are now acceptable to us because they will get at the facts. The first draft, bluntly put before us, was not designed to do this and would not have allowed us elicit all the facts.  As indicated by Deputy Dukes, it took much negotiation and umpteen drafts before coming up with the present comprehensive, albeit focused, terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to other planning issues.  While not wishing to refer to specific amendments tabled by other Deputies, there are amendments which will be discussed over the next hour which refer to other potentially contentious planning and zoning decisions.  All of us are receiving information about potentially corrupt decision <Col N="72" /> and suggestions of corruption.  Like the Minister and virtually every other Member of the House, I want all these matters fully ventilated and explored.  If people have suggestions to make they should present their information.  We should then look at that information, as I did as Minister, when suggestions of impropriety were made.  I said I would investigate any information or evidence presented to me to the furthest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The Order Paper makes suggestions about two issues other than the central thrust or focus of this tribunal.  I believe the Minister will not turn a deaf ear when I ask that for once and for all, we should have a full exposure and investigation of anything the people want explained.  I wish the Minister to confirm my understanding that paragraph 5 of the terms of reference will achieve this. The section states:</P>
    <P>In the event that the Tribunal in the course of its inquiries is made aware of any acts associated with the planning process committed on or after the 20th June 1985 which may in its opinion amount to corruption, or which involve attempts to influence by threats or deception or otherwise to compromise the disinterested performance of public duties, it shall report on such acts and should in particular make recommendations as to the effectiveness and improvement of existing legislation governing corruption in the light of its inquiries.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to confirm that this paragraph will allow those who have evidence or who believe there has been improper conduct in the planning process to submit that evidence to the tribunal to have it evaluated.  Deputies will be set at ease if this is done.  Without this there will be further allegations.</P>
    <P>Whether as a Minister or in Opposition, neither I nor any other Member is in a position to make a value judgment on the issues now arising.  It is almost as if one is involved in complicity if one does not demand an inquiry which may damage a person's reputation.  It is an invidious and unacceptable situation in which to be.  Whatever about the Taoiseach's proposal on a standing ethics committee, there is probably merit for a standing Ombudsman or tribunal to look at any suggestion of impropriety, past or present, and make a judgment.  I hope these terms of reference will encompass that and the new tribunal will be able to take submissions from whomsoever it decides on matters suggested for specific amendment. If I get an assurance from the Minister, it would be better than specifying what should be done because we might well exclude aspects of the same issue through which we need to sift.  I would like an open facility for somebody who has gathered or garnered evidence to submit it to presumably a learned judge who will determine whether an inquiry is warranted.  That is equally an essential part of the terms of reference of the tribunal before us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> The Minister made a number of points the tenor of which I agree with but the specifics are a cause of concern.  He spoke of the necessary courage of whistle-blowers and said much of what is happening is not in that category.  There is a danger in the view that because a colleague has seen fit to tender his resignation somehow those who sought investigation are culpable.  That is a very dangerous philosophy or line to adopt.  If there are issues in the public domain, let them be investigated and let reputations stand or fall on the basis of actions and proper conduct, investigation and decision making.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about corrosive cruelty dressed up as principled investigation.  If we had the investigation we suggested three weeks ago, there would not be this corrosive cruelty to which the Minister referred.  It is those who voted down that suggestion some weeks ago on whom the odium and blame must fall.  He said the tribunal of inquiry and nothing else should be the instrument to address this, and I agree.  The tribunal of inquiry must be given its head in the comprehensive way I suggested.  The terms of reference we finally have will achieve that.  However, these terms of reference and the great support we now see from the Minister and the Government for them were hard won over days of haggling and umpteen drafts before we reached the form of words which will meet the requirements of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made a rather interesting and fulsome defence of the principle of rezoning which I found a little difficult to take.  He wants to turn the view that anybody who is jaundiced about rezoning has put themselves on a moral high ground, that they should get real and live in the real world and that we need rezoning for development and progress and to provide houses for the homeless.  However, that is not what has caused controversy but rather maverick rezoning. Indeed, it caused so much controversy that my predecessor as Minister, the present Minister's party colleague, changed the procedures to make it more difficult for material contraventions and for section 4 motions relating to zoning to be passed.  It has been recognised that there has been more than an acceptable amount of rezoning in the past.</P>
    <P>I made it clear I would not support maverick rezonings.  My party has taken a strong and principled position on this matter for which I will not apologise.  Necessary land should be made available in a structured and planned way.  I welcome the Minister's comments on the planning process as a whole because it needs fundamental change. I was bringing that about and I hope the Minister will continue in that vein.</P>
    <P>Part of the issue which needs to be addressed is that haphazard way in which plans are developed.  For example, there is no statutory requirement to have a comprehensive plan.  To put it succinctly, every county has its own development plan but there is no requirement for each plan to dovetail logically together, which is <Col N="74" /> bizarre.  We do not have a national plan but counties with their own plans, some of which may run counter to the adjoining plan.  We have made progress in the Dublin area by requiring the new regional authorities to act as agents for bringing together a dovetailed planning process, but we have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>There is often a fundamental friction between adjoining local authorities in relation to development and proposals, whether on housing, waste disposal or water supply.  Contentious views may be adopted by adjoining local authorities instead of working in partnership.  We have long way to go to having a national plan, the subsets of which logically fit together and serve the rational development of our country.</P>
    <P>Some of the plans devised recently visit on an isolated village a projected population increase of perhaps 500 or 1,000 per cent over five years.  It is an amazing projection.  We must provide houses but in a structured logical way.  Over the years I have seen many proposals to rezone areas of land which have no services and to which it would be illogical to provide services in advance of providing services for other areas.  These matters must be brought together in a logical way and I support the Minister's notion for a public forum to do so. A public and inclusive forum is a good idea from which we need to make hard decisions.</P>
    <P>There are always grey areas in planning; there is no right decision.  We must make the best decision in the circumstances, although there will be aggrieved people.  If we have clearly defined rules and regulations, transparency in national and local administration, clear mechanisms for appeal, and open hearing systems where reports are in the public domain, we will quickly achieve full confidence in planning.  Unfortunately, that is not the situation at present.</P>
    <P>I refer to the role of the firm of solicitors, Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly, a point picked up on by Deputy Dukes.  One of the amendments the Labour Party proposed to the Government, sought to bring within the encompass of the inquiry those making allegations.  We suggested a form of words which would bring within the terms of reference allegations made in public, whether directly or indirectly, of corrupt or improper behaviour on the part of any person concerned with the formation, submission, consideration or approval of proposals relating to the planning and development of lands.  The Government has adopted that, somewhat, in paragraph B(iii) which requests the tribunal to &ldquo;seek discovery of all relevant documents, files and papers in the possession, power or procurement of said Mr. Michael Bailey, Mr. James Gogarty and Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly Solicitors,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I re-echo the hope expressed by the two previous speakers &mdash; the Minister and Deputy Dukes &mdash; that the firm of solicitors, who has said for a number of years that it wants a full tribunal of inquiry into planning matters, will co-operate fully and give whatever information it has to the tribunal.  If it has something to say, it should say <Col N="75" /> it now and not waste this opportunity.  It is important that those who have information about alleged corruption and interference come forward with that information at this time when we have a statutory mechanism to deal with it, this judicial inquiry which will be independent and powerful under the terms of reference which this House will approve tonight.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the central core of the terms of reference.  I am very satisfied that they will, by and large, get to the heart of the issues which have caused controversy &mdash; the suggestion by an individual that he could procure planning permission, the circumstances surrounding the contribution of money to former Minister, Deputy Burke, and any other issue which might arise out of those lands.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will confirm the view I expressed when we were negotiating the terms of reference, that is, that section A.5 of the terms of reference is a catch-all to allow for a full investigation of any other allegation of corruption in the planning process anywhere in the country subsequent to 1985, and that those terms of reference will enable the specific issues which other Deputies will raise, such as Glending or other lands in north Dublin, to be fully ventilated.  It is very important to put that matter clearly on the record before we decide how to vote tonight.</P>
    <P>I regret it has taken so long for the terms of reference to be finalised and that there was contention about their drafting.  It was a difficult process for the Opposition to try to deal with draft after draft with legal opinions coming from the Attorney General's Office on the matter.  More than once during that process we thought the Government was engaged in obfuscation rather than in building consensus.  I believe the terms of reference now before the House meet, by and large, the requirements of Deputies on this side of the House &mdash; subject, of course, to the clarification of the specific points I raised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to speak clearly on this issue which has concerned me since long before I entered this illustrious House.  During my time as a member of Cork Corporation I read and heard about the need for transparency and openness in public life. I agreed with the views expressed and I have heard members of all parties echo similar thoughts in this House since I have been privileged to join it.  Unfortunately, recent events appear to show clearly that transparency may be an aspiration but not a reality.  There have been <Col N="76" /> allegations and counter allegations about the abuse of power.  There is talk of corruption, tax evasion, cosy cartels and the abuse of the Planning Acts, particularly in relation to the rezoning of land.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, can you blame the public for casting a cynical eye on politics and politicians?  I cannot.  People are regularly given a poor impression of politicians when they read newspapers, listen to the radio or watch television and the utter sensationalism by some members of our media is a major contributory factor.  They are largely responsible for the exaggeration and distortion of events and they exercise a major influence on people's attitudes towards politicians. The <i>modus operandi</i> of some of the media is to allege that politicians are guilty until proven innocent.  This undermines the vast majority of journalists who report the news in a professional manner.</P>
    <P>If one were accused of a crime and brought before our courts, all matters relevant to the case would be <i>sub judice.</i>  If the accused is proven guilty following the hearing, it is then right and proper for the media to make statements regarding the proceedings.  The same rules of fair play should apply to politicians against whom allegations are made.  The media should await the outcome of the tribunal before making their pronouncements based on the evidence.  Some sections of the media should not pre-empt the tribunal by appointing themselves as judge and jury in the absence of all the facts.</P>
    <P>Today, it appears one can make allegations without having to prove them.  Reputations are lost and the integrity of individuals and bodies is impugned.  The public perception of politicians will not change if their images are continually tarnished by attacks which are often unfounded.  It is not enough for us to do the right thing: it must be clearly seen to be right and to be done for the right reason.</P>
    <P>The buck stops with the Members of this House.  Those who voted for me and the other Members of this House did so in the belief that we would represent them honestly and to the best of our abilities.  I still believe they were correct in that assumption.  The integrity and credibility of Members is basic to the exercise of democracy in this small nation.</P>
    <P>The rezoning of land is an extremely sensitive area.  It may make some people far wealthier because of the increase in the value of their land. However, it should not be forgotten that the Exchequer takes a healthy slice of the raised capital value of rezoned land through capital gains tax, VAT on building programmes and the PAYE and PRSI contributions of those involved in the construction industry, not to forget stamp duties, etc..  These all add up.</P>
    <P>We must create a climate of active investment. We must encourage those who have wealth to use it.  They might create greater wealth for themselves in so doing but that also benefits the State and those who live here.  We must remember that <Col N="77" /> investment is a risk from which one does not always gain.</P>
    <P>In the course of development plans, corporations and councils, as we have already heard tonight, have the power to rezone lands.  It is extremely important that they be allowed exercise that power transparently.  Our actions must be to the benefit of the public.  We must not seek to enrich anybody by the rezoning of their lands to their personal profit.</P>
    <P>I regard the suggestion that decisions relating to rezoning should be submitted for ministerial approval as negative.  That would further reduce the already limited powers of the elected members of local authorities.  They should be free to deal with land within their own functional areas to the benefit of the public they represent.</P>
    <P>Problems can arise when section 4 is invoked in regard to zoning applications before local authorities. There is a consultative process during the preparation of a development plan which goes on public display.  There is further consultation between citizens, elected public representatives, planning officials and the executive of the local authorities.  I believe there should be such a consultative process after the proposal of a section 4. The views of planners, developers and citizens must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>A further safeguard in this process would be the submission of such rezoning to an independent consultative body on the lines of An Bord Pleanála.  Its recommendations would be made public and referred to the local authority which could then make a decision to ratify or reject the disputed rezoning and justify its stand.  The public might agree or disagree with the decision but it would be a position to assess the merits and motives behind rezoning decisions and it could not be said that matters were being dealt with in an underhand manner.</P>
    <P>My priority is to re-establish the confidence of the people in those whom they have elected.  We must react to the public demand that those in public office set an example of honesty and integrity which are prerequisites to holding office.  If there is corruption in high places we must expose it.  If we do so we can ensure that no further sensational stories will appear in the media about corruption in politics.  We are the servants of the State and the people.  Those who voted for us believed in us and we must confirm and copperfasten their faith in us.</P>
    <P>I support the establishment of the tribunal and the terms of reference proposed.  I abhor the necessity for such an inquiry and I urge Members to ensure that the need for another does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague on his excellent maiden speech which was short and to the point.  He echoed a sentiment that exists on all sides &mdash; the urgent need to re-establish confidence in public office and office holders.  No party has a monopoly on that feeling; it is a commonly shared objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> I will focus on the sale and rezoning of lands at Glending, County Wicklow.  I have not been involved in this issue in recent times.  I have shown a vigorous interest in it since the issue first appeared before Wicklow County Council.  Proper procedures were not followed in the sale of those lands, a view I expressed last year and which is now shared by Members whose parties supported the sale and rezoning.  Some of the Members opposite were in Government last year when I asked them to examine the issue and, although they could have taken action, they did not do so.  However, this is not a time for recrimination. From this tawdry mess we should attempt to put our house in order.  There is no point blaming the media for outlining wrongdoing.  There have been many reasons over the past 20 years to raise questions with regard to land rezoning.</P>
    <P>When public assets are disposed of it should be done in a way which is transparent and above question.  The sale of the lands at Glending was not handled in such a manner.  A year ago I wrote to a number of Ministers on this matter and some of them were forthcoming and helpful, in particular, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Michael Higgins. Deputy Higgins undertook to examine the files in the Office of Public Works on the matter and he gave me certain assurances that wrongdoing was not an issue there.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Committee of Public Accounts, when appointed, should request the Comptroller and Auditor General to do a thorough examination of the files relating to the sale of the lands.  Even if no wrongdoing occurred it is the widely held view that the sale was not handled in an appropriate way.  I am surprised the Comptroller and Auditor General has not examined the issue already given that it has been a matter of public debate for two years.  I have argued consistently that the Committee of Public Accounts should pursue this matter.  As soon as that committee is appointed I intend writing to it to request an examination of the files related to the sale.  If wrongdoing is discovered it is in our interest that it would be exposed and, if not, the reputations of those involved will be vindicated.</P>
    <P>I am one of seven councillors who voted against the rezoning of the Glending lands. Democratic Left was the only political party which was unanimous on the issue because it only had one member on the council, and it voted for the rezoning.  Deputy McManus has had a great deal to say of late about the rezoning.  I am not a cynic and I believe in Pauline conversions.  She was a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment last year and she had the right to examine the relevant files in the Department. Deputy Howlin and Deputy Michael Higgins received my correspondence and responded with courtesy and in detail.</P>
    <P>There are questions about the rezoning of the Glending lands which must be answered, mainly by Wicklow County Council.  For example, in the original draft development plan for Blessington, published and circulated in 1993, there was a <Col N="79" /> commitment to retain Glending as an amenity area.  There is a great deal of hypocrisy surrounding this issue.  I was not supported in the council chamber at the time by parties which now support a detailed examination of the issue.  However, I welcome their latter day conversions.  The Fine Gael Party, with the exception of one individual, supported the rezoning.  My party colleagues, despite my requests, also supported it.  With one exception the Labour Party voted against the rezoning.  Councillors Liam Kavanagh, Tom Cullen and I have consistently questioned this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were struggling to find a means of exposing what was happening, Deputy McManus, who was a member of the county council and went on to become a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, sat on her hands and did not assist Councillor Cullen when he took that personal risk.  When the residents of Blessington asked the Deputy to intervene on their behalf she refused to do so.  It is smirking hypocrisy of a high order to hear the Deputy question my good faith on the issue.  I have nothing to be ashamed of because, from the outset, I maintained that the issue deserved examination.  Deputy  McManus  indicated recently that her colleague, Councillor Kirwan, was not aware of the details of the rezoning.  The Blessington Heritage Trust, Councillor Cullen and I tried to make the council aware.  I was castigated for speaking at length on the matter at the council meeting.  The cynical aspect of the rezoning that took place then is that those councillors who went along with the rezoning of Glending not only rezoned Glending but lands belonging to their cronies.  One area has been the subject of a massive housing development, enriching one individual at the cost of the people of Blessington. No wonder people are sick of politics and politicians; to them they spell hypocrisy.  I welcome this tribunal as I would welcome anything that would try to clear the name of politics.  I will ask the Committee of Public Accounts to examine this issue and hope to have the support of other Members on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Flynn on his maiden speech.  This debate is to set up a new tribunal of inquiry and could have been avoided if, four weeks ago, the Government had accepted the amendment proposed by Democratic Left on the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  When that tribunal was considered, Democratic Left made the modest proposal that the £30,000 payment to former Deputy Burke should be subjected to a preliminary private screening process to establish whether it warranted investigation by the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> If that proposal had been agreed, the £30,000 payment and the Bailey-Gogarty letter which emerged subsequently would now be under the scrutiny of Judge Moriarty and we would not be setting up a new tribunal.  Former Deputy Burke might have been spared the necessity of retiring from politics and politics would have been spared the corrosive effect of a month's talk about political corruption.</P>
    <P>That proposal was defeated because the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste led their parties into the lobbies against it, where they were tamely followed by Deputies Blaney, Healy-Rae and Fox, who have suppressed whatever pretensions they may have had to be independent.  They voted for a position which is discredited, indefensible and being stood on its head this evening.</P>
    <P>More than anyone else, the Taoiseach is responsible for allowing the Burke affair to foment and become the political crisis it is.  Repeating the mantra, &ldquo;a man is innocent until he is proven guilty&rdquo;, the Taoiseach has sought to brazen out the growing public unease over this affair.  His choice of the terms and language of the criminal courts to defend one of his most senior Ministers was extraordinary, and he was the first to do so.</P>
    <P>The political arena is not the place to judge anyone's guilt or innocence, as those words are not the currency of politics.  Credibility and confidence are the qualities by which public representatives and democratic politics maintain a relationship of trust with the citizens who elect us.  The problem at the core of former Deputy Burke's dilemma has been that the public found it quite incredible that somebody the Minister did not know arrived on his doorstep with £30,000 in cash for his personal election expenses and that no favours were expected or returned.  The public suspicion was fuelled when it emerged that the two gentlemen in the Minister's parlour had, a few days previously, been in correspondence with each other about a land deal which included the procurement of planning permission and the procurement of a majority vote on Dublin County Council.  &ldquo;Procurement&rdquo; is an unusual term to use about a planning permission or about the exercise of the democratic function of an elected council.</P>
    <P>Instead of addressing the problem upfront, the Taoiseach, by his mishandling of the affair, has brought about a set of circumstances whereby the outcome for his Government is worse than it was four weeks ago.  He has lost one of his most senior Ministers and unassessable damage has been done to public confidence in politics.  The Taoiseach began by circling the wagons in refusing to allow Judge Moriarty to examine the matter in private.  Nobody had called for a separate new tribunal, yet the Taoiseach announced on the radio on the Sunday of the All-Ireland Final that a new tribunal was to be established.  He cast further doubt on the integrity of politics by claiming others had received contributions of the same order as former Deputy Burke.  Whether the Taoiseach has evidence for this claim will be considered <Col N="81" /> by the new tribunal and I hope he will give evidence to that tribunal in this regard. Whether this claim was intended to frighten the Opposition or was an admission that the Taoiseach considers personal political contributions of £30,000 as normal has yet to be seen.</P>
    <P>The House is now being asked to approve the terms of reference of a new tribunal which will examine the Burke issue, the Bailey-Gogarty letter and other matters relating to possible corruption of the planning process.  I welcome the establishment of the tribunal and in particular paragraphs 4 and 5 of the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 provides for the examination of the political and personal contributions made by Mr. Bailey and Mr. Gogarty and their associated companies since July 20 1985, whether those contributions were made to Members of the Oireachtas, councillors or council officials.  It would test the claims of the Taoiseach that others received contributions.  It will provide, for the first time, a public snapshot of the financial relationships between a major property developer and politics and planning.  It is in the public interest to know if any such payments were made, to whom they were made and what conclusions may be drawn from that.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 provides for a wider examination of possible corruption of the planning process. My party has called for this before and I have been calling for it since before I entered this House over eight years ago.  On a number of occasions I have spoken here of my unease about planning, particularly in County Dublin where I am most familiar with the planning process.</P>
    <P>The inquiry we are now establishing should have been set up in the late 1980s or early 1990s at the latest, not least because the new tribunal will inevitably find it more difficult to investigate complicated planning issues of some years ago.  I was a member of Dublin County Council from June 1985 until 1993, when that council was wound up.  Over that period, I saw frequent abuse of the planning process.  I have no evidence of corruption, but I look forward to the investigations which will be conducted by the tribunal and to the report that the tribunal will present in order to establish whether corruption lay at the base of the abuse of planning which occurred in that period.</P>
    <P>The worst abuse occurred between 1985 and 1991 when meetings of Dublin County Council were virtually dominated by proposals to materially contravene the County Development Plan and to grant planning permissions by way of section 4 motions.  I summarised this abuse in a document which I published in March 1991 entitled: &ldquo;The Rezoning Majority: A Study of Abuse of Planning in Dublin&rdquo;.  In this document I explained that the section 4 provisions of the City and County Management Act, 1955 &mdash; the power of elected members of the county council to allow developments which would materially contravene the County Development Plan &mdash;<Col N="82" /> were very democratic provisions intended to serve the public interest.</P>
    <P>I further explained that section 4 motions, material contraventions or land rezonings are not automatically bad in themselves.  They are very necessary provisions to allow for the ordered growth and development of an area.  Many of the material contraventions and land rezonings passed by Dublin County Council were well based.  The problem, however, was the frequency of abuse and pattern of the use of these provisions. In the document I published, I summarised that between the local elections of 1985 and early 1991, Dublin County Council passed 41 section 4 motions directing the granting of planning permissions in cases where they might otherwise have been refused.  In the same period, the council decided to grant planning permissions to 131 developments which would materially contravene the council's own development plan.  Of those 131 material contraventions, 108 were proposed by Fianna Fáil councillors and 87 were seconded by Fianna Fáil councillors.  The county manager and the professional planners employed by the council recommended that the motion should not be passed on 91 of the 131 material contraventions which were passed.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the rezoning which resulted from the material contravention motions resulted in housing development.  There has been some comment recently that this was necessary as house prices were rising and there was a shortage of housing land.  House prices were not rising between 1985 and 1991.  Anybody who knows anything about the property market will know that, over that period, the housing market was in quite a depressed state and there was no shortage of housing land in County Dublin.  Of the land which was zoned for housing, 757 hectares already had planning permission but were not developed, a further 1,450 hectares were serviced but had no planning permission and 313 hectares were neither serviced nor had planning permission.  This hardly indicates that there was a shortage of building land.</P>
    <P>I estimated that the effect of the rezonings was to add £150 million to the value of the rezoned land.  There was clearly big money at stake. Decisions made by the elected members of the council had the potential to add enormous values to land.  Members of the council were intensively lobbied by developers and landowners seeking the rezoning of their land.  Councillors were also lobbied by local community and environmental organisations which opposed many of the rezonings. Such lobbying is perfectly proper; it would not be proper if it went beyond lobbying.  That, of course, is what the tribunal must find out.</P>
    <P>Against that background, the use of the term &lsquo;procurement&rsquo; of a majority vote at two council meetings in the Bailey letter is interesting to say the least.  I have served more than 12 years as a public representative and I have never before heard the use of the term &lsquo;procurement&rsquo; in the <Col N="83" /> context of a planning application.  Its use is especially curious in a section of the letter which seeks a reduction in the price of the land in return for, among other things, the procurement of planning permission and by-law approval, the steps to which are described by Mr. Bailey as &lsquo;expensive&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 of the terms of reference gives the tribunal a very wide remit.  It is an important function but it will cause the tribunal some difficulty. First, the tribunal will have to sift through the frivolous cases which will inevitably be put to it.  It is conceivable that any crank with a grudge against an elected or appointed public official may use this avenue to vent an allegation. Second, where the tribunal considers that investigation is warranted it will be handicapped by the lapse of time in examining past cases.  The tribunal will, I believe, have difficulty in examining abuses of planning which occurred a decade or more ago.  I hope this will not unduly handicap the tribunal and that it will be able, at least, to get to the bottom of any corruption which may have occurred.</P>
    <P>Most of my remarks have referred to Dublin as that is where my experience lies.  However, it is important that the investigation of planning abuse should not be confined to Dublin.  Over the years, there have been many disturbing stories about the abuse of section 4 provisions, in particular, outside of Dublin and, more recently, there has been concern regarding rezoning in Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche has used this debate to rehearse his typically nasty approach to local politics and his constituency colleagues but my party supports the inclusion of Glending in the terms of reference of this tribunal.  I must express some surprise that, given the vehemence of Deputy Roche's comments on that subject this evening, he managed not to vote for its inclusion in the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal when he had an opportunity to do so in this House four weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers who said it is important that the information which Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly possess should be put before the tribunal.  The clients of that firm of solicitors should instruct it to make that information available to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable that since the general election, politics and debate in this House have been dominated virtually exclusively by suggestions of corruption, political contributions, planning inquiries and so on.  Since the general election we have already debated one inquiry and set up two others.  It is time this House had an opportunity to proceed to consider the issues which most of the people who voted for us sent us here to address.  Those issues relate to the economy, problems in relation to social conditions and immediate day to day concerns.  The sooner we are enabled to do that, the sooner the wish widely expressed in this House &mdash; that the cloud of suspicion over politics be lifted &mdash; will be granted.</P>

      <P>I offer my sympathy to former Deputy Ray Burke and his family on the death of Mr. Seán Burke and on the illness which has beset the family recently.  It is a scandal that the witch-hunt which has occurred resulted in former Deputy Burke coming to a decision to resign from the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs and from Dáil Éireann at this emotional time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore said we could have avoided this tribunal and former Deputy Burke's resultant resignation if this Government had accepted the amendments in relation to the Moriarty tribunal. This situation could have been avoided if Members had trust in their own colleagues.  There was no need for former Deputy Burke to be included in the Moriarty tribunal; that tribunal refers to two persons which the McCracken tribunal found were associated with gross irregularities and wrongdoing.  Former Deputy Burke is guilty of nothing.  In 1989 he received £30,000 as a political contribution without favours being sought or given.  A full explanation was given to the House which, if there was trust among its Members, would have been accepted.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the former Deputy as a politician.  I joined Dublin County Council in 1985 with Deputy Gilmore at the same time as former Deputy Burke was re-elected to it.  Former Deputy Burke was chairman of Dublin County Council in 1985 and 1986 and I found him to be solid, steadfast and very serious.  He went out and fought for what was right for the people he represented and I believe, as I am sure Deputy Owen does, that the parks in North Dublin &mdash; Ardgillan, Newbridge Demesne and Malahide Castle &mdash; are a tribute to him.</P>
      <P>Former Deputy Burke knows his way around local authority bureaucracy.  In his position as Minister for Justice, he showed that he was up to whatever could be meted out by the civil servants in that Department.  During his tenure in Dublin County Council former Deputy Burke was able to get funds from reserves for the purposes of carrying out improvements in North Dublin.  I was somewhat envious of that as I would like to have seen such improvements come about in west and south Dublin.  However, former Deputy Burke was chairman of the council and, as a man of great ability, looked after his constituents very well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore said there was no evidence of corruption in county councils and I concur with that.  In the 12 years I have been a member of a county council, I did not know of any councillor who was offered or received an inducement for planning, apart from the £100 which was sent to Deputy Sargent and which was publicly shown at a council meeting.  Deputy Gilmore also stated that many planning applications and rezonings were well based and I agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a new Member I am appalled by the influence of the media in the matters that relate to this House.  It appears the profits generated by the sale of newspapers &mdash; and that profit motive has come to the fore in recent years &mdash; and this <Col N="85" /> media influence pervades all happenings in the House.  A senior member of an Opposition party for whom I have great respect told me that on the day drug trafficking legislation was being debated, and important developments at Stormont were taking place, the only question reporters wanted to ask him on leaving Leinster House was: where was the blood of Ray Burke? That is an appalling vista.</P>
    <P>I read in the papers recently that I voted for the rezoning of one of the items in the tribunal's terms of reference.  It concerned rezoning nine acres of land in Portmarnock which was proposed by two Oireachtas Members, Deputy Owen, the Deputy Leader of Fine Gael, and G.V. Wright, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, and another councillor from that area.  Those elected members were councillors from the area in which the land in question was located.  They are people for whom I have great respect and I know they represent their constituents well.  If a proposal is made by representatives of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil in respect of an area about which I know little, I accept the arguments put forward by my colleagues.  In the same way, if an item comes up concerning an area I represent, and if I believe rezoning or planning permission is necessary in that area, I expect colleagues in my party to support me.</P>
    <P>Item No. 4 refers to the identity of all recipients of payments made to political parties, Members of either House of the Oireachtas, members or officials of a Dublin local authority or other public official.  I understand that in April of this year a number of friends of mine organised a lunch for which they requested subscriptions of £125.  A cheque for £125 was made out to those persons by a person whom I understand is a co-director in a company with Mr. Bailey.  Apparently this is not included in the items to be investigated by the tribunal.  I do not know the reason for that or whether it is relevant but I would not like to appear to be hiding behind this item simply because it is not covered under the terms &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; or &ldquo;final beneficiaries of any payments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a need for housing.  Most of the people who attend my clinic or who phone me in my office are looking for housing.  There are flat complexes in my constituency including Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House and Bridgefoot Street flats. There are 50 vacant flats in Fatima Mansions because people do not want to live there.  They want to live in good quality housing in a nice environment where they can raise their families with pride and dignity.  To enable them do that we must provide housing but there is a shortage of land for housing.  In south County Dublin, 2,800 houses were built last year.  Currently there are lands residentially zoned for 10,000 houses, that is three and a half years' supply.  The development plan is currently being discussed and, as the Minister said recently, there was a ten year gap between development plans in Dublin County Council but I hope there will not be a ten year gap in the South Dublin County Council <Col N="86" /> area.  There is a definite need for more lands to be rezoned in south County Dublin.  It is only by rezoning lands for residential use that the people we represent can be housed.  I do not have any qualms about exercising my responsibility in rezoning areas of lands that are needed for residential development.</P>
    <P>A meeting of South Dublin County Council was held yesterday at which the idea of sustainable development was discussed.  For two and a half hours the dedicated councillors of South Dublin County Council discussed this concept so that when we are making decisions on rezoning lands, we will take into account matters such as energy needs, maintenance of green spaces, etc. which are necessary to ensure that whatever development takes place will not endanger resources for future generations.  County councillors take their responsibilities seriously, particularly in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the unseemly squabble currently being engaged in, mainly for political purposes, is simply to allow the media have its bite. All of the councillors I know, and I know many of them not only in south Dublin but also in Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath, are hard-working people who are dedicated to local service and the constituents they represent.  They deal with the minutiae of people's daily lives.  If the House will pardon the use of the word, they are the bridge between people and bureaucracy.  The amount of time the majority of local authority members spend on council matters is enormous.  They do that for the benefit of their constituents, not for their own benefit.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore who said we are not here to discuss political footballs or have unseemly rows.  We are here to care for the social and economic needs of the people.  Deputies today received a booklet from CORI on basic income.  In a year when we have in excess of £500 million to give away, the use of the phrase &ldquo;payback time&rdquo; is regrettable because we have to discuss where that money goes.  The combination of extensive poverty and unemployment has contributed to the growing exclusion experienced by large numbers of people.  CORI states that an alternative model for organising the distribution of resources is needed.  This alternative system, a basic income, should be discussed and brought into the public domain.</P>

      <P>Earlier today when the Taoiseach referred to the resignation of Mr. Burke the Ceann Comhairle ruled that party leaders only could make a short intervention.  I obeyed the ruling and did not intervene in the debate.  I regret that the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Davern, felt it necessary to try to score political points at this difficult time for the Taoiseach.

      <Col N="87" /> The resignation of Mr. Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs was a matter for him and the Taoiseach, who appoints his Ministers.  However, he would not have resigned his Dáil seat if the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste had handled this matter in a better and more efficient way.  Following Mr. Burke's statement in the House some weeks ago, the media excoriated Opposition Members for not going in for the kill and claiming all sorts of wrongdoing by Mr. Burke.  We were not aware of any wrongdoing and did not allege any but we tried to get answers to questions, which is what the Opposition is supposed to do.  If the Taoiseach had taken the wishes of all Opposition parties on board and agreed to have the £30,000 donation further investigated by the Moriarty tribunal a Member would not have been put under pressure to resign from office and this House.</P>
    <P>This is a sad day for the constituents of Dublin North who elected Ray Burke to the Dáil in every election since 1973.  He served his constituents to the best of his ability.  I am sure some people did not like all the decisions he took.  I know for certain that some of my constituents in Dublin North did not like some of the decisions I took. However, all Members do the best they can.  I lay the blame for what happened today on the Taoiseach's shoulders.  He should have handled this matter in a more efficient and speedier way and covered it in the tribunal so that Mr. Burke could get on with his job and face the tribunal as he said he would.  Even as more information emerged the Taoiseach ignored the need to have the matter investigated.  When the letter exchanged between two people was made public the Taoiseach should have taken hold of the issue and included it in the tribunal where it would be examined.  It is regrettable that he did not do this and he must take the blame for Mr. Burke's resignation.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Justice for two and a half years during a very difficult time.  It is not proper for a Minister for Justice to trawl through files and dish the dirt on previous Ministers for Justice. As Minister for Justice I was subject to the Official Secrets Act and I took my job extremely seriously.  I set about making changes in this sensitive Department and introducing long overdue legislation.  I want to make it clear that I did not provide <i>The Irish Times</i> with the report by Mr. Dermot Cole into the Mahfouz passports issue: it was requested by my predecessor, Máire Geogh-egan-Quinn. I resisted making any public comment on suggestions about what was in it but, as it has now been published, I wish to comment on it.  I have no idea how a journalist got a report which was on a file in the Department of Justice. I wish to clarify one or two inaccurate points made in the media.  This was an interim, not a final, report.  Like my predecessor, I was concerned about some of the issues raised in the report and the loose way in which some of the mechanisms and processes for gaining naturalisation and passports had been handled mainly by <Col N="88" /> a senior official in the Department.  When I examined the report I realised that only £3 million of the £20 million promised investment had been made.  I asked my officials to continue looking for the remainder of the money and to come back to me when all of it had been identified or when they reached the stage where they could not identify if all of it had been invested.  As reports in the newspapers now show, and as has been confirmed by the Department of Justice, £17 million of the £20 million has been identified.</P>
    <P>I was concerned to ascertain from the interim report if there was any evidence of corruption.  I want to make it clear that there was no evidence in the report of corruption or wrongdoing by anyone involved.  There were certainly breaches of the technical requirements which, according to the report, were carried out in the main by officials in the Department of Justice.  I was concerned about the undue haste in issuing the passports. It is important to note that the Mahfouz family had been in dialogue with people for three or four months prior to receiving the passports. However, the passports were issued very quickly at the end of the day and there were some unusual elements in the handing over of them. When I was Minister for Justice I never physically handed over passports to anyone and it was unusual to say the least for Mr. Haughey to hand over the passports to the Mahfouz family at a lunch at which no officials were present.</P>
    <P>The role of the Minister for Justice in revoking naturalisation is very carefully defined, it is a legal process.  Until such time as I was satisfied on the whereabouts of the £20 million there was no need for me to proceed against the Mahfouz family and revoke their passports.  There may well have been a need to revoke them after the completion of the inquiry but there was certainly no case for me to do so at that stage when I would have run the risk of a High Court action which the Department would have lost.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this issue was raised in the context of what we now know about the lifestyle of Mr. Haughey.  We did not know what the McCracken tribunal identified, that Mr. Haughey had a particular way of financing his lifestyle.  We know where £1.3 million of Mr. Haughey's money came from and if the inquiry into where other moneys came from to allow him live his lavish lifestyle leads to the Mahfouz passports issue then so be it.  I saw nothing on the file to allege any such corrupt act on the part of the people involved.  The efforts of the Government parties to put the blame and full responsibility on Opposition parties for Mr. Burke's resignation today is regrettable and disingenuous.  It is the Opposition's job to raise issues and questions about matters of public interest and to try to get answers.  All Opposition parties rightly queried the provision of a £30,000 donation to one individual and asked that at least it be examined and put to rest if there was no wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>As other speakers said, politics has taken a terrible beating in the past few years, particularly in <Col N="89" /> the past few weeks.  All of us in politics feel that people's perception of us all is that we must be up to something.  If somebody else makes money out of decisions we make, that is not a matter of responsibility for councillors or TDs.  It is for the legislators to decide if they want to do away with any element of profit in any transaction undertaken by anyone in this State.  The allegations made are unfair because councillors do their job.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 states it is the responsibility of county councils to prepare a development plan with respect to county boroughs, boroughs, urban districts and scheduled towns for the use solely or primarily, as may be indicated in the development plan, of particular areas for particular purposes, whether residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural or otherwise.  I was a member of Dublin County Council for 15 years and in latter years of Fingal County Council and was involved in the preparation of two development plans.  That was a difficult time.  I have a set of minutes of the council meetings for one year during the final period of the 1993 development plan. All living members of the council from 1985 to 1997 will be answerable to the new tribunal for the decisions they made.  I have no problem in being answerable to the tribunal.  I welcome it because I hope it will clear the air as to how councillors must prepare a development plan in a situation where they will always be open to allegations that by their decisions they have made money for other people.  There is no other way of introducing a development plan other than to change zonings.  Councillors of all parties on the council of which I was a member at some time voted in their best judgment for some form of zoning, whether for industry, general housing or single housing.  I do not know how it can be claimed that some people are always under a shadow because they do that job.  There have been Garda inquiries.  There was one in 1991, 1992 or 1993 and no wrongdoing was found.  I hope the tribunal will put to rest the allegations and the concerns raised.</P>
    <P>Councillors, some of whom spoke in the Chamber, were not happy with some decisions.  I was not happy with all the decisions made and in hindsight I might not be happy with some I made and if I had my time again I might change them. I made them on the basis of the best information I had without inducement from anybody.  We went into those meetings, listened to the arguments and did our best to decide if rezonings were good or bad and voted accordingly.  It is important I say that because I am one of the few former Fine Gael councillors who has a chance to speak here.</P>
    <P>The demands placed on local councillors will continue.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's remarks that he wants to make the planning process more transparent.  The planning process as I operated it, and as I know it operated in Dublin County Council, allowed for two public displays of the development plan, one when the first <Col N="90" /> plan was put on display and another when it was reviewed and more changes were made.  The public made thousands of submissions in respect of all elements of that plan.  I would be interested to hear how the Minister intends to make the process more transparent.  The councils are commencing the process of new development plans and I wish them luck.  There will be another series of debates as to whether they should or should not allow for the fact that the population of Dublin is now 1,058,264 compared to 7l8,000 in 1961. Someone must face the reality of the growing population of Dublin.  I do not know how that can be faced other than by providing for it in a development plan.</P>

      <P>I welcome the tribunal because I have been a member of Dublin County Council since 1985 and in latter years of Fingal County Council.  I and many councillors reject the smear that attaches to being a Dublin county councillor.  I express my sympathy to Ray Burke and his family on his resignation.  I served with him when he was chairman of Dublin County Council.  Although it was tempestuous at times and he was tough, he was also fair.  He would not have subjected anyone to the type of vilification and smear he had to put up with in the past few weeks and months.  One lesson I learned early as a Member of this House is that it seems there is very little humanity in this House.  That was something of which I was not aware in the other House or as a member of Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that rezoning has a bad name, which it has, but it is a statutory obligation of county councillors and county councils to review the development plan every five years. However, Dublin County Council only completed two reviews of the plan from 1972 to 1993, two reviews in 21 years.  The chairman of the new tribunal should start his investigation at that point on the hiatus that created in County Dublin and the reason for changes in the development plan that might have seemed spectacular.</P>
      <P>No changes were made to the 1993 development plan when I was involved in the 1991 to 1993 review.  We did not make any changes to the decisions of the l983 plan.  If those decisions were so controversial and wrong, why were they not overturned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is more to the 1983 development plan than simple rezoning.  I say that because I live in the Blanchardstown area.  The development plan objectives or the spatial settlement strategies, as they were referred to in the documents Deputies Owen and I got during our period on the council when the plan was reviewed, were simple and straightforward.  There were three new towns, Lucan-Clondalkin, Tallaght and Blanchardstown, which were to accommodate 100,000 people each. <Col N="91" /> That was the settlement strategy for the county from the early 1980s.  Any decision which interfered with that settlement strategy was objected to by the manager.  Any proposals which the manager felt would be in competition with those three new towns were opposed, quite furiously at times, by the then manager.</P>
    <P>It was said by Deputy Rabbitte, and I also said it at a council meeting, that pipes in the ground dictated where people could and should live.  I ask the House and the new tribunal if that is good planning.  I do not believe it is.  As Deputy Owen said, most members of Dublin County Council rejected the suggestion that because a sewerage pipe could accommodate the waste products of 100,000 people in one of the three new towns in County Dublin that was the basis on which people would select where to live.  Strangely, the only breach of this strategy was in the 1991-93 plan when the manager introduced the only rezoning proposal I can remember.  There may have been others but this plan sticks in my mind. This was a rezoning proposal for, approximately, 500 acres in Carrickmines Valley.  It was a managerial proposal and came out of the blue but if it is investigated we might discover if it was connected to the fact that there was a pipe in the vicinity which had been pumping out sea water for a number of years to make sure that it could be used when the time came.</P>
    <P>In their wisdom the members of Dublin County Council rejected this proposal and yet no reference was made to the fact that it was a managerial proposal.  North County Dublin, which will be the subject of the initial inquiry, was not to grow under any circumstances.  That decision was made despite the fact that the ERDO report recommended that the north fringe would accommodate approximately 100,000 people as had been decided for the other three satellite towns.  North County Dublin could not and would not be allowed to grow and the tribunal will discover that fact in terms of the manager's strategy.</P>
    <P>A recent newspaper article referred to 105 section 4 motions passed by Dublin County Council in an eight year period.  A colleague has informed me that 27 of those motions concerned individual houses in north County Dublin for the sons and daughters of people already living there. As a result of the development plan restrictions imposed by the manager those people could not live in their home villages and towns.  The strategy was that someone living in Rush, Lusk, Skerries, Balbriggan or wherever should move to Blanchardstown, Lucan, Clondalkin or Tallaght. That was the policy of the management of Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>Another point which is overlooked is that in my area of Blanchardstown I dezoned a considerable amount of land owned by Dublin Corporation which was zoned for housing.  We rezoned this land for industrial use.  Deputy Higgins supported that although many of those who are most vociferous would say they never supported a <Col N="92" /> rezoning motion.  I have supported such motions and I hope I can stand over all of those decisions. We decided that land zoned for housing in Blanchardstown should be rezoned for industrial use. That decision has resulted in the arrival of IBM and the promise of 3,000 jobs.  Had we not decided to overturn managerial decisions these jobs would not exist.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation was the largest owner of zoned land in County Dublin.  I would pose a question to the tribunal chairman.  Could there be a connection between the fact that until 1994 the manager of Dublin Corporation was also the manager of Dublin County Council even though he never attended a meeting?  There were weekly summits in City Hall at which our managers were given their instructions.  Could that manager have exerted any influence on the reports and rezoning proposals which he brought to us?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the tribunal will also look at designation.  I wish to defend a decision made by the previous Minister, Deputy Quinn, in relation to Cherry Orchard.  This decision has been smeared across the newspapers.  This is a most deprived and disadvantaged area and the kind of innuendo attached to that designation is to be regretted.  It is time for courage.  I reject any suggestion of immunity from prosecution for those who bribed people or received bribes.  It is time for those who made a lot of the running on this issue to put up or shut up.</P>

      <P>The genesis of this issue is the result of the election.  The Opposition has never accepted that result.  Before the election it believed its own propaganda and it seems determined to undermine the Government by foul means or fair.  It is hard to listen to some of the self-righteous nonsense coming from some people who, if one is to believe rumours, also have questions to answer.</P>
      <P>It is sad that we are dealing with this motion on the day that former Deputy Burke has resigned.  The witch-hunt carried out against him is a disgrace.  It is a sad day for politics when people go about trying to undermine and hound a good man out of office for weeks on end.  During the past few days when Deputy Burke suffered a family bereavement the behaviour of some people in politics and the media has been very shabby.  Only they can look in the mirror and say whether they are proud of their behaviour. There was a time when one was innocent until proven guilty, one received the benefit of the doubt.  That time seems to be gone.  The ruthless, continuous, headlong pursuit of a head seems to be the philosophy of politics and the media.  We are all the sadder for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that the all-party talks have commenced in the North today.  Former Deputy Burke can take credit for the part he played over the past few months in reaching this stage.  I wonder if there is some jealousy in some quarters about the recent success of the talks?  Perhaps we will have to wait for history to supply the answers <Col N="93" /> as to who orchestrated this recent campaign to undermine the former Minister and why.  I do not wish to get involved in conspiracy theories but there might be interesting questions behind this issue.</P>
    <P>It is very sad to see the way in which public opinion has been manipulated and people's characters undermined.  There has been an ongoing drip of information and one wonders whether that was freely given or whether it was paid for.  I am sick and tired of tribunals but sooner or later we will have a tribunal on the media and how it receives and presents its information. I wonder if when people pay 80p or £1 they consider whether they are reading fact or opinion, from where the spin comes, whether that spin is an opinion or genuine or whether someone has received inducements to frame it in that manner?</P>
    <P>I am a member of the city council.  There are not many rezonings in the city although we have material contraventions.  Much of what is occurring is giving rezoning a bad name.  I must defend the system of local government.  There is nothing wrong with a council or councillor objecting to or voting against the recommendations of officials. Those in local government know that there is a balance between the powers of officials and councils. This is a battle and people must stand up for what they believe in.  It is scandalous to suggest that there is something wrong with not taking the advice of officials.  Many people have suggested this in recent days.  Too often officials do not take the advice of elected members yet no one ever suggests that this is done for an ulterior motive. They do so because they believe it is right.  I know that some rezonings might have been difficult to understand but the problem is partly a result of the development plan.  The process is so long-winded that no sooner has one review been completed than another is started.  I am convinced the tribunal will vindicate the former Minister, Deputy Burke.  I hope at the end of the day all of us in politics will portray a proper image and stop telling tales on one another, which does much damage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The proposed tribunal relates particularly to planning matters.  As a member of Dublin County Council in 1991 and 1992, I found myself at the centre of a maelstrom of rezonings, led not primarily by considerations of good planning but in response to demands of landowners, developers and, in some cases, speculators.  I was astounded the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, spent a considerable time attacking those who question some rezonings that deserve to be questioned.  He attacked people who ask legitimate questions rather than directing his attention to answering the questions raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we are setting up another tribunal arising from information accidentally brought to public attention, information involving a donation of £30,000 and a letter which refers to the procurement <Col N="94" /> of planning permission.  A Fianna Fáil Member said that if there is corruption in high places we must expose it.  Ordinary people believe there has been massive corruption involving obscene profits from land speculation, particularly in the Dublin area and perhaps in other areas.</P>
    <P>It is an undeniable facet of the ugly face of capitalism that land rezoned from agricultural to residential or industrial use rockets in price by up to 30 times the original price.  The result is that young people purchasing homes pay for speculation and profiteering.  They spend 20 to 30 years of their lives repaying mortgages, a good part of which pays for the site on which their home is built, a site from which a speculator, landowner or developer has made a fortune.  Will the main parties of the Establishment who spent most of the day rubbishing the attack on the planning process, and particularly rezonings in Dublin, give their views on those factors?  This is not an academic discussion but one that impinges on the lives of tens of thousands of ordinary working and unemployed people.</P>
    <P>There is a demand for the truth in this whole controversy, but the Government's terms of reference may set the scene for a possible cover-up of the truth rather than for its revelation.  Paragraph 5 of the terms of reference refers to the tribunal investigating acts which, in its opinion, amount to corruption.  I hope the Minister will direct attention to the amendments I propose rather than read a prepared script.  We should be given concrete answers.  Does there have to be direct <i>prima facie</i> evidence of corruption before a serious matter of planning can be examined by the tribunal?  I refer to amendment No. 4 in my name.</P>
    <P>In 1993 two parcels of land compromising 130 acres at Dublin Airport were inexplicably rezoned from agricultural to industrial by a coalition of councillors from the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael &mdash; the information is in the minutes of the meetings concerned.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications of the day, the Department responsible for Dublin Airport, wrote to the county council stating that the land should not be rezoned.  Aer Rianta, the public body charged with the management of national airports and future strategy for the development of airports, told the county council that in about ten years' time this land on the periphery of Dublin Airport would be needed for expansion for a new terminal and related development.  Even the Dublin Chamber of Commerce wrote to the county council stating that the land should not be rezoned, yet the rezoning was agreed to.</P>
    <P>The effect is that the 130 acres, which might have been bought by Aer Rianta for £5,000 per acre and would cost £650,000 in agricultural zoning, because it was rezoned for industrial purposes could cost £100,000 per acre or, as has been stated by people in the property market, £150,000.  Aer Rianta, therefore, could have to <Col N="95" /> pay between £13 million and £19.5 million simply because the land was rezoned.  Since Aer Rianta is a public body, that would be a direct attack on the taxpayer, and for what purpose?  The effect would be to enrich a tiny handful of individuals.</P>
    <P>Why did the councillors agree to the rezoning against all the advice?  That matter should be investigated.  Can that case be referred to and examined by the tribunal and an investigation conducted into the matter?  The Minister should deal with that issue and with the amendments.  I called for an investigation into the Glending Wood case, the sale in secrecy for £1.25 million of valuable State lands which could be worth £48 million.  Herein lies a scandal of immense proportions which must be investigated.  The rezoning of Laraghcon on the slopes of the Liffey Valley near Lucan should be examined.  That area should be kept as an amenity for the huge communities between Blanchardstown and Lucan.  Land must be set aside for homes and industry in Dublin and elsewhere, but that can be done rationally, without profiteering in housing and industrial land.  There should be strict control of building land so that the scandals I believe have occurred, irrespective of whether there was corruption, will never happen again.  In the interests of those who have to purchase homes &mdash; a basic shelter that everyone requires &mdash; the profiteering element should be taken out of building land.  To facilitate a proper investigation and discovery of the truth, provision should be made for at least limited immunity for those who have guilty information.  This is necessary to ensure that more of the truth comes to light and that a successful investigation into scandals and corruption takes place.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing time with me.  While I had heard rumours about the Minister, Deputy Burke, resigning from his ministerial position, I was shocked to hear of his resignation from the House.  This highlights the vulnerability of politics and politicians.  He did a great deal of good work.  He spoke out strongly against landmines, something that is close to my heart, and when in Opposition he spoke strongly on the question of neutrality. There is a sense of shock in my constituency tonight.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins that Glending Wood should be included in the tribunal.  The drip feed of information in the media in recent days, irrespective of whether it is accurate, will continue unless this matter is investigated by a tribunal.  I do not agree with Deputy Roche that the matter can be dealt with in a committee. Committees cannot compel witnesses in the same way as a tribunal.  We will never get to the bottom of this issue if it is not investigated by a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> The Minister for the Environment referred to rezoning.  I am sure all Members would agree that rezoning has a part to play in proper planning, but it is a question of whether it is done rationally or against the advice of planning officials.  I witnessed two types of rezoning during in my time as a member of Dublin County Council, when many bizarre proposals were brought before the council. During that time I received money with a request that I consider favourably a rezoning proposal. On 13 February 1993, having asked if any other member of the council had also received such money, I was quickly told to resume my seat as I was causing disorder.  I was assaulted in the chamber, the meeting had to be adjourned and, for my own safety I was told, I was led from the chamber by the county manager.  For the sake of the planning process and confidence in public life, the nervous attitude among those involved in planning must be tackled.</P>
    <P>I hope the tribunal will begin to put to rest at least some of these allegations &mdash; to uphold them or to throw them out as unfounded.  I have no doubt the allegations will continue to surface and that there will be a cloud over the heads of all councillors because we cannot say who was honest and dishonest unless we have this tribunal.  If the matter is to be investigated properly the DPP will have to be asked to ensure immunity for witnesses. Up to now both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice have said the DPP is above politics and cannot be asked to grant immunity to witnesses.  That is fair in most cases but issues such as this, which are in the national interest, have to be followed through.  This is an issue on which the DPP will have to be guided.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will not be the end of this matter unless it is given the latitude to follow any money trails unearthed.  As in the Hamilton tribunal, the McCracken tribunal and now in the Ansbacher tribunal, as it is being called, unless there is latitude to follow those money trails the process will be seen to be flawed and ultimately will give rise to further investigation and numerous tribunals.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Molloy, and Deputy Stagg for sharing their time. For the past 45 years Roadstone has been involved in the extraction of sand and gravel at Blessington.  The company's lands at Blessington extend to 638 acres.  The lands are divided between active extraction areas, lands undergoing reinstatement and lands that have been reinstated to forestry and grasslands use.  Of the 638 acres, 147 acres were sold to the company by the Department of Energy in or about 1992.  The 147 acres sold to Roadstone by the Department are subdivided as follows: 90 acres is a coniferous commercial plantation and 57 acres is a mature plantation known as Glending Wood and Deerpark Plantations.  This area will not be exploited in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the granting of planning permission the company's intentions for the 147 acres are as follows: the 57 acres known as Glending Wood <Col N="97" /> and Deerpark Plantations to be retained as they are in full and managed to best forestry standards and 80 acres to be used for sand and gravel extraction.  These lands will be fully reinstated to forestry, grass and wetland, ten acres of coniferous plantation to be maintained for additional screening purposes.</P>
    <P>In respect of the sale of the lands, in a written reply to Question No. 298 on 15 April 1997, column 1141 of the Official Report, the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, stated:</P>
    <P>Prior to the sale detailed assessments on the property were carried out by the Geological Survey of Ireland and by independent consultants to evaluate a fair market price for the property.</P>
    <P>In April 1990 the independent consultants suggested that the Department of Energy might be best advised to invite offers by tender for the sale of the land.  However, following an offer for the property by the first company [Roadstone] mentioned by the Deputy, the consultants subsequently advised in October 1990 that it would be most unlikely that any other party would be able to match an offer from that company and strongly recommended that the sale to the company be pursued.  The then Minister for Energy accepted that advice and the land was not advertised for public sale.</P>
    <P>The Minister was aware that there had been an expression of interest from the second company mentioned by the Deputy.  While negotiations on the sale of the property to the first company were in progress, the second company made an offer for the property, but that offer was significantly lower than that of the first company and was not therefore accepted.  On the basis of advice available to him, the Minister was satisfied that, if the land were put on the market, it would most likely fail to reach the price on offer from the first company.  In accordance with the guidelines on the disposal of Government property where a sale is not conducted by public tender or auction, the approval of the Department of Finance was sought and obtained before the offer by the first company was accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates then went on to say that taking into account the circumstances of the case the Minister at the time was satisfied the State received a fair price for the sale of the property.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been much comment in County Wicklow on Glending and development in the Blessington area.  A few vociferous individuals have made many claims.  Blessington is a small market town located just 20 miles south of Dublin, and it is undergoing radical change due to the proximity of the capital.  I fear that it may become a political football.  There has been much information and innuendo on the airwaves and in the media where allegations of planning scandals and rezoning of lands for pals have been made, <Col N="98" /> and the credibility and bona fides of certain individuals have been unfoundedly called into question in a most distasteful way.  I believe there is nothing to hide with respect of the development of Blessington and Wicklow in general.  I welcome the terms of reference of the new tribunal and, in particular, paragraph 5, and I look forward to those individuals who claim there is something wrong with planning coming forward with factual information and ceasing to peddle speculation.</P>

      <P>In the limited time available to me I will deal with planning and zoning in county Kildare.  Zoners there have gone stark raving mad.  Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrat councillors have been zoning land at such a rate as to lead to 90,000 additional population in the county over a period of five years. This has been vigorously pursued by the right-wing coalition of councillors, despite the strong opposition of the county planners and the opposition of planners from the Labour Party, Democratic Left and the Green Party.  The availability of infrastructure such as roads, water and sewage treatment is of no concern to the zoners.  When advised by the planners that these necessary infrastructural facilities were not available, it mattered not one whit.  Zone and be damned seemed to be the philosophy.  No thought was given to the need for schools and amenities.</P>
      <P>As an example of what I am talking about, at one meeting of the Clane Area Committee of Kildare County Council, the councillors, two Fianna Fáil and two Fine Gael, were told the lands they were now proposing to zone for residential development was subject to regular flooding and that the county council would be liable for damage caused by the flooding of houses in future.  When it was established by the councillors that individual councillors would not be liable for damage, it was decided unanimously by the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors to go ahead with the rezoning.  That is in the village of Clane where the zoners propose to extend the population by a factor of three in a mere five years. This pattern of massive zoning is being pursued not just in Clane but throughout mid and north Kildare.  In Kilcock the same Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors propose to enlarge that village by a factor of five inside five years, and this despite massive public resistance to their proposals. In Kilcock a formal plebiscite was held and, despite the full weight of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael political machines in favour of rezoning proposals, they were rejected by the public by a margin of two to one.  In the prize-winning village of Johnstown, land in the family ownership of the local councillor was zoned from agricultural to residential use which will increase its population by a factor of seven, destroy its village character and transform it into a commuter town &mdash; the value of the land went up from about £100,000 to £1 million overnight.</P>

      <P>In the town of Newbridge, the councillors zoned a sizeable pocket of land that would be sufficient for indigenous needs for 50 years, but the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrat zoners were not satisfied with this. They also decided to go some miles outside the town to zone land in the ownership of Senator John Dardis, then chairperson of the Progressive Democrats.  The 20 acres in question automatically shot up in value from approximately £60,000 to £2 million.  If Senator Dardis was not a millionaire before that decision he is now.  It should be recorded that Senator Dardis is a member of the planning authority and did not vote on the decision.</P>
      <P>This pattern is repeated throughout the county with probably the worst excesses in Maynooth where the full council decided to zone the green belt on either side of Cartan Avenue for residential and commercial purposes despite the strong opposition of the planners, overwhelming opposition by the public and majority opposition by the Celbridge area committee of the council.</P>
      <P>These planning outrages in County Kildare are such that the previous Minister, Deputy Howlin, refused to accept the county development plan. This action was unprecedented and I congratulate Deputy Howlin for having the courage to do so. The county councillors in favour of zoning went back to the drawing board.  The proposal they have come up with has also been rejected by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  It is to be hoped that reason will prevail in County Kildare and that Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael county councillors will heed the advice of the professional planners and the opinion of the public and take account of the planning needs of the county.</P>
      <P>Why do Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael county councillors who are normally industrious in their attention to the needs of their areas lose all reason when it comes to zoning land for residential development?  The reason is plain &mdash; money and greed.  Land zoned from agricultural to residential use rockets in value from approximately £5,000 per acre to £100,000 per acre.  Ten acres yields approximately £1 million.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael are supported with funding by those who make these massive gains and the golden circle continues.  Action must be taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  From the contributions which have been made no one disagrees on the need for a judicial investigation to get to the bottom of the allegations, rumours and innuendoes which have beset the planning system and have scant regard for the good name and reputation of those who serve on public authorities whether as elected members or officers.  If people are guilty of impropriety I hope this will be established and they will have to face the consequences of their actions.  If, on the other hand, people who have been fingered are innocent it is even more important that their good name is restored, that they are vindicated and that the allegations and innuendoes are refuted.  As is clear from the Programme for Government, it is a major ambition of mine during my term as Minister to improve the operation of the planning system.  The process has commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the next year or so, I hope to bring a number of Bills before the House to reform and consolidate planning law.  The public consultation exercise in which I am now engaged will help to achieve this.  I urge anyone who has an interest in good and proper planning to feed their ideas into the process so we can have an improved system in place by the middle of next year.  The tribunal will help to dispel the fog of cynicism that frequently <Col N="101" /> affects planning, pointing up lessons that can be learned so that the legislation can be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked me to respond to their amendments. Up to the outbreak of hostilities between the two Kildare Deputies the debate was very civilised.  I will make one political point on the contributions of Deputies Dukes and Howlin. They persisted in questioning the bona fides of the Government in drafting the tribunal's terms of reference.  The desire and aim of the Government at all times was to have an effective, efficient and focused tribunal.  When the draft terms were brought forward the Opposition had difficulty with them.  The Opposition Whips involved in the negotiations would agree that while they had disagreements and rows about what they felt needed to be included, all told, there was a desire among all parties to get the most effective terms of reference to prevent this from going all over the place and wasting time.</P>
    <P>As a result of the consultations the terms of reference are now better than those first drafted. It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the Whips who had responsibility for drafting the terms of reference and coming up with something reasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin talked about the need for an ombudsman to reassure the public on an ongoing basis about matters of concern.  That is precisely the point I made in my contribution.  The Taoiseach, when in Opposition, put forward that idea and is following up on it in Government.  I agree with Deputy Howlin that it is vital to have this commission in place so that legitimate concerns, allegations and evidence that people have can be brought to a body that is independent of all of us in this House and independent of the &ldquo;system&rdquo;. They can then put their case which can be independently investigated.  That is the aim we have in setting up the permanent ethics commission.</P>
    <P>While we all have our own views of different aspects of this controversy, we can agree it is absolutely necessary to have some other way of dealing with matters of this nature rather than across the floor of the House, until such time as allegations are proven or otherwise.  I am sure Deputies will support that when the time comes.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Howlin's contribution, and Deputy Higgins' amendment to section 5 of the tribunal's terms of reference, I am happy to give both Deputies the assurance they sought on paragraph 5.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's interjection was correct.  Paragraph 5 requires the tribunal to report on any acts associated with the operation of the planning process of which it becomes aware during its inquiries and which it believes might amount to corruption or which involves attempts to compromise the disinterested performance of public duties. Paragraph 5 is designed to be as wide and specific as possible so that the tribunal can investigate any evidence which suggests corruption.  If people bring matters to the attention of the tribunal, it will be in order for it to pursue them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> While Deputy Gilmore welcomed paragraph 5, he said it went too far.  This shows the difficulty the Whips had in drafting the terms of reference. I spoke to the Attorney General about this matter and it was felt that if we tried to specifically list the different incidents we wanted investigated, one would be left out.  If that incident arose during the tribunal, it would be stymied and a new one would have to be established.  I assure the Deputies that paragraph 5 addresses their concerns.  I give an undertaking that if it does not, we can discuss it again in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes tabled amendments Nos. 1, 1<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>1, 2, 7 and 8.  I am advised that these are not specifically needed.  The Deputy said he wanted clear terms of reference and that he had tabled these amendments to remove any doubt.  On the basis that they do not alter the agreement already made with the Whips on the terms of reference, I will accept the amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 7, and include them in the terms of reference.  I have also received advice on amendment No. 7.  The Deputy wanted to insert &ldquo;Electoral, Freedom of Information and Prevention of Corruption&rdquo; Acts.  I suggest that he accept my amendment to insert &ldquo;any other relevant Acts&rdquo; so the tribunal does not feel it has to investigate all such legislation.  The phrase, &ldquo;any other relevant Acts&rdquo;, would leave the tribunal free to investigate legislation if it so wishes.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy.  One of the clearest demands from all sides of this House is that Donnelly Neary and Donnelly Solicitors, their clients and all their complainants would put before the tribunal at the outset the facts and evidence they have in their possession.  That is the one clear message to emerge from this matter.  It will greatly facilitate the tribunal in its deliberations and remove the need for much preliminary work which might otherwise have to be done. With no sense of acrimony I say to those solicitors that they now have what they desired, namely, a judicial inquiry into the planning process in Dublin.  I expect they will do their utmost to co-operate with that inquiry and make available to it all the evidence in their possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to a comment relating to councillors lining people's pockets by rezoning land, etc.  In fairness to councillors, they have a job to do and they sometimes work under enormous pressure. They have a duty to become involved in and take responsibility for the planning process and development plans.  It is unfair to characterise them doing their duty as doing it for the sole reason of lining people's pockets.  It is the responsibility of this House to ensure that, if people are making money from decisions relating to rezoning, etc., a regime is put in place to deal with such matters and collect suitable taxes from those involved.  I have referred this matter to officials in my Department and the review group <Col N="103" /> in order that consideration might be given to the provision of services in respect of rezoned land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The reported increase in the price of the pint was permitted by a decision of the Government.  I am displeased that none of the Ministers responsible have presented themselves in the House this evening.  The matter will be replied to by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for food safety and older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important matter.  As recently as 9 July the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, consumer rights and international trade, Deputy Tom Kitt, told the House that he had no plans to raise the price <Col N="104" /> fixing order that I imposed last March.  However, it is reported in the newspapers that the Minister has done that and has permitted the trade to take an increase of 5p.</P>
    <P>In so far as we can establish a reason for this it is that the brewers have increased the price of a pint by 2p and that the remainder is taken by the licensed trade.  It is shameful that any Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs would capitulate in this fashion to the powerful lobby of the licensed vintner's trade, which is well represented in Government.  There is no justification for it either in terms of fairness to the consumer or its impact on inflation.</P>
    <P>In terms of fairness to the consumer, the proportion of the cost of a pint going to the publican has consistently increased in recent years at the expense of the Exchequer.  The rainbow Government refrained on three successive budgets from imposing an increase in excise duty on alcoholic drink on the understanding that the trade would show similar restraint.  However, the trade took a price increase of 5p and, having failed to persuade those publicans outside Dublin to rescind it, I found it necessary to impose a price fixing order effective from 11 November 1996.  That contributed to depressing the CPI by 0.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>I seek permission to have circulated a note on the statistics of this from the weekly monitor produced by Davy Stockbrokers which point to the fact that the depression in the CPI in the past year was 0.2 per cent arising from that price fixing order because alcohol forms such a disproportionate share of the basket of items that make up the consumer price index.  In submitting to the lobby from the publicans the Minister is prepared to put the present low inflation environment at risk.</P>
    <P>Whatever the excuse for permitting the brewers to take an increase, which is not justified in this low inflation environment, there is no excuse for the Minister of State to bow the knee to the publicans in the fashion that he has done so.  He told the House on 9 July that he had no plans to raise the price fixing order but as soon as the vintners visited him he rolled over.</P>
    <P>It is a particularly inauspicious start for any Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as his first act in Government, to impose on the ordinary pint drinker an increase of 5 pence in the price of the pint with, apparently, the support of his colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace and I ask the Government to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following detailed discussion with representatives of the drinks industry, and having received undertakings on price restraint, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, confirmed by press release dated 3 October 1997 that he would <Col N="105" /> revoke the Retail Prices (Intoxicating Liquor) Order, 1997 with effect from 8 October, 1997. Revocation of the Order will result in a maximum increase at retail level of 5 pence per pint of beer and half glass of spirits from 10 October onwards both in rural areas and in Dublin where there has also been a <i>de-facto</i> price freeze.</P>
      <P>Based on data provided by the Central Statistics Office price increases of the amounts proposed would add 0.26 per cent to the consumer price index in so far as they would apply to the licensed trade.</P>
      <P>The Retail Prices (Intoxicating Liquor) Order, 1997, effective from 11 March, 1997, froze alcoholic drink prices sold in licensed premises outside of the Dublin metropolitan area at the levels pertaining on 4 November, 1996.  In the meantime there has been a <i>de-facto</i> freeze on Dublin drink prices but there are now isolated instances of breaches of this voluntary arrangement.</P>
      <P>The making of the order resulted from the refusal by Limerick publicans to reduce drink prices voluntarily last March, which contrasted with the withdrawal of price increases of 5 pence per pint of beer, stout and ale and 5 pence per half glass of spirits, implemented by certain Dublin and rural publicans during the December 1996-January 1997 period.</P>
      <P>These increases provoked strong consumer reaction and were deemed to be unnecessary and unjustified given the present low inflationary environment.  They did not coincide with any major cost increases and for the third year in succession there were no duty increases on drink in the January budget.</P>
      <P>However, it was always intended that the order would be a temporary measure.  Statutory price control can have uneven and unintended effects and is inconsistent with the thrust of public policy over the past 10 years which has been to foster increased and more effective competition.  The order was largely a warning to the licensed trade to deter irresponsible behaviour but, in this form, is unlikely to be effective over time.  The Director of Consumer Affairs regards it as unenforceable due to the difficulties of obtaining the proofs necessary to sustain a prosecution.</P>
      <P>The order is also vulnerable to legal challenge. The Vintners Federation of Ireland has been given leave by the High Court for a judicial review of the order on the grounds that it is discriminatory and constitutes a restraint on trade contrary to the Treaty of Rome.  As well as excluding Dublin pubs which charge much higher prices, it does not cover clubs or off-licences.  The case is due to be heard on 19 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contemporaneously with the adverse publicity about the price increases, the Competition Authority announced its intention to invoke its powers under section 11 of the Competition Acts 1991-96 and investigate barriers to entry to the drinks trade, particularly the licensing provisions.  The expectation was that the authority's investigation would be completed by end June last and that the <Col N="106" /> Prices Order would then be lifted.  It now transpires that the Authority's report will not be available until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for labour, trade and consumer affairs has engaged in intensive negotiations in recent weeks with Guinness, Irish Distillers and the vintners.  Guinness Ireland has been pressing strongly since early July to implement a price increase of 1.93p per pint on stout, ale and lager.  To do this, they have repeatedly asked that the Prices Order be lifted.  They point to the fact that their most recent price increase was on 1 June 1996 and that the increase of the size mentioned is necessary to compensate for additional costs.  Irish Distillers, whose last general price increase occurred in autumn 1991, is also now seeking to raise its prices for whiskey, gin and vodka by the equivalent of 2p per half glass.  The VFI, which represents 6,000 rural publicans, adverts to the threat to the viability of some of its members because of the continuance of the prices order.  Over 75 per cent of the pubs represented by the VFI have, according to the Revenue Commissioners, an annual turnover of £150,000 or less.  Apart from the temporary upward movement earlier this year, the last general price increase was in June 1996 and, since then, the Vintners Federation of Ireland members have had to bear a range of cost increases.  The Licensed Vintners Association, representing about 700 licensed establishments in Dublin, has also been pressing for the removal of the order.  The final phase of the PCW was paid on 1 April, while the first phase of Partnership 2000 was paid on 1 October.  Like the VFI, its members' last price increase took place in June 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's negotiating strategy has been predicated on the preservation of order and stability in drink prices without the need for continued statutory price control.  The negotiations have resulted in agreement, in the event of the prices order being revoked, on the following price arrangements in accordance with the following timetable and subject to prior notification to the Government: amount/share of proposed price increase &mdash; 5p maximum per pint at retail level for beer, ale and stout and 5p maximum per half glass of whiskey, gin and vodka, of which 2p would accrue to brewers and distillers, 2p to publicans, and 1p in additional VAT.</P>

      <P>In October 1957 a fire broke out in the Windscale nuclear power plant and a deadly cloud spread as far as Dundalk.  A study by Patricia Sheehan published in <i>The Lancet</i><Col N="107" /> claimed a link between the high incidence of Down's syndrome children and stillbirths in County Louth and the Windscale fire.  The study was carried out on a number of women who were students in a school in Dundalk.  In later years a number of these women gave birth to stillborn babies and several had a first child with Down's syndrome.  Many of them suffered from a form of cancer.</P>
      <P>I find it incredible that, in the week we commemorate the 40th anniversary of this nuclear catastrophe, this Government can renege on commitments made to the Dundalk residents who are bringing a case against Sellafield.  The case is made all the more incredible when we know the majority party of this Government, Fianna Fáil, promised during the election it would fully support the group.  Fianna Fáil's election manifesto stated:</P>
      <P>In government, Fianna Fáil will ensure that the case taken by the residents is fully funded and if required appealed through the higher courts.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats also gave the impression they would help residents and stood an environmental campaigner who is very active on the Sellafield issue, Dr. Mary Grehan, in Dundalk for the election.  The residents obviously felt this was a Government they could trust.  We now sadly know the words &ldquo;fully funded&rdquo; can be replaced by the words &ldquo;£200,000 in total&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are all too well aware of the reality of legal costs.  Millions were paid in such costs in the beef tribunal.  Offering just £200,000 for this serious case, which requires substantial research, is close to laughable and very disturbing.  The figure offered is even more disturbing when we consider that on 1 October, in reply to a question from Deputy Yates, the Minister for State, Deputy Jacob, stated the Dundalk group could expect very positive information as to the money which would be forthcoming.  In response to Deputy Yates, the Minister stated the matter of research and assistance towards research was being fully and directly assessed in the Government's proposals to the residents.  He continued to say that the Government's intention was to be &ldquo;ultra-helpful to the group&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What were we and the Dundalk group in particular to expect following these hopeful remarks but that the Government would provide substantial and complete public backing for the taking of this important legal case.  But, a week is a long time in politics.  For the Government to announce such a paltry sum at this time marks not only a broken Fianna Fáil electoral promise to the people, but a remarkable lack of sensitivity to the people of Dundalk in particular and to the Sellafield issue in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of Sellafield will not go away for the four plaintiffs involved in this case or for the majority of people living on our east coast.  This has to be tackled seriously.  This half-hearted <Col N="108" /> attempt by the Government does not auger well for the other promises made by Fianna Fáil in its election manifesto regarding the full closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I wish to recall some of the glaring evidence of the effects of Sellafield.  There are measurable amounts of plutonium in seaweeds on the east coast.  The Irish Sea is unique in having more than half a tonne of plutonium in its silt.  Levels of technetium-99 in lobsters in the Irish Sea have doubled each year since 1992 and in some cases have been up to 30 times higher than the EU's maximum permissible concentration.  Britain continues to ignore the radioactive levels in the Irish Sea.  At the recent Brussels meeting of the Oslo and Paris Commissions, the British Government was the only one of the 15 delegations not to express concern over the levels of technetium-99 found in seafood caught in the Irish Sea.  The delegation said it did not see the issue as being urgent.</P>
    <P>This is the type of complacency we are up against and it is this which the Dundalk group is willing to challenge in court.  As the group said in its statement regarding promises made in the election, &ldquo;why do they continue to believe the people will not recall the election promises and the Dáil statements, or do they feel that by cynically spinning an answer to create a false impression they shall be immune from scrutiny?&rdquo; The Government will not be immune from scrutiny.  The Green Party will not allow the Government to get away with this disgraceful decision.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for agreeing to share time with me.  There have been many reports that Sellafield is detrimental to the health of residents, and most of these remain unfunded and uninvestigated by successive Governments. For example, Carmel Mothersill, an eminent scientist, has proven the link between genomic instability and low levels of ionizing radiation.  Ms Mothersill's ongoing research has been confirmed by many renowned scientific institutions, including the Harvard School of Public Health.  There is so much public concern about Sellafield that I feel it necessary to fund research to investigate the long-term consequences of radiation for current and future generations of Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>In the Fianna Fáil environmental policy document published before the general election, the party said that &ldquo;in Government Fianna Fáil will ensure that the case taken by the Dundalk residents is fully funded and if required appealed through the higher courts&rdquo;.  That is a clear promise given by Fianna Fáil prior to the election and I call on that party to fulfil that commitment and not let down the people or the residents of Dundalk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to state the Government's <Col N="109" /> position on this matter.  First, let me clarify that STAD &mdash; Stop Thorp Alliance Dundalk &mdash; is the support and fundraising group for four County Louth residents who have taken a High Court action against British Nuclear Fuels Limited, Ireland and the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that yesterday I met for the first time with the residents to explain, with the Government's full authority, the nature of State support and co-operation to the residents in connection with their High Court action.  At that meeting I explained that the Government recognises that the residents have won the right to a substantive action against BNFL and that any State assistance would be offered in the context of the residents' responsibility for prosecuting the case.</P>
      <P>Since July last the complex issues relating to this case have been comprehensively reviewed by the Government on two occasions.  This clearly indicates the high level of importance the Government attaches to this matter.  It is the Government's wish to be co-operative and supportive in respect of the residents' efforts, particularly in their attempts to assemble research material designed to further their case.  To this end, on behalf of the Government, I offer the County Louth residents up to £200,000 for research purposes.  This is the first tangible offer of £200,000 for research purposes made by the State.  The package I have offered allows them discretion to identify the precise research which they see as a priority relating to their conduct of the case.  At yesterday's meeting, I informed the residents that all relevant Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland could make themselves available to advise and assist them relating to the content and scope of research they may wish to undertake.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested by the residents' solicitor that the Government accepted some time ago that the residents' research proposals amounting to £250,000 were necessary and should be carried out.  However, the previous Government only approved funding of £100,000 towards these research projects.  This Government's offer of assistance for such research is intended to assist the residents' with funding for projects which they see as a priority relating to their conduct of the case.  This Government does not intend to screen the residents' proposals in terms of assessing their value because it is a matter both for them and their legal team to determine how best to pursue their case and the £200,000 offer is available to support this work.</P>
      <P>I also told the residents that I wanted to be as helpful and co-operative as possible in providing assistance relating to the computerised management of the great volume of documents contained in my Department's Affidavit of Discovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the residents' request for financial assistance towards legal work already carried out or proposed in relation to their case, I informed the residents that the Government was not in a position to fund this work.  The question <Col N="110" /> of funding legal fees was carefully considered in the light of the legal proceedings in the High Court in which the State is named as a co-defendant. For reasons related to the State's own review of a possible legal action against Sellafield and the potential Exchequer implications arising from supporting the residents' case it has been decided to exclude legal fees from the offer of assistance to the residents.</P>
    <P>At yesterday's meeting I informed the residents that any financial assistance to be provided would be subject to the State being removed as a co-defendant in their action against BNFL.  I indicated that I would welcome an early decision from the residents to accept the offer in order that the Government agreed financial assistance could be made available.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the County Louth residents indicated that they could not accept the Government's offer because, in their view, the support offered was not adequate to pursue their case.  I expressed regret on behalf of the Government that they did not find the offer acceptable.  Naturally, I am sorry that the offer did not meet their expectations.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to respond to claims that this Government is not serious about taking a legal action against Sellafield.  I totally refute such claims.  The question of taking an action against Sellafield is one which has been considered by successive Governments over the years.  This issue remains a complex and difficult legal matter.  It would be highly irresponsible of me to commit significant amounts of public money to commence such a case without being assured that the essential preparatory work had been completed, including the crucial element on which grounds for legal redress by the State relies, namely firm scientific evidence.  The matter is under review with the advice and assistance of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Again I thank the House and the two Deputies for this opportunity to clarify the Government's position concerning assistance for the County Louth residents action against BNFL.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Nursing Staff Shortages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the reported shortage of nurses and the difficulty in staffing major teaching hospitals and particularly psychiatric hospitals.  I ask the Minister to outline the facts, the reasons the situation has developed and the implications for medical and hospital care to patients in the coming weeks and months.  What difficulty is there in filling vacancies?  What planning has been done to deal with the situation if, as has been reported, it is the change in training which has caused the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there was an agreement that the vacancies created by the student nurses moving onto a new form of training would be filled by staff nurses.  I wonder if this has happened. Obviously, student nurses were available in the past for teaching hospitals but, because of the <Col N="111" /> change to college based training, these students are no longer available.  From this September, no traditional training will take place.  As it is clear the consequences of the change in training are dramatic, perhaps the value of students' services to hospitals in the past is only now being appreciated.</P>
    <P>Hospitals have advertised abroad with little success.  Clearly, we do not want to overreact to this new situation.  Otherwise, both patients and relatives will become stressed.  However, with winter approaching and likely increased bed occupancy, and with the changing needs of seriously ill patients in our hospitals, this situation needs urgent attention.  A national study of the nursing needs of hospitals must be immediately initiated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A major hospital in my constituency told me today it is barely maintaining its nursing requirements on a day to day basis.  How much more difficult is the situation in areas with smaller populations and, perhaps, less attractive working conditions?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear the issues which were dealt with last year &mdash; the recognition of courses and the need for promotion &mdash; are equally critical in tackling this problem.  I welcome the Commission on Nursing's interim report and look forward to its full set of recommendations.  The vast majority of nurses are women.  It is worth noting they have not got the rewards and recognition over the years which they deserved.</P>
    <P>The fact that bullying of nurses in the workplace was one of the main topics raised with the commission is deeply disturbing.  It appears from the report and the submissions to the commission that bullying may be taking place at a variety of levels in nursing.  Clearly, this issue must be dealt with if we are to make progress in this area and if young women and men are to be attracted to nursing.</P>
    <P>The report states:</P>
    <P>Complaints were made of students being bullied by nurses, nurses being bullied by other nurses and professionals, nurses being bullied by nurse management and nurse management being bullied by general management.  Nurses also reported being subjected to verbal and even physical abuse from patients.</P>
    <P>If this is an accurate report it is devastating in its implications and needs immediate attention and analysis in the workplaces concerned.</P>
    <P>Nurses and the quality of care which patients receive have been recognised as a vital part of our health service for many years.  Perhaps care staff need to be further developed and supported as a profession in hospitals, with priority being given to releasing nursing staff who are caught up in paperwork and excessive administration.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, we need to consider developing a prenursing grade of cadet nurses in each hospital and health board area.  A cadet nurse grade would be a transition year for those considering entering <Col N="112" /> the profession and is already in use in some of the smaller hospitals.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's views on this reported situation and the remedies which may need to be put in place to deal with it in the coming weeks and months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for affording me the opportunity to comment on this issue.  The number of nurses employed in the public health service has increased steadily in recent years.  Between 1990 and 1995 the whole-time equivalent number of nursing staff employed in public health services funded directly by my Department increased from 24,732 to 27,359 &mdash; an increase of 2,626 or 10.6 per cent.  Indeed, the rate of increase in the number of nursing staff employed has been higher than that for health services employment generally over the same period.  At December 1996 the number had stabilised at 27,264.</P>
      <P>These figures do not include nurses working in private hospitals, nursing homes or the private sector generally.  They also do not include nurses who may work for voluntary groups assisted by way of annual financial grants from health boards.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1996, there was a total of 53,641 nurses registered with An Bord Altranais.  Of these, 44,822 were eligible to practice, having paid their annual retention fee required by An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the traditional apprenticeship model of pre-registration nursing education and training is being replaced by a new diploma based programme.  This is in line with the key recommendations contained in the report &ldquo;The Future of Nurse Education and Training in Ireland&rdquo; published by An Bord Altranais in 1994.  Among the main features of the diploma programme are that students register with a third level institute as well as on the candidate register of An Bord Altranais and have access to the facilities of the third level institute.  Nursing students on the programme are supernumerary to service requirements.  The traditional student nurses' service contribution is being replaced by an appropriate grade/skill mix of qualified nurses and other grades.  Accordingly, when examining the details relating to nursing employment the Deputy should bear in mind that within the overall employment levels there is an underlying trend away from unqualified student nurses to qualified nurses.</P>
      <P>Another factor which should be taken into account is the increasing trend in recent years among health service employers to facilitate nurses who, for personal reasons, do not wish to commit themselves to full-time work.  There are now nearly 4,000 nurses working in formal jobsharing arrangements in addition to the significant number who work part-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to understand that nurses have received the most favourable and substantial pay increases in percentage terms anywhere in the <Col N="113" /> public service under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>The requirement for nurses in general hospitals and psychiatric services, while influenced by factors such as activity levels, technological change and working patterns, is to a significant degree determined by perceptions of the role of the nurse in the delivery of services.  The evolving role of the qualified nurse together with structural and work changes appropriate for the effective discharge of that role is central to the terms of reference of the Commission on Nursing chaired by Ms Justice Mella Carroll.  The commission, which published its interim report today, will issue its recommendations on these matters in its final report.  If it is the case that some of the tasks undertaken by nurses are inappropriate to them and can be undertaken by other grades of staff, and it seems from the commission's interim report that this is the case, then issues relating to the availability of nurses must be viewed in that light.  It will be necessary to review this valuable resource to ensure that nurses are not used inappropriately for non-nursing duties.</P>
    <P>I have asked my officials to keep the issue of the availability of nurses under review and to examine with the health service employers whether any special initiatives are required in relation to recruitment.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Taughmon (Westmeath) Water Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise the important matter of the Taughmon water scheme from Drummond Cross to Killucan. I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy McGrath.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace to the House and I hope he brings us good news.</P>
      <P>The saga of this scheme is one of the longest of any of those initiated and the patience of people living in Drummond, Clonickivant, Huntingtown, Lisnabin and Killucan who would benefit directly from the scheme, is wearing thin at this stage.  The absence of a reliable water supply hinders the hard and earnest efforts of the local community groups to initiate developments to bring worthwhile projects to this large area.</P>
      <P>The immediate approval by the Minister of State's Department of the contract documents which were lodged with the Department in 1984 for the extension of the Taughmon water supply scheme from its present extremity at Drummond Cross to Killucan would allow the abandonment of the present village source, which is very vulnerable in quantity terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme encompasses 2,200 linear metres of 150 millimetre diameter main to the new booster pumping station, 4,225 linear metres of 150 millimetre diameter rising main to a new 1,250 cubic metre capacity distribution main to serve Killucan village and Raharney village.  The estimated cost of the scheme at 1996 prices is £1,034,000. The scheme will also provide the headworks for infilling by group schemes for an area bounded by Drummond Cross, the Vee of the Downs, the <Col N="114" /> Royal Canal, the county boundary to the east and to the north as far as Craddenstown, Killucan and back to Drummond Cross.</P>
    <P>The scheme will also boost the low pressure supply in the Wooddown area and in effect this scheme will provide water for a population equivalent of approximately 5,000 persons.  It will also allow for future development as well as permit the expansion of the rural hinterland served by this proposed scheme and of course will permit further housebuilding and possible industrial developments in the areas served.  This would be very important for rural regeneration and would help to keep the population in these areas.</P>
    <P>The scheme will also help promote the conditions necessary for the development of agriculture in the area as it is a mixed farming area and a reliable water supply is vital to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Contract documents were sent to the Department in 1984 and it is now vital that the Minister ends the uncertainty for the many people of the area who will be served by this important scheme, and indeed Westmeath County Council.  He must sanction the contract documents submitted in 1984 which can be immediately updated if necessary, in order to allow the scheme to proceed to tender.  We must not have any further procrastination or delay as it will only cost slightly over £1 million and with the Exchequer awash with funding right now it is payback time for the people who will benefit from this scheme.  It is the least they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Penrose, for allowing me to share his time.  I hope the Minister of State will have good news.</P>
      <P>A clean and constant water supply is the right of every householder.  In an age when we can send men to the moon it is surely possible that every household in Ireland can have a clean water supply.  However, many people in the Killucan area of Westmeath do not have a basic supply of water, which is totally inadequate.  There is a reservoir in Killucan but the supply line is unable to meet the demands put on it so the water pressure is very poor.  This means that extensions to the Killucan scheme or new house connections in the area are prohibited.  People are getting contaminated water and are unable to tap into the village water supply.  Many wells go dry.  Last year in the area around Edmondstown 15 wells went dry.  A school in the area has just completed sinking its third well in a very short period at a cost of about £3,500.  There is no guarantee that this well will supply the school.  A new piggery was constructed in the area with a demand for 5,000 gallons of water a day.  A deep level well is supplying this piggery at present, but locals fear that it will not be long before this deep level well drains the supply from their low level wells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot tolerate this any longer.  The contract documents for this scheme are in the Department for the last 13 years.  When initially submitted to the Department, they would have cost about £500,000 to implement.  The cost would <Col N="115" /> now be in excess of £1 million.  Other brook schemes would flow from this scheme to facilitate a much wider area, as outlined by Deputy Penrose. I call on the Minister of State to ensure that this scheme, if it is not approved by the end of this year, will be approved by his Department in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Penrose and McGrath for raising this issue.  My colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, regrets that he is unable to be present to reply to this item and he has asked me to do so on his behalf. I will outline the broader picture on investment in water and sewerage services before I specifically deal with the proposal to extend the Taughmon scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's water and sewerage services capital work programme is the largest in the history of the State.  It represents an increase of nearly 20 per cent in real terms on the 1996 programme, which was also set at a very high level.  The provision of over £150 million this year for water and sewerage services is solid evidence of the continued commitment to improving the country's environmental infrastructure and to meeting the existing and projected needs arising from residential, economic and other development.  The investment programme for 1997 will ensure that up to 60 major public schemes will start this year <Col N="116" /> with a final value estimated to be in the region of £250 million.</P>
    <P>County Westmeath has benefited from this substantial level of investment.  This year's water and sewerage services capital work programme provides for schemes amounting to approximately £3.25 million to proceed to construction. These include the provision of sewerage facilities in the West Bank area of Athlone and the extension of the Mullingar water supply scheme to serve Tyrrellspass.  Work is already under way on two further schemes with a combined cost of more than £6.5 million.  These schemes involve the provision of sewerage facilities for Moate and the provision of water supplies to Ballynacargy, Moyvore and Ballymore.  Work on a water leakage detection scheme has also been approved recently.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific proposal raised by Deputies Penrose and McGrath, contract documents to extend the Taughmon regional water supply, from Drumman Cross to Killucan, have been submitted to the Department of Environment and Local Government.  This proposal is estimated to cost almost £500,000.  Deputies will appreciate that, given the high level of existing commitments under the water and sewerage services capital programme, it is not possible to say when this proposal will be approved.  However, the Deputies can be assured that the scheme will be considered in the context of the prioritisation of schemes for the work programme in future years.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 October 1997.</P>

      <P>The Agenda 2000 document sets out the Commission's views on the future of the CAP in general terms.  It will not be possible to adopt definitive positions on the proposals in the document until the full details are published next year. However, I believe that reform of the market regimes of the CAP is necessary to make European agriculture more competitive on world markets and allow it to be developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  This must be done in a way that ensures that principles of the CAP are preserved.  In particular, farm incomes must be protected by full compensation for any price <Col N="119" /> reduction not only for reasons of equity and social cohesion but also because the predominance of agriculture as an economic activity in rural areas makes it of central significance in the development of those areas.  I also believe that the reform of the market regimes should be accompanied by appropriate measures to assist the agricultural sector to adapt its structures to the more competitive conditions which will obtain and that agri-environment measures and rural development policy should both be strengthened to ensure the preservation and enhancement of the rural environment and the survival of dynamic rural communities.</P>
      <P>My strategy in the negotiations on Agenda 2000 will be based on the approach which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>In the beef sector premia are paid on suckler cows and male cattle.  These premia are intended to compensate beef producers for the effects of a reduced level of market support for all categories of cattle, including heifers.  They are not in any way related to eligibility for national beef quality assurance schemes.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the exclusion of heifers from the premium system means that they are not counted in the calculation of stocking density on premium payments.  This reduces the impact of the stocking density limit on well stocked farms and facilities qualification for the extensification premium.  In addition, in view of EU budgetary constraints, the inclusion of heifers in the premium system would almost certainly result in a reduction in the rates of premium payable on suckler cows and male cattle.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing direct income payments are set down in EU regulations and therefore any changes in these conditions would require a proposal from the EU Commission and the agreement of the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>The 1992 CAP reform measures which switched the emphasis from market supports to direct payments had the effect of getting support more directly to producers as well as containing a bias in favour of small and medium sized producers. Overall the reform package has been favourable to Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>The agricultural elements of Agenda 2000 largely follow the path of the earlier reform although the detailed aspects will not be presented by the Commission for some time yet. It is my intention, in the forthcoming negotiations on Agenda 2000, to pursue the objective of equity in the direct payments system.</P>

      <P>The position following the mid-term review of the Structural Funds is that an extra £20 million in total public funds has been allocated to the scheme for the control of farm pollution.  The net result is that overall funding of over £226 million is available for on-farm investment over the 1994-99 period.  The extra funds which we have now obtained will allow us continue to process the remaining applications on hands and pay the farmers as soon as work has been satisfactorily completed.</P>
      <P>They do not, however, provide sufficient funding to allow the scheme to be reopened to new applicants.  I am still considering the matter and will also be closely monitoring the progress of other large-scale projects in the CSF as a whole in early 1998 to see if savings are likely to be identified in any areas which could be diverted to the scheme for the control of farm pollution.</P>
      <P>I might add that I had hoped to secure more funds at the mid-term review but considering that there were demands for substantially increased funding from all of the nine operational programmes and that few of these could be met, I accept that the funding we secured was a reasonable amount.  Furthermore, extra funds for any one operational programme had to be transferred from some other programme as no extra overall funds were available to Ireland.</P>

      <P>The issues which have been brought to my attention in relation to intervention relate in the main to the need for an effective intervention system, on the one hand, and the costs on the beef industry arising from the controls enshrined in EU regulations.</P>
      <P>As far as the effectiveness of the intervention system is concerned, I believe that the recent decision of the beef management committee to retain (a) the maximum carcase weight limit at 360 kg and (b) eligibility of steer grade O4s for the next quarter will ensure that an effective intervention system will be available for the beef sector for the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the controls on intervention, the position is that these controls have been substantially strengthened in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any consideration of production and imports of fruit and vegetables must take account of the following: there are no restrictions on imports from other member states of the European Union and member states are precluded from taking unilateral action to encourage native production; the seasonality factor, especially in respect of fresh vegetables, means that economic production in this country is not possible for certain periods of the year; the variability of yields, particularly for potatoes, due to climatic conditions makes it impossible to achieve an exact match of production and demand on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Domestically produced vegetables collectively enjoy a market share of between 70 and 75 per cent.  For some products such as potatoes, cabbage and mushrooms, the market share is as high as 90 per cent.  However last year imports of vegetables showed an increase on 1995.  There are a number of factors which contributed to this increase including adverse weather conditions and fluctuating exchange rates.</P>
      <P>Overall the horticulture industry performed well in 1996 with output &mdash; excluding potatoes &mdash; increasing to over £166 million compared to £141 million in 1995.  The mushroom and soft fruit sectors have already achieved the targets in the Bord Glas Development Plan 1994-99.</P>
      <P>The potato sector had a difficult year in 1996 not only in Ireland but throughout the EU due to oversupply arising from increased production and high yield.  In Ireland the increase in production was slight and in general while prices were much lower than in 1995 our producers fared better than their counterparts in some EU countries. Potato acreage in Ireland has increased from 40,823 in 1992 to 44,857 in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Glas is supporting the sector through a number of initiatives.  These include the setting up of the Horticulture Industry Forum, the establishment of a market co-ordination programme to match domestic supplies with market demand with a view to minimising imports and the implementation <Col N="126" /> of a comprehensive quality auditing programme for horticultural products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The reference by the director of Teagasc for the introduction of a national food safety research programme is based on the belief that the development of the agri-food sector must be underpinned by the necessary assurances in relation to food safety.  I subscribe fully to that belief.  The support measures available under the current development strategy for the food industry lay a heavy emphasis on food safety and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The role of research in the context of food safety has been clearly recognised.  A particular element of the current development strategy is devoted to &ldquo;public good&rdquo; research.  Under that initiative, Teagasc and other institutions are supported for research which is not commissioned or carried out by individual firms and the results of which will be made publicly available.  While the initiative covers a number of priorities, food safety has merited significant support.  To date, some £7.2 million has been awarded for projects with that theme.  The issue is also one which commands priority under the other support measures which cover capital investment, marketing and promotion, and the development of human resources.</P>
      <P>The EU research programmes also recognise the importance of food safety.  Teagasc and other Irish institutions participate in these programmes which afford opportunities for collaboration with research centres in other member states.  Another welcome development is the lead role being taken by Irish institutions in the area of research into functional foods.  This research is directed at food products which enhance rather than simply protect the health of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, essential that research does not occur in a vacuum.  The communication and adoption of research results are equally as important as the research itself.  This is being catered for through the assistance provided under the food development strategy for the dissemination of research results.  A particular feature of <Col N="127" /> this support is that it embraces all research viewed as relevant to the Irish consumer and industry.</P>
    <P>Future research requirements in the area of a food safety are a central consideration in the current planning initiative being undertaken by Teagasc.  They are also likely to be on the agendas of other research institutions and the National Food Safety Authority.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Livestock Marts (Date of Test and Name and Address of Owner) Regulations, 1997, which require that livestock marts publicly identify the name and address of the owner of bovine animals and sheep and, where applicable, the date of the most recent bovine TB and brucellosis tests, in advance of the sale of such animals at the mart.</P>
      <P>Reports received in my Department indicate that some marts have not been implementing the regulations or are not doing so in the proper manner. The situation is being monitored by officers of my Department with a view to ensuring that all marts comply fully with the regulations.  In addition, the livestock mart organisations have also been asked to remind their members of their obligations in this regard.  I am keeping this under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to allegations which have been repeated on a number of occasions in the recent past of the illegal export of UK beef as Irish product.</P>
      <P>Over the last months, the EU Commission has carried out two separate investigations into the illegal export of UK beef.  The first investigation arose from the discovery of beef with UK markings in Dutch and French cold stores.  Some of this beef bore veterinary control labels indicating an Irish origin.  An investigation was jointly carried out by my Department and by the Commission's anti-fraud unit.  The conclusions were that there was no evidence whatsoever of Irish involvement.</P>
      <P>The most recent investigation arose in connection with seizures of beef by the customs authorities in France and Germany.  Ireland was one of several member states whose assistance was sought.  The conclusions of investigations carried out in Ireland by both the special investigation unit of my Department and the EU Commission were that the beef in question was shipped illegally from the UK using false Irish documentation. I would like to emphasise that there is no evidence of fraudulent involvement of Irish beef or Irish meat export plants nor is there evidence that the beef was shipped through Irish territory. I should also make clear that none of the beef seized bore Irish health marks.</P>
      <P>The controls on the production and movement of Irish beef are very stringent and ensure that only product which is clearly identifiable as Irish beef produced in export approved plants in Ireland under official supervision receives the necessary official veterinary certification to allow it to be exported.  In addition there are extensive controls at the Border with Northern Ireland to prevent illegal imports of cattle or beef.  The Irish Army operates patrols on a 24 hour basis.  The Garda Síochána has a series of static and rolling checkpoints.  The customs authorities and Department of Agriculture and Food staff are on call on a 24 hour basis.  I am fully satisfied therefore that there are no grounds for questioning the integrity of beef exports for Ireland.</P>
      <P>To counter any possible damaging effects of the publication of allegations, such as those which appeared recently, my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia continue to clarify the position as regards Irish beef in all markets of importance to us.  I have made the position clear to my German and French ministerial colleagues in whose countries the reports first appeared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The excessive use of phosphate based fertilisers is one of a number of contributors to the eutrophication of rivers and lakes.  Responsibility for the implementation of legislation relating to water quality and waste management rests with my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the various local authorities under the aegis of his Department.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme (REPS), introduced in 1994, has a major role to play in reducing water eutrophication from agricultural sources.  The main aim of REPS is to establish farming practices and controlled production methods which will prevent water pollution and promote habitat conservation and landscape protection.  Among the REPS measures is a requirement to prepare a waste storage, liming and fertilisation plan for the farm. This provision of the scheme is specifically designed to protect and improve the quality of water resources by minimising nutrient losses.</P>
      <P>My Department in conjunction with the Department of the Environment published a code of good practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates in July 1996.  This code prescribes methods to prevent or minimise the pollution of waters from nitrates by adopting certain farm waste and nutrient management techniques in the storage of organic wastes, silage, dungstead and farmyard manure and soiled water.</P>
      <P>All farmers are advised to take account of its guidelines.  Observance of the detailed advice and recommendations contained in the code will also make a significant contribution to a reduction in phosphorus losses from agriculture.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has now drawn up revised phosphate recommendations and these will be incorporated into the Department's REPS specifications straightaway.  In this context I would like to welcome the recently announced drive by Teagasc to improve water quality by persuading farmers to use significantly less quantities of phosphates.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these measures will considerably reduce the incidence of eutrophication of rivers and lakes from agricultural sources. They are a significant contribution to the total quality management approach which the Irish agricultural industry needs to adopt more and more in all its sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers was one of the sub-measures operated under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99.  The programme had an indicative budget of £17 million for the scheme and was launched in December 1994.  It was expected that about 3,000 young farmers would participate.  Due to the high level of demand the scheme was suspended with effect from 7 August 1997 in respect of new applications.</P>
      <P>By 1 October 1997 a total of some 3,240 young farmers had been paid about £18 million under the scheme.  In addition there are about 600 other applications being processed currently with a potential grant commitment of about £3.5 million.</P>
      <P>As part of the operational programme the independent analysis and evaluation unit carried out a detailed evaluation of the scheme.  They indicated that the scheme should be terminated as it was not meeting the main objective of encouraging the earlier transfer of farms.</P>
      <P>My Department as part of its submission to the mid-term review sought additional funds to enable the continuation of the scheme.  This was additional to the funds sought in other areas where the level of applications had already exceeded the level of funds available &mdash; CFP and dairy hygiene.  The mid-term review took on board the views of the independent evaluation report and a report prepared by consultants on the operation of the first half of the operational programme, both of which recommended the suspension of the scheme, and accordingly did not make any additional funds available for the continuation of the SIA scheme.  The scheme was consequently suspended, as already indicated, on 7 August 1997.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that there are currently in excess of 6,600 farmers participating in the scheme of early retirement from farming.  While this money is not going directly to young farmers the benefits of the earlier transfers along with other national aids &mdash; tax reliefs &mdash; have greatly assisted in the improvement of their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> In addition the Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises the need to support young farmers by ensuring adequate provision for access to quota or production rights by qualified young farmers, and stamp duty exemption for young farmers taking over family holdings.</P>
    <P>I am considering the matter and will be closely monitoring progress of other large-scale projects in the CSF as a whole in early 1998 to see if savings are likely to be identified in any area.</P>

However, final agreement has not yet been reached as to the independent bodies or individuals who will carry out inspection and certification functions at farm level.  This aspect is being pursued and I am confident that agreement will be reached on this at an early date.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Horticulture Industry Forum which was set up towards the end of 1995 is an initiative to create greater co-ordination, co-operation and communication within the horticultural industry, with particular emphasis on closer linkages between those in the industry comprising the &ldquo;supply chain&rdquo;.  It is also designed to create closer and more dynamic linkages between the statutory bodies &mdash; i.e. An Bord Glas, Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; and the various sectors of the industry &mdash; i.e. growers, wholesalers, retailers and their <Col N="133" /> representatives.

      <P>The forum lapsed on the expiry of the term of office of the board of An Bord Glas in December 1996 but the incoming board decided in January 1997 that the forum would continue to operate as heretofore.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>A key element to be introduced under the national beef assurance scheme is the computerised movement monitoring system &mdash; CMMS.  The CMMS will bring together all data relating to bovine animal events, such as birth details, herd location at time of premium/headage claim and of certain disease tests, slaughter or export details, as well as information on movements between the various locations, in particular inter-herd movements.  The CMMS, therefore, when constituted will be a computerised traceability record of bovine animals in the national herd.</P>
      <P>The major and most important element of the CMMS relates to the data on animal movements. It is also the most difficult to plan and implement. The data will be ascertained, in particular, from movement notifications to be made by marts and movement notifications to be made by individual herdowners.  Arrangements have also to be made to improve the collection of data in respect of cattle slaughterings and exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultations are being held with the mart organisations to settle arrangements for the effective participation by the marts in the CMMS by way of direct computer links to the Department's central computer.  These arrangements are proving more problematic than had been envisaged, particularly because of the lack of computer facilities-usage at many marts.  Nonetheless, it is hoped to commence an initial pilot operation of the system at a number of marts within a matter <Col N="134" /> of weeks and then to move to a wider and more comprehensive implementation over the coming period.</P>
    <P>The arrangements to be implemented for inter-farm movements to be notified by herdowners also are in the planning stages.  These arrangements have to take place with due regard to recent EU Council legislation on bovine animal identification and registration and in accordance with related Commission implementing rules. The regulation dealing with the latter has not yet been finalised or adopted but is expected to be settled shortly at upcoming meetings in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Some £3 million capital has been allocated for CMMS in 1997.  The amount to be provided for 1998 is soon to be determined in the context of the 1998 Estimates.</P>

    <P>Following the resignation of the Electricity Supply Board's representative on the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board on 1 June 1997, the ESB nominated Mr. Gerry Gough for the vacant position and he was formally appointed to the board by my predecessor on 16 July 1997.  Mr. Declan Turnbull was offered appointment to the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board by my predecessor on 24 June 1997.  His appointment was not commenced until the date on which he accepted the appointment which was 30 June 1997.  Ministerial appointments to the fisheries boards &mdash; apart from casual vacancies &mdash; fall due at the time of elections to the boards.  I am currently reviewing the date on which these elections will be held.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tom O'Reilly was appointed as a director to Drogheda Port Company for a five year period by my predecessor with effect from 23 June 1997. Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan was appointed by my predecessor as a director to Galway Port Company for a five year period with effect from 23 June 1997.</P>
    <P>The question of appointing or reappointing directors to these port companies, except in the case of casual vacancies, will next arise in March 2002.</P>

      <P>As I advised in my reply of 30 September, I received numerous requests this summer for extensions to the commercial fishing season in various regions around the coast.  Having carefully considered all the submissions made to me, the advice of relevant regional fisheries boards and the scientific assessments by the central fisheries board and the Marine Institute, as well as the particular local circumstances, I <Col N="142" /> decided, as an exceptional measure, to grant a limited number of extensions, including the draftnet fisheries in the north-western fisheries region, the Rivers Cashen-Feale, and the Waterford fisheries district.  This effectively allowed draft fishermen in the areas up to five days additional fishing time.</P>
      <P>The three regional fisheries boards concerned are in the process of compiling catch statistics for the season and have been requested to disaggregate the draftnet catch information requested by the Deputy from the registers of licensed salmon dealers.

The whole question of how to associate non-governmental organisations more closely with the work of Irish delegations to the UN and other bodies is however already under consideration.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, prepared at all times to receive the views of non-governmental organisations representative of youth on the issues covered in the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000.  Such views would be taken into consideration by our national delegation in arriving at positions to be adopted on the issues under debate in this programme.</P>

      <Quest>the latest research on the possible health effects from masts for mobile telephones services; if an independent body conducts this research; if a non-thermal standard can be used to ensure low exposure of radiation; if monitoring of the radiation from these masts will continue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of possible effects on health from the transmission and receiving antennae required for the roll-out of mobile telephone services has been the subject of much research internationally.  I can inform the House that in 1996 a major review of the health issues raised by non-ionising radiation emitted by telecommunications masts was carried out by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection &mdash; who are advisers to the World Health Organisation on these matters.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that there is no substantive evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to levels of non-ionising radiation at levels at or below those set in 1988 by the International Radiation Protection Association &mdash; IRPA.  The IRPA guidelines are compulsory in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Compliance with international non-ionising radiation emission standards is a condition attached to all telecommunications licences for mobile telephony services issued in Ireland.  The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, who was appointed pursuant to the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, is responsible for ensuring compliance with licence conditions and will arrange for monitoring of non-ionising radiation emissions.  I understand that the director is currently looking at this issue and intends to put in place suitable arrangements in the near future.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that mobile telephones in use in Ireland meet the exposure standards recommended by major health advisory bodies worldwide, including the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection, the American National Standards Institute and the United States National Council for Radiation Protection and Measurements.</P>
      <P>Further research in the area has been proposed recently in a report commissioned by the European Commission and I can confirm that my Department will be monitoring developments to ensure that the most up-to-date standards are applied to emissions in this country.</P>
      <P>I would also like to inform the House that arising from the increasing number of inquiries being received in my Department from local authorities, Health boards and elected representatives concerned about the health aspects of mobile phone towers, MMDS masts and other transmission infrastructure, it has been decided to hold an international conference on this issue early next year.  The conference is, as of yet, at the early planning stage.  I will keep Members informed as progress is made.</P>

      <P>The final report by Oscar Faber on a comparative socio-economic evaluation of the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum lines was published in October 1996.  My Department had many contacts with Drumcondra 2005 at that time and subsequently and has responded to their requests for information and documentation.</P>
      <P>The work done by Steer Davies Gleave was modelling work requested by and supplied only to Oscar Faber to assist them with their study.</P>
      <P>The work requested was in relation to the DTI model runs and comprised the running of up to six new specified tests, the preparation and provision of additional data on previously run tests and the calculation of user and non-user benefits, accident reductions and vehicle operating costs for each test and the provision of generalised cost matrices.  There was no separate Steer Davies Gleave study or terms of reference as such.</P>
      <P>I propose to reply as fully as possible to the Drumcondra 2005 request for information which I received on 24 September last I do not consider it appropriate to publish the minutes of the Light Transit Monitoring Group which was set up to oversee the light rail project generally and is part of the on-going deliberative process of my Department.</P>

In this context &ldquo;local&rdquo; was interpreted at two levels &mdash; the catchment <Col N="149" /> area to be served by the particular route and the wider Dublin economy.</P>
    <P>The light railway public inquiry is an independent process established by statute, which gives the inspector conducting the inquiry power to call witnesses.  My only function in relation to that inquiry is to receive and consider the inspector's report thereon.</P>

      <P>In August 1996, a multi-annual development programme costing £28.5 million at Shannon Airport over the period 1996-2001 was approved.</P>
      <P>Some £23.5 million of this relates to a major rationalisation and expansion of the passenger terminal.  The main element of the programme is the refurbishment of the existing arrivals concourse and a major extension of the arrivals building which will house departures and provide a larger arrivals area.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the development relates mainly to a new approach road and relocation of coach, taxi and car hire parking facilities.</P>
      <P>I understand from Aer Rianta that work on the capital development programme is progressing satisfactorily.  The programme is subject to regular review in the light of traffic and other developments. The first annual review of the programme is currently under way and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.  The question of whether any airline wishes to exercise traffic rights available to them is a matter for the airline on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  In effect the regulations require that when all balancing payments under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium schemes and 1996 EU special beef premium schemes are made a comparison is to be carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money is to be recouped from those farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  This money was to be recouped either from 1996 extensification entitlements <Col N="155" /> of the farmers concerned or alternatively from entitlements under the 1997 schemes.</P>
      <P>The money so recouped is then to be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.  The person named had 30 additional eligible cows in 1996 and 20 additional eligible male animals and will therefore be entitled to further payments under these categories.  It is intended that these adjustments will be made towards the end of this year.</P>
      <P>To date, the person named was paid BSE suckler cow top-up on 25 cows amounting to £560.00 (25 x £22.40) and BSE special beef premium top-up on 10 male animals amounting to £190.80 (10 x £19.08) last October, based on the 1995 suckler cow and special beef premium schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the 1997 element of BSE compensation he was paid £1,127.85 (55 x £20.47) top-up on 55 cows on 23 May 1997 and £300.00 (30 x £10) on 30 male animals on 28 May 1997.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the scheme that producers who apply for grants on more than 15 animals must submit documentary proof that all of the animals applied on were in their ownership and possession prior to 20 March 1996.</P>
      <P>The persons named did not submit the necessary proof with the application but, following a request for same from the district livestock office, a letter was received on their behalf from another person confirming that the animals in question had been purchased from him in September/October 1995. However, only one of the 58 animals was found in a full BTE test of the herd of the persons named which was carried out on 6 January 1996. This suggests that 57 of the animals applied on were not in the ownership and possession of the applicants at the time indicated by them.  For this reason, BSE compensation can be paid only on the one animal found in the herd of the persons named before 20 March 1996.  This payment will be made within the week.</P>

      <P>Under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, statutory responsibility for the supervision of day to day operations at domestic abattoirs, including ante and post mortem examination of animals and certification of meat, rests with the relevant local authority.  In December 1996, as a result of the unsatisfactory situation which had existed for some time in this regard, Government approval was secured for payment by my Department of financial assistance to local authorities in order to assist them in urgently rectifying this situation.</P>
      <P>My Department has been engaged in ensuring that each local authority is carrying out all the relevant functions and where it is satisfied that this is the case, payment has already been made to the local authority concerned.  Payment will be made to the remaining local authorities as soon as they have confirmed that they meet the relevant criteria.</P>

      <P>The East Offaly Project which was established in 1989 demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of tuberculosis breakdown following badger removal.  However, it was felt that these findings could not be assumed to hold true for other landscape types and farming practices throughout the country.  A research trial was agreed with the Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to confirm the involvement of badgers in the spread of bovine tuberculosis in a varied sample of national situations.  The areas involved are parts of counties Donegal, Monaghan, Kilkenny and Cork and it is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of badgers that will be involved.</P>
      <P>The laboratory at Abbotstown as well as other regional veterinary laboratories are involved in the examination of the badgers.  The estimated additional cost of the project is £180,000 and this will be borne by my Department's vote which is the sole source of funding.  This is a major biological project which will yield information on the involvement of badgers in bovine tuberculosis. There are also a number of sub-projects which will avail of the information collected, increasing our knowledge of the ecology and habitat of the badger.  The project is also being used as part of separate vaccine development work.</P>

      <P>The EU regulation on the labelling of beef which was adopted by the Agriculture Council last March, provides, in principle, for the labelling of beef on an optional basis until 31 December 1999.  While the regulation provides for the compulsory labelling of origin from 1 January 2000, it also permits member states to waive the requirement in respect of beef sold on their own territory.  I will decide in light of experience whether to avail of this waiver.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the EU regulation permits member states with a well developed cattle identification and registration system to impose a compulsory labelling system in respect of beef derived from cattle which have been born, reared and slaughtered on their own territory.  It is not my intention to implement this provision.  I am satisfied that the introduction of a cattle movement monitoring system will ensure that the Irish beef industry will be in a strong position to comply with a compulsory labelling system from 1 January 2000.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that, having regard to our open policy with regard to the importation of breeds from other countries, the range of beef breeds available in Ireland is adequate to meet the diverse needs of the industry and the marketplace. However, I believe that we need to improve the quality of the Irish beef breeds.  This can best be achieved by an expansion in our national cattle breed improvement programme and by upgrading our system for genetic evaluation. The recently established Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) will play a major role in achieving these objectives.</P>

      <P>Since taking office I had one formal <Col N="168" /> meeting on 23 July with representatives of the Irish beef processing industry.  Discussions at that meeting covered a range of issues including cattle prices, the prospects for the autumn cattle trade and the need for an effective market support system. Officials of my Department are in regular contact with the industry.</P>
      <P>At the last meeting of the beef management committee on 26 September, the Commission extended the existing intervention buying-in arrangements until the end of the year.  This means that the carcase weight limit remains at 360kg and grade 04 steers will continue to be eligible for intervention.  I am satisfied that these arrangements will provide an effective support for cattle prices this autumn.</P>

Last year over 70 farmers in Ireland were involved in growing non-food crops for use in the pharmaceutical industry in the UK.</P>

      <P>The REP scheme commenced in 1994 and operated under a set of agri-environmental specifications published at that time.  Subsequently in the light of experience a number of improvements and clarifications were incorporated into a revised version of the agri-environmental specifications which took effect from 15 May 1996.  However, applications received in my Department prior to the issue of the revised specifications are dealt with in accordance with the original version which was applicable at the time of joining REPS.  The revised specifications are applied only if a revised REPS plan has been submitted by such applicants subsequent to the implementation of the revised agri-environmental specifications.  Many applicants have availed of the new specifications in this way.  My Department has not applied the new specifications and conditions retrospectively.</P>
      <P>REPS is operated on an up front payment system, made on trust that the terms and conditions of the scheme and the specifications will be complied with by the applicant.  An essential control feature of that system involves widespread checking of compliance by farmers with their plan and a 5 per cent compliance check of plans with the specifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> The REP scheme appeals committee is comprised of three officials of my Department who review individual appeals of penalties imposed following control inspections carried out prior to payment.  If a penalty is imposed during the processing of a REPS application the farmer is notified of this penalty.  The first option open to the applicant is to seek a review of the case in the Department's local office.  If the penalty is not withdrawn an appeal can be lodged in the Environment Section of my Department.  Following the receipt of such an appeal, an acknowledgment is issued and the case is referred to the relevant regional inspector.  The regional inspector investigates each case and makes a recommendation to the committee.  At that stage the committee considers the merits of the case and issues a decision on the appeal.  The farmer is then notified of this decision.  All stages of the appeal procedure are independent of the original decision making process and all aspects of the appeal are considered objectively by the committee.</P>
    <P>The individual members are a senior inspector, an agricultural inspector and an assistant principal officer.  The frequency of committee meetings depends on the number of appeals received.  The committee has sat on 12 occasions since the first meeting on 10 January 1997.</P>

      <P>The REP scheme specifications are applied in a common-sense approach throughout the country.  The REP scheme specifications are very detailed and spell out how the measures in the scheme are to be applied.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of farmers have no difficulty with the interpretation of the specifications.  For those who have problems, my Department operates a comprehensive appeals system which provides farmers with a means of having their case reviewed.  The appeals system allows for the examination of all aspects of the REPS plan, including the interpretation of the Department's inspectors.  The appeals system is the guarantor of consistency in the interpretation of the specifications throughout the country.</P>

    <P>Where raised bog forms part of a holding, fencing of external boundaries to the bog area is not required where its location is such that livestock from the holding will not enter the area.  The <Col N="172" /> farmer is required to fence any boundary between the land being farmed and the bog area. Fines are applied where livestock are found to have gained access to habitats such as turf banks on open bogs.</P>
    <P>The new agri-environmental specifications apply to all plans prepared from the date of their introduction.  In relation to plans prepared under the old specifications, these continue to apply except where the participant has had his plan revised to comply with the new specifications.</P>

      <P>This country enjoys a high health status and a range of national and EU schemes are in place to protect this status.  Other measures are introduced as and when required.</P>
      <P>In the cattle sector, my Department operates a number of schemes covering, in particular, the eradication of BSE, TB, brucellosis and leucosis. In the sheep sector, legislation is being drafted by my Department to introduce a new scrapie eradication scheme.  In the pig sector, an Aujeszky's disease eradication programme covering a five year period is due to commence shortly.  My Department is also monitoring the PRRS status of pigs slaughtered at meat plants adjacent to the Border in order to safeguard our disease-free status.</P>
      <P>In general the importation of cattle, sheep and pigs is governed by EU rules.  However, in September 1995, the major farming, veterinary and breeding organisations, under the auspices of the RDS, published a code of practice on the safer importation of cattle, sheep and goats.  In the case of pigs, a similar code of practice is operated by the National Pig Health Council.  I have urged that any person importing livestock should follow closely the recommendations set out in these codes of practice to ensure that risks posed by these imports are minimised.</P>

      <P>An Bord Bia has statutory responsibility for promoting, assisting and developing the marketing of Irish food and drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bord Bia Market Development Strategy 1995-99 is the framework for the delivery of a comprehensive market development programme for Irish food and drink covering both the Irish and export markets.  This market development strategy is implemented in detail through its annual programmes.  These programmes take account of ongoing developments in the food industry and encompass all aspects of food promotion <Col N="174" /> and market development, with appropriate focus on target markets and market segments.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia engages in a wide range of activities both in the market place and with producers and exporters.  Its buyer contact programme includes trade fairs and exhibitions, food missions, trade promotions, buyer liaison and buyer visits.  Its food promotion programme, which is designed to position the Irish food industry as a competitive and innovative supplier of high quality foods and ingredients includes direct marketing, image building public relations, trade advertising, co-ordination of Irish weeks, provision of point of sale materials and in-store sampling and consumer information services.</P>
    <P>In addition to its ongoing promotional and marketing development activities for Irish food in export markets, in 1997 Bord Bia has carried out an extensive programme of research in the major European markets.  The purpose of this research was to assess the environment for direct consumer promotion of Irish beef and to obtain an up-to-date profile of the consumer in these markets and of their perception and expectations. Arising from its assessment of this market research Bord Bia has decided to institute a pilot consumer promotional campaign in Italy in November 1997.  This pilot project will represent an important test to determine how consumer, as opposed to trade, promotion will operate in the particular environment of a continental market. From this it should be possible to extrapolate the financial and logistical requirements of ongoing consumer promotion in this market with the possibility of repeating it in other European markets.</P>

      <P>A levy of 1 per cent was imposed on certain insurance premiums in 1982.  This levy is not confined to motor insurance premiums.  It is imposed on almost all non-life insurance premiums, the exceptions being reinsurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.  The levy was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to state what the annual or total yield from motor insurance premiums has been because the insurance companies, when paying the levy, do not distinguish between the different categories of insurance to which the levy applies.  However, the total yield from the non-life insurance levy since 1982 is as follows:</P>

There was, in any event, no unpaid taxes at that time. <Col N="177" /> The taxpayer's case was reviewed some months ago in the normal course, and it was noted that no return has been submitted for the year 1993-94, and accordingly it was unclear whether there had been any liability for tax in the year of his death.  An estimate was raised for the purpose of obtaining the necessary information. This estimate of liability was communicated to the person in question, who became the taxpayer's personal representative after his death, through a solicitor, who is her last recorded agent in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners wrote to the solicitor on 26 September 1997.  The person in question responded by letter to the Collector-General dated 30 September, setting out the facts of the case.  In view of the circumstances outlined in that letter and in the Deputy's question, the Revenue Commissioners are now satisfied that there is no outstanding income tax liability relating to the late taxpayer, and their records have been adjusted accordingly.  The person in question will receive a notice in due course that liability has been revised to &ldquo;nil&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The designation of areas for urban renewal purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Environment and Local Government.  I have not received any proposals to include Tipperary town in the urban renewal scheme.  I did receive a request to meet a deputation from Tipperary SR County Council to discuss the creation of enterprise areas in County Tipperary.  You may be aware that enterprise areas are currently being reviewed in the European Commission.  With regard to the excel project, I understand that the issue is primarily a matter for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>In February 1997, the European Parliament and Council adopted Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients and my Department is the competent authority in Ireland for its implementation.  Foods and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia,</i> within the scope of the regulation, which came into effect in all member states in mid-May of this year.  The regulation provides that novel foods and novel foods ingredients must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved-authorised before being placed on the European market.  Thus the regulation, which is an Internal Market measure, ensures that common rules and procedures in relation to novel foods and ingredients will apply across all member states of the European Union. These controls provide protection to consumers and I will be keeping the matter under continuing review to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected.</P>
      <P>The regulation also contains provisions for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients and in response to any concerns about consumer information I would like to refer the Deputies to Article 8 of the regulation.  Essentially, this states that there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property (e.g. composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food) which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. These labelling requirements for novel foods are in addition to the general food labelling provisions which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise Trade, and Employment.</P>
      <P>To ensure a coherent approach, the European Commission is at present considering the labelling and consumer information aspects of the various pieces of EU legislation on the use of genetically modified organisms.  I wish to assure the House that in any discussions with member states I will press for genetically modified foods to be so labelled to ensure the highest degree of consumer information.  The question of a formal information campaign on this subject is something which I will consider in the context of EU developments.</P>

Approval has been given to the Western Health Board for the appointment of a cytoscreener and I understand from the health board that an appointment will be made as soon as possible.  In addition, my Department has given approval to the Western Health Board to appoint a temporary cytoscreener to clear the backlog and reduce the delay in providing results.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the reply given by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Tom Moffatt in response to a written question from Deputy Sargent <Col N="181" /> on 30 September where it was outlined that a person in receipt of a nursing home subvention is entitled to items which are covered by the subvention, including incontinence wear, aids and applicances.  Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 provides that a registered proprietor of a nursing home shall not seek any additional payment from a subvented patient for any service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in nursing homes.  Among the services which are considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home, and common practice in most nursing homes, are incontinence wear and bedding, laundry services and aids and applicances necessary to assist a dependent person with the activities of daily living.  The position in respect of the supply of dressings, including vaseline gauze and strappings, to patients in receipt of subvention is being investigated and I will communicate with the Deputy, and Deputy Sargent when the position is clarified.</P>
    <P>The position regarding suppositories and enemas is that certain products which require a doctor's prescription are available to patients free of charge on the GMS.  Generally these treatments are available without a prescription on an over-the-counter basis and, as such, are not available on the GMS scheme.</P>

      <P>I have received representations on behalf of the Irish Migraine Association regarding the need for a headache and migraine clinic.  I understand that the association has been in communication with Beaumont Hospital on the matter.  However, to date I have received no proposals from the hospital in this regard.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> On receipt of such proposals, they will fall to be considered within the context of the hospital's priorities and the many competing demands for resources within the acute health sector.</P>

      <P>The provision of ambulance services in Arklow, County Wicklow is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  However, I have been advised by the board that it identified the need to develop an ambulance base at Arklow and a new base was completed in January 1997 at a cost of £300,000.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the completion of this project the board entered into discussions with staff representatives in mid 1996 with the objective of ensuring a smooth transfer of the staff involved to the new base.  The matter was the subject of consideration by the Labour Relations Commission in June 1997 and by the Labour Court in September 1997.  The current position is that the Labour Court has now issued its recommendations, the Eastern Health Board fully accepts these and is awaiting a response from the staff representatives.</P>

      <P>The provision of services, including respite care facilities, is a matter for the relevant health board. The Eastern Health Board currently provide 30 respite places in the Wicklow area for the elderly and persons with physical and mental handicap.</P>
      <P>In 1997 approximately £3 million additional funding was provided to the Eastern Health Board to increase the level of day and residential-respite places for people with a mental handicap in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, additional funding has also been made available to the Eastern Health oard to strengthen home and community support, including respite care services, for older people and their families.</P>
      <P>The report of Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future,</i> which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of this service.  The process of implementing this report is currently under way and, as a first step, the boards are in the process of putting in place co-ordinating committees to examine and prioritise the development of services at local level.</P>

      <P>This scheme formed part of the Gaeltacht Area Cohesion application sent to the European Commission in September 1995, on which a decision has not been given.  However, following discussions with the Commission a separate Cohesion application in respect of the Gweedore scheme will be submitted <Col N="192" /> shortly by my Department.  Pending a decision by the Commission on the proposed application, I cannot say when it may be possible to advance this scheme.</P>

      <P>The need to revise local electoral areas is being examined in the light of the recently published population figures for the 1996 census.  Before deciding to make an order revising local electoral areas, the Minister is required under section 32 (2) of the Local Government Act, 1991, amended by the Local Government Act, 1994, to request a boundary committee, established under section 28 of the 1991 Act, to prepare a report and to have regard to it before deciding whether to make the order. If a revision is found to be necessary, the question of whether the local elections would need to be postponed will be considered in the context of the likely timescale for the review.</P>

      <P>The Public Art Research Project report was published on 24 June 1997.  The aim of the project was to facilitate the more effective promotion of art in the public sector by developing a strategy which furthers the commissioning of art in a variety of sectors, in particular by public authorities.  The project specifically focused on the per cent for art schemes administered by the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works, and examined them in the context of contemporary visual arts practice generally.  The cost of the report, including the services of consultants was £38,600.  This was jointly funded by the members of the steering group overseeing the project.  The recommendations that are specifically relevant to my Department have been implemented.  Implementation of other recommendations that are relevant to more than one Department will be the responsibility of an inter-departmental public art co-ordination group.  This group will be led by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that the transportation of timber from forests is a contributory factor in damage caused to non-national roads.  Draft guidelines recently published by my Department on forestry development refer to the question and recommend that planning authorities should take account of these impacts when determining their strategy for the provision and improvement of roads.  As roads are generally multi-purpose and support a wide range of economic activities, including forestry, much of the State grants provision for non-national roads benefits the forestry sector.  Such payments to county councils amounted to £115.877 million in 1995 and £134.503 million in 1996.  Grant allocations in 1997 amount to £165 million.</P>
      <P>Forestry is one of the sectors for which provision is made under the EU co-financed scheme of specific improvement grants for non-national roads.  Grants totalling £2,573,343 and £2,174,700 were paid to county councils for projects of relevance to the forestry sector in 1995 and 1996 respectively, and the 1997 allocation to such projects under this scheme is £3,095,450.</P>

      <P>Deserted wife's allowance (DWA) is only payable to those women over 40 years of age with no child dependants who were deserted by their husbands.  Persons in receipt of this allowance are not entitled to participate in community employment (CE) as participation is restricted to the unemployed and lone parents with child dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women with child dependants deserted by their husbands could claim either deserted wife's benefit (DWB) or, since January of this year, one-parent family payment (OFP).  Any lone parent in receipt of OFP is eligible to participate in community employment and a DWB recipient may transfer to OFP in order to participate.  In assessing a person's means to determine the rate <Col N="197" /> of OFP payable, the first £6,000 of the person's earnings &mdash; including earnings from community employment &mdash; are disregarded.</P>
    <P>For example, a lone parent with one child participating in community employment and with no other income would receive £96.95 from his-her community employment which would still entitle him-her to maximum rate one-parent family payment of £82.70 a week.  However, income tax is payable on the combined community employment one-parent family payment income.  A lone parent participating in community employment will also retain any secondary benefits she or he might already be receiving such as rent allowance, fuel allowance, Christmas bonus etc.</P>
    <P>I should add that with the introduction of the one-parent family payment in January this year, the concept of desertion has been removed from the social welfare code as title to OFP is not dependent on how the situation of lone parent-hood came about.  As a result, the DWA and DWB payments were discontinued from January; however existing recipients retain their entitlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  Estimated total expenditure on the scheme this year is put at £36.4 million.  At the end of last August there was a total of 9,753 carer's allowances in payment.</P>
      <P>The present scheme does not distinguish between medium-care or high-care special needs but is applied to all carers who satisfy the above conditions.  If such were the case, separate categories would have to be devised to assess the individual requirements of each applicant.</P>
      <P>The cost of introducing an additional payment to all full-time carers of £20 per week, to take account of the extra costs involved in caring, would involve additional expenditure of £10 million while an additional weekly allowance of £50 would entail additional costs of almost £25 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its programme &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers <Col N="198" /> can get the benefit; and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  In line with these commitments, I will be considering the potential for the further development of the carer's allowance scheme in an overall review of provisions for carers which is being carried out in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the reason thousands of workers aged 25 and 26 years, who, in spite of having permanent jobs for more than four years, should not be able to avail of dental benefits from his Department due to the fact that, through attendance at school and college, they are unable to have the required 260 reckonable contributions; and the steps, if any, he will take to eliminate this anomaly.</Quest>

      <P>An underlying principle of social insurance schemes is that, to establish entitlement to benefit, persons must have been insurably employed and paid appropriate rates of PRSI for a specified period.  The general requirement in the case of treatment benefits is a minimum of 260 weeks paid contributions.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the difficulties that young people would have in meeting these insurance conditions, the paid contributions requirement for those under 25 years of age was reduced in July 1992 to 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> Any further change in the insurance conditions for receipt of treatment benefits would have financial implications and would be a matter for consideration within the constraints of available resources.</P>

      <P>: Cataloguing in the National Library is an ongoing task and there are levels of cataloguing appropriate to each type of manuscript.  The National Library considers that there are 350 collections of papers which are not processed to an adequate standard, nearly all of which are estate papers.  There are preliminary lists available of 50 of these collections, but it is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of individual items that the collections represent. It can be stated that 750,000 items have been appropriately catalogued.  This has involved the making of 61,000 individual catalogue entries. In the past year, in order to improve access by users, new catalogue entries are being made available on the library's online public access catalogue.</P>

      <P>: At present, Teilifís na Gaeilge operates as an RTÉ service under the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 to 1993.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, RTÉ was given the responsibility by Government of constructing the technical infrastructure necessary for the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate national service and, pending the establishment of separate legal structures for Teilifís na Gaeilge, of assuming responsibility for staff, programmes and operations of the service.  Accordingly the performance of Teilifís na Gaeilge is a matter for the RTÉ Authority on the advice of Comhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>In the context of a range of courtesy meetings with the various bodies under the aegis of my Department, I met the management and staff of Teilifís na Gaeilge in Baile na hAbhann in July last.</P>
      <P>Regarding the reception of Teilifís na Gaeilge, RTÉ informs me that Teilifís na Gaeilge is available to more than 95 per cent of the population on the UHF band.  RTÉ estimates that between 74 per cent and 81 per cent of the population can receive that service using their existing receive equipment and that 21 per cent to 24 per cent require a new UHF aerial to receive service.</P>
      <P>RTÉ further state that they are implementing an ongoing coverage improvement plan for Teilifís na Gaeilge during 1997 and that it operates a Call Save number, which is frequently advertised in the media, to advise viewers on how to tune into Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>: I am informed by the Garda authorities that this problem is receiving ongoing attention.  Regular meetings are held between the Garda and Iarnród Éireann to review incidences of stone throwing and to decide on appropriate action.  Since 1 January 1997, there have been, on average, one or two such attacks each month.  The Garda has regular railway protection patrols and a number of arrests have been made.  As part of the Garda school programme, the Garda is raising the issue in local schools in order to highlight the dangers of this activity.</P>

      <P>: The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas.  They have informed me that County Wicklow is policed by three Garda divisions.  The southern portion of the county is policed by gardaí from the Wexford division, the western portion is policed by gardaí from the Carlow-Kildare Garda division and the remainder of the county is policed by the DMA Eastern division.</P>
      <P>However, they have expressed concern, and I share that concern, about providing the type of detailed information sought by the Deputy on grounds of security and in the interests of crime prevention generally.  I propose, therefore, to provide the Deputy with the information on a divisional basis for the period 31 December 1988 to 31 August 1997.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he intends taking to provide additional staff in the Dublin Circuit Court office to enable judgment papers to be registered speedily and to address current difficulties in this area; the number of judgments received which currently await registration in the Dublin Circuit Court office; and his views on whether the current situation is undermining the credibility of our legal system and facilitating debtors who wish to evade their financial obligations.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am concerned that there should be any delay in the processing of these cases and I had already arranged that as many staff as are available to do so would work overtime in the judgments section to assist in clearing the backlog.  In addition, in early September, I arranged that an additional head of staff be deployed in the judgments section.  The situation there will be monitored on an ongoing basis and the current staff complement will, as far as possible, be maintained until the arrears are cleared.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there are approximately 800 judgment files awaiting attention and over 100 of these cases are the subject of queries to the solicitors who submitted them.</P>
      <P>These delays are a direct result of measures introduced last year to eliminate delays in the hearing of civil cases.  These measures, which included the introduction of a case management system and the appointment of additional judges, have eliminated the delays in having civil cases listed but have resulted in an increase in the number of judgments to be processed.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that there is currently a delay of seven months in having judgments processed in the Dublin Circuit Court office compared with delays of between nine and 11 months in March of this year.</P>
      <P>I understand that in any case where a litigant is experiencing exceptional difficulties due to a delay in having a judgment processed the County Registrar will, on receipt of representations from the relevant solicitor, endeavour to expedite the processing of the judgment in that case.</P>

      <P>: A deed of trust is executed in respect of any grant amounting to £40,000 or more in value.  The deed creates a charge up to the value of the grant paid.  The charge comes into effect in the event that the grant aided facility ceases to be used for the sporting, recreational or community purposes of the grantees within 35 years of the payment of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation and execution of the deed of trust can be a lengthy process.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The steering committee, established under the chairmanship of the chairman of the Higher Education Authority, finalised and submitted its report about the most cost-effective way of providing 1,000 additional software graduates and 750 technicians annually, in late June 1997.</P>
      <P>Following its advertisement seeking proposals from eligible institutions, the steering committee engaged in a range of consultations both with industry and the institutions involved.  The committee recommended a capital investment of some £50 million, over the period 1997-2000, in this regard.  The committee further recommended that the Higher Education Authority and my Department be empowered to negotiate with the institutions, so as to maximise the output of graduates within this capital investment framework. The committee also recognised the need for current investment to facilitate the provision of these computer software graduates and engineering technicians.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of the steering committee's report, the Government considered the need for capital investment to meet the emerging and critical skills demands in the high technology sector. As the Deputy will be aware, an immediate capital investment of additional investment next year is under consideration in the context of the 1998 estimates.  In the light of this decision, my Department and the Higher Education Authority engaged in discussions with the institutions, following which an additional 650 places in software engineering and 500 places in engineering technician programmes have been approved for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>I have also established a joint education industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for the high-technology sector.  The task force is to produce an action plan to address the anticipated needs in the area and to ensure an improved supply of technicians in the short to medium term.  I expect the task force to report to me later this month with detailed targets and measures for the academic years 1997-98 to 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>On the advice of the chairman of the steering committee, I do not consider it appropriate to accede to the Deputy's request to lay the report in the Oireachtas library as the information supplied by the institutions was furnished in confidence.</P>

      <Quest>the current progress in relation to each of the recommendations of the NESF early school leavers report; and the targets, if any, which have been set for the end of the school year 1997-98.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15371/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>: There has been ongoing progress with regard to the areas of action identified in the NESF's report on early school leaving.</P>
      <P>Among the key areas focused on by NESF were the need for early educational intervention and the support of children from disadvantaged areas.  In this connection I recently announced my intention of setting up a National Forum of Early Childhood Education.  This consultative process will allow all interested bodies in this field to put forward proposals aimed at co-ordinating and resourcing services so as to ensure equal access and opportunity for all children of pre-school age. The output from the forum will inform my policy decisions in relation to the development of the Early Start Pre-school Pilot Project.</P>
      <P>The breaking the cycle pilot scheme represents an important component in the ovarall effort to combat educational disadvantage.  The effectiveness of this scheme as a mechanism for combatting disadvantage is being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre on an ongoing basis.  An interim report is expected from the Educational Research Centre by December 1997. The findings of this report will make a valuable contribution to the further development of responses in this area.</P>
      <P>With regard to education services for traveller children, an additional five teacher posts have been allocated to the visiting teacher service for travellers for the current school year.  In addition, an internal departmental committee has been established to co-ordinate the delivery of education services to travellers.</P>
      <P>The NESF report sets out clearly the link between poor education performance and youth unemployment.  With a view to retaining pupils in the education system, and thereby improving education performance, it is necessary to cater for a varying range of aptitudes and abilities.  To this end, the restructuring of the curriculum at second level is continuing.  Included in the restructuring are the revision of syllabuses and the expansion of innovative programmes such as the junior certificate elementary programme, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme.  A review of the primary curriculum has been under way for some time and is nearing completion.</P>
      <P>In response to the NESF report, and as part of the mid-term review of the Structural Funds, new initiatives have been agreed for implementation in 1998 and 1999 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) £19.733 million will be provided for a minimum of 1,000 additional places for early school leavers in the Youthreach and traveller training programmes.  Arrangements are under <Col N="224" /> way to establish 750 Youthreach places and 250 traveller places with a view to having them operational at the beginning of 1998.</P>
    <P>(b) Some £0.987 million will be provided for the strengthening of counselling, guidance and psychological services for participants on these programmes.  A task force is being established to define and quantify needs in this area in collaboration with the National Centre for Guidance in Education and in FÁS, with a view to implementation in early 1998.</P>
    <P>(c) Some £1.97 million will be provided for bridging and progression options for early school leavers through the FÁS training system, and 725 places within the FÁS system will be re-deployed to progression options for Youthreach and Traveller trainees.</P>
    <P>(d) Some £2.96 million will be provided over 1998 and 1999 for a new initiative focused on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas which test models for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for young people aged 8-15 at risk of early school leaving.  A working group has been established to progress the initiative, with a view to implementation at the beginning of 1998.</P>
    <P>In the area of in-service education, substantial support services and a large number of inservice courses are currently being provided for teachers/tutors engaged in programmes and measures concerned in the NESF report.</P>
    <P>The NESF report placed particular emphasis on the area of second-chance education.  In this connection, funding for adult education programmes and, in particular, literacy programmes is being increased.  Furthermore, a Green Paper is being prepared which will give impetus to the process of rationalisation of adult education provision and the formulation of national policy for the future.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations of the NESF report are being kept under review and will continue to be pursued in the context of the Estimates provision of the Department.</P>

      <P>I understand from Carlow Regional Technical College that the college authorities did not advise individual students returning to the college of the increased charge.

      <P>: I take it the Deputy's question relates to the information contained in the Appropriation Account for 1996 in relation to primary school buildings.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of successive Ministers for Education to approve primary school building projects at the pre-planning stage based on estimated costs, and in the knowledge that estimates would change as planning work was undertaken. This policy was considered prudent given the significant backlog of primary schools needing major capital works, and the costs associated with bringing the projects through the planning stages before seeking ministerial approval.  The clear danger with this latter course of action is that too much of the budget would be spent on planning costs at the expense of providing much-needed accommodation.</P>
      <P>I have noted the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General and will be looking at ways of effecting improvements to the system.</P>

      <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme</P>

Arts education, which encompasses visual arts, music, drama, dance and literature, will form a key element in the revised curriculum which will be implemented in primary schools in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>At second level greater emphasis is being placed on cultural and artistic activities in various curricular programmes.  At junior certificate level the NCCA is developing short courses in dance and drama.  The transition year programme enables schools to develop specific cultural and artistic programmes to meet their own local needs.  At leaving certificate level modular programmes continue to be developed in arts education for the new leaving certificate applied programme. The art syllabus for leaving certificate is being revised.</P>
      <P>At both primary and second levels, cultural activities are being emphasised in the various syllabi for Irish, History and Geography.  Consultations with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands form an important part of my consideration of these developments.</P>

      <Quest>when he will allocate the remedial teacher on an ex-quota basis to Coláiste Mhuire secondary school, Mullingar, County Westmeath in view of the fact that this school currently has a pupil population of 663, and there are a number of pupils who would benefit from such an appointment.</Quest>

      <P>: I am very conscious of the need to improve the remedial teacher service in our secondary schools.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that there are many competing demands for increased funding in all sectors of education.  These demands are considered within the overall budgetary constraints and I can assure the Deputy that the position of this school will be kept under review and will be considered when next it is possible to allocate additional ex-quota remedial posts.</P>
