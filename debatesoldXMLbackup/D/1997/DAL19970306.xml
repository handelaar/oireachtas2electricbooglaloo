      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the final Book of Estimates for 1997 be published?  In view of the commitment given by Taoiseach some weeks ago, will the nurses' pay element be reflected in cuts in other Government Departments?  Will the cut that is causing so much concern among officials in the Department of Social Welfare, which will reduce by half the students summer jobs scheme, be among them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have both said the Book of Estimates will reflect departmental cuts to cover the nurses' pay.  There is concern in the Department of Social Welfare that the Minister is being asked to cut by 15 per cent the students summer jobs scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Item 2 on the Order Paper refers to the Freedom of Information Bill.  Given the cross-party support for <i>glasnost</i> with regard to information held by the State which should be available to the citizen and public representatives, is the Taoiseach not embarrassed that his Government is responsible for the Dáil being misled daily as a result of the refusal of Ministers to answer questions?  They refuse to give information legitimately sought by Members of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies asking questions are thwarted and the Dáil is misled every day.  I was misled yesterday by the Minister for Justice.  She refused to give information which I legitimately sought with regard to how many prosecutions had collapsed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I referred to the lack of any fundamental thinking on reform of the social welfare system.  The Minister said that the provisions in the Social Welfare Acts and this Bill have transformed the social welfare system as we know it.  He invited the House to pass judgment on his performance not only in terms of this Bill but over the past three years.  When Deputy De Rossa was appointed Minister for Social Welfare people had high expectations that he would transform the social welfare system, having regard to the party of which he is a member.  However, this transformation has not taken place and, in line with the budgets introduced by the Government, the Bill proposes a serious of incremental changes which are designed to appease interest groups but which have no underlying coherent philosophy or direction. This policy has characterised the Government's approach to the economy and I am not surprised it has adopted the same policy in the administration of the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>Having regard to our economic position and the anticipated demographic trends during the coming decade, fundamental questions arise about the social security system.  We have enjoyed a period of rapid economic growth but ESRI studies suggest that long-term unemployment will continue to be a persistent social problem.  This will lead to a continued high demand for unemployment payments, notwithstanding rapid economic growth.  In this context, radical changes are required.  Initiatives such as the family income supplement and the back to work allowance scheme have been introduced but much work still remains to be done.  There is no evidence of any fundamental rethinking by the Minister in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the years leading up to 2031 there will be a continued increase in the number of people in receipt of old age pension.  The lack of provision made by the Minister for the social insurance fund is disquieting in view of the increased liability on the State to pay old age pensions in the long-term.  Entitlement to contributory pensions has been increased due to the extension of PRSI to self-employed persons.  In a few decades there will be a universal entitlement <Col N="10" /> to old age pension and the funding of this will put an enormous burden on the State.</P>
    <P>Similar concerns have been expressed about certain pay arrangements for the public sector agreed by the Government and their implications for the public service pensions bill.  However, the only ball on which the Government seems to have its eye is the general election.  The Minister has displayed a lack of fundamental thinking on this serious question during his time in office.</P>
    <P>Another issue of considerable importance in the evolution of the social security system is the integration of the tax and social welfare systems. Reports on this issue have been published and there has also been a great deal of discussion on it.  Without making a commitment in regard to basic income, a guaranteed minimum income or negative income tax, there is a need to approximate the tax and social welfare systems as far as possible.  One obvious step in this area which should have been taken during an election year is the harmonisation of the years of payment under the tax and social welfare systems.  The Minister did not avail of the opportunity to do this in the Bill and I wonder if it will be done in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that no consideration was given in the budget or the Bill to the alignment of basic social welfare payments with general tax allowances.  If the public had been invited to submit their views on desirable proposals for the budget the Minister would have received many representations urging him to use the additional money available to increase basic tax allowances and to harmonise the tax and social welfare systems.  The Government lost the opportunity to do this and the budgetary process represents more an Arab bazaar than coherent policy. The incremental improvements in tax benefits for various groups provided in the budget have no underlying direction or philosophy. This policy has been carried through into the Social Welfare Bill which provided the Government with a marvellous opportunity to ensure some alignment between basic social welfare payments and general tax allowances.</P>
    <P>That, too, is a disappointment and a failure by this Minister who claims to have effected a complete transformation of the social security system.  He has not made any fundamental change to the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises when one considers the integration of tax and social welfare is child benefit payments.  Substantial improvements in these payments were made in recent years, but further increases would serve to emphasise the child centred nature of social welfare support. That is important because there is much discussion in the media about the desirability or otherwise of payments to particular categories of persons.  We must make it clear that these moneys are being targeted at children.</P>
    <P>If the tax and social welfare systems are to be integrated, the relationship between a possible <Col N="11" /> tax allowance for children and child benefit must be examined.  The Minister has avoided that issue. I realise there are political pitfalls involved and that it is not a good idea to be courageous in an election year or engage in fundamental thinking, but in introducing this measure the Minister advanced the bold claim that he has effected a transformation of the system in the past three years.  He has not, and that guff must be got out of the way well in advance of the general election.</P>
    <P>A further matter in relation to the social welfare system is whether taxpayers receive value for money.  I am referring to the incidence and extent of fraud perpetrated on taxpayers by those who do not qualify under the legislation making claims.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, there is enormous public concern about this issue. Deputies constantly receive representations about alleged abuse of the system.  Abuse is inevitable in any system, and in his contribution the Minister of State referred to discussions he had with ISME on attempts to tackle problems relating to the black economy, but there is substantial public disquiet about the incidence of abuse.  That public disquiet reflects not only on the social welfare system but on the entire political system.  It is one of the factors that has contributed to the considerable loss of public confidence in the political system.  To put it bluntly, people who work hard and keep the rules feel discriminated against.  That is the general perception. I note from the Minister of State's contribution he does not have any specific legislative proposals to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The issue of PRSI arises under this Bill because it provides the statutory foundation for the collection of social insurance contributions in any particular year.  For many years, taxpayers did not really understand or accept the theoretical basis of PRSI as advanced by successive Ministers for Social Welfare.  As far as they are concerned it is another form of taxation.  Because of the Government's refusal to reduce the top rate of income tax, we now have a situation where more than half of certain taxpayers' income is taxed at an early stage.  That has caused enormous disquiet over a number of years, yet the Minister has not seen fit to address it in the budget.</P>
    <P>Given the continued Exchequer commitment to pensions, it will be necessary to ensure adequate and proper funds are collected through some form of social security tax in the future.  The Minister has not brought forward any real proposals to effect fundamental reform in social security tax arrangements, despite the fact that commentators and commissions over many years have indicated that the current arrangements are unsatisfactory, operate as a disincentive to creating employment and bear hardest on the weaker and poorer sections of the community. There has been some tinkering around in particular budgets but no fundamental change.  The suggestion of some sort of transformation in the social welfare system is entirely fallacious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> I would like to hear the Minister's view on the question of a movement towards individuated payments.  I welcome the introduction by the Minister of certain changes in the dependency rules relating to adult dependants.  A clear suggestion in that measure is that there will be a movement towards individuated payments over a period of time.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the social welfare system historically, it is clear that it has operated to inhibit the greater participation of married women in the workforce.  The rules in the current social welfare code relating to that area will have to be reviewed, and I am glad the Minister has taken a step in that direction.  I agree this is an aspect of his brief where transformation will take a substantial period of time &mdash; it will not be done overnight.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in the payments for multiple births.  The Minister of State is aware that the parent of twins is discriminated against because the amount prescribed for multiple births is in excess of that prescribed for twins.  The Minister for Social Welfare, when in Opposition, viewed this as a justifiable case for reform, but he has opted not to remove this anomaly from the social welfare system.  I urge him, even at this late stage, to consider whether the special payment for multiple births should be extended to include twins so that this differentiation can be equalised. The current arrangements are discriminatory.  For example, a person who gave birth to triplets last year received £184 in child benefit while a person who had twins received £58.  Certain changes were introduced in the initial grant to alleviate the position of the parents of twins, but the financial differentiation seems remarkable and difficult to justify in principle.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to re-examine that issue to see if this anomaly can be eliminated from the social welfare system.  With the declining birth rate this could be done without any great loss to the Exchequer.  In the context of a declining birth rate, the birth of twins to a couple is a far more fundamental development than it might have been ten or 20 years ago.  The Minister should review these arrangements to ensure there is no inequality of treatment as between the parents of twins and the parents of triplets or greater numbers of children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I disagree with Deputy Lenihan in respect of what he said about fundamental transformations not taking place.  The current Minister and the Government have set out clear targets for transforming the system in three main areas: in encouraging people to take up employment opportunities and making it easier to do so if the opportunity arises; in focusing on the needs of children in the social welfare system; and in trying to undo the damage to the social insurance system that was done by Deputy Lenihan's colleague, Deputy McCreevy, when he was Minister <Col N="13" /> for Social Welfare for a short but very damaging time for the ministry for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The current Minister is receptive to suggestions for dealing with anomalies that Deputies come across in dealing with their constituents, and addressing them in legislation.  While addressing these anomalies may not seem very important in terms of strategic issues, it is important to the people we represent.  The Minister has done much to remove many anomalies and niggling aspects of the rules which frustrate social welfare claimants and those who represent their interests.  I compliment him on focusing on strategic issues &mdash; returning to work, the needs of children and the social insurance system &mdash; while at the same time having an eye for detail.</P>
      <P>The measures taken in the past few years to encourage people to return to the workforce, which include the back-to-work scheme, the introduction of the one parent family allowance and the changes in the tax and social welfare systems, have been most successful.  That almost 20,000 fewer people are signing on the live register compared with this time last year shows those measures are working.  My experience of dealing with constituents who have shown great interest in taking up employment schemes is borne out by the national figures.  The schemes are working, and I would encourage the Minister to extend schemes that allow people to consider job options when they arise and take them on perhaps for a trial period, to ease their way back into the workforce. Many people are doing that after a long period of unemployment.</P>
      <P>These people certainly are not social misfits as was alleged by ISME earlier this week.  I was shocked when I heard what ISME had to say about the 100,000 or so long-term unemployed people on the live register who find it difficult to get back to work.  It was not a revelation to find they existed.  The work of the National Economic and Social Forum, and reports and debates in this House going back years, have shown that there are people for whom the various measures have not worked, mainly because of the length of time they have been unemployed, their lack of skills and many other complex factors.  To label them social misfits was not alone an insult to them but to the many people in small businesses who have co-operated with the schemes the Department of Social Welfare and FÁS have introduced in recent years to encourage the unemployed back into the workforce.  It is no good telling us it is a technical term.  If I were a person on the dole for five or six years and heard an organisation which claims it should have a place at the negotiating table with the other social partners call me and others like me a social misfit, my anger would not be assuaged by being told it was only a technical term.  I call on ISME to withdraw that term of abuse and co-operate in the efforts being made by the trade union movement, by the INOU, by the Government and by the business sector generally to try to find ways of tackling this persistent problem of long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> I am particularly glad to see this year's increase in child benefit.  The payment of child benefit is most effective in ensuring the money goes to the children who need it.  It may sound sexist to say it, but studies not alone in this part of the world but in the developing world have shown that money paid directly to mothers in families is, to a much greater extent, spent on the needs of children in those families.  I would argue for a continued increase in the payment of child benefit, and it should not be brought into the tax net.  In the absence of a specific child tax allowance, paying this to all families is justified.  The increase of more than 90 per cent to the rate of the child benefit paid to people with three or more children since my party went into Government, 50 per cent of which has been paid since the current Government was formed, contrasts with the record of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats when they were in Government.  It has made a real difference to children.  In particular it has made a real difference to mothers of families who are struggling to meet the costs of education, clothes and the many other needs children have.</P>
    <P>I particularly compliment the Minister on the measures introduced to reverse the effect of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts on unemployment benefit claimants who may have casual, seasonal or part-time employment.  This is a very large element of the workforce.  Studies of the workforce show that part-time and casual employment is an increasing feature of working life.  Those people continue to pay into the social welfare system but, under the measures introduced by Deputy McCreevy in 1992, many of their entitlements to benefit were decimated.  We have been working for years to reverse those cuts.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister listened to the case which those of us representing midland counties made on behalf of seasonal workers, particularly in Bord na Móna.  We made their case to Deputy Woods when he was Minister, but it was the present Minister who brought in the changes necessary to reverse for that category of worker the disincentives to work that had resulted from Deputy McCreevy's measures.  Similarly, this year, the changes in the requalification conditions for unemployment benefit will make a significant difference to up to 10,000 workers.  The contributions paid after the sixth months unemployment by those who have part-time or casual employment and who are paying the full rate of social insurance contribution will start the clock running again for their future entitlement.  A particular group of workers had been detrimentally affected and, on their behalf, I thank the Minister for the changes he has made.  I refer to the part-time fire-fighters in the local authority service who were in a very difficult position as a result of the changes made in 1992.  They were paying a full stamp, but when their benefit ran out they had to go back on unemployment assistance, go through a difficult means assessment and start clocking up 13 fresh contributions even though they had continued to pay contributions while <Col N="15" /> signing on.  They will now be able to regain their entitlement to unemployment benefit and that is very welcome among that category of workers.  In that category, there are still a few on unemployment assistance who do not qualify for benefit.  In assessing their means for the purpose of unemployment assistance, the training and retainer allowances paid to them should be disregarded. They are not payments for work; they have to be trained for their job, and the element of training is increasingly complex, given the type of work fire services do nowadays, and they are prevented from taking up other employment because they have to be available for duty.  I would ask that those two services be taken into account in the calculation of means for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the reckoning of capital means for social welfare payments.  The amount of savings or investment to be disregarded has been greatly increased, from £2,900 to £6,000.  That will apply to old age non-contributory pension, carer's allowance, pre-retirement allowance and widow's or widower's non-contributory pension.  In the case of old age pensioners in particular who put aside a small amount of money for the rainy day, or in some cases for their funerals, that money was taken into account in assessment for social welfare purposes. I welcome the increase in the amount to be disregarded and ask that it be index linked in line with cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in regard to dependent spouses, as they were known to date.  That title is very insulting, particularly to women.  The change in terminology to qualified adults, together with the increase in the amount &mdash; from £60 to £90 per week &mdash; which may be earned before the qualified adult allowance is withdrawn from one's partner, was brought to the attention of the Minister last autumn by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, national women's councils and women's groups throughout the country.  I would ask the Minister to consider changing other areas of the social welfare code where women are discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on extending maternity benefit and adoptive benefit to self-employed people.  The small business sector is the fastest growing sector in the economy and, as a member of an enterprise board in my county, I am aware that the promoters of many of those businesses are women.  It is welcome that women who pay self-employed social insurance contributions will be entitled to maternity and adoptive benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in family income supplement, a scheme that has been improved tremendously in recent years.  The disregard of PRSI and levies in the calculation of pay for FIS purposes is a welcome move towards disregarding all deductions.  The increase in the threshold will mean that a greater number of people will be <Col N="16" /> entitled to payment and those already claiming will receive measurable increases this year.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on introducing the disability allowance, one of the major successes of the Department in recent years.  Claimants with whom I have had contact are very happy with the service they receive from the Department.  Previously they had to apply to the health board for disabled person's maintenance allowance and it took months on end for their claims to be processed.  Work on their application was carried out by a clerical officer in the health board, the medical officer, the community welfare officer and, finally, the administration.  I dealt with cases which took more than 12 months to complete.  The service provided by the Department is extremely swift and client-friendly, and people find the response speedy, effective and sympathetic.  Now that the Department is dealing with applications, Deputies may put down parliamentary questions on the issue, which may be of assistance in having claims dealt with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the power granted to the Minister to be more flexible in terms of the regulations governing disability allowance.  I also welcome the introduction of sickness allowance.  As with those on disability allowance, the sick-no-benefit people &mdash; an unacceptable title &mdash; will also apply to the Department of Social Welfare for sickness allowance if they are not fit enough to sign on for unemployment assistance.  I am confident the level of service provided to those on disability allowance will be extended to people claiming sickness allowance.  I wish the Minister success in the implementation of that measure.</P>
    <P>One issue that is of concern to all of us is the anomaly in the payment of child dependant allowance to short-term social welfare claimants. The changes for those on unemployment assistance with child dependants in education are welcome. It is unacceptable, however, that people who have contributed to the social insurance system, which entitles them to unemployment benefit, are treated differently.  Disability benefit, which may be claimed for years, is classified as a short-term benefit.  I am at present dealing with the case of a man who has been on disability benefit for 12 years.  He is certainly not a short-term claimant, yet when his children reach the age of 18 payment is stopped.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the transition year and the extension of the post-primary cycle to six years, many students reach 18 years before they leave secondary school, but parents of those students do not qualify for child dependant allowance. A case was recently brought to my attention of a father who has lost payment of child dependant allowance for his son who will sit his leaving certificate this year.  When his son leaves secondary school, however, the allowance will again be payable because the son will be unable to sign for unemployment assistance for three months.  The Minister should seriously consider that anomaly which is deserving of urgent attention.  The cost <Col N="17" /> factor would not be exorbitant because the number of people involved is not great.</P>
    <P>One of the principal features of the Bill is the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pension for people who do not have a full social insurance record for pension purposes.  This is a hoary old chestnut concerning people who left work under a redundancy scheme, those who may have worked in the 1950s or 1960s and then went into self-employment or small farmers who may have worked in the past with the Office of Public Works, Bord na Móna, the county council or other organisations.  The stamps those people had paid in their previous employment were not taken into account for pension purposes.  I made representations on behalf of a number of people in that position and the Minister informed me that most of those people will now qualify for a pension at either the 50 or the 75 per cent rate.  I would like the Minister to confirm that for people paying the self-employed rate who do not have full contributions by the time they reach 66 years, contributions from other employment in their working careers will be taken into account for <i>pro rata</i> pension.  Constituents often ask us what is the use of paying a stamp.  The changes in this area recognise the importance of a social insurance record and ensure people can draw benefits later in life.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about the 1 per cent reduction in PRSI and how it squares with the integrity of the social insurance scheme.  It is certainly justified as a once off measure because many low income earners, who are exempt from paying income tax, will not benefit from the reduction in the basic rate of income tax.  I welcome the reduction in PRSI because those at the lowest end of the earnings net will benefit, but any future reductions should be consolidated and maintained within the income tax code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill merely inserts in legislation the measures introduced in the budget.  During the budget debate we heard many positive speeches about the wonderful transformation in society.  The Bill is all hype because, while it contains some worthwhile measures, very few people will benefit from its provisions.  When in Opposition some members of the Government claimed they would change the world when they got into Government, but after three budgets nothing much has changed.  There have been a few percentage increases in some areas, but society has not been fundamentally restructured.  In the past, because of a lack of resources, budgets and social welfare Bills could only try to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, but when the economy is booming people should benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main yardsticks by which a society can be judged is its treatment of the elderly.  It is pointless to talk about a booming economy if we do not pass on a fair share of the fruits of that boom to the less privileged and the elderly who have contributed to its development.  They are not getting their fair share.  If we can believe our <Col N="18" /> national income figures, we have all been doing well in recent years.  However, while the Minister may claim the £3 increase to the elderly is well above the rate of inflation, that is not a proper yardstick with which to measure their income.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the operation of the social insurance fund.  I accept some employers and employees view PRSI as a form of income tax, but the social welfare fund is being squeezed between the right and the left.  In fighting his corner and defending the social welfare increases in the budget, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, outlined the tax and social insurance contributions in a number of other countries and, while our personal income tax rates are high relative to other EU countries, our social insurance contributions are very low.  He made all the right points, but they were not included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The social insurance scheme is being diluted. The PRSI system was introduced some years ago as an insurance fund into which people can pay to claim benefit when sick or unemployed. However, we do not respect the dignity of those who pay into the fund.  When they make a claim they are seen as sponging on the system.  We do not treat those who have paid into the fund all their lives differently from those on assistance. Perhaps those two groups of people should be dealt with by different Departments.  If I pay into an income continuance scheme and am out of work because of illness, nobody would suggest that in drawing down my insurance fund I am milking the system.  However, this attitude has crept into the social insurance scheme.  If we continue to reduce the PRSI rate, contributors will be viewed in the wrong light.  The worthwhile arguments made by Minister of State at budget time were not inserted in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare should be viewed in a much broader light and not merely as a Department that hands out money.  In recent years it has tried to promote a sense of value and dignity among people claiming social welfare. However, there is something wrong with a society that fails to tackle unemployment, poverty and social exclusion when its economy is booming. The Government is not living up to its glossy words.</P>
    <P>Additional resources which have come on stream in recent years have not been allocated properly.  Poverty, unemployment and social exclusion persist and few inroads have been made into these problems.  While we may talk in glowing terms about the additional number at work, they are not coming off the unemployment register. The more people at work and the more they contribute should mean the fund to distribute to the less well off is greater.  We are not addressing the problem of the long-term unemployed.  If we cannot do anything for these people at a time when the economy is booming, what hope will they have when the pendulum swings the other way?  Now is the time to do something for the socially excluded because money is available. <Col N="19" /> Many of those in Government made brave promises about what they would do if they found themselves in a position to deliver in this regard.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not distribute resources properly. I realise there are competing views in any Government and it must make choices with which it must live.  However, this Government pretends it has done more than it has.  Is it too much to ask that people should have a sufficient income to live with dignity, have something meaningful to do each day and have good housing?  We have not fully availed of this opportunity.  We hear much about the additional number at work but few of those have come off the long-term unemployment register.  A figure showed that only 400 people came off the long-term unemployment register last year, which is shameful.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say the economy is booming but that there are 250,000 people for whom we can do nothing.  These people are human set aside.  We give them increases in their social welfare payments in line with inflation, but that is all.  There is more to life than having enough money to buy food and drink.  People need to make a contribution and to have a reason to get up in the morning, to say when they go to bed at night they have done an honest day's work or that they have made a contribution to their well-being or that of their family or community.  It is important that every individual is treated with respect and is given something meaningful to do.</P>
    <P>People who have been given adequate accommodation in the suburbs of Dublin have been given nothing else apart from sufficient money to survive.  Many of them do not live by the same clock as others in our society.  They seem to go to bed at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning and get up at noon.  Teachers have told me that children drift into school at 10.30 a.m. or 11 a.m. and when asked why the are late, they say their mothers did not get up because they did not go to bed until 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.  The reason they live by a different clock is that they do not have anything meaningful to do.  We should do more for them by providing jobs.  If we cannot provide them with employment in the economy, we should give them something useful to do in their communities to help raise standards and give them dignity.</P>
    <P>The Government has done little for the long-term unemployed.  All it has done this year is approve increased participation of a few thousand on the back to work scheme as if it were a scheme this Government introduced.  The scheme was introduced by the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods.  This Government seems to have turned its back on a number of other schemes.  The number participating in the community employment scheme has been static since this Government came to power two and a half years ago.  Some community employment schemes are good but perhaps we approved too many schemes in the past and there was pressure to get them up and running without properly <Col N="20" /> scrutinising their implementation.  Even if some people do not progress to full-time employment, the scheme gives them a reason to get up in the morning and respects their dignity.  Yet this Government has not increased by even one the number on the community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>Another scheme, the part-time job opportunity scheme, was promoted by the Conference of Religious of Ireland and Fr. Seán Healy.  After the 1994 budget it was set up on a pilot basis for three years.  In my constituency of Finglas, a couple of hundred people are on that scheme but it is coming to an end.  It is a great scheme and has given much satisfaction to those on it.  I should not have used the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; because it should be seen as a job rather than a scheme. Those in Finglas have enjoyed great personal development and much job satisfaction.  They believe they are making a contribution to organisations and groups in Finglas.  I understand, however, the axe is hanging over this scheme.  I had hoped the number on it would have been increased to 50,000 or 100,000.  Instead of this Government giving the scheme its blessing, it seems to be winding it down.  The supervisors and managers of the scheme are on notice and others have been told they may remain until September.</P>
    <P>Creating jobs in the open economy is all very well but long-term unemployed people must be given something meaningful to do.  A fortune is being spent on window-dressing.  It would be better if we used that money to create jobs rather than give hand-outs.  In parts of Dublin city thousands of people are unemployed yet computer factories in the area are looking for staff. However, those who are unemployed are not trained to take up these jobs.  What are we doing about that?  Many of them have not been educated and are not able to take up available jobs, but that does not mean we can ignore them.  We should be able to create local employment so that they may work in their communities.  We must stop handing out money left, right and centre. There is much work to be done in the community which will help to raise the quality of life in these areas.  It is appalling that, despite all the promises, the Government has done nothing to help them. They have been set aside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which contains a number of innovative provisions and gives effect to the measures announced in the budget. It is part of an integrated package devised by the Government to help all sections of the population. In this instance, we are dealing with the old, the young and the unemployed.  Measures to help workers were announced in the budget. These include a reduction in the standard rate of tax, a reduction of 1 per cent in PRSI, increases in personal allowances and a widening of the tax bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In furtherance of the principle of social solidarity, measures include the provision of new primary schools, the Breaking the Cycle programme, first step education, transition year and applied <Col N="21" /> leaving certificate courses, the appointment of extra remedial and home-school-liaison teachers, and free third level education.  These are part and parcel of a programme aimed at bringing the community together in an egalitarian fashion.  In the health sector, steps have been taken to reduce hospital waiting lists, the carer's allowance scheme has been extended while the Minister for Health has announced the introduction of a new cancer strategy.  The stubborn issue of long-term unemployment is being tackled under the anti-proverty programme.</P>
    <P>All of the social partners are now involved in the process.  Apart from the business community and the trade unions, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed and the National Economic and Social Forum, which represents minority groups such as travellers and the disabled, have an input.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern raised the issue of inflation. There is a general increase of 4 per cent in social welfare payments.  The latest figures show that inflation is running at less than 1 per cent.  This gives a ratio of 4:1.  If inflation was running at 5 per cent &mdash; it has been as high as 15 per cent in the past decade &mdash; and there was a general increase of 20 per cent, it would be considered an enormous increase.  With inflation running at less than 1 per cent, a 4 per cent increase is welcome and far in excess of the increases granted in recent years.</P>
    <P>All social welfare payments now stand at 95 per cent on average of the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Old age contributory pension stands at 113 per cent of the recommended rate.  It is estimated that by the end of the year the figure will have increased to 98 per cent.  That is a significant achievement and an indication that the benefits of the economic boom are being passed on.  If the Progressive Democrats had their way, the high rate of tax would be reduced from 48 per cent to 40 per cent immediately to the benefit of a particular clique or niche market, the very well off.  There is a need, however, to help everybody in society, the well off and the less well off, the old and the young, as well as those who are finding it difficult to secure employment.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent in employee's PRSI.  In many ways, this is a double edged sword.  Under no circumstances should we undermine the social insurance fund. We must ensure there are adequate funds available to provide for the rainy day when people find themselves unemployed, perhaps due to illness. While the reduction will remove some of the financial burden on those in employment, we must ensure the fund is maintained at an adequate level.</P>
    <P>In the past two years child benefit has been doubled.  It is to be increased substantially again this year.  This is a move in the right direction as the principle behind the payment is an important one.  It is paid directly to mothers and not taxable. <Col N="22" /> I would have a difficulty with any proposal that it be means tested.</P>
    <P>Important changes have been made to the family income supplement scheme.  It will now be calculated on the basis of net rather than gross income.  Superannuation, PRSI and levies will be deducted.  There is a substantial increase of £10 in the weekly income thresholds.</P>
    <P>In the area of pensions there is a most important innovation.  People lost out in the past because to qualify for a full contributory pension one had to have an average of 20 yearly contributions. One can now receive 75 per cent of the maximum pension with an average of 15 to 19 yearly contributions and 50 per cent with an average of 10 to 14.  This is a welcome improvement because it provides for a <i>pro rata</i> benefit.  Before this, payments made would have been of no benefit in terms of contributory pension if a person did not have the required average payment.  With the <i>pro rata</i> system, people receive benefit for their contributions.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification on whether all payments are on a <i>pro rata</i> basis?  I am especially concerned with the self-employed who I am sure have approached many Deputies on both sides of the House since the 1988 scheme for the self-employed was established.  It requires a minimum of ten years' contributions.  Many people would have reached the retirement age of 65 before they would have fulfilled the ten year requirement. Until now, they have not been able to obtain a <i>pro rata</i> benefit.  Will previous insurance contributions be included to allow them reach the <i>pro rata</i> level?  Is there any scope for people who have not reached that level?  The scheme was introduced in 1988 and someone could have been self-employed then at 60 with no possibility of reaching the ten years' requirement before retirement age.  Can those self-employed people continue to work after 65 and accumulate years on a <i>pro rata</i> basis?  If someone works until 70 he should receive benefit from those contributions.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to see how it could be teased out.  There is a large number of people who have contributed enormously in terms of giving employment, making contributions in tax and superannuation paid to the State who do not have the required years.</P>
    <P>This new <i>pro rata</i> entitlement will especially benefit married women who left employment without the necessary contributions.  It will clear up an anomaly.  That is an exceptionally fine development but I am anxious to hear what it means for the self-employed and the farming community.  We are led to believe there is a large number of people in this category, anywhere between 30,000 and 40,000.  I am interested in how they will benefit under these proposals.</P>
    <P>The doubling of the special allowance for a single pensioner from £200 to £400 and from £400 to £800 for a married couple is a welcome development.  No one can say innovative supports for pensioners have not been given in this Social <Col N="23" /> Welfare Bill.  The new sickness allowance for short-term sickness not covered by contributions clears an anomaly and is welcome as are the equality provisions which will finalise the equal treatment issue.</P>
    <P>There are provisions relating to the anti-poverty programme and bringing people back to work.  We have seen developments in this area, for example, lone parents retaining their allowances, the unemployed retaining secondary benefits when they return to work and the tapered adult dependant's allowance being extended from £60 to £90.  Those are important and welcome developments.  There are also measures such as the provision of 1,000 places for the disabled on the back to work allowance scheme and that all State Departments should reach their 3 per cent quota of disabled people employed by the end of the year.  The increase of 5,000 places on the back to work allowance scheme from 17,000 to 22,000 is an indication of the Government's and the Minister's intention of providing pro-employment measures.  The retention of child dependant's allowance for 12 months upon taking up employment is extended to people in the community employment scheme and is another incentive and enhancement for people returning to work.</P>
    <P>Other measures are being implemented under the local employment service and these are important in achieving a reduction in the level of long-term unemployment.  There has been a very satisfactory average monthly reduction of 4,000 to 5,000 for the past five to six months.  It is the first reduction.  Before this Government came into office, there was a danger that the 300,000 threshold would be breached but numbers have now reduced to 250,000 and I hope that continues.</P>
    <P>We have a stubborn long-term unemployment problem and the measures introduced have not been effective in dealing with it.  With students graduating and finding jobs, people returning from abroad and finding jobs and the numbers on the live register beginning to fall significantly, it is time the long-term unemployed were specifically targeted.  The local employment service is now being set up under the various partnerships and that must be promoted firmly and determinedly so that we have a local forum whereby everyone interested in employment and who has been long-term unemployed is given every encouragement. That can only be given at local level and it must be a major focus in future.  With the establishment of the task force on drugs, we are now beginning to get a grip on this area neglected by successive Governments.  It will improve the quality of life and give people some hope.  We must examine unemployment blackspots with a view to designating them for specific tax reliefs and pro-employment measures to encourage entrepreneurs to come to the area and to encourage people living in endemic unemployment to return to work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on its various innovative measures.</P>

      <P>I, like previous speakers, welcome the changes for the better in the Bill.  As I have only ten minutes to make my contribution I will not go into them in detail.  However, they are not such great changes when one considers that while old aged pensioners will get a larger increase in their benefits this year than in the previous two years, the average increase this year is only £2.33.  The increase for those in receipt of unemployment assistance and disability benefit is only £2.17.  It would not be unfair to suggest the reason there is a larger payment this year is that this is an election year.  It is not fair that social welfare recipients should have to wait until an election year for a reasonable increase in their allowances.  They certainly have not fared well in respect of increases over the past three years.  The Fine Gael-Labour Government put back the payment of increased benefits to October, but given the amount of money available this year I thought it might have brought forward the payment to April.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of matters not included in the Bill which the Minister might be able to deal with by regulation.  Regarding supplementary welfare allowance, I met a person in receipt of lone parent's allowance studying for a degree through a correspondence course who finds it difficult to pay for her books.  Will the Minister consider if provision could be made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for people on the margins who wish to pursue an education qualification or who wish their children to pursue such a qualification?  I also know of a woman in receipt of lone parent's allowance who has a number of children, the eldest of whom are twins and are studying for the leaving certificate.  That woman has to pay £92 for exam fees.  Will the Minister ensure in cases where more than one child is studying for exams that some provision will be made to assist parents under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme or the back to school allowance scheme? He might discuss this matter with his colleague in the Department of Education.  The school in question has a small budget, but the woman I mentioned was not given anything near half the sum she had to pay out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The MABS scheme is working well.  Will the Minister consider ensuring people can have their local authority house rent deducted from their social welfare income if they wish?  That facility is available in some areas to people in receipt of unemployment assistance.  When the housing Bill was debated last week I made the point that the day is past when a person should be evicted for the non-payment of rent, particularly people on the margins who are in receipt of an income from the Department of Social Welfare.  More than 82 <Col N="25" /> per cent of the tenants of local authority houses receive part of their income from the Department of Social Welfare.  It should not be too difficult for the Department to arrange with local authorities to make provision for those who wish to have their rent deducted from their social welfare income.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to transfer from disabled person's maintenance allowance to the disability allowance scheme.  The legislation which provides for that was in gestation when Deputy Woods was Minister for Health and Social Welfare and during my time in the Department of Health.  As a result of the expanded disability allowance scheme and the new sickness scheme that will be introduced incapacitated contributory pensioners under the age of 66 will not be eligible from the free schemes.  Recently I called to see a widow who is incapacitated whose sole income is a widow's contributory pension.  Because she did not qualify for a long-term disability pension, she was not entitled to free telephone rental.  If ever a case were to be made for providing free telephone rental to a person living alone, it could be made for an incapacitated woman living alone and in her fifties.  I do not see why that woman should not qualify for that benefit in the same way as those in receipt of long-term disability pensions under the age of 66.</P>
    <P>I frequently made the point that there is an anomaly in the carer's allowance scheme.  I pay tribute to Deputy Woods who introduced the carer's allowance, which is a major advance, when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  While I accept the amount of income disregarded under the scheme has increased, a major anomaly needs to be addressed in the interest of the elderly, the carers and health boards, which are facing increasing difficulties in providing care for the growing number of elderly persons in the community. Two carers could live side by side.  In one house there may be an elderly relative who needs full-time care but who is able to assist with baby-sitting or some housework and the daughter in law, as it is generally the woman who is the carer, may receive the full carer's allowance on the basis of her husband's income.  Next door a carer may be looking after an elderly lady who is totally incapacitated, who may have had a cerebral haemorrhage, is paralysed, cannot leave the bed and requires a good deal of home care in terms of laundering sheets and feeding four times a day. That carer is not free to leave the house, but because the carer's husband may be earning £100 or £150 more than her neighbour's husband she is not entitled to the carer's allowance.  It would not involve major cost on the State to totally disregard income for people caring for a person who is totally incapacitated and needs care and attention 24 hours a day.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter of funeral grants in the past. There are a very small number of people over the age of 90 whose next of kin will not receive a funeral grant when that person or his or her spouse dies on the basis that they retired before <Col N="26" /> 1971, even though they may have worked for 50 years and paid contributions.  I know the reason for that ruling, but the Minister could make a gesture by extending the provision to include those people and their relatives.  There was a report in the newspaper some time ago that the Minister was to remove branch managers and replace them with civil servants.  Why did the Minister make this outlandish proposal which created insecurity and caused anxiety for branch managers who are doing an excellent job?  What has become of that proposal?</P>

      <P>The Bill has many positive aspects and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it.  It gives legislative effect to the announcements made in the budget.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the great handouts in this year's budget and how everyone will be better off.  At a time of national economic boom, the increases of £2 or £2.20 over the past three years have not been that exciting for widows, the unemployed or OAPs.  These were not great handouts.</P>
      <P>As regards section 12 and the employed, someone who works is interested in how much they will receive when they retire.  Up to now someone could make contributions for three years, sign for credits for seven years and would still be entitled to a contributory pension.  Now someone must sign for ten years before they have the same entitlements.  Surely this cannot be seen as a step forward.  There is no solace in knowing that this will not happen all at one but will creep in unnoticed.  Saying that the timescales are more generous than those envisaged by the National Pensions Board will not give much comfort either.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said about the increases in payments.  Pensioners have received a colossal £7 over three years.  I still await information on the free fuel scheme and how it can or will be expanded so that the increase given over three years will cover the cost of the extra fuel rural pensioners must buy out of their own pockets. The current allowance of £5.50 does not buy a bag of coal in most areas and our weather often warrants the use of more than one bag.  I would like to have seen realistic support for our pensioners in this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The butter voucher scheme has been reduced by half, affecting over 900,000 people.  Those who really need these vouchers were let down at a time when we held the Presidency of the European Union.  It is a sad boast at a time when dairy <Col N="27" /> products are plentiful and a little leniency would have meant so much.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance was introduced by Deputy Woods.  It was announced that those caring for more than one person will receive an additional payment amounting to 50 per cent of their existing basic rate.  How many carers does the Minister know?  Is the true extent of the hours they put in realised?  Is the mental and physical stress carers are under fully appreciated?  If so, I would like to know the number of cases &mdash; the Minister mentioned 2,000 &mdash; who are able to manage more than one dependant and I would like to meet them.</P>
    <P>The role of the carer is not fully recognised and the sacrifice these people make should warrant the abolition of means testing, especially for those who are in the special circumstances of dealing with someone 24 hours a day.  The carer's ability to leave the house to earn a substantial wage is curtailed.  Many of them are living on a pittance and they do not need to be penalised further.  The provision of respite care for both the carer and the cared for is covered by the Department of Health.  The Department of Social Welfare's abandonment of this problem is awful.</P>
    <P>An announcement was made last year that carers would be given support in meeting mortgage repayments.  Many carers were delighted because they thought they could buy their local authority house, only to find this was not included in the scheme.  The manner in which it was presented was misleading.</P>
    <P>In section 8 there is a reduction of 1 per cent in the standard employee contribution rate of PRSI, which will surely reduce the social insurance fund. Is there a rationale behind this which could be clarified?  If income is reduced by £114 million, what kind of security will this give to workers as regards illness, pregnancy, occupational accidents and pensions?  Perhaps the 1 per cent levy could have been removed instead, which would have been to the benefit of pensioners.  However, they paid their PRSI when they worked and will continue to pay the 1 per cent levy when retired.  This does not bode well for care of the aged.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification on whether it was conveyed on budget day that pensioners over 75 years would be entitled to free electricity.  Will the Minister confirm that this was stated at the time?  Will all pensioners qualify, as opposed to being entitled to apply, for free electricity?  There is a substantial difference between being eligible to apply and being able to qualify.  I hope that pensioners will not be led astray in a word game. Free schemes should be widened.</P>
    <P>Another issue which needs clarification is the resources the Department intend to put into the student summer job scheme, which was also introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It is a tremendous asset to those students who exist on a very low education grant and depend on this potentially great resource.  However, the value of the scheme is not only financial but has massive repercussions <Col N="28" /> in areas in which they work.  Local communities give significant support to the scheme and they see its benefits.  Why is the scheme not appreciated and expanded further?</P>
    <P>I, like others, was concerned at the message conveyed by the qualifying requirements last year.  It was wrong that if someone was eligible for unemployment assistance they were ineligible to contribute to the community through the scheme.  This was giving the message to young people not to work but to go on the dole.  The scheme should be extended to encompass as many categories of student as possible, including leaving certificate students.  Too many people are not getting a chance to participate in the scheme. I know parents whose child was told to draw unemployment assistance, despite having a place on the summer jobs scheme.  The parents fretted all summer that the student would decide not to go back to college and remain on unemployment assistance.  Whether this fear was rational, it was real.</P>
    <P>There are rumours circulating today about proposals to cut the student summer jobs scheme by 50 per cent this year.  If they are true, I am horrified.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's clarification.  I want the scheme extended, not reduced.  It is not only students who benefit from this scheme.  Students can only earn a maximum amount of money but if they are on unemployment assistance all summer, they cost the State more.  I cannot understand why this scheme would be reduced.  I am delighted to hear the rumours are grossly exaggerated.</P>
      <P>I welcome the support given to windows who deserve recognition.  However, it is small comfort to them as we need to expand the support they receive.  I welcome the fact that small firms will work with the Department in preparing a guide for employers on how they and their employees can legitimately avail of support from the social welfare system.  They would have liked some movement on VAT returns, but that is an issue for another Minister.  I am very disappointed that the children's allowance, another Fianna Fáil initiative and the best mechanism for supporting families and tackling poverty, is being increased by a mere 25 pence a week for each child and will not be paid until September next.  The increase would not even purchase an extra bar of chocolate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An average increase of £1.17 for adult dependants over three budgets is a mere pittance for the 120,000 involved.  There is no doubt that our society is changing rapidly with people remaining <Col N="29" /> in school longer and living longer, necessitating radical reforms of existing structures accompanied by initiatives to target those most in need.</P>
    <P>Self-employed people, whether fishermen, farmers, contract workers or others, need support in terms of occupational injuries benefit and invalidity pensions.  Some months will elapse before these very small increases are paid, which I trust will not be after a long summer minus the student jobs scheme.</P>

      <P>Although the media appear to have little interest in this Bill, it is one of the most important to be considered by the House annually. It is important because its provisions affect over one million of our citizens, many of whom have been identified by the Progressive Democrats as people who cannot help themselves and in whom that party has no interest.  There are social welfare recipients who, through no fault of theirs, are unable to help themselves, who should not be thrown on the scrap heap by the right wing philosophy of the Progressive Democrats but rather deemed to be in need of a minimum amount of income to sustain the standard of living we know to be just about possible from social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, on having obtained the support of his Cabinet colleagues for these proposals, thus addressing some anomalies in the system.  I have no hesitation in complimenting the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, on his efficiency and caring attitude in carrying out his responsibilities.  He is at all times prepared to examine specific difficulties encountered within his remit.  Whenever particular issues were brought to his attention &mdash; as inevitably Members will do &mdash; he was prepared to examine all the relevant regulations and rules governing decisions in an attempt to make his Department as user-friendly as possible.  In this he has been very successful, something certainly appreciated by my constituents.</P>
      <P>I should also compliment the Fianna Fáil spokesman on social welfare, Deputy Woods, on the ingenuity he displayed during his tenure in office.  If there is anybody who knows about social welfare issues overall, it is he.  He has always made a very constructive contribution.  Unfortunately, at one point his party appointed Deputy McCreevy to this portfolio.  He did irreparable damage with the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts which successive Governments have endeavoured to rectify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Bill also addresses some problems such as those in respect of one's entitlement to disability benefit.  While Deputy Woods has been complimented on introducing the carer's allowance &mdash; which replaced the dependent person's allowance of approximately £14 or £15 weekly &mdash; it should not be forgotten that he also introduced a means test to establish eligibility.  That may have been necessary at the time of its initiation because it would have been <Col N="30" /> impossible to grant all applicants that allowance without some form of means test.  Nonetheless, I am pleased to note that means testing of carers will be eased under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Recognising the work they undertake and service they provide to elderly relatives, in-laws or other qualified categories in their homes, which is a huge saving to the State, no compensation or payment is sufficient for carers, who perform a 24 &mdash; hour task, day and night without respite.  It is appropriate that the Bill should go some way to addressing the overall concept of caring, even if the carers involved are not required to sleep overnight in the home of the person for whom they are caring.  This easement should allow an average working family a reasonable income without penalising a spouse's eligibility for this allowance.</P>
    <P>This issue of caring for the elderly will continue to need serious examination.  With a growing elderly population clearly the State will be unable to meet the many residential care demands made on it which could be met by relatives for a fraction of the cost within a much happier and more secure environment.  This would also leave elderly people happy in the knowledge that they could remain in their homes for as long as possible. That concept represents the way forward.  I am pleased that this Bill attempts to address that anomaly of very strict means testing for this allowance.</P>
    <P>Means testing is odious anyway, particularly in its application to those who have been saving with a view to having sufficient for a decent burial, many of whom, on inspection by the Department, are penalised for having been thrifty.  I am glad to note that the relevant income ceiling has been raised from £2,500 to £6,000 in the case of a single person and £12,000 in the case of a married couple. This should be of considerable benefit to carers who should not continue to feel they are operating within a black economy.  Such savings were put aside by a generation of people meticulous in managing their limited resources, which they either worked for or secured through social insurance contributions.  They were invested in the post office, credit union or elsewhere and were intended for one specific purpose, to pay for a decent burial.</P>
    <P>Another benefit is that this allowance will be index linked, resulting in meaningful increases, thus obviating the possibility of budgetary increases being usurped by increased local authority rent.  It was important to overcome that vicious cycle of annual budgetary increases being negatived by reassessed local authority rents.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note also that the Minister and his Minister of State have examined <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pensions in the case of some contributors who, because of their longer life span, do not have the requisite average 20 contributions in order to qualify for the minimum payment. Henceforth those who have fewer than that average, perhaps between ten and 20 contributions will be eligible, as they should be, for a <i>pro rata</i> pension based on their individual contributions. <Col N="31" /> This is especially important in the case of small shopkeepers, small farmers and other self-employed people who had made pay related social insurance contributions, perhaps in the course of earlier, part-time employment.  For the first time, they will be eligible.</P>
    <P>I have made representations to successive Ministers to examine the possibility of increasing the death grant which has remained at £100 since its introduction in the 1970s.  This £100 bears no relation to the cost of burials which average at between £1,000 and £1,200.  The response always given is that it is important to use the resources available under the social welfare code to the best possible effect.  It was never considered that assisting people for burial was the way to do it.</P>
    <P>The health boards have a similar scheme but if one has received the £100 from the Department it will not give assistance particularly if one has a small insurance policy on the deceased.  These are sensitive issues.  If improvements were made in this area it would not cost much and it would be recognised that the Government is serious about looking after people in their old age.</P>
    <P>Major progress has been made in providing for families.  In the last three budgets child benefit increased by 52 per cent.  This has been confirmed by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed as the way to get money into families with children where it is needed most.</P>
    <P>The changes in the family income supplement are significant for those in low paid employment who have major family responsibilities.  The family income supplement has been identified as a useful scheme for low paid large family units to obtain State assistance in recognition of the challenge to take up employment even if it is low paid.  Employers have an obligation, when the rate of pay is low enough for the person to qualify for family income supplement, to assist employees by identifying the schemes available. No employer has used the family income supplement deliberately to pay workers low wages. It is an important indemnification of low income families.  Those who have availed of the back to work scheme &mdash; whether in self-employment or in the commercial sector &mdash; and continued to draw percentages of their unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance should be entitled to family income supplement in addition to the back to work allowance.  That would be a real boost towards getting people back into the workplace.</P>
    <P>That the Government and the Minister have extended the entitlement to medical cards for a period of three years on taking up employment has succeeded in breaking the cycle where people were reluctant to take up employment because of the loss of benefits.  For larger families the benefit of a medical card cannot be over emphasised.  It is not abused but it is an important reassurance for families that in the event of illness they can call a doctor and get a prescription.  People in continuous employment, and on similar or lesser <Col N="32" /> incomes, have complained that, because of its extension to people who have returned to work, they have difficulty in obtaining medical cards. They point to their colleagues who have returned to work as being still in receipt of benefit.  If anomalies are created they should be examined but the health board is not the most democratic organisation to examine anything.</P>
    <P>I was pleased when the disabled person's maintenance allowance was removed from the ambit of the health boards to the Department.  I had the experience of years of waiting for decisions on disabled person's maintenance allowance applications which were legitimately before health boards and were not being processed due to internal difficulties.  They are being processed now and the means test has been eased.</P>
    <P>When a health board made a decision it was not retrospective to the date of application or else it included a proviso that the applicant for disabled person's maintenance allowance went for retraining.  I have had to avail of the services of the Ombudsman to prove to the health board that there is no such requirement to qualify for disabled person's maintenance allowance.  I am pleased the Ombudsman has found in our favour in many cases and has confirmed that people are entitled to it from the date of application.  The only requirement is that one has to be means tested and sick enough to get it.  I am pleased changes have been made in that area.</P>
    <P>On invalidity pension and disability benefit there is some difficulty in the Department about people who were awarded invalidity pensions based on medical evidence that can be updated and reviewed at any time by hospital consultants. There is no doubt decisions based on medical evidence, X-rays, tests and so on will stand up to basic scrutiny by any inspector from the Department. Yet doctors arrive from the Department of Social Welfare and give an opinion based on a simple examination of the patient who is seen either in a social welfare office, a hotel room or wherever with no facilities to check the legitimacy of a person's condition.  On the law of averages their applications are refused in the knowledge that if the applicant is bad enough he will reapply. One has to go through a bureaucratic procedure to enter the appeal, produce new medical evidence, have another medical examination and nine times out of ten a medical referee is necessary. All this costs money and here we are always talking about value for money.</P>
    <P>If an application for disability benefit, invalidity pension or some of the new sickness allowances is backed up by X-rays from hospital consultants why is that evidence not accepted in the Department of Social Welfare?  Much time and money is wasted by doctors travelling around the country informing people that in their opinion they are fit to work when if they opened the file they would know they are not fit to work.  If the patient being examined suggests to the medical inspector or doctor that his full case is on file he would be snapped at for daring to enter into a <Col N="33" /> conversation with the medical inspector who seems to consider the patient is seeking something to which he is not entitled.  I resent that attitude to the people I represent.  I have one case where, because we have managed to appeal and win it, the person in question has deliberately chosen every year to be re-investigated.  His condition has worsened and that has been confirmed by consultants.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we should subject people to this supernumerary investigation which pushes them almost to the point of suicide.  We all have a responsibility to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Given that social welfare touches so many people in our constituencies every week and every day the Minister will realise it is an emotive subject for many of us.  I compliment the Minister on making the Department more user friendly and beneficial to people who cannot help themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  The Social Welfare Bill implements the strategy adopted by the Government in the budget.</P>
      <P>After the publicity generated by the Government's spin doctors in the preceding six months, the budget and the Social Welfare Bill were a grave disappointment to all sectors of society that depend on social welfare.  In each of the past three years the old age pension has been increased by £2.33 per week while the widow's pension has been increased by only £2.20 per week.  A person on disability allowance or long-term unemployment assistance received even less at £2.17 per week.  Allowances for dependent children of recipients were not increased.  This flies in the face of justice and the concept of dealing equitably with the less well off in society.  It shows this Government's lack of understanding of the poorest and most disadvantaged members of society.</P>
      <P>Each Social Welfare Bill provides the Government with an opportunity to improve existing schemes and to introduce new ones.  However, the major elements of importance in a Social Welfare Bill, from the point of view of the public, are the increases in basic payments.  The basic payments under this Bill do not live up to the Government's promises and, in view of the current economic climate, a Government never had a better opportunity to provide decent increases. In 1983 to 1987 the Government almost bankrupted the country.  When Fianna Fáil came to power in 1987 it had to get the country back on its economic feet.  However, even during those times of stringent economic policies, the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, ensured that the less well off received higher than expected increases.</P>

      <P>Not only did Deputy Woods secure the necessary funding to improve the lot of social welfare recipients, he also saw the need for innovative schemes.</P>
      <P>During the history of the State, Fianna Fáil was responsible for introducing the children's allowance, free travel, the carer's allowance, the back-to-work allowance and second chance education for the long-term unemployed.  In three years this Government has failed to bring forward any innovative schemes, which demonstrates the lack of ideas in the rainbow coalition.  When three different parties are pulling in different directions, it is difficult to bring forward new ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister of State has different ideas from his senior Minister in many areas of social welfare.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance was one of the most important developments introduced in the social welfare area.  It was introduced at a time when State finances were restricted but it was improved over the years.  The allowance should be examined again with a view to not imposing an income limit in cases of severe disabilities.  The Departments of Social Welfare and Health should work together to identify such cases and provide a carer's allowance to people who look after those with severe disabilities in their homes.  Carers save the State vast amounts of money.  If people are put into homes or hospitals there are added costs of subventions and nursing care which cost the State much more than the cost of carer's allowances to have those people looked after at home.</P>
      <P>Respite care must be improved.  Our population is changing and the number of elderly people will continue to grow.  Future Governments will have to provide more respite care places.  Carers who are looking after parents or other relatives occasionally need a break from their work and respite care is a suitable method of giving them one.  However, as time passes, more people will need respite care places but there are insufficient places available.  It is incumbent on future Governments to ensure greater resources are put into providing such places.</P>
      <P>Widows and old age pensioners must be properly taken care of.  Most other social welfare recipients receive extra moneys from various sources but widows and old age pensioners usually cannot do so.  However, their heating and health expenses continue to increase just as they do for everybody else.  We must pay particular attention to providing sufficient income for these groups so they can live in a degree of comfort.  A pensioners' charter is worthy of consideration and would be an important means of clarifying the rights and benefits available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The invalidity pension and appeals procedure cause grave concern for many of my constituents, particularly the time it takes for appeals to be <Col N="35" /> heard.  Every Deputy will have met constituents who want to know why their appeal is not being heard within a reasonable time.  The Minister should try to improve the provision of this service. It is important that people who are in need are not left waiting for their entitlements.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed I do not have more time to discuss the Bill.  It is a failure and shows a lack of understanding on the part of this three party coalition of the problems of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible during the time available to reply in detail to the many points made.  I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this very important debate.  It is interesting to listen to those Deputies who are familiar with the workings of the social welfare system.  I have noted the points made by them and these can be debated in more detail during the later Stages.</P>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to a few broad points.  Many Deputies expressed concern about the ability of the State to make future provision for pensions in view of demographic trends etc. This matter has engaged the minds of officials in the Department for some time.  A pensions initiative has been undertaken within the Department to generate discussion and to ensure adequate provision is made.  Occupational pensions also raise questions about the future burdens on the State.  It is important to point out that the combined assets of occupational pension schemes amount to approximately £18 billion, an increase from £2.3 billion in 1981-2.  This constructive and helpful development must be measured against the increasing number of people in insurable employment.  Concern was also expressed about the changes in regard to PRSI, the social fund etc.  All future requirement have been fully taken into account and are adequately catered for in the Bill, the budget and the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the controversy which arose during the past week about the long-term unemployed, Deputies show their knowledge of an issue by the way they apply themselves to the debate.  It goes without saying that Deputies generally have a very good understanding of the problem of long-term unemployment. People must have a good knowledge of the problem if they are to properly appraise it. It is very easy for a person who has never been unemployed to conclude that the long-term unemployed do not want to work.  This misleading assumption is very hurtful to the people concerned. I know from my clinic that many people are not considered for certain jobs because they are too old or have outdated skills.  It is totally unfair to suggest that these people do not want to work.  Some people may live in deprived areas, but this is not their fault.  The Government is taking the necessary long-term measures to deal with this problem to ensure the maximum number of <Col N="36" /> people can secure places on training schemes and courses and can compete for jobs with other workers.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to explain the true position to people who do not deal with this problem on a regular basis.  People look at the issue in different ways: those who see things as they are ask &ldquo;why?&rdquo; while those who only see things as they should be ask &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;.  The policy being pursued by the Government in relation to the long-term unemployed is aimed at ensuring long-term unemployed people will be able to compete in the workplace and will not be patronised.  There is no quick fix solution to the problem of long-term unemployment.  A person who has been unemployed for five, six, seven or eight years requires a great deal of assistance to re-enter the very competitive work arena.</P>
    <P>As somebody once said, rumours can be greatly exaggerated.  However, rumours during an election year can be very misleading and dangerous. Many young people may decide to stand in the general election on the basis of misleading rumours.  I would not like them to be misled. Rumours about the student summer job scheme and various other schemes are misleading and harmful and do not benefit anyone.  I do not want to be political but the main Opposition party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will address a point about which I am concerned, particularly if Deputy Woods gets his wish and the election is held earlier than I would like.  I have calculated the costs of the extension of existing schemes and the provision of new schemes.  We would have to increase the social welfare budget by at least 30 per cent this year to meet the hopes and aspirations of the Deputies opposite.  The Progressive Democrats Party has not entered this arena during this debate as it is difficult to call for increased expenditure and fiscal rectitude at the same time.  It is <Col N="37" /> unfair to the public for Opposition parties to call for increases for everybody, while telling another audience they are in favour of fiscal rectitude, without indicating how they propose to do that. Those parties need to clarify that contradiction in the near future or they will face difficulties on the doorsteps in the general election.</P>

      <P>Perhaps in some parts of the country candidates from only one party will appear on the doorsteps.  This issue may not arise but the public will want to know about it at some future stage.</P>
      <P>A question frequently raised by Deputies in the debate was whether the increases proposed in the Bill are adequate.  They are not as good as we would like.  A budget has never been produced which satisfied every Minister in charge of a Department.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill by national and international standards and there is little sense in the parties opposite decrying it and calling for more increases for the elderly.  Every person receiving a payment from the Department of Social Welfare can justify a case for an increase, but we must have regard for budgetary strategy, which is controlled from within, and follow guidelines laid down outside this House.  Everybody recognises that is the way to proceed and we are proceeding in that fashion.  We have achieved the best that can be achieved within those constraints.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, has a good working knowledge of the way the Department of Social Welfare works.  He has taken his responsibilities for the Department seriously.  He understands the needs of the people who depend on the services provided by the Department.  That is important because, without a reasonable understanding of those needs, it is difficult for a Minister to do justice to a brief.  The Minister has done exceptionally well in that regard and I am privileged to have served with him.  Perhaps we will have an opportunity of repeating the performance.</P>
      <P>Time does not allow me to deal with the other points raised but I hope to have an opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.  I thank Members for their contributions which have been noted. They were constructive, although some of the proposals would be expensive to implement.  I thank the departmental officials with me in the Chamber and those working behind the scenes. When these measures are put into operation and the benefits begin to flow, the public will have an opportunity of passing its judgment on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the views expressed on all sides of the House.  Clearly there is a welcome for this legislation.  I am very much aware of the invaluable service credit unions provide. There are nine credit unions in my constituency, Dublin South, including two of the top 70. One of these is in my area of Dundrum, and I suppose it is important that I should declare my wife's membership of it.  There are 14,000 credit union members in Dundrum, and 9,000 members in Rathfarnham, also in my constituency.  As other Members have done, I too want to express my appreciation of the invaluable service they provide to the community.  The people involved in running credit unions give voluntarily of their time, and I am very much aware of the crucial role they play in the community.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies have highlighted the role of the credit unions and of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Irish society, and I would echo their sentiments.  As a public representative I am continually made aware of the special role played by both of these organisations in helping people in need, and there are many people in communities all over the country who need a leg up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about the philosophy of the credit union movement.  They have been rightly described as self-help institutions.  Reference has been made to their voluntary efforts, their solidarity and their impact on society.  Let me share with the House my experience during my time as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development in relation to the work of Irish aid personnel in southern Africa and of <Col N="39" /> Irish missionaries working abroad and interacting with communities in Zambia, Tanzania and the townships in South Africa.  In many of these communities where Irish personnel interacted with the local community invaluable work was done in education, health and agriculture.  There is a strong sense of solidarity in those communities, and leadership is often provided by the women. Having visited those areas and having had discussions with Irish aid workers and local people there, it was evident that, apart from providing technical assistance in health and agriculture, many of the Irish personnel in the missionary movement were involved in setting up credit union systems which, in turn, provided a strong local economy and support for small businesses in the communities.</P>
    <P>I make this point to reinforce the fact that the credit union system is truly an international concept which reinforces a sense of community and solidarity among people at local level, and this is evident not just in Ireland but throughout the world.  Credit unions fulfil a much broader role in societies throughout the world than simply providing loans and a means of saving for their members.  This Bill has been a long time in gestation and I am glad it has finally been produced. I hope the Minister will take on board any constructive proposals put forward by Members in this debate.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to some of the points made by the credit union movement in regard to the Bill, many of which I agree with.  According to the Irish League of Credit Unions their vision of the credit union movement, based on the co-operative, non-profit system, is seriously undermined by the Bill.  This is a valid view and the Minister of State should take note of it.  The Minister should think long and hard before introducing legislation that would hinder the growth of this movement which involves 12,000 volunteers working in their own communities throughout the country.  The diversity of the credit union movement must be taken account of by the Minister when formulating appropriate legislation.  I commend the fact that he has introduced legislation, but there are concerns across party lines about the need to get it right.</P>
    <P>There are 427 credit unions varying in size from some with less than £500,000 in assets to others with £55 million.  This diversity will require a flexible response from the Minister.  This Bill does not meet the needs of the credit union movement because it is overly restrictive.  A Minister who would claim to represent ordinary people &mdash; as he is doing in relation to the price of the pint &mdash; should not turn his back on a movement that provides invaluable support and assistance to ordinary people.  Restrictive legislation such as this will impede the growth of credit unions.  The Minister is fully aware of the concerns of the Irish League of Credit Unions and, in the course of his contribution, he made some comments about them.  They are concerned about the capping of <Col N="40" /> deposits by individual members.  I support their concerns on this crucial issue.  It is essential that the limits set on deposits should reflect a percentage of the credit union's shares and that the Minister should reverse his decision to provide for an absolute limit.  The credit unions make this point time and time again, and it is valid.  Under existing legislation there is no limit on deposits.  It is difficult to understand why the Minister is interfering in such a draconian manner and disrupting a system that has had widespread support in the community.</P>
    <P>The Bill also limits the amount of loans that can be provided by the credit unions to £20,000. Some 132 credit unions have issued loans in excess of £20,000 and 293 credit unions have issued loans ranging from £10,000 to £20,000. There is no doubt that the demand for loans in excess of £20,000 will increase in the future. These loans are taken out by ordinary people who want to carry out repairs to their houses, buy farm equipment, change their car or, increasingly, for business purposes.  The Minister is committed to provide finance for those endeavouring to take up business ventures or expand their business, particularly small businesses.  The plea by the credit union movement to cater for that sector should be met.</P>
    <P>Restricting the monetary limit of individual loans will discourage investment in credit unions as members will not invest if they are not allowed to borrow at the level of their savings.  At present there is no monetary limit on loans, and in light of the current success of the system I would ask the Minister to reconsider the restrictive nature of the proposals on loans.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be considering a compromise solution by which he will raise the monetary limit on loans and savings, but I would urge him not to go down that road but rather to apply the percentage option which would allow for the continued steady growth and development of credit unions, small and large.  Credit unions have operated under the Credit Union Act, 1966, with remarkable success, providing loans to members for 31 years for various purposes.  The capping of limits in absolute rather than percentage terms would be disastrous and should not be contemplated by the Minister.  If that option is taken it will damage irreparably the invaluable service provided by the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>A key concern of credit unions is recognition of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The Minister rightly recognised the role of the league in presiding over the growth of the movement, but the Bill does not recognise the pivotal and central role the league plays in controlling and servicing credit unions.  A new section should be introduced to allow such recognition by the Registrar of Friendly Societies so that the work currently done by the league is brought within the regulatory framework established by the registrar.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has been subject to selfsupervision through a comprehensive self-regulatory system.  The movement has its own savings <Col N="41" /> protection scheme which has strict rules and procedures. That system has served members very well in protecting their savings over the years.  It is vital that the savings protection scheme remains under the control of the movement in future.</P>
    <P>Section 48 deals with new services.  Many credit unions already provide on an agency basis additional services &mdash; for example, insurance, savings stamps, foreign exchange and other such services. This section allows credit unions to provide additional services to their members, but the system of approval of those services is cumbersome. The movement is concerned that there may be delays in approval of additional services by the registrar.  I ask the Minister to take account of those legitimate concerns and recognise that, since the personal financial services sector is a fast-moving and changing sector, credit unions must be given the capacity to respond efficiently and speedily to their members' needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill is dotted with references to offences and penalties relating to credit union activity.  It is appropriate that penalties be brought together in one section, as was done in the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  That would provide for a much tidier and less intrusive Bill.</P>
    <P>I am one of many Members who contributed to this legislation.  I welcome the Bill which has been a long time in gestation.  I have proposed fundamental changes which are very much in line with the proposals of the credit union movement. I recognise the work they have done for many years in my community.  I have had lengthy discussions with representatives of credit unions and am very impressed by them.  I look forward to a positive response from the Minister to my proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government, particularly the Minister on bringing this legislation before the House and also on having it published, as promised, before the end of 1996.  It is extremely complex legislation containing a huge number of sections.  I am sure it has given the Minister considerable headaches and that he has had even greater headaches listening to the array of speakers in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must pay tribute to the wonderful work done by the voluntary workers and members of credit unions in the past 40 years.  They are a credit to the nation and are one of the great success stories of modern Irish society.  I am sure the Minister is straining at the leash to reply to a number of points raised during the course of the debate, many of which echo the sentiments expressed by the credit unions, which are not totally happy with the Bill even though they are glad it has at last come before the Dáil.  The main amendments sought by the credit union movement are that the deposit limit be set at 2 per cent of total shares of £50,000, rather than the £20,000 proposed, and that the share limit be set at £30,000 rather than the proposed £20,000.  They <Col N="42" /> are the primary demands and I hope the Minister sees fit to agree to them.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement was born in an era when people had to be thrifty with their money because they had very little of it. Another institution set up around the same time to give motorists a cheaper form of insurance is the PMPA.  That was a very interesting and worthwhile concept to protect motorists from exorbitant charges by insurance companies, but unfortunately it fell into private hands and has been reconstructed as a commercial enterprise.  Bodies such as the PMPA and building societies were originally set up as voluntary bodies to help poor people and give them a better deal than they received from banks, which charge exorbitant interest rates.</P>
    <P>That leads me to ask the Minister what has happened to the third banking force which has been promised for a number of years.  What alternative does the public have to the four main banks, particularly the two larger banks, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank?  People frequently ask that question.  I recently tabled a question to the Minister for Finance regarding the charges banks impose on customers, even though they make large profits.  While I believe in competition and profit-making enterprises, there should be a limit on bank charges and the amount of profit banks make.  The reply to the question I tabled stated that the Minister for Finance does not have responsibility for bank charges.  In other words, it is a matter for the Central Bank.  While that may be a Government agency, Members of the House do not have the power to question it on how it monitors commercial banks.  We should have such power.  To whom are banks answerable if not to the Minister for Finance or Members of the House?  The current system is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>When credit unions were first established a parallel could be drawn between them and the Morris Minor car which was regarded as the poor man's Rolls Royce.  Credit unions gave less well-off people an opportunity to borrow and save money.  Many people saved small sums of money with credit unions to enable them take out a loan to cover the cost of communions, confirmations or other essential items.  Society has come a long way since then and, as the Morris Minor became a Japanese car in the 1970s, the credit union has increased its membership and the amount of money it disburses.  The credit union movement currently has £2 billion in deposits.</P>
    <P>We all acknowledge that the Minister of State's heart is in the right place and that he is doing good work, but is it not time restrictions were imposed on money lending and moneylenders? While it has not totally eradicated the problem, the credit union movement has gone a long way towards offsetting the awful difficulties people face when they get into the clutches of moneylenders. I occasionally meet people in my constituency with incredible financial problems because they are in the grips of moneylenders. <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> the official Government publication, <Col N="43" /> states that people must apply annually for a licence to become a moneylender.  The era of moneylenders is over and future applications for licences should be refused.  Credit unions can do the work of moneylenders, whose exorbitant interest charges are a disgrace.  Unlicensed moneylenders &mdash; an even greater scourge than licensed ones &mdash; operate in many local authority housing estates.  We should cease the practice of issuing licences for money lending and do everything in our power to outlaw unlicensed moneylenders. Giving greater flexibility to credit unions would assist in that regard.  Their wonderful work has already gone a long way towards abolishing the need for moneylenders.</P>
    <P>As we owe a debt of gratitude to the credit union movement, we should be prepared to compromise in regard to its requests.  The Minister of State is a flexible and brilliant individual and I am sure he will be accommodating on Committee Stage.  While I accept he does not want credit unions to become banks or building societies, for many people that is what they are.  They do excellent work for the community.  I wish the credit union movement well in the future and hope it can reach an accommodation with the Minister of State on the matters in dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on introducing this Bill.  While Fianna Fáil will table amendments on Committee Stage, we are pleased the legislation on credit unions is being updated.</P>
      <P>More than 12,000 people work voluntarily in credit unions to help the less well-off sections of society.  The credit union movement could be compared to a large co-operative organisation and its members cannot be given enough credit. They do tremendous work for those who want to place small amounts of money on deposit or borrow for essential purposes.  Rigid controls apply to the operations of the movement to ensure a minimum number of misdemeanours.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement is concerned about a number of key issues.  The limits on shares, deposits and loans are unacceptable to it.  The Bill proposes to set a limit of £20,000 on shares, but the credit union movement wants that increased to £30,000.  The Bill proposes a limit of £20,000 on deposits, but the movement wants that increased to 2 per cent of total shares or £50,000. The Bill proposes a limit of £20,000 on loans, but the movement wants that increased to 5 per cent of total assets or £30,000.  A solution which raises the monetary limits without allowing for those percentages will not be acceptable and for good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards self-regulation, recognition of the credit union movement by the insertion of a provision similar to section 94 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, will provide for supervision of its affiliated members by the Irish League of Credit Unions within the framework established by the registrar.  An approval system for new services <Col N="44" /> will be tiered to recognise the varying types of services which could be provided by credit unions, to enable single approval applications for all affiliated existing services to be automatically approved, and for fast-tracking of approval, especially for agency services.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, referred to offences and penalties.  I spoke to many members of the credit union movement who were anxious that sections relating to offences and penalties be consolidated in one part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The vision of the credit union movement is that it should satisfy the social and economic needs of its members with dignity and integrity by offering, in a co-operative way and on a non-profit basis, full financial services for those who wish to join. This ambition, which embodies the philosophy and ethos of the movement, is not recognised in the 1996 Bill.  Many features of this legislation will hinder the development of the credit unions and may damage the ethos of the movement and frustrate the work of 12,000 volunteers who demonstrate the value of a co-operative, self-help approach to economic development in their communities. Economic development is vital to these communities and anything which hinders such development is bad.</P>
    <P>The movement has identified a number of fundamental issues.  When looking at these issues it is important to remember that the credit union movement represents 427 credit unions which vary in size with assets ranging from less than £0.5 million to £55 million.  This diversity is an indication of the strength and the representative nature of the movement which should not be threatened. I am worried that many of the proposals here represent a threat to the unity of the movement.</P>
    <P>Limits unacceptable to the leaders of the credit union movement have been set on shares and deposits.  Under the 1966 Act, a limit of £6,000 was set on shares.  It has been increased to £20,000 under this legislation but the credit union movement seeks an increase to £30,000.  There was no monetary limit on deposits under the 1996 Act, but this Bill imposes a limit of £20,000.  The credit union movement seeks a limit of 2 per cent of total shares or £50,000, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>While the bulk of savings in credit unions are held by small savers &mdash; the average saving is £1,300 &mdash; some people have savings in excess of £40,000.  Indeed, there are 68 credit unions in which members have savings in this category. Any unnecessary restriction on the ability of a credit union to raise funds from members will impede the growth of the movement.  In practical terms, the proposed limits mean that in certain circumstances, a credit union may have to turn away a member who wishes to place funds.</P>
    <P>Setting a monetary cap on members' deposits rather than relating it to the total shares in the credit union does not recognise the diversity of credit unions or allow for flexibility depending on the size of a credit union.  It is fundamentally important that the limit set on deposits reflects a percentage of the credit union's shares and is not <Col N="45" /> an absolute monetary limit.  We must bear in mind that present credit union legislation does not have a limit on deposits.  This has not caused problems, so why is this change being introduced?</P>
    <P>The 1966 Act limits credit union loans to a term not exceeding five years.  This limit will be relaxed in the 1996 Bill so that 20 per cent of loans may be for a period exceeding five years and 10 per cent for a period exceeding ten years. With this welcome relaxation in terms has come an unwelcome limit on loans.  A limit was not set under the 1966 Act but under the 1996 Bill, a limit of £20,000 has been set.  The credit union movement seeks a limit of 5 per cent of total assets or £30,000, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>While the vast majority of credit union loans are for small amounts for a short duration, there is a substantial market for credit union loans in excess of £20,000.  People with small savings often build houses with help from the credit union and save taxpayers, rate payers and county councils the cost of building local authority houses.  This alone is a good reason to reconsider the limit.  At present, 132 credit unions have loans in this category. Given the potential growth in loan demand as a result of the extension in loan terms, it is probably more appropriate to consider the present number of loans in the £10,000 to £20,000 category which are given by 293 credit unions.  It is clear the demand for loans in excess of £20,000 will increase.</P>
    <P>An absolute monetary limit on the value of individual loans will seriously impede the development potential of credit unions, particularly the 81 larger credit unions, which would be seriously affected by this cap.  A limit on loans will only serve to discourage investment in a credit union because members will be less inclined to invest if a borrowing facility, even to the level of their savings, is not available.  Given the diversity in size and lending capacity of credit unions, it is logical, and serves prudential objectives, to set any such limit as a percentage of total assets. The existing limit on loans is 10 per cent of total assets with no monetary limit.  This has not caused problems in the past, so what is the reason for the change?  I do not understand the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>The proposed monetary limits on savings and loans are unacceptable to the credit union movement. A compromise solution whereby the monetary limits only would be raised would be unacceptable as it would impede the development of credit unions and might divide the movement with larger credit unions in particular seeking a different legal framework within which to operate.</P>
    <P>All credit unions operate under rules approved by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  For 38 years credit unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions have been subject to self-supervision under a comprehensive self-regulatory system operated centrally by the league through the management of the savings protection scheme <Col N="46" /> which has strict rules and which was introduced voluntarily in 1989.  It currently holds £28.7 million, representing 1.2 per cent of total savings, exceeding the recognised norm for credit unions worldwide and far in excess of the figure of 0.2 per cent for the deposit guarantee scheme operated by the commercial financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The rules of the scheme lay down prudential management procedures, standards and ratios which must be adhered to and require a credit union to have a fidelity bond for all of its employees and volunteers.  Credit unions are inspected by the league's monitoring division at least once every 15 months.  In 1996, 317 credit unions were inspected.</P>
    <P>The scheme protects members' savings in a number of ways.  There are total movement reserves of £290 million, representing 12 per cent of total savings; fidelity insurance cover related to assets; internal supervision; external annual audits; computer monitoring of financial performance and field inspections; and monitoring and investigations by the league.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister of State recognised its role in presiding over and guiding the extraordinary growth of the credit union movement, recognition is not extended in the Bill to the Irish League of Credit Unions which is the central controlling, servicing and representative body for credit unions.  It has proposed that a section be inserted, reflecting section 94 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, to allow recognition by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and to provide for supervision of its affiliated members within the regulatory framework established by the registrar.</P>
    <P>While section 48 allows credit unions to provide additional services to their members, the system under which services will be approved is cumbersome and of significant concern to the movement.  Many credit unions provide, on an agency basis, services other than savings and loan accounts consistent with their objectives.  These include insurance services, saving stamps, budget accounts-bill payment, money advice services and foreign exchange.  The introduction of additional services could be severely hampered by delays in issuing approval.  In a fast moving personal financial services sector, this would inhibit the ability of credit unions to respond to their members' needs.</P>
    <P>There are repeated references to offences and penalties in relation to almost every credit union activity.  While the credit union movement accepts the need for offence and penalty provisions, the Minister of State should consider bringing all of these together in one section.</P>
    <P>Amendments must be made to the Bill to ensure it is workable and an effective legislative framework for this vibrant, community-based, non-profit, member-owned and controlled, mutual, co-operative and highly successful movement. It should be amended along the lines suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the Bill.  It is evident from the number of backbenchers who wish to contribute to the debate that the credit union movement is held in high regard throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Last week, at its invitation, I visited the new custom built offices of New Ross Credit Union.  I heard it said recently that the credit unions were becoming like the banks and other lending institutions in that they were building monuments to themselves in various towns.  I reject this.  They are to be commended for providing such fine facilities.  I was well briefed in a professional manner by the persons concerned.  I hope I can do them justice.  While they welcomed the Bill, they were of the view that it had its shortcomings.</P>
      <P>Later that day I visited a businessman in New Ross who wished to brief me on a £9 million development at the Hook in County Wexford. On hearing that I had come from New Ross Credit Union, he informed me that he had cut his teeth with it.  This is a clear indication of the success of the credit union movement.</P>
      <P>My colleague on the opposite side of the House, Deputy Deasy, raised the issue of the third banking force, of which Democratic Left and the Labour Party are in favour.  It is disappointing that so little progress has been made.  I am sure the Minister of State, who holds a prominent place at the Cabinet table and expressed a particular interest in the matter when on this side of the House, will clarify the matter.</P>
      <P>There are seven credit unions in my constituency of Wexford: New Ross, Gorey, Enniscorthy, Wexford, Cleristown, Piercetown and Bunclody. This is clear evidence that it is a rural and urban based organisation accommodating much of the diversity of the population of the county and I am sure this is repeated throughout the 32 counties. Despite members of my family being involved, I was surprised to learn that there are £26 million in savings in County Wexford and that 37,000 members are involved which is over one third of the population of the county.  That reflects well on the organisation and on the wonderful work it has done which should never be forgotten.  I would not like to suggest the Bill loses sight of that but it goes too far in many instances.</P>
      <P>This Bill presents an opportunity to do a good job and meet the demands of the credit union movement.  However, there are elements in the Bill which are not good.  If I quote often enough from the briefing document of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as many others have done, the Minister of State may be convinced of the necessity to amend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit union movement, unlike the banks, is flexible.  When one applies to it for a loan, one does not expect to receive the same negative answer one expects from a bank.  The movement is successful because there are no fools among its officers.  No member has ever lost money. Members own the credit union and dictate policy through the voluntary directors.  Any surplus is returned to members by way of dividends or <Col N="48" /> interest rebates.  Many small businesses have been started and sustained by the credit union, for example, light engineering companies, garages, joineries and shops.  The credit union has left its imprint and has been effective.  The amount of savings can be as low as 50p per week.  A Christmas savings scheme is also operated within the credit union.</P>
    <P>This raises the issue of moneylenders, also raised by my colleague, Deputy Deasy.  They no longer provide a necessary service.  I am inclined to agree with the strong line taken by Deputy Deasy that there should be a long, hard look at the issue when their licences come up for renewal.  The comparison between the interest charged by moneylenders and that charged by credit unions is frightening.  Moneylenders are legalised extortionists.  When the time comes for their licences to be renewed, they should be refused as their services are no longer required.</P>
    <P>People will often go to a TD's clinic looking for money from the county council to build a house or to install windows or central heating.  If it cannot be obtained, I guide them towards the credit unions but, if they cannot get it there, they visit moneylenders.  When they are caught in their clutches, they must take out a loan to cover the original one and a third loan to cover the first two and this continues until such time as these people are in serious trouble.  The credit union has taken many people out of the clutches of moneylenders. We, as a parliament, should take a more serious view of the terrible difficulties people find themselves in because of the intimidatory tactics of these people.  How many times has a housewife come to our clinics in tears because of intimidation by moneylenders who stated that unless she paid the money due at the end of the week they would inform her husband?  It is disgraceful. The credit unions can help in such a situation and we should encourage them to do so.</P>
    <P>I have met many local boards of directors, not alone in New Ross but all over County Wexford and many from neighbouring counties as well. They are all excellent people with common sense who operate in a professional manner.  We should not interfere with the local boards of voluntary directors.  I often wonder if voluntary people are more committed to an organisation than those who are paid.  It is an interesting point which we should consider.  No one should be in any doubt that these boards of directors with their excellent staff &mdash; many people in the credit union movement are paid officers &mdash; provide a fantastic and social service.</P>
    <P>The strongest message from the credit union movement is that control is being taken from it. This is a worry and, if the fine print in the Bill is examined, one could be forgiven for having that suspicion.  It was suggested to me that there is a smell of the banks about it.  I know the Minister of State's feelings about banks and I wonder if his erstwhile enemies are becoming friends.  I worry he is being taken in.  His performance in the past would suggest this would never happen <Col N="49" /> but then I never thought I would see him on the Government side of the House either.  With the third banking force in the offing and this little hint of control being taken away from a successful organisation, I reprimand the Minister of State by saying I am a little worried.  If those involved in the organisation tell me they are worried, I have no reason to believe otherwise.  The Irish League of Credit Unions extends to all 32 counties and people of all religious denominations and political convictions are members and are on boards. If organisations adopted a similar attitude to that of the credit union movement they could contribute to the successful resolution of political differences here.</P>
    <P>A fine aspect of the movement is it operates its own inspection scheme, with which we should not interfere.  A credit union may be inspected at any time without warning.  We must be careful not to do away with that inspection system in this successful movement.  I note the Minister of State is in agreement.</P>
    <P>It is often perceived, although I do not know where the idea originated, that politicians are the best off people in the world.  However, we have to approach banks to secure loans.  I have some land, but the bank manager has refused my requests on more than one occasion.  Many people have no chance of securing a loan from the bank, but they can get one from a credit union.  Accessibility to credit unions must be nurtured and encouraged.  That must be reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The vision of the Irish League of Credit Unions is that credit unions will satisfy the social and economic needs of their members with dignity and integrity by offering, in a co-operative manner and on a not-for-profit basis, full financial services for everyone in the community who wishes to join.  Many of us have taken issue with banks because of their very high profits.  We recall they gave loans to many people, particularly to those in rural areas, in the early 1980s and increased their interest rates to almost those charged by moneylenders.  That hike in interest rates forced many people to sell their properties and remortgage their houses, but that would not happen in the case of credit unions.  We must ensure that will remain the position.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions' vision which embodies the philosophy and ethos of the movement is undermined by this Bill.  Many of its features will hinder the development of credit unions, damage the ethos of the movement and frustrate the 12,000 volunteers who demonstrate the value of the co-operative self-help approach to economic development in their communities. Those volunteers are important people in their communities &mdash; their involvement does not extend only to the credit union movement.  That was evident on Tuesday when I went to the funeral of one of the credit union collectors in my area which was attended by a large number of people involved in the movement throughout the <Col N="50" /> country.  That man was well respected because of his involvement in the movement.</P>
    <P>The movement identified a number of fundamental issues as paramount.  In considering them it is important to bear in mind that the credit union movement represents 427 credit unions in rural and urban areas, with assets varying in size from £0.5 million to £55 million.  That diversity is an indication of the strength and representative nature of the movement and should not be threatened. We are worried that many of the proposed solutions pose a threat to the unity of the movement. I know from consultations with many of those involved that they feel strongly about that. I do not believe the Minister of State intended to cause that concern, but he should give this matter serious consideration.  In doing so he will be able to say when he leaves office in the not too distant future that the Credit Union Bill is a monument to him; he put his stamp on it, listened to the views expressed by those involved in the movement and amended the Bill to ensure the organisation continues to grow and retains its ethos.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  This Bill, which was long promised and awaited, is one of the most important to come before the House.  In recent months our support has been sought and we have been lobbied to introduce the Bill and consider proposals in respect of specific provisions.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement plays an important role in the economic and social well-being of many people.  I was surprised to learn from some of the briefing material that the membership of the movement is so high.  Based on those statistics one wonders how there is any business for the more commercial financial institutions.  The credit union movement is community based and owned and run by members.  Its culture and ethos are tailor-made to the needs of this country.</P>
      <P>This legislation will define how the movement develops in the future.  Because of the many misgivings expressed about the Bill, one must question if it will put the movement into a straitjacket. Will the movement's role, importance and the significance of its objectives be lost sight of in our changing environment?</P>
      <P>The monetary limits proposed are unnecessary and unwise.  Anyone with the most basic information about the movement will realise there is a great variation in the size of credit unions.  Of the 427 in the country, their assets base varies from £0.5 million to £55 million, but the limits proposed will apply to the spectrum of credit unions.  It is crude and will be ineffective.  It will restrict the movement's ability to develop and expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The briefing material states that 68 credit unions have individual deposits in excess of £40,000.  Because of the limits that will apply to shares and deposits when the Bill is enacted, to where will those deposits be transferred?  Will the <Col N="51" /> movement be prohibited from catering for depositors who have accumulated that level of savings through their hard work and thrift?  The impact of the Minister of State's proposal will result in members withdrawing their savings and investing them elsewhere.  There does not seem to be a problem with the amount of deposits under current legislation.</P>
    <P>On the exclusion from the house mortgage market, the Minister humorously said £20,000 would not build a decent conservatory.</P>

      <P>In preparing the White Paper on Human Resource Development I have consulted with many different groups and organisations which have an interest in the development of our human resources.  FÁS and trade unions were among these.  From the outset I recognised that their practical experience and expertise would be invaluable in planning a new human resource development policy which will bring us into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Written submissions were invited and received from many different organisations, including employers, trade unions and the agencies.  In the process of consultation, I met the board of FÁS to discuss various aspects of the White Paper.  I presided over a number of fora on the White Paper, which were attended by people covering a wide range of expertise.  I also organised a consultative seminar on the White Paper held in Dublin Castle.  The seminar was attended by many diverse groups and the contributions made were of considerable value.  Employers, trade unions, FÁS and the industrial agencies were involved in all of these consultations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his annual report for 1991, the Director of Consumer Affairs stated:</P>
      <P>A number of complaints were received during the year from consumers about theatre and concert ticket booking fees.  Under existing legislation it is not possible to prohibit booking fees <i>per se</i> and it would not be desirable to do this in a market economy.  It would, however, be possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make an advertising order under section 11 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, prescribing that particular information should be included in concert and theatre advertisements in a specified form and manner.</P>
      <P>He adverted to the re-emergence of consumer complaints about this matter in his annual report for 1994, which I received during 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the concerns expressed by the director and following consultations with concert and theatre ticket providers, I asked the Attorney General to prepare an order under section 11 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978 requiring that in every written advertisement for a public concert or theatre performance the admission price must be indicated and, where applicable, and separately, the amount, in monetary or percentage terms, of any additional charge and the circumstances in which such additional charges are payable &mdash; for this purpose admission price would mean the price stated on the face.  In all other forms of advertising the admission price must be stated, together with a reference to the fact that an additional charge may be payable in certain circumstances.  Where an advertisement for a public concert or theatre performance makes a statement about the method of payment for tickets and there are restrictions in relation to <Col N="54" /> that method of payment to be applied, the extent of those restrictions shall be clearly stated in the advertisement.</P>
    <P>I am informed that, where applied, additional charges are intended to offset the costs associated with the making available of the ticket to the would be purchaser, in circumstances where the would be purchaser, decides on his or her own responsibility, to procure the ticket other than by means of direct purchase at the venue in which the concert or theatre performance takes place.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Information (Advertisements for Concert or Theatre Performances) Order, 1997, incorporating the three aforementioned requirements, was signed by me on 4 March, presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on 5 March and shall come into operation on 12 May 1997.  This shall allow adequate time for concert promoters to adapt to the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is interesting.  I submitted my question last Friday, 28 February and I am glad it stimulated someone into action as I thought the matter had been dropped.  How fortunate and timely that my question stirred the Minister from his inactivity on this matter and that an order was produced on 4 March and laid in the Library on 5 March, to the wide open gaze of Dáil Éireann.  I am delighted that although I was removed from the Department of Enterprise and Employment, I can continue to poke at it.  The booking fee most unjust and rips off consumers.  What arrangements have been made by the Director of Consumer Affairs and-or the Minister's Department for their reportage to ensure that concert halls and promoters comply with the relevant order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that there is not a day in my parliamentary life that Deputy O'Rourke does not stimulate me into some productive action.  Even this morning I woke up to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to hear her stimulating me to further effort on a different matter.  Whereas I do not wish to decry the lady's own interpretation of her power in these matters, neither she nor her colleagues poked very effectively at the matter when in this Department.  Contrary to her question of 5 September provoking me to do so, I took the report from the Director of Consumer Affairs in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It applied to 1994.  That report is what caused me to have the order prepared.  The Deputy will appreciate it could not have been prepared between the submission of her question and my making the order, it being such a complex matter.  Referring to his 1991 report the Director of Consumer Affairs had the following to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a previous annual report &mdash; that is 1991 &mdash; I raised the possibility of a solution to the vexed question of additional fees for telephone <Col N="55" /> credit card bookings for theatres, concerts, films and shows of various kinds.  I am disappointed that, despite this and a number of recommendations I have made in the past, no action has been taken on the problem which emerged again in 1994.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Director of Consumer Affairs was aggrieved that no action had been taken during those years.  Once the matter was brought to my attention in 1996 I immediately set about drafting the order concerned with the co-operation of the Attorney General's office.  I am very glad that order is now in place and I hope it will result in consumers being clearer about their entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been numerous contacts between myself, officials in my Department and IDA Ireland concerning the legislation to implement the Directive on the Organisation of Working Time.  The views of the IDA on the legislation were sought when legislative proposals were being prepared and there have been continuing contacts since.  In the course of these discussions the IDA made a variety of points about perceptions that might be generated about the Bill's possible impact.  These views have been fully taken into account in the course of preparing the Bill and in formulating the amendments tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Shortly before the Bill was considered on Committee Stage, the IDA was briefed on developments in the legislation, including the proposed amendments and indicated its general satisfaction at the manner in which the concerns of its client companies were being addressed.  After this meeting I became aware that, in early January, prior to the Committee Stage amendments being known, the IDA had written to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy conveying some views on the legislation.  As I explained at my press conference last week, I conveyed my surprise at the contents of the letter to the IDA.  However, I did not request that body to withdraw the letter.  Subsequently, it withdrew the letter, on its own initiative, explaining that its views on the legislation had altered considerably since it had been written.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a balanced measure, arrived at through deep and wide consultation with the social partners.  This partnership approach has served Ireland well.  It has served employers, employees and the unemployed well.  It has brought, along with this Government's excellent handling of the economy, industrial peace, economic well-being, increased employment, reduced unemployment, low inflation and low mortgage interest rates.  The Bill is built on this approach.</P>
      <P>The Government has adopted the most flexible approach in line with the partnership arrangements that are fundamental to Government policy in this area.  In the preparation of this Bill, the maintenance of competitiveness in the economy and the attractions of this country as a location for inward investment have been of primary concern to me, the Government and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  I am satisfied the proposed legislation poses no threat in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister may not have asked IDA Ireland to withdraw the letter, clearly he exerted pressure on that body.  Does he agree that establishing contact with that body and expressing his surprise would be sufficient warning from any Minister?  With whom in the IDA did the Minister establish contact?  Was it with its chief executive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I established contact with its chief executive on this topic, as I have on numerous <Col N="57" /> occasions.  Therein lies my surprise at the letter because many of the issues we discussed surrounded individual companies.  Several companies expressed concerns which were addressed in the course of our discussions.  They essentially formed the Committee Stage amendments introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  The Deputy will be aware of some of those amendments which will afford significant flexibility in implementing the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Bill, such as the definition of &ldquo;working time&rdquo;, those who are exempt, the arrangements for a transition period and so on. In addition, we have established a monitoring committee to oversee its implementation.  The amendments to that Bill were very much a product of the interaction between the two Ministers, our Department, the IDA, its clientele and other, wider industrial and trade union interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that, as was said in its letter, IDA Ireland was seriously concerned that Ireland was not taking advantage of the opt-out clause?  Since that has remained the position, is the Minister suggesting that IDA Ireland has changed its mind and is no longer concerned that we are not taking advantage of that opt-out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see that IDA Ireland has already spoken and indicated that, at the time that letter was written, it was not privy to the amendments being introduced to the Bill. Indeed it has expressed satisfaction at the approach adopted by the Government and my Department to the introduction and implementation of this Bill.  We have always taken considerable heed of any advice from that body. However, I strongly reiterate that the issue of the opt-out clause is not a fundamental element. Ireland is an extremely competitive location. Since introducing this legislation we have attracted and announced 11,000 additional overseas jobs here.  It ill-serves the House for Members to suggest we are undermining our competitiveness in some way since we have one of the most demonstrable, competitive packages for overseas investment throughout Europe, evidence of which is manifested in job performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept the IDA letter was withdrawn only three weeks after it was sent because its political master ensured it would be withdrawn by expressing his concerns?  Is that not the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is categorically not the case.  I have had numerous discussions with the IDA on this issue.  Those discussions gave rise to the surprise expressed when I learned of the letter. The IDA's action, which it took entirely on its own account, demonstrates the sensible approach we have adopted in relation to the introduction of this legislation.  I am convinced <Col N="58" /> this legislation will be seen as a broad part of a package for a competitive environment in Ireland for the creation of employment and the attraction of overseas industry.</P>

      <P>The company has made proposals, contained in its plan &mdash; Building a Force for the Future &mdash; to change the roles and responsibilities of the staff of its sales force.  The proposals affect managerial and non-managerial staff.  The dispute between the company and its managerial staff has been resolved.</P>
      <P>The company is proposing to introduce new reporting arrangements and work practices for its non-managerial sales staff.  The majority of this group is represented by the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union, while SIPTU represents approximately 60 of the 420 staff.  The sales staff, known as personal finance advisers &mdash; PFAs &mdash; believe the changes will have a detrimental effect on their commission earnings.</P>
      <P>The proposals affecting the PFAs have been the subject of negotiations between the company and the MSF union.  The parties also attended conciliation conferences held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
      <P>The parties then referred the dispute to the Labour Court on 26 November 1996.  A Labour Court hearing took place on 10 December 1996. The Labour Court issued its recommendation on 17 January 1997 in relation to various aspects of the plan, including an improvement in the compensation payable to the sales staff for the changes required.  The company has stated the recommendation will cost the company an extra £1 million.  The members of the MSF union rejected the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
      <P>The company informed staff that if they failed to co-operate with the restructuring they would be suspended without pay.  Since 3 February the company is reported to have suspended 320 sales staff, all members of the MSF trade union.  The suspended MSF members have been picketing Irish Life offices.  Sales staff who are members of the SIPTU trade union and non-union members are not involved in the dispute.</P>
      <P>In mid-February the parties resumed direct negotiations but no substantial progress was achieved.  The Labour Court then requested the LRC to provide further assistance to the parties. As a result a number of LRC conciliation conferences have been held with the parties and this process is continuing.</P>

I have met both sides, the union, through its individual members and collectively on several occasions, and with the management on two occasions.  The position has become intractable and I genuinely want to see it ended.  It has serious consequences for a successful company, formerly a semi-State company. There is a need for an interest to be shown, leading to an intervention by the Government with a view to a resolution of the impasse.  The personal finance advisers are upset at the dictatorial way in which the matter is being handled.  Apart from a constituency level, has the Minister in his official capacity met with either side in the dispute? Will he encourage an intervention either from his Department officials or himself to solve this impasse which daily is becoming more intractable?</P>

Their approach has been tried and tested in handling labour relations issues.  They have tremendous experience in the field, a good track record and the confidence of the parties involved.  They are continuing to work with the parties to find a solution. That is the correct approach to resolving these issues.  The two sides have to come to terms with one another.  These tested and proven professionals in the field are best placed to assist in finding those solutions.</P>

      <P>This is a serious situation in that up to 350 people are effectively locked out of work and picketing daily not only the office in Dublin but the Irish Life offices around the country. They say the matter is serious and that they are not getting a decent hearing of their case.  The Labour Court recommendation was non-binding but provided that negotiations would be entered into and full consultations.  That did not happen. I am aware they are currently involved in negotiation and I hope it concludes satisfactorily. There is something very wrong in the system when that number of people &mdash; not of a young and impetuous age &mdash; are determined to get their <Col N="60" /> rights and apparently the managerial side is not co-operating with them.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he is taking in response to the recent report by SIPTU entitled Case for a Minimum Wage for Hotel and Catering Workers.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only recently received a copy of the report referred to by the Deputy and I have asked my officials to examine it.  I am aware that the SIPTU trade union has been expressing concern about pay rates for employees in the hotel and catering sectors of our economy.</P>
      <P>Under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946-90, trade unions, or other organisations claiming to represent a category of workers, may make application to the Labour Court for the establishment of a joint labour committee, known as a JLC.  In the final analysis any decision to set up a JLC or to extend the remit of an existing committee rests with the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>The function of a JLC is to draw up proposals for fixing minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for the workers involved.  When proposals submitted by a joint labour committee are confirmed by the Labour Court, through the making of an employment regulation order &mdash; ERO &mdash; they become statutory minimum pay and conditions of employment for the workers concerned.</P>
      <P>There are three JLCs in operation which impact on the areas referred to by the Deputy.  In the catering sector two JLCs cover Dublin and Dun Laoghaire and the rest of the country respectively.  The hotel JLC covers the whole country with the exception of Cork city, Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire.  I am informed that SIPTU has applied to the Labour Court for the establishment of a JLC for hotels in the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire areas.  The Labour Court is to hold an inquiry on 3 April 1997 into the application by SIPTU.</P>
      <P>It is open to SIPTU to bring its report to the attention of the Labour Court on 3 April, as regards its findings in relation to the hotel industry in the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire areas.  Also the report could be brought to the attention of the other relevant JLCs in the catering and hotel sectors.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is unsatisfactory.  The report by Norman Croke makes the case for a minimum wage and demands a direct interest and involvement on the part of the Minister by a concentration on workers in that sector.</P>

Pay issues are usually matters for negotiation between the two sides but the JLC procedure is available where there is weakness in the organisation of workers.  The unions can apply to the Labour Court to have a joint labour committee established which will determine rates of pay.  The procedure exists and SIPTU is acting on it.  We are determined the policy approach will be to build profitable enterprises that can provide good pay and conditions. That aim underpins all our work.  With regard to action on the report, SIPTU is taking the action it regards as appropriate and which is in accordance with the legislation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept, in view of comments by many Ministers and especially the Minister for Tourism and Trade, that tourism is set to become the second largest employer in Ireland in the new millennium?  We agree with the Minister that this sector demands particular attention and that the JLCs have a role to play with regard to equitable wages.  However, we should take note of the report's finding that there is a marginal difference between the wages paid to many people working in the tourism sector and unemployment benefit.  That requires particular attention from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister will also agree we need a highly motivated and skilful workforce in this sector if we are to provide the jobs that should be available. In view of the statistics and the survey carried out by CERT, does the Minister not feel it is inadequate to rely solely on the JLCs and that ministerial attention is required to ensure wages in this sector are appropriate?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade has addressed the core issue of training and <Col N="62" /> creating an environment for profitable tourism ventures and has done so effectively.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Last year, 350,000 extra visitors came to Dublin, leading to an additional spend of £90 million in the city, as a result of successful strategies being put in place. That provides a basis for building a strong tourism sector in Dublin.  I endorse the Deputy's view that we need a strong tourism sector which provides good working conditions and pay levels. That is also the aspiration of the Minister for Tourism and Trade and, if the Deputy puts down an appropriate question, he will outline the strategies involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="(Mr. Rabbitte) (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>(Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 96, 102 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurers worldwide tend to classify young and/or inexperienced drivers as a high insurance risk category relative to the more mature and/or experienced driver.  The degree of risk tends to decrease with age and maturity and the level of <Col N="63" /> premiums charged to young drivers reflects the insurer's claims experience of such drivers as a higher risk category.  Accordingly, as a general rule, they will pay more for insurance cover, although there may be exceptions depending on the circumstances of each individual case.</P>
    <P>In analysing young motorists' risk profile, the Deloitte &amp; Touche consultancy report on insurance costs in Ireland confirmed that, in a European context, young drivers as a group and individuals with poor safety records will have limited choice of insurers and face high premium costs throughout the EU.  Indeed, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report found, in its survey of motor insurance premium levels, that for the 21 years age group, UK premium rates for comprehensive insurance cover exceeded Irish rates.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report concluded that the inculcation of safer driving standards in young drivers and education in driving skills is the key to reducing their high accident rate and to obtaining lower premium quotations.  In this regard, I draw the Deputy's attention to the specific recommendations by Deloitte &amp; Touche in relation to the possible introduction of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers similar to a model in force in Ontario.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is to undertake an examination of the Ontario model in the context of current law and practice in Ireland.  The Department of the Environment has also cooperated with the AA in the launch of an AA drink driving video aimed at young drivers.</P>
    <P>An insurance incentive scheme has been established by agreement between the Irish Insurance Federation and the Driving Instructors Register whereby insurance discounts will be offered to young drivers who have completed an agreed number of driving lessons over a calendar year. The National Safety Council is also working to produce course material on road safety to fit in with the new primary school curriculum and has recently adopted a five year road safety programme which includes the development of educational material in 1998 for transition year students in secondary schools.  Some schools are also offering driving training courses on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to the incentive of free insurance on the purchase of new cars in Northern Ireland, this is a marketing matter concerned with the determination by motor traders to increase the sale of new cars rather than any benevolent attitude on the part of insurers in that jurisdiction.  With regard to the reports and studies on the cost of insurance for young drivers, a survey undertaken by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1993 found that, in the age groups examined &mdash; 17-24 years, 25-30 years and over 30 years &mdash; under both comprehensive and non-comprehensive cover, the frequency and average cost of claim in the 17-24 age group was significantly higher than in the other age categories.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland provides further evidence <Col N="64" /> of the high cost of claims associated with the young driver.  The consultants found that the average cost of an insurance claim for a 17 to 24 year old driver is over twice that for a 36 to 40 year old driver and that motorists in the younger age group are responsible for over 3.5 times the claims costs of motorists in the 36 to 40 age group. In addition, the National Roads Authority annual report of 1995 indicated that almost 38 per cent of the motorists involved in fatal and personal injury accidents in 1995 were young drivers and that 41 per cent of the road casualty victims in 1995 were between the ages of 18 and 34 years.  Given the facts, it is not surprising that young drivers may experience difficulty in obtaining quotations for motor insurance and that from an underwriting and solvency perspective insurers will quote relatively high premiums to young and inexperienced drivers.</P>
    <P>Generally, a young person with a provisional licence and little driving experience can expect to pay a premium in the region of £1,550, although given the number of different conditions and/or loadings which may attach to such policies and other individual circumstances, some young people may pay more and some may pay less than this amount.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it may interest Deputies that quite recently, the Hibernian Group carried out a reassessment of young drivers' insurance risk profile resulting in a new insurance scheme which will take into account a young motorist's claims-free experience as a named driver on his or her parents' motor insurance policy and a no claims bonus incentive will reward such claims-free driving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  I asked him the loadings to be applied, the measures required to curtail the high cost of insurance, the comparative figures for our EU counterparts &mdash; he referred to the UK only &mdash; and the measures to be introduced in 1997 to help reduce the high cost of motor insurance.  The Minister failed to answer these questions.  He also misled the House by saying that the cost of premiums for provisional licence holders is £1,550&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The premium quoted by both companies was in excess of £2,500.  The Minister is aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>My question deals with the issue of major concern to people in my constituency, that is, the provision of free insurance for two years to people on the other side of the Border who buy cars.  Some of the companies which provide <Col N="66" /> this cover also operate in the South.  We supported the introduction of the derogation as it was designed to protect the insurance industry but perhaps it is time we had more open competition. Does the Minister intend to open up the insurance industry, particularly the motor sector, so that the incentives offered to motorists in the North can be offered to those in the South?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from what the Deputy said that he does not accept Deputy Callely's charge that I am anti-Dublin.  The incentives being offered in Northern Ireland are a marketing strategy by the insurers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That kind of marketing strategy is probably desirable in Northern Ireland given the conditions which obtain there for a variety of reasons.  The increase in car sales in the Republic as a result of our strong economic performance is such that that kind of marketing strategy is not necessary here.</P>
      <P>There may be some merit in the Deputy's point about competition.  The insurers concerned would argue vigorously that there is cut throat competition in the marketplace but I have an open mind on this issue.  Given that we operate in a single market, it will be interesting to see to what extent there is intrusion from outside the jurisdiction to provide greater competition.  We will not be able to get away from the underlying statistical relationship between the number of accidents and fatalities in which young drivers are involved and the level of premiums charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take action to deal with companies which give three or four quotations to the same individual through different brokers?  Depending on the cc of the car and experience, the premium quoted can range from £1,800 to £3,000.  Will the Minister introduce measures to ensure companies quote the lowest premium?  Because different premiums are quoted through various brokers many people end up paying more in insurance than they paid for their car.  It is unbelievable to think that people who buy cars for £1,500-£2,000 can pay double that amount in insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of insurance for young drivers is high and almost prohibitively so in some cases.  On this and previous occasions I have sought to explain the reasons for this to the House, that is, the obligation on insurers to provide prudentially for anticipated claims in the future.  I am not aware of the phenomenon to which Deputy Ellis referred.  Part of competition in the marketplace is that one should shop around to get the best deal.  I do not know why the same ultimate insurer would quote different premiums <Col N="67" /> in respect of the same case provided the circumstances are described similarly each time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance industry would expect me to say that that is not the case and that because of the risks associated with this category of driver they assess applications in great detail and that while premiums may be high this is not because they are not assessed on their merits.</P>

I take it that the Minister is not satisfied with these increases.  Will he appoint an inspector from the insurance section of his Department to investigate this proposed increase and the high cost of insurance?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the number of cars on the road has increased as a result of our buoyant economy.  An increase in car sales should lead to lower insurance costs.

      <P>I dealt with last year's premium increase on a number of occasions.  It is not referred to in these questions but I take Deputy O'Keeffe's point that in an environment of persistent, unprecedented low inflation it is unacceptable that we should be asked to anticipate a further increase this year.  I have done precisely as Deputy O'Keeffe requests.  I initiated a detailed study in my Department on this issue as a result of the public statement from a particular insurance company to the effect outlined by Deputy O'Keeffe.  I am also concerned about the implications of the new transparency requirements arising from a particular EU directive which, for the first time, separates investment income from the normal operational performance. That is being examined also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Deloitte and Touche report, the expert group set up to put in place some of its more important recommendations, specifically the personal injuries tribunal, is well advanced.  I understand that work is likely to be concluded before the end of this month.  A number of initiatives are suggested in the Deloitte and Touche report relating to the category of young driver, to which I referred in my formal reply.  I have been in discussions with the Minister for the Environment who is contemplating the introduction of a number of those initiatives.  Some insurers are also taking account of the widespread public concern about the issue the Deputies opposite have raised.  I hope progress will be made as a result of those initiatives, but, regardless of who is sitting in this seat, it will not change the underlying statistical <Col N="68" /> facts of life unless we have greater success in terms of inculcation of safer driving techniques among young drivers.</P>

      <P>I notice a change of tone in the Minister of State's replies as more comprehensive questions are put to him.  I offer him an opportunity to correct a reply he gave to Deputy Ellis on the comparison between insurance costs here and those in Northern Ireland, the thrust of which seemed to be that the reason there was no competition with regard to insurance costs was because of the number of cars being bought here; in other words, there was no real need for competition in this area.  Will the Minister of State clarify that rather dangerous statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said the marketing ruse being used in Northern Ireland to boost car sales was unnecessary in the Republic because of our strong economic performance.  Car sales are at an all time high, and presumably insurers consider that a similar ruse, giving away free insurance for two years, is not necessary here.  Deputy Ellis referred to a separate matter, namely, that in his view there is inadequate competition among insurers here.  I said the insurance industry would argue there is cut throat competition in the marketplace here.  I have an open mind on that.  We are examining this whole area. I commissioned the Deloitte and Touche report to address some of those questions.  There is a broad measure of agreement in terms of the parameters applied by all insurers in respect of this category of young and inexperienced driver, and that is not necessarily a pointer to the absence of competition in the marketplace.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callely either misunderstood or does not wish to understand the reply I gave which focused on answering that particular point.  The loadings are directly related to the connection between young drivers and the incidence of accidents.  They are directly related to that phenomenon.  The Government can try to create an environment where a greater premium attaches, for example, to safety on roads, better quality of roads, some of the initiatives in the Deloitte and Touche report referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe and to the schemes some insurance companies are taking on.  I instanced the Hibernian one which would give some credit to young drivers for their previous record as a named driver on their parents' driving licence.  I do not know of a magic solution that will deal with impetuosity in driving terms.</P>

      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland did not seek a meeting with me or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on the organisation of working time legislation.  However, at the request of the chamber, an officer of my Department provided a meeting of its members with a briefing on the organisation of working time directive on 8 November 1996.  The purpose of that meeting was to inform the chamber about the contents of the directive and the likely contents of the Bill.  Neither at that meeting nor subsequently did the chamber convey to me or my officials the serious concerns conveyed by it on 20 January 1997 to the Select Committee, on Enterprise and Employment.  Following the publication of that letter, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, suggested that the chamber meet with him and myself to discuss any concerns it may have about the legislation.</P>
      <P>That meeting took place yesterday and the Government's position on the working time legislation, having particular regard to the amendments introduced on Committee Stage, was fully explained to the chamber representatives.</P>

      <P>Given that over 60,000 people are employed in over 400 American companies, it seems extraordinary that the Minister did not immediately seek a meeting with the chamber when the letter was sent to the committee.  It seems rather irrelevant to have met it yesterday when the Bill has already gone through Committee and the Government has clearly closed its mind to any change.  In the light of yesterday's meeting, will there be any changes to the Bill on Report Stage, particularly in relation to the opt-out clause?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very constructive meeting yesterday.  The chamber did not seem to understand that the Bill contains a substantial amount of deregulation and repealing of laws going back to the 1930s making it less onerous than the existing employment law.  This seemed to be misunderstood by some of the chamber representatives. They did not seek additional changes on any specific issues in the legislation.  I am happy that we had a very constructive meeting and that there is now a greater understanding by the American Chamber of Commerce of precisely what the legislation contains.</P>

      <P>The chamber said strongly in its letter to the committee that the lack of flexibility regarding the opt-out clause will have &ldquo;a negative effect&rdquo; on direct American investment into Ireland.  Is that still its position or has it drawn back from that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I had a number of meetings with individual American multinational companies for which the American Chamber of Commerce is a representative organisation. Prior to the publication of the Bill these companies did not express concern about the opt-out clause.  They had concerns about record keeping and about people who determine their own working hours, which have been addressed on Committee Stage.  They were concerned also about double employment.  The new legislation is a modification of the law which has been in existence since 1936.</P>
      <P>On the question of the opt-out clause, only 6 per cent of Irish employees currently work in excess of those working hours, and these are not employees of the multinational companies.  It does not represent a problem for the multinational companies because, when working hours are averaged out over the year, they are able to meet seasonal demands.  Subsequent to the publication of the legislation one multinational company expressed some concern about phasing in and start-ups.  We have addressed that in an amendment which was adopted after detailed discussions with both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC on the phasing in of the full requirements of the legislation.  I am satisfied that meets the point of concern in question.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that the American Chamber of Commerce has changed its position as set out in its submission to the committee which stated that for its member companies the most controversial provision of the Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996 was the imposition of the maximum 48 hour working week on employees without allowing for relief under the opt-out clause?  Is the Minister saying that this element of its submission, which we received during Committee Stage, was withdrawn by the delegation that met her and the Minister or that it was not referred to?  Given that there are 400 companies involved, this is a crucial factor, and it is also a very important issue in the context of the competitive advantage of Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a discussion earlier about the Norman Croke report on the tourism industry.  He makes the point that 20 per cent of people in that industry work between 51 and 80 hours a week.  There is, therefore, a particular concern, which I know the Deputy shares, about excessive working hours which may put workers' health at risk.  We had detailed discussions with multinational firms about this directive and the legislation before the publication of the Bill.  The 48 hour rule was not a concern.  The American Chamber of Commerce, in discussions with us yesterday, said that one of its concerns was the appearance of lack of flexibility, and that it would not be able to meet seasonal peaks and demands. However, when we went through individual points with it its perception that there was a lack of flexibility was based on a misunderstanding of the provisions in the Bill which allow an averaging over four months of the 48 hour rule, an averaging over six months for all seasonal businesses, and an averaging over 12 months which is available to any company which concludes a collective agreement to that effect with its workforce.  The chamber misunderstood the provisions, and we were happy to be able to put its mind at rest.  The sector which it represents is not a sector which, generally speaking, works very long hours.  It was more a question of its perception of inflexibility. We were able to assure it that far from being inflexible this Bill is an extremely flexible instrument, that we are availing of the opportunities in the directive to be flexible, and that we are engaging in a substantial amount of deregulation of very prescriptive labour laws going back to the 1930s introduced by the Deputy's party which was in Government at the time and which have no application in the modern age.  For example, my Department receives between 12 and 14 inquiries a week because technically under the 1936 conditions of employment Act I as Minister or my staff to whom I would delegate responsibility must endorse it every time there is a change of shift pattern by a company.  That very inflexible working arrangement is being repealed in the Organisation of Working Time Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> There has been a misunderstanding.  The Minister and I had a very useful opportunity yesterday to alleviate the concerns expressed about inflexibility, and the chamber said that its main concerns were ones of perception.</P>

We are competing with the economies of the Far East, for example, Vietnam, Malaysia and other such countries.  The contribution made by American industrialists to this island is very strong, and I am strongly convinced that if we do not agree to the opt-out clause we will have difficulty creating jobs.  The genuine concern that exists is well documented and must be addressed.  Everyone I meet is concerned, and the Minister is not addressing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1989 a working group, comprising the Registrar of Friendly Societies and representatives from my Department, the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Advisory Committee, was set up to identify what should be included in new stand-alone legislation for credit unions.  Those discussions eventually developed into an intensive series of negotiations between the registrar and the league representatives which resulted in a set of proposals being submitted to my Department in 1993.  Ultimately, those proposals provided the basis for the heads of a Credit Union Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the specific request of the Irish League of Credit Unions I arranged subsequently for the Registrar of Friendly Societies to make himself available to continue to develop the detailed provisions of the forthcoming Bill.  These negotiations continued until May 1995 when, I understand, the terms of an agreement between the registrar and the league were sent to the league board.  In September 1995 the registrar and the league met and a document, endorsed by the league board, setting out what had been agreed <Col N="75" /> between them was handed to the registrar.  This agreement was subsequently submitted to my Department and passed to the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>In addition to these intensive discussions, I attended the annual general meeting of the league in 1995 and 1996 to keep the movement informed of progress on the preparation of the Bill.  In addition, I met with the league board on several occasions before publication of the Bill to review progress and I have had meetings with the Credit Union Advisory Committee also.</P>
    <P>In March 1996 following a change in the leadership of the ILCU, the league wrote to me introducing a number of ideas which were not part of the agreement between the league and the registrar. These included the concept of self-regulation by the league of its members and a proposal for a corporate credit union.  After consultation with the registrar and the parliamentary draftsman, the league was advised that neither proposal could be accepted in the context of the Bill under preparation.  The Bill was published on 18 December last and reflects as far as possible the elements agreed with the credit union movement. There are, inevitably, some areas where for policy, legal or technical reasons the Bill differs from what might have been expected.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published I have attended a special general meeting of the credit union movement held to discuss the Bill.  At that meeting I made a commitment to make available my officials and the registrar to the league representatives to discuss the concerns of the credit union movement about the Bill.  In recent weeks some two and a half days of intensive discussions have been held which, I believe, all parties felt were of benefit.  On two occasions since the Bill was published I met with the league board and I have also had two meetings with the Credit Union Advisory Committee.  As well as meeting with the two bodies representing the credit union movement, I have had discussions with several individual credit unions.  The views of all Government Departments were sought on the Bill and there are ongoing discussions with two Departments about certain aspects of the Bill.  I have received written submissions from the Irish Bankers' Federation, the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association and the Prison Officers' Credit Union.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will note therefore that there have been unprecedented consultations about the content of the Bill.  Arising from these consultations and subject to the views of the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General's office, I plan to introduce a number of Government amendments on Committee Stage, if we ever reach that stage.  I am satisfied that when enacted the new Credit Union Bill will substantially meet the wishes of the credit union movement for a comprehensive and modern framework for its future development.</P>

I appreciate the Bill was a long time in gestation and much discussion has taken place.  Given that the credit union movement is such a large and diverse body, will the Minister consider the arguments on the effect of the legislation on large credit unions as against smaller credit unions?  Last Saturday in Cork there were signs of a split within the Irish League of Credit Unions following that debate. Does the Minister of State agree the Bill is in the process of being finalised rather than a final Act? Will he intervene to avert what could be an unfortunate schism in the credit union movement?</P>

There is no need for undue frenzy, everything is under control.  I have the highest regard for the credit union movement and I share Deputy Sargent's sentiments in that regard.  I also have the highest regard for this House, which means I do not regard the published Bill as the final article.

Will the Minister of State publish the letter he received from the Irish Bankers' Federation?

I have not met representatives of the banks, but I am sure I will hear their views.  Deputy O'Keeffe speaks with tongue in cheek when he suggests that I would stay awake at night wondering if I had done the banking fraternity proud in the credit union legislation.</P>
      <P>There is little prospect of the difficulty to which Deputy Sargent referred arising.  However, he is correct in stating there is not a single view in the credit union movement.  That is one conclusion I reached after all my consultations.  In a movement comprising more than half a million people it would be surprising if there were a single view among all its members.  Members are motivated by the best interests of the movement, but there are differences in emphasis and so on.  As a result of meetings I have had, not only with the league but with individual credit unions, I have a good knowledge of where the balance lies and I would like to take Committee Stage to manifest those amendments for Members.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>At the launch of the Bill the Minister of State freely admitted the £20,000 threshold was not sufficient in terms of current building costs. He said &ldquo;it would not build a decent conservatory nowadays&rdquo;.  That observation encapsulates the shortcomings of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent one of the most urbanised rural constituencies and have been in local and national politics for a number of years.  One of my greatest regrets as a local representative is that I did not have the opportunity to organise a housing co-operative which would serve as a model to other areas.  The old meitheal principle stood people in good stead when fewer resources were available.  Organising a housing co-operative in a rural parish would help to regenerate a local population which may be drifting to large urban centres.  The credit union movement would be an ideal source of finance to provide such a structure. <Col N="79" /> However, the lending threshold of £20,000 will effectively prohibit such involvement, given building costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and other advocates of the legislation and the restrictions therein could not argue against the idea of the credit union movement participating in house building in rural areas where people have limited resources.  The Minister of State should consider that example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What level does the Deputy recommend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The movement made recommendations in its submission.  I do not know if the thresholds it suggests are adequate.  It suggests £30,000 or a percentage, depending on the capacity of the credit union to advance a loan.  I am not being critical, but I would like the Minister of State to contemplate a scenario where a group wishes to organise a housing co-operative in a rural parish.  Given the credit union movement's community focus, it should have a pivotal role in organising such activity.  It should also have an important role in setting up enterprise centres in small towns.  The threshold, however, effectively prohibits the movement's participation. I am sure there are other examples which do not spring to mind in which the movement should be able to become involved.  No legitimate argument has been made by the Minister of State's side of the House against this concept.</P>
      <P>In a response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Sargent and supplementary questions asked by other Members, the Minister of State indicated that wide-ranging consultations took place with credit unions and that he attended meetings and made officials available for consultation.  If, after all that consultation, it is necessary for the Irish League of Credit Unions to submit 77 amendments for the Minister of State and his officials to consider, it reflects a high level of dissatisfaction with the Bill's provisions.</P>
      <P>As a public representative, I received a considerable number of representations from credit union members and those involved in the running and organisation of them at local level.  The misgivings they expressed and the submission of 77 amendments mean that there will have to be a significant rethink of the Bill if it is to meet the needs and requirements of those concerned.  As a Member said, this Bill has been in gestation for some time.</P>
      <P>Are there other interests involved who believe there may be an overlap or an infringement of their area?  The Minister of State, in a reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, referred to correspondence with the banks on the matter.  Given the Bill's provisions, the banks and other financial institutions have nothing to worry about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an ideal opportunity to build on community structures so that people may do things which gain little recognition in the administrative <Col N="80" /> or political arena.  Given this opportunity to introduce beneficial legislation, we should take account of any misgivings the movement advances.  I have no reason to doubt that consultation took place, but there is a serious problem with the legislation.</P>
    <P>During the run-up to the last general election it seemed imperative that we establish a third banking force, but calls for it are not as strong today as in 1992.  The principal advocate of the third banking force was the Labour Party.  I do not know if Democrat Left felt as strongly but I am sure it was on the same wavelength.  This legislation provided an opportunity to introduce competition but it has been fudged.  I have no doubt the Minister of State is committed to the concept of community development and to building worthwhile structures in Tallaght, Clondalkin or Muirhevna Mor in Dundalk. I was glad to hear him say in response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe that he will bring forward worthwhile amendments on Committee Stage.  I hope when he responds to Second Stage, he will avail of the opportunity to outline his thoughts.  If the amendments tabled do not deal with the major amendment requirements, it will be a pointless exercise. The borrowing and savings thresholds caused the most concern and if these concerns are not addressed, the Bill will be ineffective.</P>
    <P>In families with limited incomes there is a need for discipline and routine in the organisation of family finances.  The credit union movement has fulfilled a tremendous role in that regard.  The head of the household will often go to the local credit union to lodge money with the intention of raising a loan at a later date for educational purposes or to build an extension or buy furniture. Apart from their mortgage company, they have had few dealings with commercial financial institutions.  The credit unions, which are community-based organisations, are consumer friendly.  The same cannot be said for commercial financial institutions.  When the Irish League of Credit Unions states the Minister of State should go back to the drawing board, we should sit up and take notice.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the scourge of moneylending.  Many households can find themselves in appalling circumstances when they become involved out of necessity with moneylenders.  I am sure responsible public representatives will channel any person experiencing problems with money lenders in the direction of the credit union movement, which may be in a position to help.</P>
    <P>With the passage of time people's needs and requirements change.  There should be sufficient flexibility to ensure the credit union movement does not stagnate but continues to grow and develop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this important financial Bill.  It is major legislation and ranks in importance alongside the Child Care Act, with which I was <Col N="81" /> involved for a period of over 12 months and which was considered to be progressive social legislation.  I hope this Bill will be viewed in the same way.</P>
      <P>The credit unions, which are to be found worldwide, have served their members exceedingly well for half a century and are an important source of financial support.  In recent years there has been much talk about the need for local initiatives and to adopt a bottom-up or self-help approach.  The group water schemes provide a perfect example. Their members pledge to provide the necessary capital and put the organisational structures in place in the provision of vital infrastructure with State support.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement is based on the same concept of local community involvement and management.  They have the necessary personal knowledge of and confidence in their members and shareholders which is vital in making decisions in their favour.  They are more approachable and accessible than the commercial financial institutions, which, with the aid of modern technology, transmit decisions quickly.  Bank managers have had many of their discretionary powers taken from them and tend to be dictated to from high.  They have to operate within strict parameters determined at national headquarters and regional level.  The only obstacle in the way of credit unions is the legislation under which they have to operate.</P>
      <P>Before I entered politics I was involved in the financial services sector and, therefore, have a reasonable knowledge of the industry.  Credit unions give those who do not qualify for a credit rating or financial assistance from commercial financial institutions another option to purchase a motor car, tractor or furniture or to build an extension.</P>
      <P>As the economy continues to expand, the credit unions are demanding they be allowed compete on a level playing pitch.  They are in a position similar to that in which the Trustee Savings Bank found itself.  I had the privilege of steering legislation through the House to allow it compete on a level playing pitch with the associated banks and other financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The credit unions, which are owned by their members and shareholders, are run by supervisory, credit and management committees with the assistance of extremely dedicated professional staff.  They deal with their clientele, investors and shareholders and those who require assistance on a personal and humane basis.  The commercial financial institutions, on the other hand, look at one's account balance and take one's credit record into account.  Where they are not prepared to fund small industry, the credit unions are often willing to step in and provide the necessary financial support.  Their track record allowed them, after five years or less, to go to a financial institution for a loan to expand their business, create jobs and deliver economic growth to local communities in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit union has played a key role.  It is not <Col N="82" /> only a financial and humane institution but also a major positive organisation.  Apart from its financial work, it acknowledges community development, local organisations, schools and communities. It sponsors many initiatives vital to creating economic activity and community development. Its projects are imaginative and it creates opportunities for young people.  It is open, accessible and positive unlike other financial institutions which, unless there is a major commercial opportunity, are reluctant to loan money in small communities but are prepared to spend huge amounts on a regional, city, urban or national basis because the return, according to their market research, will be greater.  They do not have much interest in local communities and the average donation from a bank to a local effort is £25.  The credit union does much more than that on a local basis by promoting the community and recognising their local membership.  Its contribution to economic and industrial development is vital.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been such a long time in gestation, I would have thought that, by the time it was published, it would satisfy the demands of the movement and that it would put the performance of credit unions on an equal footing <i>vis-à-vis</i> other financial institutions.  There are over 400 credit unions in the country with huge resources, some of which hold deposits of only £500,000 in the case of small rural communities and up to £55 million in huge urban areas of high population density.  Unions and civil and public service organisations have their own credit union movement with the facility of making automatic weekly deductions to create deposits and shares which are managed for the benefit of members. This gives them a huge advantage over people in rural Ireland who, in many cases, are ordinary individuals in need of money or have money to invest and are prepared to do so locally.  They benefit from it by investing with their credit union.</P>
    <P>In many small provincial towns, the credit union movement has made a major statement about its activities and confidence in local communities. It has invested wisely and acquired properties in key locations.  It has either built new facilities or acquired existing buildings and converted them into local, modern, financial services centres.  It behoves us as legislators to ensure we provide clear, simple, positive and protective legislation which allows the credit union movement to grow, prosper and confer facilities and services on its members similar to those of other commercial institutions.  The latter lend money, to the benefit of their directors and investors, institutional or otherwise, whereas the credit union movement confers benefits on its shareholders and members as a non-profit-making operation.  The credit union movement's tremendoes fixed assets in property in key locations in our communities are a statement that this country has made major progress and that the movement can now use its expertise and knowledge to expand its services and facilities to the benefit of <Col N="83" /> local people.  I hope this legislation will not impose further impediments on the movement.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was published, we were told that there would be no difficulty with it and that it would be supported by the movement.  From my consultation with members of credit unions, I know they are not happy with the restrictions being imposed.  I had meetings with members of various credit unions, as did my political colleagues. They told us what they felt was being proposed in the Bill from their consultations with Department of Enterprise and Employment officials and with the Minister.  I advised at those meetings that capping loans at £20,000 was ridiculous. We have been waiting a long time for legislation and it should take account of past performances, give the credit union movement confidence to expand, develop and deliver its services, utilise its resources, make a greater contribution to economic activity, sustain low interest rates and compete equitably and fairly with other financial institutions and ensure that credit union members prosper together with the country, the movement and other financial institutions.  I am not convinced from my examination of the Bill and the accompanying memoranda and documentation and from what I have heard from the Minister and the movement that this situation will prevail.</P>
    <P>I read the interview which the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, gave to <i>Review</i>, the bimonthly magazine published by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  He said he would listen to the credit union movement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the Minister of State was not listening.  I hope he will listen again to the elected representatives of the people who are part of this movement.  His Department must be advising him and he must understand that capping loans at £20,000 is lunacy and that a five year lending period is silly.</P>
      <P>I was involved with building societies.  Long before the economic developments of today and long before the level playing field, there was only one group of institutions which took account of individual citizens, their capacity to repay and family situation and allowed them to rear their family and have a reasonable standard of living over a period of time based on their age, and that was the building societies.  They have always been prepared to give long-term mortgages, so vital in easing repayments, to ensure people could make a commitment to themselves rather than being dependent on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in curtailing the credit union movement in what it seeks to deliver.  The movement has a key role to play and there is a major opportunity for it to expand.  As a member of the Government, the Minister of State has an opportunity to allow the movement expand.  A Minister of State seldom has an opportunity to introduce <Col N="84" /> such vital legislation.  The Minister of State said he was prepared to listen and must listen to the views of Members of this House.  He must be prepared to accept amendments and have an open view and a clear vision of what is in the best interests of the future of our country <i>vis-à-vis</i> the credit union movement and financial management.</P>
    <P>As we move into the next millennium, the minimum lending capacity of the movement should be £50,000.  There is no point talking about a smaller figure, but certain criteria could be laid down.  There must be consultation with the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and others. Why was the introduction of this legislation delayed for so long?  Why are the restrictions in it so severe?  Somebody did not favour it and suggested strict legislative proposals that appear to curtail the ability of the movement in what it seeks to deliver to its members.  It may have been someone in the Department of Finance.  I doubt if it is someone in the Minister of State's Department or in the Central Bank.  It may have been business people in competing financial institutions. The International Financial Services Centre is a major success story.  There is great competition between the financial institutions and economic growth is at its highest in our history. There is an opportunity to confer on another financial institution a system of financial management with benefits similar to those that apply to other institutions that will allow the movement to provide what it seeks to deliver.</P>
    <P>The minimum lending figure for the movement should be £50,000.  A minimum lending figure of £20,000 is crazy.  Farmers do not have the wherewithal to buy a new tractor which costs £50,000. A second-hand one costs £20,000.  Farmers have an account with the local creamery to which they sell milk, with the local mart to which they sell livestock and an arrangement with their local credit union to lodge their monthly milk cheque and so on.  It is important to keep business local to sustain the local community, whether in small towns taking account of the needs of small business or in rural towns which are so dependent on the local infrastructure and the demographics vital to sustain the local community.  If services are not provided locally to meet people's needs, the rural area will be denuded.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement is broadly based and has played a key role in rural and urban Ireland.  It has provided an excellent service to people who had to deal with tragic deaths and personal harassment from vicious moneylenders who charge compound interest rates.  I pay tribute to my former ministerial colleague, Deputy Woods, for his work in organising the involvement of the credit union movement to address those problems.  The Minister for Social Welfare and others have expanded on that to help people address their major financial problems.</P>
    <P>Our people are our greatest assets.  The credit union movement is the only organisation that has taken account of people's problems and provides <Col N="85" /> facilities to address them.  It takes account of people's income and whether they are employed or unemployed.  Most other financial institutions will not grant loans and other facilities to the unemployed.  The credit union movement does not operate on that basis.  It has local knowledge and a human connection that is vital to delivering a proper service to its members.</P>
    <P>It is vital the Minister amends section 35 and the maximum loan facility is made available. Some speakers suggested the limits applying to credit unions should be staggered depending on the location of the credit union and the size of its deposits.  That would be disastrous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>Anthony Hopkins got an Oscar for <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i> Some people say the Minister, Deputy Higgins, is consulting him to see if the Minister of State should get an award for &ldquo;silence of the rabbits&rdquo;.  I am not so sure he should.  The Minister of State does not stagger when it comes to dealing with some matters.</P>
      <P>Section 35 should be amended.  Irrespective of what deposits a credit union has, there should be no discrimination against any branch in terms of the limits that apply to it.  A facility in law that is available to one branch should be available to all branches.  People want to live in parts of rural Ireland that have major attractions and others wish to provide facilities in those areas.  The same facilities should be available in a credit union in Donegal or Connemara as are available in a branch in Dublin 4, 8 or 10.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill. I am not satisfied there is clarity in it.  I cannot understand why anyone would put impediments in the way of the development of the movement. I have the utmost confidence in the Minister to bring his Government colleagues on side to ensure that the parties making up the Government listen to the two Opposition parties and the Independents who want to ensure this is a positive and practical Bill.  We will give the Minister of State every co-operation to help him achieve that, but he must listen and co-operate with us.  If he does that, he will be remembered as a Minister who introduced a very important financial instrument for the future development of our nation.</P>

      <P>I, like other speakers, could speak for hours on this historic and important legislation.  I am a member of the smallest party in the three party coalition Government and I am proud of the phenomenal influence my party has had in Government.  I am also proud of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who introduced this Bill after a lapse of 33 years since the last legislation on this area was introduced.  I have no doubt he will be famous not only for tackling the publicans who had the audacity to increase the price of the pint on at least two occasions before <Col N="86" /> and after Christmas, but for introducing this magnificent legislation.  I am sure he is listening to our views.  I was delighted to hear the previous speaker applaud him for his ability to listen and to act.  He also paid the Minister of State a compliment by saying he had every confidence in him. I also have confidence in him.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and other Members know I am a grassroots politician and work closely with my constituents in the predominantly working class Dublin South Central area.  I know a great number of them are involved in and have great praise for the credit union movement. There are at least ten credit unions in my constituency. I applaud the staff of the credit union movement and the community activists who have provided a service for large numbers of decent working class families on low incomes who cannot borrow the amount of money they need from the high street banking institutions.</P>
      <P>Excellent efforts were made by the staff of Walkinstown credit union to acquire old shops owned or leased by Dublin Corporation to build a magnificent new office.  They, as well as the staff who work from premises in Galteemore Road in Drimnagh, should be applauded.  The Minister should take a trip there.  No sophisticated existing banking system compares with this magnificent project, the official opening of which I attended. The staff are impeccably presented in beautiful uniforms.  The building is of an extremely high quality with a marble facade.  The architecture is excellent and good materials have been put into the building.</P>
      <P>We should applaud the fact that the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Councillor Lynch, is an extremely active member of Donore Avenue credit union.  Without the credit union movement, the funds which many of my constituents have availed of would never have been accessible.  It is important to remember the thousands of people who followed Ireland in the World Cup tournament and whose trips to Italy were financed by the credit unions.</P>
      <P>Credit unions often help those on low incomes who wish to instal replacement windows or doors, modernise their kitchens and carry out other household improvements.  Very few people living in poor circumstances could access funding for an annual holiday to Spain or Portugal to break the monotony, without borrowing from credit unions. The credit union movement has achieved all of this.  I applaud the Minister and the credit union movement.</P>

      <P>Nobody underestimates the significant role of the credit union movement in this country.  This is a tortuous and complex Bill which has wound its way through the parliamentary process for a couple of years.  I hope the Minister will take the points raised on this side of the House into account.  Tonight, in the Green Isle Hotel in his and my constituency, the local credit union chapter is meeting.  The Minister has met with the national credit union movement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want some clarification of drug treatment programmes in the Eastern Health Board area.  I ask the Minister to meet the chairman and chief executive of the Eastern Health Board to discuss its methodology and proposals to deal with a difficult problem.  Both sides of the House want a commitment to see the right thing done.  We also want to help the community who are fortunate enough not to have come into contact with drug addiction.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, the Eastern Health Board is repeatedly seeking consultation, thereby raising people's fears.  The &ldquo;not in my backyard&rdquo; syndrome and genuine concerns are then reflected in opposition.  The Eastern Health Board then decides to do what it proposed in the first instance.  Following the consultation process and the highlighting of objections it provides methadone and other programmes for those who are prepared to enrol on them.</P>
      <P>The board has no option but to utilise current facilities for drug treatment.  Sometimes these are in the most unsuitable locations &mdash; child care clinics and Eastern Health Board clinics which provide for the normal medical requirements of young, growing areas.  There is a drugs problem in these areas and we all have to share responsibility for it.  A drug treatment centre was transferred from my constituency to Baggot Street, in Deputy Michael McDowell's constituency.  It was felt that everyone should take their own share of responsibility and that too many programmes should not be foisted on any one community, causing drug addicts to congregate there.  When a treatment centre was proposed for the rear of James Connolly Hospital, opposite an open space where children play, the parents in that area automatically assumed the centre was undesirable and unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the personnel working in the Eastern Health Board who have attended public meetings and encountered vigorous opposition. They are seen as the people foisting these facilities on communities.  The health board should ensure its role is not hijacked.  Various public representatives are purporting to solve the problem and taking on the role of health board ambassadors. A circular was sent around my constituency telling people about the drugs affliction in certain areas and that there are 30 people affected, including teenagers and young people in their 20s. These people are claiming to be pioneers for the <Col N="88" /> health board and are turning the issue into a political football.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister discusses the programme for tackling the problem with the Eastern Health Board.  It should make decisions in its best judgment and communicate these to communities. It should stop arm's length communication. When it encounters resistance, its role is hijacked by the local drugs action committees which attempt to tackle the problem by railroading over the feelings of the local community.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the provision of services for drug misusers in the Blakestown and Mountview areas, is aware that there is a drugs problem in these areas.  In developing responses and treatment facilities for drug misusers, the board has undertaken to provide services only to people from the local area.</P>
      <P>A limited counselling service is provided on the basis of appointment only in Roselawn Health Centre to clients with problems of alcohol and drug addiction.  Mountview Health Centre is used for counselling a small number of drug misusers from the local area on an occasional basis, strictly by appointment only.  No other treatment services are provided in these centres.</P>
      <P>One of the education officers, just recruited by the Eastern Health Board, will work in the Dublin 15 area providing education and training to young people and their parents.  This officer will also liaise with schools and youth groups in the area with a view to involving them in a concerted action aimed at preventing young people turning to drugs in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Lawlor's concern about the drugs problem but it must be acknowledged that, in almost every part of this city, the threat of drugs is a reality.  Unless all agencies are vigilant and take a proactive approach to the problem it may get out of hand very quickly.  Preventive measures, such as health education and counselling, play a significant part in tackling the problem at an early stage.</P>
      <P>I urge local communities to be supportive of Eastern Health Board initiatives in this area.  The board is conscious of the need to engage the support of local communities in developing services to respond to the threat drugs pose to them.  It is also aware that such support is more likely to be forthcoming if full and open consultation with communities takes place and is firmly committed to that approach.</P>
      <P>A most significant recent development throughout the city has been the positive support of local communities for locally-based initiatives. In this respect the Eastern Health Board received tremendous support from the communities of Blakestown and Mountview in identifying the nature of the services required in the area.  I hope this support will continue as it is only with integrated action that efforts to stem the rising problem of drug misuse can be addressed.</P>

      <P>A very serious dispute has arisen at the Sacred Heart School, Sunnyside in Drogheda, with a complement of approximately 600 pupils, in relation to the appointment of a vice-principal. While I do not propose to go into the respective arguments in relation to appointment procedures and subsequent disagreements, I want to express my concern for the position in which its pupils find themselves, many of whom will be sitting their junior and leaving certificate examinations in a few months time.

      <P>This dispute centres on the filling of a post of vice-principal, the subject of an appeal under the terms of the fifth memorandum on posts of responsibility agreed between the representatives of school management and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland.

      <P>The Minister for Education, of course, is greatly concerned for the well-being of these students, particularly those in examination classes.  It is essential that all parties involved make every effort to avoid any action which would increase students' anxiety at this sensitive time.  The Minister is heartened by the fact that the parties to the dispute are making considerable efforts to resolve their differences under the auspices of an agreed facilitator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to refer to the chaos obtaining in the Patents Office.  In 1996 this House passed into law the Trade Marks Bill, three years late, which would probably remain unenacted were it not that I had undertaken the bulk of the drafting in introducing a Private Members' Bill, taken over by the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and used as the model for his Government Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trade Marks Act, 1996, came into force on 1 July 1996 since when there has been complete chaos in the trade marks area.  The Irish Patents Office, which administers both our trade mark and patent law, has examined no new applications <Col N="90" /> under the 1996 Trade Marks Act.  Worse still, the Patents Office has examined no service mark applications, even though some of them predated the enactment of that legislation, dating back to 1993.  Between new applications under the 1996 Act and existing service mark applications, there are at present 10,000 applications in the pipeline, none of which has been examined or touched.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances is it not reasonable to ask the Minister in question to accept responsibility for the chaos over which he is presiding? Somebody is responsible for this matter.  Under section 6 of the Patents Act, 1992, the Controller of the Patents Office was made independent.  I understand that the incumbent has been given a contract which enables him to hold on to that office for the remainder of his working life.  I further understand that it would cost a lot of money to buy him out of that contract.</P>
    <P>The fact that he is independent in his function does not take away from the Controller's obligation to carry out his statutory duties.  My latest information &mdash; and I understand the position has worsened since I made a statement on the matter the other day &mdash; suggests that there has been complete non-co-operation, complete unwillingness to work the statute, complete dereliction of the duty to comply with basic statutory duties imposed by law on the Patents Office and the Controller in charge of it.</P>
    <P>These are serious allegations to make but I stand over them.  There has been complete non-co-operation and, as far as I can ascertain, the holder of that office has no intention of carrying out his statutory function unless the Minister insists that he should do so.  I saw a press statement from the Patents Office indicating that it proposes to begin doing its work from Monday next.  I regard that as an insult compounding the injury already done since that work should have been done all the time.</P>
    <P>The Patents Office generates a profit income for this State of £3 million in patent fees and £2.5 million in trade mark fees alone.  How one individual can decide that it is within his powers to simply throw away that State income and not carry out his functions defies belief as far as I am concerned.  Apart from the scandalous abuse of public office involved, we are also dealing with a very serious inhibition to Ireland's capacity to attract foreign investment.  I pay tribute to the work the Minister has undertaken to attract foreign investment, but if foreign investors knew that our Patents Office was being run in the manner it is, there would be a major problem in selling Ireland as a location for commercial activities using trade marks or service marks.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to give the House an undertaking that he will speak to the Controller of the Patents Office, clearly indicating to him that if that office does not discharge its functions he personally will discharge the Controller and make sure that somebody else does the work; that he will implement a crash programme to examine <Col N="91" /> outstanding applications; that he will take immediate steps to examine service mark applications; that hearings between parties where there is a dispute, now four years in arrears, will be brought up to date immediately and that the office will carry out its quasi-judicial function to resolve those disputes.  Furthermore, I want him to guarantee immediate action to ensure that assignments of trade marks, ownership changes, licence agreements and registered user agreements will be complied with immediately.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to make clear to this House now that he will insist on the Patents Office discharging its functions under the Trade Marks Act, 1996, and that he personally will ensure and guarantee to this House that its Controller will not be permitted to adopt a non-co-operative attitude. Newspaper reports suggest there are difficulties with a new computer.  The Trade Marks Act, 1996, was going through the system for three years.  If a computer was needed to operate it, it could have been bought, installed, serviced and brought up to scratch to come into operation on the same day as the Act.</P>
    <P>Some 98 per cent of the staff do not want to be relocated to Kilkenny.  Irrespective of the argument about decentralisation of the Patents Office to Kilkenny &mdash; I do not want to get involved in its merits one way or the other &mdash; it is no reason people should not do the duty cast on them by statute.  Certainly it is no excuse for a senior official who is paid by the State to refuse to carry out his functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share fully the concerns expressed by Deputy McDowell in his contribution and in his press release issued yesterday.  The Government will do all in its power to ensure that Irish trade mark law acts in the interests of business. Irish business should not be put at a disadvantage by administrative delays of the sort referred to by Deputy McDowell.  The Government would not be happy if Ireland's reputation as a competitive location for industry and commerce was undermined by such delays.  My Department, through the intellectual property unit, has introduced a number of items of legislation in the intellectual property area in the past year to ensure Ireland does not fall adrift in this area.</P>
      <P>The Trade Marks Act and rules of 1996 are by far the most significant items of legislation in that field.  The intellectual property unit is continuing its work in this technical and difficult area to ensure our intellectual property legislation is on a par with best international practices and that we have an effective intellectual property system which can be used to attract and keep international businesses in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the points raised in the Deputy's press release yesterday I instigated an initial investigation of the situation in the trade marks branch of the Patents Office.  I have ascertained the following information: the Trade Marks Act <Col N="92" /> and the trade marks regulations of 1996 came into force on 1 July 1996.  These instruments introduced a modern trade mark regime which specifically extended the capacity for registration to service marks.  The introduction of the new system called for significant changes in the trade mark registration procedure and specifically imposed an additional area of work on it in respect of the registration of service marks.</P>
    <P>The new system called for significant changes to the examination and registration procedures operating in the office under the 1963 Act and necessitated a revision of these procedures.  The new requirements under the 1996 Act meant that a number of new administrative systems had to be put in place in respect of all aspects of trade mark examination and registration.  The legislation has meant that existing procedures were overtaken and new procedures had to be planned and finalised on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>This process, given the legalistic nature of the work undertaken by the office, was painstaking and has taken some time to complete.  The delay in the finalisation of the system has led to delays in the processing of applications, which is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>On the issue of registration certificates, specifically referred to by the Deputy in his speech and in his press release, work on this item was only finalised with the trade mark agents on 26 February 1997 and work on the examination guidelines to be used by the trade mark examiners is only now reaching completion.</P>
    <P>In view of these delays it has not been possible for the trade mark examiners to start work on examining the approximate 7,000 applications which have been filed with the office since the the Act came into force.  It is the intention of the office to start examination of the applications under the Act on 10 March 1997.  This date was set long in advance of Deputy McDowell's queries.</P>
    <P>Given that examiners working in the trade marks section of the Patents Office previously succeeded in reducing a similar if not larger backlog, arising from different difficult circumstances, I am sure they will clear the backlog quickly and reach a position where there will be rapid examination and registration of trade marks under the 1996 Act.  We can count on their professional application and dedication in achieving this task.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I share his concerns about any negative feature which administrative delays of this nature might produce in the world of business.  For that reason I do not propose to let this matter lie here.  I intend to conduct a more comprehensive review of the activities of the trade marks section of the Patents Office with the Controller of Patents, Trade Marks and Designs on his return from official business in Munich on Monday next.  As part of that review I propose to involve an independent management specialist to ensure no organisational issues are impeding the work of the office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> I propose also to establish a users' council in the interests of facilitating better delivery of the industrial property services of the Patents Office. The council will be representative of such interests as the patent and trade mark agents profession, the industry, businesses and the university and scientific community.  Such a council will be useful in highlighting necessary improvements and in suggesting actions which will form the basis of change in the office's activities and structures in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the serious and important issue of Wexford coastal erosion which has brought into conflict two Government Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Higgins.  On a visit to Wexford in 1996 the Minister would have discovered how soft is the coastline of Wexford as he was taken on a trip from north Cullenstown to Courtown where many areas are becoming eroded, whether by global warming or otherwise.  Nevertheless acres of land are disappearing.</P>
      <P>In Cullenstown houses are under threat and land is eroding.  The houses are the property of local people, farmers, fishermen, retired people and regular summer visitors.  Given the storms, the people are worried that the coastline is getting ever closer to their houses.</P>
      <P>When the problem came to light about two years ago Wexford County Council addressed the issue and prepared a plan which it submitted to the Department of the Marine.  Lo and behold, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, was prepared to make available £100,000. Wexford County Council then proceeded to employ a contractor.  At this stage the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, intervened and said the money could not be spent.  This is remarkable coming from two Ministers in the same party and does not augur well for a future event.</P>
      <P>The Minister visited Cullenstown and I have no doubt he understands the seriousness of the issue. When will the money be made available?  Can the local people be assured their property, including land and houses, will be protected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the awful situation in Wexford where one person objected and the Department of the Marine hid.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht decided to take over and agreed with this individual despite the fact that 21 county councillors were anxious to see the work proceed. I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Higgins, does not care about the ordinary folk of Wexford or their property and is prepared to allow the houses disappear.  We have the money, the plan and the contractor and are ready to go ahead.  I await with interest what the Minister, Deputy Barrett, has to say.  Due to pressure, officials from the Department of the Marine, Wexford County Council, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, local interests and I visited Cullenstown <Col N="94" /> last week.  I understand the Department of the Marine was concerned about what was happening. I hope it can convince its counterparts in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht of the seriousness of the issue and that the work should proceed.  We will be in a worse position since a new area west of the ball alley needs protection.</P>
    <P>It is believed locally that had the first area been protected, there would not be the current problem in the second area.  I blame the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It is a pity there is a conflict in Cabinet between two Ministers from the same party.  Perhaps the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, will act as referee and allow the money, which we are told is available, to be spent in the interests of the people of Cullenstown and their property.</P>

      <P>Following publication of the applicant's proposal on 24 January 1996, two objections were received, one from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.  Both objectors called for an assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed coast protection works to ensure that they would not adversely affect important conservation sites in the area. The Office of Public Works originally passed on its concerns to Wexford County Council last August.

The council proposes strengthening and extending the existing groyne, cutting through the burrow and placing sand in the old channel at an estimated cost of £108,000, and has secured funding from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, for this purpose.  The application to me under the Foreshore Acts for consent to the works is on hold, pending a more detailed examination of the impact and potential impact on the protected species and habitats within the special protection area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only last week a meeting between officials of the county council, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and my Department took place to establish what additional material and studies must be provided and carried out by the local authority to allow my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, <Col N="96" /> to discharge his responsibilities under the habitats directive on behalf of the State.  It is intended, on foot of the results of the collaboration between these three bodies, to propose an overall protection and development scheme combining protection of physical and environmental resources with local economic and tourism development.</P>
    <P>In the course of the site meeting last week it was also observed in Cullenstown that the storms of the previous 72 hours had stripped an extent of sand from the beach in the vicinity of the parking area and the ball alley.  I understand the county council is proceeding with emergency remedial measures at that location.  I am aware of the concerns of the local people and I understand them.  As far as my Department is concerned, I will ensure that pressure is applied to get a final resolution of this matter so I can deal with the foreshore application.</P>

      <P>As a matter of policy, the IDA already works closely with companies in jeopardy or at a high risk of job losses or closure with a view to assisting the company to develop a long-term viable business plan.  I am advised, however, that in almost all cases companies get into difficulty because of changing market conditions and not because of employee skill problems.</P>
      <P>FÁS has a range of programmes and services available to help companies with their training needs, the main instrument being the Training Support Scheme.  This scheme is designed to increase company competitiveness, quality and productivity through upskilling from operatives to management level.</P>
      <P>Where a company is forced to close, it is the agreed responsibility of FÁS to assist employees with training and retraining, identification of job opportunities, job skills requirements and training scheme opportunities.  This is most useful in cases where employees' skills are no longer appropriate to new incoming industries.  In general, the companies with the least risk of job losses or closure tend to be those where the Irish plant has most responsibility for its own future, acting as a centre of excellence for particular products, processes or markets within the overall corporation.  This is why IDA Ireland's strategy for overseas companies already operating in Ireland focuses on each company achieving the maximum embeddedness in the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>Both Forbairt and IDA Ireland are actively seeking to increase the level of inward investment to the Border region.  As I announced on Monday, IDA Ireland is currently implementing a new regional policy for employment growth at locations outside the larger urban centres.  It is expected that in line with other locations the Border region will benefit from the bias of financial incentives in favour of regional locations, with higher grant levels as appropriate to each individual case.</P>
      <P>This policy will involve working in partnership with local authorities to have available quality, serviced sites at priority locations for new industrial investment and private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations.  IDA Ireland has been acquiring land for development in the Border region.  It will also promote all advance factory space provided by the private sector in line with the policy for the provision of all future factory space by the private sector.  IDA Ireland seeks to ensure that the supply of advance factories in any area matches the demand so that factories are not vacant for long periods and the private investors receive a return on their investments.</P>
      <P>In the Border region, an advance factory is under construction in Dundalk.  Negotiations have recently concluded between Cavan County Council and IDA Ireland to acquire a site in Cavan on which a private finance advance factory will be constructed.  A developer will be sought to provide an advance factory in Monaghan when a project has been secured for the Cavan factory.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland will work in partnership with the local authority and the private sector to ensure that they are fully aware of the needs of modern mobile investment projects.  It is in the interest of each local authority to make adequate provision for well serviced industrial lands if new industrial projects and new employment are to be secured for their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the inward investment programme for the food industry, Forbairt has also been actively marketing the Border region for investment.  The large Heinz facility in Dundalk is one of the notable successes from this approach.  Forbairt will continue to actively promote the Border region and will also apply the additional incentives <Col N="99" /> I mentioned for developments outside the major metropolitan areas.</P>
    <P>In the forest products sector the major multinational companies are strategically located on a regional basis to maximise the raw material supply. The Masonite project which will employ 330 by 1998 is a prime example of this strategy.  The impact on Leitrim and surrounding counties has already been substantial.  Smaller projects of this type will, hopefully, continue to be developed on a regional basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the results of research undertaken by the Small Firms Association were published recently under the title &ldquo;Health and Safety Standards in Small Firms&rdquo;. This research was based on the replies of 342 companies all with fewer than 50 employees and formed the basis for an address to the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health (HSA) annual conference which was held in Dublin Castle last week.</P>
      <P>I welcome this contribution by the Small Firms Association to the debate on how best to raise awareness of occupational health and safety among small firms.  The research shows that 81 per cent of companies surveyed have safety statements and 73 per cent have formal consultation arrangements with their staff.  More than half of the companies believed that proper management of health and safety issues actually helped control or reduce costs in their enterprises.  The promotion of workplace health and safety among small and medium-sized enterprises is a particular concern for the HSA.  The HSA recognises the important role the SME sector plays in the Irish economy and also the fact that this sector constitutes 95 per cent of workplaces.  It is also aware of the special needs of small businesses.  The HSA has had over the years a number of joint programmes and initiatives with various bodies representing small businesses.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the HSA will be working more intensively than heretofore with a variety of business support programmes.  The overall objective is to raise awareness among these bodies so that they routinely alert their members and clients to requirements in the area of health and safety management.  Similarly the HSA will continue to work with union groups to improve the level of their members' awareness so as to create more informed consultation in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> Among the initiatives being undertaken, the HSA is now working with my Department's county enterprise boards to help existing clients, especially at start-up stage.  Other initiatives the HSA has been involved with recently include assisting IBEC with the production of information packs for the hotel and catering industries and also for the retail and distribution sectors. The HSA is currently working with the Small Firms Association in providing information for the franchise sector.  In liaison with FÁS, the Insurance Federation (IIF) and small firms' representatives, the HSA will be investigating the establishment of safety management courses for SMEs.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that good safety management is one of the features which distinguishes successful companies and enhances their quality image, while reducing operating costs.  To help develop awareness in this area, the HSA will be conducting safety audits of 25 companies in various sectors.  It will look at their safety statement, safety consultation and representation procedures and safety management systems.  Involving the workforce in these management systems through appropriate consultation arrangements is essential if the employees are to take ownership of the issue.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the concerns of the small and medium enterprise sector will continue to be a priority for me in respect of all the services and regulatory systems operating from my Department.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which I published last year, covered a broad spectrum of matters and made recommendations relevant to a number of Departments.  At Chapter 7 the report recognised that:</P>
      <P>there is unanimous support for the principle that the primary mechanism for complaint must retain as one to the newspaper itself, and must involve rapid communication with the editor, or readers' representative, or newspaper ombudsman by the reader who has a complaint.  Any function of an outside ombudsman or press council should therefore necessarily be confined as a further step only to be availed of if a complaint, having been made to the newspaper itself, has not been dealt with to the satisfaction of the complainant.</P>
      <P>The commission recommended:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the appointment and funding by the newspaper <Col N="101" /> industry, both indigenous and imported in Ireland, of a wholly independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards not involving any possible question of defamation provided that such a complaint has first been made to the newspaper and has not been dealt with to the complainant's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>It went on to recommend a general scheme for newspapers to follow for the appointment and funding of such an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated to the House, I accept this recommendation of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.  I recently met the industry to discuss with it the course of action I was planning for progressing the commission's recommendations within my Department's area of responsibility and to get its views on these matters. At that meeting I also outlined to it my endorsement of the commission's recommendation for the appointment and funding of a wholly independent ombudsman by the industry itself.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>There are 18 areas earmarked for the Local Employment Service.  The service is currently operational in the original 14 areas, namely Cork city, south west Kerry, Waterford, Dublin north-side, Dublin inner city, County Wexford, Mayo, Dundalk, Tallaght, Finglas-Cabra, Limerick, Ballymun, Kildare and Clare.</P>
      <P>Four new areas were recently approved by Government, as follows: Drogheda, Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>In selecting the new areas, the Government gave priority to large urban areas experiencing high levels of unemployment.  I am confident that the LES can make a real impact in the four new areas that are characterised by endemic unemployment. Officials of my Department met representatives of the four new areas to organise the implementation of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Employment Service was never designed to create jobs.  The aim of the LES is to provide the gateway or access point to the full range of options which should be available to enable a long-term unemployed person return to <Col N="102" /> the world of work &mdash; these include guidance, training, education and employment supports.  Of course, at the end of a process the intention is that clients will secure employment or, at least, be far better prepared for competing in the labour market.  During 1996, the LES engaged with 7,500 clients involving some 21,000 actions &mdash; guidance, support, progression.  For 1997, with a more complete service developing in the original 14 areas and the four new areas to come on stream, I would expect that the LES will engage with some 16,500 clients.</P>
    <P>Forfás recently completed an initial review of the Local Employment Service which, while broadly positive in its conclusions, noted that the LES is still in its formative stage and needs further development to achieve its potential.  The review outlined a number of recommendations which are currently being examined in my Department to see how best we can progress the development of the LES over the coming months.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 commits the Government to the development of an effective public employment service, including the phased expansion of the Local Employment Service to all partnership areas during the period of the agreement.  I am currently reviewing options in this regard and I am anxious to ensure the provision, in a structured and well directed way, of improved information, guidance and placement services to the unemployed and the matching of individual job seekers with notified vacancies from employers.  In this context the LES will provide an intensive, client-centred service in selected disadvantaged areas to those furthest removed from the labour market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputy involve matters which are of relevance to the Department of the Environment as well as my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as my Department is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that under the Industrial Development Act 1986, Forbairt assistance is restricted to manufacturing projects and to a list of service activities designated under section 21, which to date have been confined to certain internationally-traded activities &mdash; e.g. software development, data processing, technical and consulting services, commercial laboratory services, administrative headquarters services, research and development services, media recording services, training services, publishing services, international financial services, health-care services. Therefore, very basic processes such as collection, <Col N="103" /> sorting, shredding and baling or incineration of waste materials are not supported by grants under Forbairt schemes.</P>
    <P>Forbairt can provide financial assistance to developments which are based on the use of waste as a raw material, and which are used to produce products in a traded sector.  Projects must satisfy normal commercial criteria and they are considered on their merit by Forbairt on a case by case basis.  It also provides assistance under the feasibility study grants programme to assist companies to investigate market opportunities for recycled products.</P>
    <P>Forbairt has therefore only limited information on employment in recycling activities and the number of employees in these Forbairt grant-aided activities would represent a very small percentage of those employed in recycling activities as the majority of such employment would be in the preparation of waste materials for further use &mdash; collection, sorting, baling etc.</P>
    <P>Recycling industries are eligible for assistance from the county enterprise boards, provided that they satisfy the commercial, investment and employment criteria applied by them.  During 1995 and 1996, grant aid of £365,065 was approved by the county enterprise boards for 43 recycling projects.  These projects are expected to generate 94 full-time and seven part-time jobs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the initiatives in operation to support recycling activities in the Department of the Environment.  Financial assistance to support waste recycling or provision of waste infrastructure is available through the Department of the Environment under the waste management sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99. I understand that the Department of the Environment has recently approved grants for 11 private sector waste recycling projects under this scheme and it is estimated that, when fully operational, these projects will provide approximately 53 additional jobs.</P>
    <P>REPAK is a voluntary industry initiative which was launched in February 1996 to co-ordinate and finance the collection and recycling of packaging waste.  I understand that interested businesses are currently being invited to participate in the scheme.</P>

    <P>However, as the Deputy will also be aware, following recent publicity on this matter which arose <Col N="104" /> because of the reported increases in the price of a pint of beer, the Competition Authority has decided to invoke its new powers under the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996 to commence a study of the Irish drinks market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply to a large number of questions in recent times on the issue of regional dispersal of job opportunities, both I and the Government are fully aware of concern about the issue.</P>
      <P>While indicating in these replies the very real constraints under which IDA Ireland must operate, in particular the fact that choice of location is ultimately for the promoter in the context of what he perceives to be the best interests of the project, I have also emphasised the Government's determination that everything possible will be done to ensure that the benefits of our recent economic success are spread throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It was in this context that I announced last Monday a new emphasis on locations outside larger urban centres which is elaborated on in replies to separate questions today.  Specifically, in relation to the western region, I would point out that almost 840 new first time jobs were created in IDA supported overseas companies in 1996, continuing the new job creation trends of the past two years.</P>
      <P>The western region is now host to 60 overseas companies extending across the health-care and medial devices, electronics, engineering, telecommunications, software and internationally-traded services sectors.  These sectors provide permanent job opportunities for well over 9,100 people, representing an increase of 7 per cent in the numbers employed in overseas firms compared to 1995 and, indeed, earlier this week I announced a major expansion for the Boston Scientific Group in Ballybrit to provide an additional 1,000 jobs in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> Notwithstanding this positive performance, the IDA is acutely aware that the major proportion of the new jobs created in the region were in fact created in Galway city and county.  In full recognition of this, the IDA will be redoubling its efforts in 1997 to achieve a more balanced dispersal of new jobs across the whole region.</P>
    <P>Despite a less than satisfactory level of new job creation in County Mayo, it was gratifying that so many of the county's overseas companies increased their workforces and indeed strengthened their roots in the local economy through the securing of additional business functions.</P>
    <P>While a total of 197 jobs were created in IDA assisted companies in the north west/Donegal region in 1996, after losses of 471 jobs net employment fell by 174.</P>
    <P>Since January, the following announcements have been made for the region: Westmark, from Germany, announced its intention to establish a mechanical kitchen aids project in Carrick-on-Shannon and provide 88 jobs.  Lilly Industries announced its intention to establish an industrial coatings facility in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, creating 12 jobs.  Abbott Laboratories announced its intention to expand its operation at Finisklin, Sligo for the manufacture of diagnostic kits and a new sterilisation facility which will create an additional 50 jobs.</P>
    <P>In the forest products sector the major multinational companies are strategically located on a regional basis to maximise the raw material supply. The Masonite project, which will employ 330 by 1998, is a prime example of this strategy.  The impact on Leitrim and surrounding counties has already been substantial.  Smaller projects will continue to be developed on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the purchase of land and the construction of new buildings in both Sligo and Letterkenny will prove beneficial in securing further new projects.</P>
    <P>As indicated in reply to a separate question, the disappointing performance in job creation in 1996 in the north east region was almost exclusively due to the substantial job losses of approximately 500 in Keytronic, Dundalk during the year.  New projects announced during 1996 for the north east region, EPC Corporation and DSC Communications, are currently in start-up phases and therefore will not offset the job losses in 1996.  However, over the next few years these projects are expected to create significant employment and will assist in re-establishing growth across the region.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is actively responding to the challenge of attracting new inward investment to the north east region through the acquisition of land for development, and an advance factory is under construction in Dundalk.  This factory is being promoted by the IDA.  A new industrial site is being acquired in Cavan and this will be developed and a private developer for an advance factory will be sought.</P>
    <P>A developer will be sought to provide an <Col N="106" /> advance factory in Monaghan when a project has been secured for the Cavan factory.</P>

      <P>The target for Forbairt-assisted companies is 12,000 new jobs, 14,500 for firms assisted by IDA Ireland, 1,500 for Shannon Development assisted companies and 3,000 gross new jobs for enterprises assisted by the county enterprise boards.</P>
      <P>There will of course be some job losses which will offset these gains; while it is not possible to determine these in advance, I expect the downward trend in job losses to continue.</P>

      <Quest>the efforts, if any, which will be made by the Government in order to redress the imbalance of jobs created by the IDA in 1996 in view of the fact that 71 per cent of the jobs funded by the IDA were in Dublin and only 0.86 per cent were in the west of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the figures quoted by the Deputy bear no relationship to the actuality of IDA new jobs created in 1996 as supplied to me, the real situation being considerably better than that portrayed by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A critical part of IDA Ireland's remit is to achieve the most equitable spread of development across all regions of the country.  IDA Ireland continues to devote considerable resources, energy and enthusiasm to this task and in fact in 1996 a total of 62 projects were approved to locate in areas outside the eastern region.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a fundamental shift in the mix of the IDA's business in recent years.  More than half of all job creating investments are not mobile because they come from existing overseas companies expanding their operations and these companies usually expand on their existing site. Many of the new technology-based and larger-scale investments have requirements that can only be met near large urban centres.  If Ireland does not provide the support services, infrastructure and logistics they require in or near a large urban centre, they will go elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From IDA Ireland's experience of seeking more greenfield and expansion investments in the marketplace, it is known that in the first instance the country as a whole has to win the project against increasingly severe competition.  Then <Col N="107" /> IDA Ireland has to try to get the best possible distribution across the country.  No location, county or region has an automatic right to new investment &mdash; it has got to be that bit better, more attractive, more competitive at meeting the needs of the new investor than many other similar locations in the UK and all across Europe.</P>
    <P>Results for 1996 show that IDA Ireland is achieving a spread outside the east coast and especially at locations such as Cork, Limerick, Galway, Tipperary and Wexford and will do even better in achieving regional dispersal as initiatives taken in 1996 begin to take effect.</P>
    <P>In terms of actual jobs as opposed to promised jobs, there is in fact quite a positive spread into all the larger population centres around the country. For example, County Galway saw an 11 per cent increase in actual employment in IDA supported companies in 1996.</P>
    <P>To achieve a better regional distribution of jobs across the country requires a strong co-operative approach between the IDA, local authorities and infrastructure-service providers.  For its part the IDA, in 1997, is:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way it can, including higher grant levels as appropriate,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; Working closely with local authorities to have available quality sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>While in the final analysis it will be the companies that will decide location based primarily on the competitiveness and general level of attractiveness of individual locations, the Government is determined that every effort will be made to ensure a fair dispersal of projects throughout the country.  It was in this context that I announced the new policy emphasis on employment growth at locations outside the larger urban centres, with the components outlined above and including additional IDA executives at senior level to oversee this new focus.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the disappointing number of overseas jobs established in counties Cavan and Monaghan in spite of the commitment of the US and EU to the regeneration of the Border economy; the plans, if any, he has to ensure a greater level of overseas investment to the Border region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the number of overseas <Col N="108" /> jobs in counties Cavan and Monaghan is disappointing in comparison to other counties.</P>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of IDA Ireland and Forbairt, Monaghan and Cavan have not attracted significant overseas investment in recent years.  Both agencies are committed, under my direction, to maximising their efforts to move more investments from major population centres to appropriate regional locations.  Redressing the situation in the Border region is a particular feature of the strategy which I announced last Monday for employment growth at locations outside the larger urban centres.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, decisions on where to locate are made by potential clients themselves on the basis of competitive advantage and one clear factor which will influence the winning of projects is, without doubt, the level of industrial competitiveness a location can offer by way of infrastructure and a positive business environment. Having said that, agency policy will now involve, <i>inter alia</i>, higher grant levels as appropriate and the stimulation of advance factory construction at key locations.</P>
      <P>It is also worth emphasising that the US and EU funding to the Border counties does not directly impact on the promotional activities of IDA Ireland and Forbairt in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>More specifically, Forbairt is working with existing overseas companies in the food processing sector in the north east region to encourage them to further develop their operations. Abbott Laboratories Limited recently announced an $18 million expansion of its Cootehill nutritional facility resulting in an additional 25 jobs.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is also progressing developments from within its property budget and negotiations have recently concluded between Cavan County Council and IDA Ireland to acquire a site in Cavan town on which a privately financed advance factory will be constructed.  A developer will be sought to provide an advance factory in Monaghan when a project has been secured for the factory in Cavan.</P>
      <P>Finally, the IDA has recently upgraded its Knockaconny Industrial Park near Monaghan town, a site comprising approximately 15 acres which are fully serviced and immediately available for promotion to overseas investors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the buoyancy of the Irish economy under this Government which has led to an unprecedented rate of employment growth and a continuing fall in unemployment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, last year I published a comprehensive strategy paper on the labour market, Growing and Sharing our Employment, which set out the three main aims of labour market policy: high levels of job creation; maintaining incentives to work; and improving access to jobs for those at a labour market disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Among other things the paper set out a number of strategies to improve employment growth and an affirmative action strategy for improved access to jobs.</P>
      <P>The broad task of these strategies is to improve the efficiency and enhance the equity of the operation of the labour market.  The Government has, over the last two budgets in particular, adopted a range of measures to facilitate the transition from unemployment to employment, including retention for a period of secondary benefits and medical cards, a reduced tax burden on lower income groups, significant improvements in the family income supplement, additional places on the back-to-work allowance scheme and new aids to recruitment such as Jobstart and Workplace.</P>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs in my Department recently announced a package of proposals ranging from flexible working hours to career breaks, aimed at facilitating greater work sharing arrangements in the public service. These are now to be the subject of discussion between public service unions and individual Departments.  These represent a very useful contribution towards a more flexible working environment, facilitation of atypical working patterns and the prospect of a greater sharing of available jobs.</P>
      <P>While the strategy paper on the labour market concluded that basic income was not currently a viable option, I advise the Deputy that the recently negotiated Partnership 2000 agreement includes an agreement that a further independent appraisal of the concept and its implications will be undertaken.  This will build on the work already done in this area such as that of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare, the ESRI and CORI, together with international research.  It is envisaged that a broadly-based steering group will oversee the study.</P>

      <P>Many of the programmes run by FÁS are intended for particular unemployed target groups.  For example, both community employment and the pilot jobs initiative are targeted at those registered as long-term unemployed whose main or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  However, the fact that resources are limited means that it is not possible to make places on the programmes available to all those unemployed.</P>
      <P>While FÁS training programmes are, in principle, open to all persons who are unemployed and seeking work, priority of access is given to persons on the live register, regardless of gender. I am satisfied that the eligibility criteria for participation in these programmes, and the kind of prioritisation they represent, are fair, objective and cost effective.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, FÁS has operated an action programme for women to maximise the participation of women in all its programmes.</P>
      <P>FÁS has also been providing courses such as return to work and enterprise training, which have a high proportion of female participation, particularly among home-makers.</P>
      <P>In 1995, 14,228 women participated in FÁS training programmes, 42.2 per cent of total participants. This was an increase of 10.5 per cent on the 1994 figure of 12,867.  In recent years, FÁS has tried to promote and improve flexibility in an effort to maximise the various provisions for training for women.  In a recent example of the initiatives being taken, FÁS has advised me that it is undertaking a pilot programme aimed at developing and testing new ways of delivering training for women.  This particular initiative, which is being piloted under the NOW, New Opportunities for Women, programme, aims to provide locally-based training in partnership with community groups.  This training is delivered in a flexible manner to suit the varied needs and circumstances of participants.  The project is currently operating in Clonmel, Tipperary and Athlone.  If successful, FÁS proposes to introduce this approach on a national basis and, by so doing, will allow a large number of women to avail of training in a cost effective manner.</P>
      <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for child-care facilities for women returning to work, and contributes over £5 million per annum to community-based child-care provision by way of support for CE projects.  Over 130 CE projects have such a child-care dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community-based child-care for women undertaking training or education.</P>
      <P>Finally, through its action programme, FÁS has continually sought more and better ways of meeting women's training and employment needs, and I am satisfied that the increase in the numbers of women availing of FÁS services provides ample evidence to suggest that its efforts in this regard are bearing fruit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now some nine months since the publication of my Department's strategy statement Promoting Employment and the launch of Delivering Better Government which sets out the Government's plans for change under the Strategic Management Initiative.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1993, my Department has continually worked to improve its structure and operations to respond better to the needs of its customers.  The Deputy will appreciate that the SMI is a process and that its successful implementation will be reflected in the day-to-day delivery of the work of the Department.  It is important to stress that it is not something that should be considered as separate from the proper work of the Department.  Indeed, many officials at all levels within the Department are involved in activities within the Strategic Management Initiative as an integral part of their work.  The SMI process is supervised by a senior management group consisting of the secretary of the Department, the assistant secretaries and the planning officer, together with the chief executive of Forfás.</P>
      <P>Prior to the publication of the strategy statement, the Department undertook a structured survey of staff perceptions of how the Department fulfils its mandate and their role in that process. A number of areas were identified as being in need of improvement, for example, clarification of objectives at various levels, internal communication and staff development, including management abilities, and customer service issues.  On foot of this and informed by the broad thrust of the SMI, a number of specific initiatives have been taken and others are in train.  Broadly they are as follows: a working group within the Department is at present examining the resources to meet priorities and also examining appropriate indicators of performance.  This exercise is central to considering how effectively and efficiently the Department is delivering its service.  I place very great importance on this exercise.</P>
      <P>Proposals being finalised are intended to allow greater autonomy to the Department's agencies, allied to greater accountability and measurement of performance, to secure a more efficient and responsive delivery of services.</P>
      <P>A quality service group is finalising guidelines to assist staff in implementing a users' charter. In the area of staff development, guided by the recommendations of a human resources group, there have been developments in the areas of staff training, staff appraisal and integration of new staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A departmental communications group has been addressing how we can improve our <Col N="112" /> communications within the Department and how we communicate with out external customers. This is being addressed in parallel with how we approach quality service issues.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the SMI is a process and not something which is simply grafted onto the Department from outside.  The general approach emphasises good management, the proper development and use of staff capabilities, clear identification of responsibilities, together with measurement of performance and accountability, delivery of a first class service to customers and the best use of modern financial management practices and information technology.</P>
    <P>I am confident that we will continue to see significant progress in this area in the course of 1997.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that about £31,000 has been spent to date on specifically SMI related matters such as printing, design and consultancy work.</P>

That comprehensive report will be published in the near future.  One of the challenges facing both Government and industry will be to have regard to the social aspects of the information society in the implementation of the strategy and action plan.</P>

    <P>I am pleased to say that the net change in employment in relation to Forbairt client companies in the Border counties over the past two years, 1995-96, has yielded a total of 409 net jobs.</P>
    <P>In terms of reporting progress on the programmes, a number of partnerships between Irish and US firms have been established over the two year period and negotiations are ongoing with other potential multinational clients.  While it is expected that jobs will eventually emerge from this process, these will come about more in the long, rather than the short term.</P>
    <P>The 1995 Washington conference and the 1996 Pittsburgh conference helped primarily to put the focus on the area as a potential location for new US inward investment, resulting in a number of schemes being put in place, geared towards establishing partnerships between Irish and US companies.</P>
    <P>The North American Partnership Programme for the Border Counties (NAPP), promoted by Forbairt and the International Fund for Ireland, aims to encourage partnerships with Irish companies in the six Border counties.  Phase 1 was launched in February 1995, resulting in nine partnerships being created.  Phase 2 was launched in May 1996, with ten companies involved in it and five more companies are expected to join the programme during 1997.  The benefits in terms of jobs from these agreements will be realised over a two to three year period.  Already four companies participating in NAAP have attracted venture capital investment of approximately £1 million which augurs well for their success.</P>
    <P>The American Management Business Internship Training Programme (AMBIT) was launched at the Washington conference.  It is also designed to help foster partnerships between companies in the region and suitable US businesses. To date six companies from the region have participated in this programme.</P>
    <P>In November 1995, the US-Ireland Business Partnership Programme was launched in order to facilitate and support the forging of business partnerships between Irish and US small enterprises. To date, seven partnership arrangements have resulted from the first business partnership mission which also took place at this time and a further four situations where negotiations are at an advanced stage.  A further mission took place in Chicago in June 1996, which has resulted in four partnership agreements being arranged and a further ten are under negotiation.</P>
    <P>The foregoing programmes are just a small sample of what is currently happening in terms of Irish/US partnerships.  My Department and the agencies which fall within my remit also have been and continue to be involved in a number of cross-Border initiatives to promote and develop industry, these being as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; The ACUMEN Programme is a cross-Border sales/business development programme. It supports small and medium companies to increase cross-Border sales and to develop other forms of commercial co-operation in both parts of Ireland.  The programme is actively supported by the main economic development agencies, including Forbairt, FÁS and Cavan County Enterprise Board.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; The IFI/Business Enterprise Programme aims to stimulate local enterprise, create awareness of the potential for self-employment and encourage business to grow profitably, develop and seek new markets and to increase their competitiveness.  Forbairt and Cavan County Enterprise Board are represented on the management board of the programme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; Another initiative, apart from the White House conference, to help accelerate industrial and economic development as an aid to promoting a permanent cessation of violence is the EU initiative for a Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties, the Delors package.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; In addition, there is the INTERREG Programme which is an EU initiative for the Border counties and Northern Ireland, excluding Belfast.  This has proved a very useful addition in relation to my Department's various promotional strategies.</P>
    <P>The agencies have found that the key factor in promoting successful overseas investment to the <Col N="115" /> Border counties, as well as the rest of the country, is the availability of the type of infrastructural environment consistent with the needs of modern industrial and service undertakings.  The Government, through its various industrial development policy measures, is committed to creating such an environment and the agencies, for their part, are working hard to assist Irish firms improve their competitiveness and so increase their attractiveness to overseas clients.</P>

      <P>There are many possible implications for computer systems, for example, a computer programme calculating ages could mistakenly consider someone born in 1925 to be 25 years old and not 75.  Applications could also sort dates incorrectly.  Banks calculating interest levels could find that programmes yield seriously incorrect values.  Telecom operators could have problems with their switching hardware and charging problems.</P>
      <P>It is of course, a matter for individual businesses and other users of computer systems to assess the implications of the year 2000 for their systems and to determine the solution.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the considerable press coverage that this issue has already received, I am anxious to assist in raising awareness of the potential problem.  To this end, at my request, Forfás has prepared a report on this issue and meetings have taken place between officers from my Department, the industrial development agencies and industry representative bodies to explore how best to proceed with an awareness campaign focused on business.  In addition, the Director of Consumer Affairs intends to consult with industry generally and will then determine what actions might be appropriate to advise consumers in this matter.</P>
      <P>It is not clear that a helpline would be practical or useful given the need for each business or user to assess the implications for their individual systems and in view of the wide-ranging variety of problems which the century change will cause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me indicates that research and development by Irish owned manufacturers and internationally trading service businesses is currently at a very high level by historical standards and growing rapidly.</P>
      <P>The office of science and technology manages a range of programmes through the research and development sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Industry 1994-99 to stimulate awareness of the need for innovation and to assist industry to engage in high quality product and process development.</P>
      <P>These programmes include the provisions of cash grants towards the cost of research and development under the industry initiative, more commonly known as Measure 1, which has a total budget of £105 million for the period of the operational programme.  To date, some £94 million of this budget has been allocated.  Of this amount, £42 million has gone to over 300 Irish owned companies which have committed to invest in 790 research and development projects involving expenditure of £97 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, the research and development sub-programme provides assistance and funding for the recruitment of key technical staff; education programmes in the management of research and development and help in the identification of overseas technology partners.</P>
      <P>The Government's plans for the development of the support framework have been set out in the White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation.  One of the recommendations in the White Paper provides for the ongoing monitoring of the Measure 1 scheme to ensure that enterprises are using it to undertake additional and new research and development activity and that the number of research and development performers &mdash; particularly indigenous companies &mdash; is increasing.</P>
      <P>In addition, the White Paper recognises the need to bring about a significant culture shift in attitudes towards the awareness of the importance of science and technology research and development to economic and social development. The historical failure of the majority of Irish firms to appreciate the contribution which investment in science, technology and innovation can make to maintaining and upgrading their business reflected a wider national disaffection with these matters.  A negative attitude to the process of commercialising and exploiting science, technology and innovation could and would undo much of the good work of the specific measures referred to above which are aimed at increasing innovation in firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To counteract this, Forfás has commenced a three year awareness campaign promoting science, <Col N="117" /> technology and innovation (STI) at all levels of society, including industry.  The establishment of such an awareness campaign was one of the key recommendations in the science, technology and innovation White Paper.</P>
    <P>I believe that already there is a cultural shift taking place within indigenous industry which recognises the need to perform research and development in order to remain competitive.  The above figures which I have outlined to the House confirm this.  The results of this change are beginning to flow and should continue in the coming years.</P>

      <P>The construction industry in Ireland is currently enjoying significant growth in demand with output expected to have increased by 13 per cent in 1996, following an increase of 14 per cent in 1995.  Output in the industry is expected to be £5,725 million in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> Direct employment in building and construction increased by almost 6 per cent to 81,500 at mid-April 1995 on year earlier levels, and is estimated to have increased a further 6 per cent to 86,200 at mid-April 1996.  Allowing for indirect employment, estimated at 40 per cent, the total number of persons employed in construction was 114,100 in 1995, or 9 per cent of the 1.2 million persons employed in the State.  Based on labour force estimates of construction unemployment, the industry's unemployment rate fell to almost 12 per cent in 1995 from over 20 per cent in 1992-3.</P>
    <P>In relation to the current demand for skilled operatives, FÁS, through the construction industry training committee, has recently developed a manpower forecasting system to assist employment and training planners and, in particular, the construction industry, to match future demands for skills.  The social partners, including the construction industry itself, are represented on this committee.  The model which has been developed will provide a framework for the future and will form the basis for a process of continuous development.  The system is capable of estimating demand for 25 construction occupations at a national and regional level.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in the number of apprentices being recruited in the industry with, for example, the intake off bricklaying and plastering increasing by 100 per cent between 1993-94 and 1995-6.  The new standards-based apprenticeship training system will ensure that the skills of craftworkers employed in the construction industry will be up to best practice standards.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there has been a significant increase in the number of first year apprentices on the new standards-based scheme, which will contribute to the overall number of craft persons. The new manpower model will provide greater accuracy in predicting future skills needs.</P>

      <P>The Irish software industry survey is only conducted every second year.  Its results for 1995 indicate that employment in the indigenous software sector was 3,801 in 1991, rising to 4,495 in 1993, an average annual increase of 9 per cent per annum, and increasing to 5,773 in 1995, an average annual increase over the period 1993-5 of approximately 15 per cent.  Indications for 1996 are that this trend has been maintained and is <Col N="124" /> likely to continue.  There are approximately 400 indigenous software companies are Ireland.  The survey findings indicate that 80 per cent of all indigenous software companies are now involved in exporting to some extent.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises software as a strategic sector for Ireland and as a measure of that recognition, Ireland is unique in Europe as the only country with a Government backed national software directorate with specific responsibility for the development and growth of the sector. The national software directorate within Forbairt was established to develop measures in co-operation with the software industry which will stimulate growth and fully exploit the industry's potential. It is a unique office within Forbairt and recognises the very significant opportunity that this high growth industry represents for the Irish economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>In April 1996 I launched the software venture capital fund.  This is a specialist fund focused on investing in Irish software related companies.  The fund is managed by the ICC and it is intended to invest £10 million over a five year period.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week I announced, along with my colleague, Deputy Bhreathnach, Minister for Education, an action plans on skills, which includes measures to provide additional skilled personnel to assist the development of the software sector.</P>
      <P>Forbairt has targeted international services, including software, as a key sector of Irish owned industry with the potential for significant future growth in employment creation and development of export earnings.  Forbairt's international services programme provides advice and consultancy support on service business development and a package of incentives and support facilities for Irish companies involved in a range of internationally-traded-services, including software. The programme is designed to capitalise on the global growth of services and to build on Ireland's established record as a base for providing services on an international scale.  This is achieved by promoting and assisting new indigenous company start-ups and the expansion of existing Irish firms through Forbairt's regional offices around the country.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance in the form of equity investment and grants, allied to advice, consultancy and expertise is helping Irish companies to become established and grow by strengthening their business development capability, competitiveness and profitability.</P>

      <P>In 1995 client companies of IDA Ireland created 230 new jobs in Waterford city and county.  In 1996, the comparable figure was 269 jobs.  During 1996, IDA Ireland assisted five expansions and one new project in Waterford city and county which in total will create approximately 300 additional new jobs over the next two to three years.</P>
      <P>The number of new greenfield manufacturing projects attracted to Ireland in any year is limited and many of these have specific locational requirements.  Ultimately the choice of location is made by the company but experience of other overseas companies in an area can contribute to a company's decision-making process.</P>
      <P>The development of the new port in Waterford harbour, which has doubled container capacity and recently completed improvements to the Waterford-New Ross road, will enhance the area's attractiveness for new inward investment.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is currently actively promoting the following sites and buildings in Waterford city and county to overseas investors:&mdash; new high specification 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory which is under construction in Waterford city; new 21,000 sq. ft. advance factory which has been recently completed in Dungarvan, County Waterford; two newly refurbished units of 36,155 sq. ft. and one stand alone unit of 19,500 sq. ft. in Waterford industrial estate being promoted for international services projects; strategic site purchased at Belview adjacent to the new Waterford Port &mdash; 40 acres.  Additional land purchase is being investigated and in addition the IDA is working closely with Waterford Corporation to establish a new business and technology park in the city.</P>
      <P>The restructuring of the IDA team in the area is an internal operational matter for IDA Ireland and one in which I have no direct function.  I understand, however, that the administrative changes introduced are working well to the benefit of the region and are being monitored to ensure that this continues to be the case.</P>
      <P>Of the firms assisted by Forbairt, while there were net job losses of 95 in Waterford city and county in 1995, in 1996 there were net gains of 347 jobs, 257 of which were in Waterford city and 90 in Waterford county.</P>
      <P>Since the city and county enterprise boards were established in late 1993, they have tapped into a new source of enterprise at a level previously not supported by the State agencies.  I am confident that the boards will continue to provide valuable assistance to new and existing micro-enterprise companies throughout Waterford city and county.</P>
      <P>Over 290 full-time and 50 part-time jobs were created in Waterford city and county in CEB-assisted enterprises in 1995 and 1996, according to figures supplied by the boards.</P>

      <P>The Government welcomes the conference held on 28 January last, in Dundalk, organised by the Joint business council of IBEC-CBI Northern Ireland.  The aim of the conference was to further promote the Dublin-Belfast corridor area as an important means of accelerating the development of North-South business links.</P>
      <P>Interested parties from the US, Canada, Great Britain and Italy were represented, where similar economic corridors are flourishing.  Representatives from the EU Commission were also present. I understand that following the very positive response received at the conference, the joint business council is developing a business plan and long-term strategy for the corridor area.</P>
      <P>The work of the joint business council, through its task force, in promoting the economic corridor is aimed at complementing rather than replacing existing cross-Border initiatives and in the light of the potential contribution it can make to both economic well-being and cross-Border co-operation on the island as a whole, I shall be watching its deliberations with interest.  I am pleased to note that the Secretary of my Department played an active role in the preparatory work for this very worthwhile activity.</P>
      <P>It is worth stressing, however, that an economic corridor as proposed would be but one strand of a variety of initiatives and my Department and the agencies which fall within my remit have been and continue to be involved in a number of such cross-Border initiatives to promote and develop industry.  These are dealt with in my reply to Deputy Leonard's separate question today.</P>

      <P>A critical part of the remit of the agencies for which I have responsibility is to achieve the most equitable spread of development across the regions of the country.  This is a matter in which I maintain a continuing interest through regular visits to the various regions.  This ensures that I have first-hand knowledge of how the policy is being given effect.</P>
      <P>To achieve a better regional distribution of jobs across the country requires a strong co-operative approach between the development agencies, local authorities and infrastructure/service providers and the local community.  I am ensuring that this approach is pursued by the agencies for which I have responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the county enterprise boards were established <Col N="127" /> in 1993 they have played a key role in developing local enterprise throughout the country. They have created over 8,500 full-time job equivalents.  These jobs have been created in every county in the State and reflect the potential for job creation represented by local development initiatives.  I am confident that the support provided by the boards will continue to ensure the development of micro-enterprise and job creation throughout all regions of the State.</P>
    <P>Results for 1996 show that IDA Ireland is achieving a spread outside the east coast and especially at locations such as Cork, Limerick, Galway, Tipperary and Wexford.  In terms of actual jobs as opposed to promised jobs, there is in fact quite a positive spread into all the larger population centres around the country.</P>
    <P>As I announced in Galway earlier this week, this year IDA Ireland is pressing ahead with the implementation of a regional policy for employment growth at locations outside of the larger urban centres.  This new policy involves: favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way it can.  Financial incentives will now be biased in favour of smaller regional locations, with higher grant levels as appropriate to each individual case; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations; working closely with local authorities to have available quality sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is devoting additional resources at a senior level to oversee this new focus.</P>
    <P>While in the final analysis the companies themselves decides on location, taking account of competitiveness and available infrastructure, this new regional focus will give an added bonus to smaller locations.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise a fundamental shift in the mix of the IDA's business in recent years. More than half of all job creating investments are not mobile because they come from existing overseas companies expanding their operations and these companies usually expand on their existing site.  Second, many of the new technology-based and larger scale investments have requirements that can only be met near larger urban centres.  If Ireland as a country does not provide the support services, infrastructure and logistics they require in or near large urban centres, they will go elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is also ensuring that a good geographical spread of developments is maintained. Specialist technology transfer executives are based in the Forbairt regional offices in order to specifically bring the benefits of these initiatives to all areas and it is intended that a greater focus will be put on these activities in 1997.</P>
    <P>Forbairt also operates a linkage programme which works with companies to maximise the amount of raw materials, components and other major purchases.  Significant progress was made <Col N="128" /> in 1996 in extending the benefits of this programme to all the regions, and executives in regional offices will be focusing on this activity in 1997.  Forbairt is taking steps to exploit developments, under the Small Business Operational Programme &mdash; Measure 3, which examines initiatives for extending the range of supports and assistance to service businesses.  Given the nature of the projects which can emerge in this sector, it is likely that they will contribute to a wider dispersal of new employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has had unprecedented success in attracting multinational corporations to locate in Ireland in recent years.  The largest achievements have been in the electronics, software and tele-servicing sectors.  Over the past two years alone, Ireland has attracted over 40 new electronics companies and 33 of the existing companies have announced expansion plans.  Furthermore, the number of tele-based call centres has increased to 40 in the same period.  The Government is determined to ensure that there will be an adequate supply of suitably qualified young people to fill vacancies in these sectors now and in the future.</P>
      <P>The Action Plan on Skills is the Government's strategic approach to the opportunities coming up the track.  I have announced, along with my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach, the details of this Cabinet-backed package of measures to address the future skills needs of business on Tuesday, 4 March 1997.</P>
      <P>The Action Plan Skills includes an increase in the number of places on one year post graduate courses in computer applications.  The output from this one year programmes, including those under the Advanced Technical Skills Programme, will be over 800 this year.  It is planned to increase this output to 1,250 for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>An increase in the number of third level languages places:&mdash; 750 extra places per annum in post leaving certificate courses; 250 extra places per annum in regional technical college courses with language content and placement abroad for 1,000 students per annum.</P>
      <P>A bidding process with educational and training institutions both in the public and private sectors to identify the most cost-effective way of providing an extra 1,000 software graduates per annum and 750 technical places per annum.</P>
      <P>A steering committee, chaired by Noel Lindsay, Chairman of the Higher Education Authority, to oversee the bidding process &mdash; the other four members of the committee are Peter Baldwin, Department of Enterprise and Employment; Eugene O'Sullivan, Department of Finance; Linda Gaynor, Farrell Grant Sparks and William McAteer, Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> An urgent examination by officials from the Departments of Education, Enterprise and Employment, and Finance of the opportunities for increased utilisation of the existing training and education infrastructure to generate additional software places.</P>
    <P>The officials group will also address the cost implications of the overall package and report with the results of the bid process and associated costs.</P>
    <P>The establishment of regional fora, involving FÁS, third level colleges and industry with a view to designing innovative ways of meeting the needs of local industry, particularly for technicians in the electronics industry.  These fora are to make an initial report within three months. Options include upgrading the skills of existing crafts people, extending specialised FÁS Traineeships, distance learning options, adding new modules to traditional apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the comprehensive, integrated approach being adopted by Government is the appropriate strategy to ensure that we continue to benefit from the job creation opportunities that we have exploited to successfully in recent years.</P>

    <P>Also in relation to Louth Country Enterprise Board, the following is the position: CEB &mdash; since end of 1993 to end 1996 &mdash; number of full-time jobs in place &mdash; 182.  The Deputy will note from the foregoing that quite substantial gains in employment were recorded in County Louth at <Col N="131" /> the beginning of the four year period 1993-1996. Regrettably, 1996 saw an increase in jobs lost which was due almost exclusively to the substantial job losses arising during the year in Keytronic, based in Dundalk.  However, I understand that, as a direct response to the situation in Keytronic, a new advance factory is due to commence construction shortly in Dundalk.  This is expected to be available for promotion by mid-year.</P>
    <P>Also, a number of new projects for the Louth area were announced during 1996.  These included Engineered Plastic Components Ltd (EPC) and DSC Communications.  While these projects are only in start-up phase at the moment, it is anticipated that EPC will create 297 jobs while DSC expects employment growth of 475 jobs.  Such a significant contribution to employment levels in Louth will greatly assist in re-establishing growth across the north east region.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the number of new greenfield manufacturing projects attracted to Ireland in any year is limited and many of these have specific locational requirements which reduces their mobility within the country.  Ultimately, the choice of location is made, not by the development agencies, but by the company itself taking account of competitive advantages such as infrastructure and business environment. Regional dispersal of new overseas companies is a priority for this Government and much effort and resources have been, and will continue to be, invested in securing this important objective, IDA Ireland, for example, is working in partnership with local authorities and the private sector to ensure that they are fully aware of the needs of mobern mobile investment projects.  It is in the interest of each local authority to make adequate provision for well services industrial lands if new industrial projects and new employment are to be secured for their areas.</P>
    <P>In the case of the north east region, in particular, IDA Ireland is actively seeking to attract new inward investment through the acquisition of land for development.  A range of options are being considered in conjunction with Louth County Council to provide a large landbank in the Drogheda area and it is hoped this matter will be progressed over the coming months.  I understand that IDA Ireland is also scheduled to meet shortly with the North-Eastern Health Board, to pursue initiatives designed to substantially upgrade a 50 acre site owned by the health board in Ardee, with a view to improving its marketability for a new inward investment.</P>
    <P>The decision of Heinz Corporation, a company which falls within Forbairt's remit, to locate its Custom Foods frozen meals project in Dundalk will, it is hoped, lead to an additional 200 jobs for the town in the next two years.  Forbairt has also advised me that employment has increased in the strategically targeted information technology sector and future job prospects in this area are expected to be enhanced by current developments <Col N="132" /> in the regional development centre at the regional technical college in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Finally, the good news from Louth County Enterprise Board is that, since its establishment in late 1993, it has approved 153 projects worth over £1 million in grants.  These projects are expected to lead to a total of 250 full-time jobs of which, I understand, 182 were already in place by the end of 1996.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the industrial development agencies have every intention of continuing to work hard in order to promote and increase employment in the Louth area.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to use part of the old Packard plant at Airton Road in Tallaght, Dublin 24, for light assembly work.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6205/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in July, 1996 the Packard Electric plant in Tallaght ceased operations.  At that time, IDA Ireland received a commitment from the company to keep the factory available for the attraction of a replacement industry for a two year period.  The company has co-operated fully in this process and has maintained the building in excellent condition in order to attract potential investors.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has circulated details of the availability of the facility through its network of offices world-wide and both IDA Ireland and Forbairt are promoting the facility as a top priority.  However, as the entire property is a 120,000 sq. ft. building with an adjoining 15 acre site, its appeal is limited to some major projects assessing Ireland as a location for investment.  In addition, a new greenfield site may be more appropriate to the needs of some projects than the Packard plant which was purpose built.  Significant interest in the plant has been shown and a number of prestigious industrialists have visited it.  While no potential client has agreed to date to acquire the facility intensive promotion to attract a replacement industry is continuing.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has maintained ongoing contacts with the owners of the property, General Motors, and they have agreed to review the various options for the facility in mid 1997.  This review will include, consideration of the subdivision of the building into smaller units, selling the building separately from the adjacent site and any other initiatives which may facilitate its disposal and provide new or alternative investment and employment at the plant.  However, such initiatives would only be taken if there are grounds to believe that it will not be possible to attract a single major investor.  There are no grounds for such a conclusion to be drawn at this time given the level of interest shown to date in the plant and the ongoing Government success in attracting foreign direct investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Accordingly, it is premature at this stage to consider splitting or subdividing the building for any purpose until the current options to attract a single major investor have been exhausted, which is clearly the first preference of IDA Ireland and the Government.</P>

      <P>There have been numerous contacts between myself, officials in my Department and the IDA concerning the legislation to implement the Directive on the Organisation of Working Time.  The views of the IDA on the legislation were sought when proposals were being prepared for submission to Government and there have been continuing contacts since.  In the course of these discussions the IDA raised certain concerns about the proposed Bill and, in particular, about perceptions that might be generated about its possible impact.  These views were taken fully into account in formulating the amendments which were made to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Shortly before the Bill was considered on Committee Stage, the IDA were briefed on developments in relation to the legislation including the proposed amendments and indicated their general satisfaction at the manner in which the concerns of their client companies were being addressed.  It was after this meeting that I became aware that, in early January prior to Committee Stage amendments being considered, the IDA had written to the Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy conveying their views on the legislation.  As I explained at my press conference last week, I conveyed my surprise at the contents of the letter to the IDA but I did not ask them to withdraw the letter.  Subsequently, they did withdraw the letter at their own initiative explaining that their views on the legislation had altered considerably since it had been written.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as currently drafted, meets the concerns of a number of American companies and others such as the scope of the legislation to cover managers and other senior personnel and record keeping.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a balanced measure arrived at through deep and wide consultation with the social partners.  This partnership approach has served Ireland well.  It has served employers, employees and the unemployed well.  It has brought, along with this Government's superb handling of the economy, industrial peace, economic well being, increased employment, reduced unemployment, low inflation, low mortgage interest rates, etc. Partnership works.  This Bill is built on this approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 92 and 97 together.  As I have previously indicated to the House, the provision of additional matching funding does not arise in relation to the re-adaptation aid of 627,000 ECU approved by the EU Commission in December 1995-November 1996 under Article 56(2)(b) of the ECSC Treaty for 209 former Irish Steel workers made redundant in 1994, 1995 and early 1996 under the 1994 Irish Steel Restructuring plan.  The extra-statutory redundancy payments received by the former workers constitute the matching funding and this has been accepted by the EU Commission. On the previous occasion that readaptation aid was paid to former Irish Steel workers by the EU Commission in 1985, the extra-statutory redundancy payments received by the workers made redundant then constituted the matching funding at that time.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that my Department will make the EU re-adaptation aid payments to the 209 eligible former Irish Steel workers as a matters of priority on receipt by my Department of the re-adaptation aid from the EU Commission. I understand that this funding is expected from the Commission by the end of March.  As I have previously indicated to the House, this aid package represents a significant improvement on the terms available in the original Commission decision of December 1995.  The amount payable to each of the 209 former Irish Steel workers will be 3,000 ECU (approximately £2,200 per person).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the petition mentioned by Deputy O'Rourke, I understand this petition was submitted to the European Parliament by the Committee representing the former Irish Steel workers. My Department informally received a copy of the petition yesterday but has received no formal communication from the Committee representing the former Irish Steel workers, from the European Parliament or from the European Commission <Col N="135" /> on this matter.  I understand, from very recent contact with the European Parliament and the European Commission, that no decision has been taken by the European Parliament regarding the formal hearing of the petition.  However, I would point out to the Deputy that there is no question of a failure by the Government to honour commitments to the former Irish Steel workers as the extra-statutory redundancy payments received by the former workers constitutes the State matching funding and this has been accepted by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>I am meeting with the Committee representing the former Irish Steel workers on next Tuesday at 6.30 p.m. to discuss the re-adaptation aid issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the community employment (CE) and the pilot job initiative programmes are targeted at a particular severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, i.e. those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment. Limited resources, unfortunately, do not make it possible to provide CE and the job initiative for all unemployed people.  It is necessary, therefore, to target them at those most in need.  The eligibility criteria for both programmes are in my view a fair, objective and cost effective way of achieveing that target.</P>
      <P>CE consists of two distinct options &mdash; the integration option and the part-time job option.  Both men and women (married or single) who fulfil any of the following eligibility criteria can participate on CE:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Part-Time Integration Option</i>
      </P>
      <P>&mdash;Those aged 21 years or over and on unemployment benefit (UB), unemployment assistance (UA) or one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least twelve months.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Special categories such as those referred by the NRB, or travellers on the live register, or on one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" />
      <i>Part-Time Job Option</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash;Those aged 35 years or over and in receipt of unemployment assistance (UA), unemployment benefit (UB) or one parent family payment (OPFP) for three years or longer.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are aged 35 or over, or travellers who are on the live register or on one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>In addition, married unemployed people can swop their social welfare entitlement in order to qualify for participation on the programme.  In this way, a married person who meets the eligibility criteria can transfer entitlement on his or her spouse, who is unemployed but not on the live register, in order for that person to qualify for participation on CE.  Also, persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension (SCP) or deserted wife's benefit (DWB) can apply to transfer to one parent family payment (OPFP) in order to become eligible to participate in CE.</P>
    <P>The job initiative is a pilot programme and is targeted at people over 35 years of age who are five years or more unemployed and who are living within partnership areas in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin.  It is designed to give full-time work for 1,000 such persons.  This group is considered to be particularly disadvantaged and to have little chance of obtaining a mainstream job.</P>
    <P>Both men and women (married or single) who are living in any of the specified areas and who fulfill any of the following eligible criteria can participate in the job initiative:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Those over 35 years of age and in receipt of unemployment assistance (UA), unemployment benefit (UB) or one parent family payment (OPFP) for over five years.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are over 35 years or travellers who are over 35 years and on the live register or on one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least five years.</P>
    <P>In my view the questions of inequality or unconstitutionality do not arise in relation to these eligibility criteria.  As I have already explained, the criteria are designed to target a specific highly disadvantaged group of unemployed persons.  However, within that group the eligibility criteria do not give rise to any discrimination or inequality since both programmes are open to all persons who meet the criteria &mdash; men or women, either married or single.</P>
    <P>I might add that the eligibility criteria for CE only came into effect last year following a detailed review of the programme and in response to the recommendations of the task force on long-term unemployed.  The job initiative is a pilot three year programme which was launched last summer.  I have no plans to review <Col N="137" /> the eligibility criteria for either programme at present.  However, I do of course keep all programmes under constant scrutiny in so far as their objectives and effectiveness are concerned.</P>

      <P>With the enactment of the Competition Amendment Act, 1996, the Competition Authority now has the right to initiate investigations on its own initiative into any alleged anti-competitive structure or practice that appears to it to warrant such investigation.  The 1996 Act introduced independent public enforcement of the Competition Acts and I have appointed a director of competition enforcement to give effect to these provisions.</P>
      <P>In addition the director of competition enforcement can investigate whether on his own initiative or as a result of a complaint to him any contravention of section 4 or 5 of the Competition Act, 1991 or subsections (2), (5) or (7) of section 2 of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996 that he suspects has occurred or may occur.  As a result of these investigations he may make recommendations to the Competition Authority as respects the institution of legal proceedings in the matter.</P>
      <P>The 1996 Act creates criminal offences and penalties provisions for breaches of the rules of competition set out in the legislation in addition to civil remedies open to the authority or an aggrieved person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 48, 49 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>As in any sector of employment, wage levels in the areas referred to by the Deputies are a matter for negotiation and agreement between employees and employers, and/or their representatives. Where disputes arise the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are available to the parties.</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier in my response to a priority question, the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946-1990, provides that trade unions, or other organisations claiming to represent a category of workers may make application to the Labour Court for the establishment of a joint labour committee, known as a JLC.</P>
      <P>The function of a JLC is to draw up proposals for fixing minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for the workers involved.  When proposals submitted by a joint Labour Committee are confirmed by the Labour Court, through the making of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO), they become statutory minimum pay and conditions of employment for the workers concerned.</P>
      <P>There are already three JLCs in operation which impact on tourism-related employment, two cover the catering area and the third covers hotels.  In the case of the hotels, JLC, Cork city, Dublin city and Dun Laoghaire are not included. I am informed that the SIPTU trade union has applied to the Labour Court for the establishment of a JLC for hotels in the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire areas.  The Labour Court is to hold an inquiry on 3 April, 1997 into the application by SIPTU.</P>
      <P>To date an ERO has not been ratified by the Labour Court in respect of the catering JLC for the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire areas.</P>
      <P>EROs are enforced by the labour inspectorate of my Department.  Routine inspections are undertaken to ensure that employers are complying with the terms of the EROs.  In addition, inspectors pursue reported breaches of these EROs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that concern has been publicly expressed about pay levels and conditions of work in the tourism sector, including hotels and catering.  However, I am satisfied that, in addition to collective bargaining, the JLC system is the appropriate machinery to address the issue of low <Col N="139" /> pay, including difficulties about apparent low pay in the hotel and catering sectors.  The JLC system includes examination of prevailing pay rates.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis a decision to set up a JLC, or to extend the remit of a committee, rests with the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I would add that ministerial responsibility for the development of the tourism industry and the maximisation of the industry's employment potential primarily rests with my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to Jobstart which was introduced in 1996.</P>
      <P>Jobstart is a recruitment subsidy scheme, aimed at enticing employers to fill new or existing vacancies with long-term unemployed persons.  The overall thrust of the scheme is to increase the proportion of jobs in the economy filled by those unemployed for three years or more against a background where such persons are often by-passed in job selection.</P>
      <P>In designing the scheme discussions took place between IBEC, ICTU, INOU and other interested parties.  All of these bodies considered it important that State subsidies should go towards on-going job opportunities for the long-term unemployed in order to avoid potential abuse through the use of the subsidy by some employers as a stop gap measure.  Hence the programme is targeted at full-time employment, including such employment in the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, continuity of employment is required since the aim of the programme is to reintegrate long-term persons back into the labour force.  A season of work followed by a return to the live register is not seen as achieving this objective.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I have no plans at present to modify the programme to include seasonal employment.</P>

      <P>My Department has monitored the case of the individual referred to by the Deputy for some years as I indicated in my reply to Deputy Gregory on 4 February 1997.  Arising out of concerns which have been expressed regarding his detention in a special secure unit, we have made representations to the British authorities on humanitarian grounds through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, including at the most recent meeting of the conference held in Belfast on 20 November 1996, as well as through the Irish Embassy in London.  The prisoner in question was visited in a consular capacity by an embassy official on 19 November 1996.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the possibility of wrongful conviction in this case.  A previous appeal against his conviction failed in January 1991.</P>
      <P>On my instructions, the Irish Embassy in London has again sought information from the British authorities in recent days regarding the question of referring this case to the Court of Appeal. They have been informed by the British authorities that representations seeking a referral of this individual's case to the Court of Appeal were received in September 1994.  The British authorities further state that additional information has very recently been received from his solicitors which was essential for their consideration of the case.  They say that this consideration is now continuing.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is for the prisoner's legal representatives to pursue the matter at this stage.  The Irish Embassy have contact with these representatives and I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to monitor this case closely and raise any concerns as appropriate with the British authorities.</P>

      <P>Under the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1994-9 Structural Funds are channelled through operational programmes covering key sectors of the economy.  This was also the case under the previous round.  The operational programmes are national sectoral programmes and do not contain specific regional allocations.  The amount of funding which a region receives is determined by a combination of factors which include sectoral needs as determined in the operational programmes and demand from the regions for the various schemes of assistance under the different operational programmes.</P>
      <P>The Dublin region is estimated to have received 22 per cent of the total Structural Fund allocation to Ireland under the 1989-93 round. Under the most recent projections of expenditure for the current round the Dublin region is projected to receive approximately 25 per cent of the total Structural Fund allocation.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): All persons covered by medical cards, irrespective of their medical condition, are entitled to general practitioner services and prescribed drugs and medicines free of charge.  Physeptone prescriptions are included in the list of drugs and medicines reimbursable under the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that methadone maintenance programmes are a valid and successful part of an integrated response to the problem of heroin abuse.  The report of the expert group on a Protocol for the prescribing of methadone set out recommendations for the involvement of general practitioners in methadone maintenance programmes. Many elements of the Protocol have already been implemented.  Most notably, a central treatment list of all patients being prescribed methadone has been established and shows that over 1,900 people are in receipt of methadone. Fifty eight general practitioners are involved in prescribing in the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>There has been a reluctance on the part of a number of general practitioners to become involved, however, and in order to address this issue, my Department commenced a pilot methadone Protocol scheme in March 1996.  Under this scheme, patients who have been assessed by the health board have been referred regardless of GMS status, to their local general practitioners and methadone is dispensed in local pharmacies free of charge.  The scheme is operated in a tightly controlled fashion, with each patient having a treatment card which is held in the local pharmacy for the duration of treatment.  The board intends to expand this scheme during 1997.</P>
      <P>My Department has established a committee to examine the role of general practitioners and pharmacists in the treatment of drug misuse and its report, which will include a review of present treatment arrangements and recommendations for improving the services to drug misusers, should be provided to me in early April.  This will be promptly acted upon.</P>

    <P>This does not include specimens tested in the unlinked anonymous surveillance programme.</P>

      <Col N="145" /> Public information on HIV and AIDS figures is provided on a national basis.  Regional AIDS co-ordinators in each of the health boards provide details of AIDS cases and deaths in their respective health boards to my Department and these are then compiled on a national basis and published every quarter.  HIV figures are provided by the Virus Reference Laboratory, which reports to my Department on a regular basis, and these are also published every quarter by my Department.</P>
    <P>While the system of reporting AIDS cases and deaths is purely voluntary the majority of doctors who deal with AIDS would be aware of the desirability of reporting all such cases.  My Department is therefore confident that the available figures give an accurate representation of the extent of the condition and the mortality associated with it.</P>
    <P>Policy with regard to testing for HIV, as set out in the National AIDS Strategy Committee Report of 1992 is one of voluntary testing, where people who believe they have put themselves at risk of infection with the virus come forward and following counselling, have a HIV test.  My Department has no plans to introduce compulsory testing for HIV.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I presume that the Deputy is referring to the matter of entry by doctors to the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme.  Entry by doctors to the GMS Scheme is by way of open competition for vacancies which arise, new posts which are created or for posts of assistant with a view to partnership.</P>
      <P>The arrangements relating to entry to the scheme have been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and they are designed to ensure that a high standard of service will be provided by doctors who are successful in securing contracts.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the GMS contract are regularly reviewed by the Department, the chief executive officers of the health boards and the IMO and, arising out of this process, agreement was reached last year on revised arrangements relating to entry to the scheme.  These revised arrangements provide for a consultation process between the health boards and the IMO in advance of decisions being taken in relation to the filling of posts.  They also provide guidelines on assessing the viability of posts, the establishment of interview boards and marking system for candidates.  There are no plans to change these revised arrangements.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is the Government's intention that retired nurses and other public servants will benefit from the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement.</P>
      <P>The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructuring, as provided for under the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement. This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers, gardaí etc. who have concluded or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the PCW.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in many cases even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this question will now have to be considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.</P>
      <P>Detailed discussions on this issue have yet to take place.  When this general policy issue has been resolved, my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>

      <P>There was no expenditure on the restoration of the Boyne Navigation in 1996.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that I provisionally allocated £2 million for the restoration of the Boyne Navigation in 1994.  However, following the preparation of a preliminary inspection report on the feasibility of restoring the Boyne Navigation from Ruxton Lock, Navan to Tiernan's Lock near Old-bridge, the Waterways Service of my Department advised that the restoration would involve expenditure of the order of £24 million.</P>
      <P>In view of that, I initiated a study to determine the feasibility and cost of restoring a limited stretch of the waterway from Slane to Staleen. While that study will not be completed until the end of this month I understand that the cost of the works would be in the region of £6 million to £8 million.  In those circumstances and in context of the mid-term review of the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, it is obvious that the provisional allocation of £2 million would be totally inadequate to restore, even partially, the Boyne Navigation.  The Deputy is also aware that there is a difficulty at present in relation to the title of the Navigation which has not been resolved.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances the £2 million originally allocated has been assigned to other waterways projects included in the current programme.</P>

      <P>In reply to a number of similar questions previously, the most recent of which was on 22 October 1996, volume 470, No. 4, columns 700-704, I reiterated that the only investigation commissioned by me for the products concerned relates to the investigation of the retail prices of magazines imported from the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>On that occasion I recounted:</P>
      <P>the investigation undertaken by the Director of Consumer Affairs, earlier in 1996 into the prices of magazines imported from the United Kingdom because of the widespread perception that the benefit of the appreciation of the Irish pound <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling was not being reflected in lower cover prices; the principal findings of the investigation, which were that:</P>
      <P>(i) the industry was dominated by two importers-distributors, who continue to work on the variation of a formula, first agreed by the National Prices Commission (NPC) in 1983,</P>
      <P>(ii)&nbsp; in contrast to the inclusion of an &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; of 5 per cent by the National Prices Commission, to compensate for the additional costs associated with the distribution of these magazines in Ireland, the distributors had in the meantime increased the uplift to 10 per cent and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the complex formula operated by the distributors resulted in the retailers charging the same price, indicating the total absence of price competition,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the circumstances culminating in my making a Maximum Prices Order for imported magazines on 9 July 1996.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the subsequent revocation of the Order, following a High Court challenge by the principal distributor and one of the retail news-agents' association, and having regard to the legal advice available to me.</P>
      <P>I referred also to the investigation, then in progress by the consultancy unit in my Department into the cost structure, both wholesale and retail, and operating margins for Irish as well as imported magazines.  This investigation which is both comprehensive and painstaking also addresses the impact on costs and prices of the practice by the distributors of imposing delivery charges, the distribution arrangements for such magazines and the extent to which they interlock with those for newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> The investigation by the consultancy unit is now nearing completion, and I expect to receive their report on 12 March 1997.  I should also add that, because of the concern expressed by the Director of Consumer Affairs about a number of the common practices pursued by the distributors, I have asked the Director of Competition Enforcement to investigate the prices and distribution arrangements for magazines.</P>
    <P>Finally may I say that, in response to a number of representations made to me in recent weeks about the differential between Irish and UK prices for compact discs, I have asked the Director of Consumer Affairs to investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces are exempt from the application of the Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996, at the request of the Minister for Defence and as permitted by Council Directive 89/391/EEC, the Framework Health and Safety Directive.</P>
      <P>The position is that an inherent and overriding principle of military service &mdash; enshrined in section 85 of the Defence Act, 1954 &mdash; is that military personnel are liable for duty at all times. The application of legislation on working time to the Defence Forces would, therefore, be contrary to the principle of military service and would have fundamental organisational and operational implications for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence has assured me that he is satisfied that the application of the Organisation of Working Time Bill to the Defence Forces would not be appropriate and that existing conditions of service relating to leave, rest periods etc. for military personnel take full cognisance of the nature and requirements of military service.</P>
      <P>Working practices in the Defence Forces are, of course, a matter for the Minister for Defence. The Minister has informed me that he is at all times anxious to ensure that members of the Defence Forces are given adequate rest periods especially following occasions when longer than normal hours of duty may be necessary.  In this regard, rest periods and sleep periods are often built into periods of extended hours of duty.  In addition, the Defence Forces have a very flexible and generous system of leave granting, time-off and days resting off reflecting and catering for the unique nature of military life.</P>

    <P>These moneys are spent on a wide range of R &amp; D activities from basic research to experimental development.  However, because of definitional problems and the increased blurring of lines between basic, strategic and applied forms of research, the compilation of data in the higher education colleges for funding received for research is not classified by type of research. However, the Forfás survey referred to above estimated that 20 per cent of all research in the third level sector could be classified as pure basic research.</P>
    <P>In relation to my own Department's research schemes, the White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation published at the end of last year underlined the importance of basic research in the national system of innovation.</P>
    <P>According to the White Paper, there are persuasive arguments for maintaining basic research capability in the third-level sector.  These include the need to be strong in the basic science areas of strategic national importance, such as the bio-sciences which are fundamental to health and to the food chain; maintaining internationally recognised standards in university education; ensuring that Irish colleges are attractive to the best Irish undergraduate and post-graduate students, thus retaining &ldquo;high quality&rdquo; people in Ireland; creation of a pool of skilled researchers as an essential basis for industrial and economic <Col N="159" /> development; the strengthening of our capacity to participate in international contracts and to acquire new knowledge through international co-operation.</P>
    <P>In the context of the foregoing, my Department's basic research grants scheme has been increased from £833,000 in 1994 to £2 million in 1996.</P>

      <P>In 1994 there were approximately 2,000 research postgraduate students across all disciplines.  There are a variety of levels and sources supporting these students.  Informal surveys have shown that students receive support from a very wide range of sources, such as Government Departments and State agencies, local authorities, the European Commission, industry and third level colleges.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the R &amp; D sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Industry 1994-1999, provides funding for post-graduate students through the programmes in advanced technologies (PATs) and the national research support fund board.  In the case of the latter, schemes such as the basic research grants scheme, strategic research grants scheme, applied research grants (RTCs/DITs), applied research grants (universities), research scholarships (PhDs), EU Presidency post-doctoral fellowship and international collaboration scheme all provide postgraduate students with funding possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, the industry scholarships (MScs) scheme which are valued at £4,000 per annum are funded 50 per cent by industry.  In 1996, 64 such scholarships were awarded.  Information on other <Col N="160" /> industry funding of postgraduate students is not available.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate from the foregoing that postgraduate funding is a wide and complex issue.  The White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation published last year recognised this and as a follow-up to the Government decisions set out in the White Paper, I have asked the national research support fund board to prepare a report on how this funding issue might be rationalised and consolidated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of support available in different European countries varies according to conditions which pertain in the particular country. Simple comparisons may, therefore, be misleading. For example, if one takes the case of the EU Training and Mobility of Researchers Programme which supports the movement of post-graduates across Europe and in which 46 Irish researchers participated since 1994, it is interesting to observe that the European Commission does not pay a standard or uniform rate. Rather they pay a specific rate tied to conditions, including tax arrangements in different countries and hence there is a spread of over 300 per cent between the rates applicable in different countries.</P>
      <P>I presume the £2,000 figure mentioned in the question refers to the annual grant paid under the Basic Research Grants Scheme, which figure I increased from £1,000 in 1996.  I would point out that students in receipt of such grants may also apply for means-tested higher education grants under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.</P>
      <P>However, I would also stress that many other postgraduates are selected by other State-sponsored schemes which are spread across many disciplines in many universities, with grant rates substantially in excess of the figure quoted in the Question.  For example, the Department of Health Scheme provides for a grant of £4,500 and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Scheme provides £7,500 per student.  In the case of my own Office of Science and Technology, the Programmes in Advanced Technology have some 190 postgraduate students on their books, each in receipt of an average of £6,500 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to stress that many post-graduate science students go abroad for reasons unconnceted <Col N="161" /> with the inference in the question.  Research does not recognise boundaries and is increasingly internationalised.  Many students go abroad for further study or experience &mdash; for professional and personal development, wider range of courses, or work in specific scientific fields or in industry in order to obtain international contacts.</P>

      <P>As part of overall enterprise support and development strategy, my Department, in conjunction with the industrial development agencies and the Department of Finance, is fully aware of the importance of measures that reward risk for business entrepreneurs.  To promote an enterprise culture it is essential to provide mechanisms that encourage and help people to go into business for themselves and, secondly, to encourage them to stay and develop their business through risk reward mechanisms.  If that twin strategy is successful the rewards are a greater level of entrepreneurship and innovation in the economy leading to increased job creation.  Several mechanisms are in place to encourage individuals to develop their existing business or take that first vital step towards entrepreneurship.</P>
      <P>The Business Expansion Scheme exists to channel much needed equity into growing business, including start-ups, that would not otherwise have had access to equity capital.  In 1996 the Government decided to extend the BES to April 1999.  Subject to meeting specific qualification criteria the BES Seed Capital Scheme provides a refund of income tax already paid to individuals who are either currently in employment or are unemployed and who are interested in starting up a qualifying business.</P>
      <P>County Enterprise Boards form a nationwide network to encourage the development of local enterprise culture through the provision of financial assistance, advice and information.  Their principal areas of activity are services, tourism and industry.  To the end of 1996 CEBs assisted in the creation of over 3,000 full time and over 500 part time jobs.</P>
      <P>Through the Operational Programme for Industrial Development funding of approximately £66 million for early stage equity is available through approved Seed/Venture Funds. Some 25 per cent of this funding is intended for seed capital investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial development agencies, as part of their development mandate, are increasingly devoting more of their financial resources to equity <Col N="162" /> investments in developing indigenous companies.</P>
    <P>Within the private sector a number of new participants have become active in the past few years in the venture capital area.  These bodies are charcterised by their concentration on start-up and early stage financing.  In addition, within the banking sector the main banks have moved towards the elimination of seeking the security of the family home against bank loans and have introduced special customised short and medium sized lending products for business customers, in a number of instances specifically for young and emerging businesses.</P>
    <P>All of the above are aimed towards the reduction of the initial entrepreneurs risk by sharing that risk.</P>
    <P>Within existing businesses the tax code has been amended significantly in recent years so that investors and entrepreneurs are rewarded for their risk by allowing them to retain more of the profits and gains earned from the business.  In 1995 this Government reduced the standard rate of Corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  There will now be a further reduction to 36 per cent from 1 April 1997.  The special 30 per cent rate of Corporation tax applicable to the first £50,000 of taxable company income was first introduced by this Government in 1996.  It has now been decided to reduce this rate to 28 per cent effective from April 1997.  The special low rate of Capital Gains Tax is being reduced from 27 per cent to 26 per cent with effect from 6 April 1997.  This rate applies to gains realised by individuals on the disposal of ordinary shares in certain smaller private companies, i.e., having a market value of less than £25 million.</P>
    <P>These measures demonstrate a continuing commitment on the part of the Government to developing an enterprise culture which rewards risk, enhances employment opportunities and assists in the further development of the economy. In conjunction with other Departments and agencies, my Department will continue to assess the need for any further measures that may be needed to further enhance the climate for enterprise.</P>

      <P>Dublin and the east region generally have been very successful in securing a large proportion of inward investment projects over the last number of years.  The record rate of growth <Col N="163" /> for 1996 recently reported by IDA Ireland, in terms of its national performance, is due very substantially to the exceptional capability of the east region to attract so high a proportion of mobile investment.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the total number of jobs created in IDA-assisted companies in the Dublin region was 6,163.  IDA client companies on the Northside of Dublin city have grown particularly well in recent years.  The total number of jobs created in Forbairt-assisted companies in the Dublin region for 1996 was 3,545.  Shortly after Forbairt was established it reviewed the needs of the Dublin region and appointed in 1995, for the first time, a new area manager for Dublin North.</P>
      <P>Through its area manager, Forbairt is working closely with various groups in developing a strategic plan for Dublin North.  These include Northside Partnership, Ballymun Partnership, Finglas/Cabra Partnership, Blanchardstown Partnership, Dublin City University, IDA Ireland, NorDubCo., Fingal County Council, Dublin City Enterprise Board, Balbriggan Enterprise, URBAN, Aer Rianta, FÁS and Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Forbairt is also actively involved with the Dublin City Enterprise Board and Finglas Partnership in carrying out a space audit of the Finglas area, to identify space availability, land available for development and the potential demand for future industrial units in the area.  In addition, the enterprise sub-committee of the Northside Partnership, on which Forbairt is represented, is in the process of commencing an audit of the overall situation in the area which will specifically focus on the availability of space for small businesses in the area.  The study will be carried out in co-operation with DCU and will be part-funded by Forbairt.</P>
      <P>Forbairt is currently working closely with approximately 450 small businesses in the North Dublin area in order to build competitiveness, capability and capacity in Irish industry through the provision of a comprehensive range of financial and development supports which are designed to position Irish companies to achieve Forbairt's core objective of increased sales and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the CEBs were established in late 1993, those in the Dublin region have approved almost 700 projects which have resulted in the creation of over 1,000 full time jobs.  The northside area of Dublin City Enterprise Board and Finglas CEB combined would account for approximately half of the approvals and jobs created to date.  Other parts of the Northside have also enjoyed significant growth as, for example, in East Point where there are currently eight companies which have established at the East Point Industrial Estate under the terms of the enterprise areas scheme. A feature of the development at East Point is the fact that the companies are predominantly international traded service companies involved <Col N="164" /> mainly in the software, dataprocessing and telemarketing sectors.</P>
    <P>The total number of potential jobs at the East Point arising from these companies is 1,979.  In addition to the above companies, further applications are expected which could lead to the present total of jobs being significantly increased in the near future.  Four local employment services, of the fourteen countrywide, are currently operating in the North Dublin area and of the four additional LESs announced on 12 February last, one has been assigned to North Dublin.  The service is geared to providing an intensive guidance and placement service for the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>The priority for the industrial agencies under my remit for 1997 is to work with local and corporate management of both indigenous and overseas industries to achieve continuous growth.</P>

It is estimated that the number of animals submitted for special beef premium will be slightly lower in 1997 because farmers were permitted to submit a fourth special beef premium application in December 1996.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the network of stations which Met Éireann operates at present is satisfactory and quite adequate for the production of reliable and comprehensive forecasts.  In addition to the automatic weather station at Roches Point and the manned station in Valentia Observatory, Cahirciveen, County Kerry.  There is also the manned station at Cork Airport and data from all the land stations are supplemented by a continuous flow of information from weather surveillance radar and from orbiting weather satellites.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the ongoing improvements in the quality and accuracy of the information and forecasts which Met Éireann provides.  There is no complacency in this organisation, however, and Met Éireann maintains a continuous review of the data needs and steps towards further improvement are taken whenever opportunities arise.  In this context there is likely to be an expansion in the network of automatic weather stations as the resources available permit.</P>
