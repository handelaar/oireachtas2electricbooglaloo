    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I took an early opportunity, on 29 July, to meet all 19 of the social partner organisations at a Partnership 2000 meeting held in Dublin Castle.  At that meeting there were detailed exchanges of views with the social partners on a variety of topics. I reiterated the Government's commitment to honouring in full the terms of the partnership agreement.  The text of my address on that occasion was published by the GIS.</P>
      <P>In my address, I outlined the need for economic and social progress to be made simultaneously so that there is the most equitable distribution possible of the benefits of economic growth.  I promised the Government's programme would be implemented in a manner compatible with the commitments set out in Partnership 2000 and which, in many ways, extends them. I acknowledged the valuable contribution that social partnership has made over the past ten years and its increasing importance in managing future growth and tackling social exclusion.  With regard to future growth, I recognised the importance of fostering the agriculture and food sectors as well as the important contribution which a modernised public service can make.  On social exclusion, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in my statement, I said Ireland's economic progress has been made against a background of wage moderation and industrial peace.  I urged <Col N="878" /> the maintenance of these policies to enhance our competitiveness.  The National Competitiveness Council and the National Centre for Partnership will have an important benchmarking and demonstration role in this.  In particular, the centre will have a special role in replicating, at the level of the enterprise, the success of partnership at national level.</P>
    <P>Since my address to the social partners in July, I have been regularly informed of all the relevant developments by the Partnership 2000 secretariat which is based in my Department.  Under the terms of Partnership 2000, as part of the monitoring procedures I will attend an annual meeting with all the parties to the agreement.  Clearly, apart from such formal meetings, I will continue to avail of informal and private occasions to meet the individual social partner organisations.  Over the course of the past month, I have had detailed and informal discussions with a number of organisations on a variety of issues relating to the implementation of Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is ongoing contact between my officials and the social partners on almost a daily basis in the context of a variety of working groups.  As we speak, the Partnership 2000 secretariat, which includes the social partners and relevant Departments, is meeting to discuss the detailed progress which has been made on the implementation of the commitments in the partnership agreement in advance of the next quarterly meeting in Dublin Castle on 13 October.</P>
    <P>In addition to direct contact by my Department with the social partners, both the NESC and NESF operate under my aegis.  The council and the forum have been given the tasks of benchmarking the implementation of Partnership 2000 and monitoring progress on the social inclusion elements, respectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What precise developments at farm level in the private sector does the Taoiseach expect to occur as a result of the activities of the recently established body to promote partnership? Has he any specific recommendations to make?</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach on the need for equity with regard to income distribution.  Does he agree the farming community faces an income crisis this autumn?  The failure to implement the proposed national compensation scheme in the beef sector is a big disappointment to people who face major losses.  There is no evidence of a medium-term plan to give hope to young people entering agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement is based on a macro-economic framework covering the period of the plan.  With regard to the private sector, we are actively engaged in looking constructively at the sectors, developments and initiatives we can advance and the agreements we can reach to create employment.  The emphasis is on increasing <Col N="879" /> employment growth.  Progress has been made in a number of sectors, tourism and the software industry in particular, and in matching what we are trying to achieve in the educational system with what the social partners are trying to do in the private sector.</P>
      <P>There are some difficulties with regard to agriculture. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has just returned from Cairo where he has endeavoured to promote Irish beef exports, whether live or processed.  In talks with the agricultural members of the social partners &mdash; with whom I had the opportunity to meet about three weeks ago &mdash; we are examining the issues with which we can assist.  The sector has had a number of satisfactory years and we wish that to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect live cattle exports to Egypt will resume?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not see that happen in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Minister said last June.  He was full of answers then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more likely we will increase substantially the exports of processed beef to Egypt.  That is in line with Egyptian policy which we must respect.  We must make the necessary adjustments to increase our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the importance of taxation reductions, particularly for the PAYE sector, in the partnership with the social partners did the Taoiseach repeat the commitments made by him and the Tánaiste during the election campaign that there will be £500 million worth of tax reductions for the PAYE sector in the forthcoming budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must await budget day to see what the budget will hold for the PAYE sector. It is in our interests to maintain pay moderation. The policy pursued by successive Governments and pursued by me since 1987 is pay moderation in return for tax reductions.  That policy has proved successful; it has managed to give us one of the lowest inflation rates in the EU and has allowed us to generate employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the social partners the Taoiseach met include the community platform? If not, can he indicate when he proposes to meet representatives of the community sector and ensure their views, which were incorporated so successfully in the negotiations for Partnership 2000, will be included?</P>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's commitment to the national anti-poverty strategy, can he indicate what new mechanisms he has put in place to ensure that strategy is implemented?  I have heard disturbing rumours that structures that would have ensured implementation of the strategy have been largely dismantled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> On taxation, can the Taoiseach ensure in the drafting of the budget that tax reform or other tax elements of the budget are balanced with the need to ensure that expenditure is available to implement the national anti-poverty strategy?  We must end a practice under which children starting school in working-class areas of Dublin are in classes of 32 pupils.  It is disgraceful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy.  The various systems put in place for that are continuing and I do not know of any that have been undone.</P>
      <P>On taxation, our policy is based on a proper fiscal and monetary policy, our obligations under the Maastricht Treaty and the stability pact signed last December.  We intend to use both tax reductions and necessary expenditures in areas dealing with social exclusion and deprivation as well as disadvantaged education.  Those are all priorities in that area.</P>
      <P>In my meetings with the social partners I met the four pillars.  I have had separate meetings with a number of the social partners in their categories as pay groups, which are set down in Partnership 2000.  I have met the farmers, trade unions and others.  I have not met the members of the four pillars separately, but I have met the disabled group and the National Youth Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be wrong in assuming from the somewhat noncommittal reply of the Taoiseach to Deputy Spring's question on the delivery of promises to the PAYE sectors that these very dear promises, unequivocal before the election, are becoming contingent?  Can we count on the promises of cuts in taxation made by the Deputy's party before the election being met in full in the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, we have an occasion when the financial announcements for the following year are made and those announcements will be made then.  The Deputy would be wrong in believing this Government will not continue to do what it has successfully done since 1987 with just a short break: reducing the burden on the PAYE sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a definite maybe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Is the Taoiseach aware of the extreme dissatisfaction among the organised workforce relating to social partnership? They see social partnership as being used to hold wage increases to an absolute minimum while private profits have been allowed to boom.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of similar dissatisfaction regarding the so-called concept of social partnership when anti-trade union employers are given a free hand to block trade union organisation and representation in their workplaces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that over the years there have been objections from certain sections <Col N="881" /> of the trade union movement in relation to social partnership.  Some adopted an ideological opposition to it while others adopt a more pragmatic view and change their views from programme to programme.  The overwhelming majority of Irish organised workers has been in favour of social partnership as it has reduced their taxation levels from what a decade ago stood at 65, 58 and 35 per cent respectively.  At that time there was huge unemployment, extremely high interest and inflation rates and the Exchequer borrowing requirement and current budget deficit here were among the worst in the OECD countries.  Social partnership has successfully managed to change all of that and the main beneficiary has been organised labour.  Improvements can always be made and progress must continue to be made on the objectives set out in <i>Partnership 2000.</i>  Those are the priorities which must be followed in the 39 month period covered by the programme and the policies contained therein must be pursued.</P>
      <P>In addition a separate section dealt with exclusion, deprivation and educational needs for the disadvantaged.  That was an extension of what had been in the earlier three programmes all of which were very beneficial for organised labour. The Government will continue to do what its predecessors have done and will try to implement these proposals to the best of its ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: What about victimisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group has been set up to look at the issue of trade union recognition and it will report in due course.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and employers' organisations regard this as a serious matter; the working group is looking at what can happen to companies, particularly indigenous ones, which do not allow workers to join unions in any organised fashion or to gain recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former trade unionist, would the Taoiseach agree that the levels of pay in certain sectors of services and industry are unacceptably low?  Would he agree that any future partnership arrangement should include a serious agreement on a national minimum rate in the interests of workers, low paid and otherwise, who have been exploited, particularly those in unorganised employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, since its election, set up a commission to deal with this issue and with the difficulties which have long existed on joint labour committees to seek an hourly minimum wage.  It is hoped that group will complete its work towards the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week's agreement to move into substantive <Col N="883" /> negotiations which will comprehensively address the totality of relationships is a historic breakthrough and achievement.  We will have, for the first time, negotiations constituted on an inclusive basis, conducted in an atmosphere of peace, involving the two sovereign Governments and with all the parties eligible to participate.  We have never had such a set of circumstances in place before.  For many years successive Governments have sought an all-round constitutional conference with all subjects on the table for discussion. This has finally been achieved.  I hope that those parties that have chosen to absent themselves will reconsider their position.  With the ceasefire and the start of all-party talks on an inclusive basis, we have moved a long way in the short time since we took office, building of course on agreements put in place under our predecessors.</P>
    <P>All of my very numerous contacts with the British Prime Minister, and my contacts with other parties, have been geared towards reaching the point now attained where we have a unique opportunity to reach a durable settlement.  I pay tribute to the tremendous amount of time, effort and dedication given by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam and the Minister of State, Paul Murphy, in helping to achieve this position and to break the deadlock which had gripped the talks since they opened.  Following the meeting I had with the British Prime Minister on 3 July last, I hope to have an early opportunity to meet him again.</P>
    <P>In the weeks leading up to the agreement, the Tánaiste and I, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and officials in our talks team met representatives of all traditions and parties including the SDLP, the Alliance Party, Sinn Féin, the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Eames, and the Bishop of Derry, Dr. Hegarty.  At all these meetings I took the opportunity to review developments and discuss ways in which progress could be made.</P>
    <P>I also discussed the possibility of reconvening a meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation at my meetings with the parties.  Requests have also been made for meetings by the Leader of the Labour Party and by the Green Party.  The Government will consider asking the chairperson to convene a meeting in early November following further consultations with the parties and groups currently participating, and to convene occasional meetings thereafter.  The Government will also consider extending invitations to other parties in Northern Ireland to attend the forum. The purpose of such meetings would be to reinforce progress in the talks, not in any way to distract from them.</P>
    <P>The issue of confidence building is of vital importance.  It will be central to the ongoing negotiations and the procedural motion adopted at the plenary session of the multi-party talks on Wednesday last makes specific provision for dealing <Col N="884" /> with such measures.  In this jurisdiction, the Government, in recognition of the importance of maintaining confidence in the process, has again taken action on the release of prisoners, including the release of five prisoners on Friday last.</P>
    <P>Confidence must flow more than one way.  In this context, the reported remarks in <i>An Phoblacht</i> were not helpful to the process of building confidence in the commitment of all parties to an agreed negotiated settlement.  This was indicated by the two Governments in their conclusions on representations made by the UUP against Sinn Féin, issued in Belfast on Wednesday last, which I am circulating with this reply.  I reiterate what I said at the outset, that we expect the republican movement as a whole to honour the commitment to the Mitchell principles affirmed by Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>The Government has not received a response to the assessment of the new material on Bloody Sunday.  There have been ongoing contacts at official level and I will meet with the relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday again in midOctober. I have already welcomed the indications by the British Government that it will look afresh at the issue of Bloody Sunday and recognise that the British Government requires some time to consider the assessment of the new material.  I believe that establishing the truth about Bloody Sunday will make an important contribution to building confidence.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations which are commencing, the Government's negotiating position, and the national interest, will be based on and served by the Downing Street Declaration, the Joint Framework Document, the Mitchell principles and the draft report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Consent will be a guiding principle for both Governments in the negotiations, from which no outcome is excluded or pre-determined. In my joint statement with the British Prime Minister I also affirmed that the aim of the negotiations is to achieve a new and lasting agreement, addressing the totality of relationships, which commands the consent of both Unionists and Nationalists.  We seek a new agreed political dispensation, a new beginning in relationships &mdash; not the acceptance of what has failed in the past.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank General de Chastelain for agreeing to take on the additional role of chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, and Senator Mitchell and Prime Minister Holkeri for agreeing to take on additional roles as joint chairmen of Strand 2.  They have shown great patience and forbearance, as well as skill and impartiality, in their work to date and we are all very much in their debt.  I also wish to thank Brigadier-General Nieminen and Ambassador Johnson for agreeing to act as members of the Independent Commission, which was established on Wednesday last, and to the Governments of Finland and of the United States for nominating such highly qualified persons.</P>
    <P>Our objective is to create a lasting peace based on justice, friendship and co-operation between <Col N="885" /> people of different traditions.  I call on all participants to maintain the momentum of progress achieved since July and join with both Governments in moving forward to reach an agreed settlement as quickly as possible, in the interests of all the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>No party should allow the interests of those it represents to go by default and we would welcome and encourage all parties to fully engage in the process.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach in calling on all the parties, those present and those not yet present, to participate in this historic opportunity to build a settlement that will heal wounds, some of which date back 300 years.  I join with him also in expressing thanks to the various Governments, and in particular individuals from overseas, who have been so helpful in this process at every stage.  I compliment the courage of some political leaders who experienced difficulty with their own supporters in reaching the point they have now reached and allowing the talks to commence as comprehensively as they have.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the expressed view of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' that Sinn Féin will accept a compromise at the talks that falls short of British withdrawal or a united Ireland?  I believe the Minister expressed these views in Washington this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will answer questions on that matter later today.  His views have been taken out of context.  What we are endeavouring to do is get a balanced, fair and just settlement. What the Minister stated is absolutely correct. Everyone in the House agrees one cannot have a negotiating position at the start and end of the talks and that compromises, concessions and understandings will have to be developed during the course of the talks which will start next Tuesday. Strand I will start next Tuesday morning, Strand II will start during the afternoon and Strand III will start during the evening.  The two liaison committees on decommissioning and confidence-building will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>The energy and effort put in by the negotiating teams and all those involved in the process is aimed at getting people to work with, and have trust and confidence in, each other.  Whatever settlement is reached at the talks and put to the people both North and South will have the confidence of both sets of communities.  In recent months I have repeatedly said to all the individuals I have met, particularly our northern brethren, that it is no good trying to seek a solution which does not have the support of both sets of communities as it will not work.  There cannot be a win for one side, it must be a set of compromises.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the work done by the Government and the British Government in recent months in advancing the talks process. They have our best wishes in regard to the talks which will start next Tuesday.  I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach that the forum will meet in November and hope all parties will participate in it.</P>
      <P>On the matter raised by Deputy Bruton, I understand the Taoiseach was at all the meetings with Sinn Féin.  He met the leadership of Sinn Féin in Dublin a fortnight ago.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a very clear statement, which was well reported and which has not been denied by Government sources since then, that Sinn Féin would accept a compromise short of British withdrawal and a united Ireland.  Was this matter discussed directly with the Sinn Féin leadership at the recent meeting in Dublin and does the Taoiseach accept the views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was not discussed: what was discussed are the matters to which I referred.  We asked everyone we met to accept that compromises would have to be made in the course of the negotiations and that the deeply held convictions and statements which I am sure each side will make at the opening sessions of the three stranded talks next week are opening positions and that they will have to move in the talks process.  The remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to journalists were on the basis that compromises have to be made by everybody. What he said should certainly not create a difficulty for any party or set of negotiators.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is unacceptable for a group to solemnly sign on for the Mitchell principles on a Tuesday and for some of that group to say the following Thursday that they have problems with those principles and to specifically say in <i>An Phoblacht</i> that there will be no decommissioning until the talks process is <Col N="887" /> over and agreement has been reached?  Will he agree that directly contravenes and contradicts the Mitchell principles?  There is disagreement between Sinn Féin and every other participant in the talks on the principle of consent.  In the Taoiseach's talks with the leadership of Sinn Féin has he received a commitment that it will accept the principle of consent in total and without equivocation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the joint statement made by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and me which states that the discussions will take place on the basis of the principle of consent which will be the guiding principle for the negotiations as they move forward. At this stage we are not tying people down before we start negotiations, but the principle of consent is the guiding one for these talks.</P>
      <P>On the <i>An Phoblacht</i> article, the Deputy will have heard me say that I hold the Republican movement to abiding by the Mitchell principles and its obligation to ensure the Republican family live by that position.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that every other participant in the talks accepts the principle of consent as laid down in the Downing Street Declaration, but Sinn Féin made it clear that it does not accept that definition of consent.  Has the Taoiseach made any efforts to persuade Sinn Féin that unless the outcome of these negotiations can be accepted through a process of consent as laid down and accepted by every other participant, it is misleading the population North and South about its intentions with regard to these talks and negotiations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately very few participants in the talks agree on everything.  There are different levels of disagreement on various matters. I know, probably better than anyone, the difficulties in regard to the issue of consent because I tried to steer the draft report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation but we could not conclude that issue.  It will continue to be dealt with in the discussions as we move forward.  I hope those who remain outside the process will sign up to it in due course.  That will require some persuasion and effort, but we will all be patient and try to achieve that.  The guiding principle will be consent.  It is clear what we cannot achieve.  It is not fair to pick on certain aspects.  I could refer to aspects with which many others are not totally satisfied.  In a joint statement on 15 September the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and I set out our position on consent, decommissioning and the conclusions we believe we can reach as we move forward.</P>

What is the context in which those remarks should be placed?  Does the Taoiseach believe those remarks are wrong and, if so, how were they misinterpreted and by whom?</P>
      <P>In regard to the <i>An Phoblacht</i> article, will he agree that the problem is we all know Sinn Féin and the IRA operate as one movement with a single political agenda and common political direction?  If one part of the movement repudiates something the other part of the movement accepts, the situation is profoundly ambiguous and unsatisfactory.</P>

As a follow on, will the Taoiseach comment on the lack of movement by the British authorities on prisoners and particularly the delay in their transfer to this jurisdiction? Three prisoners are awaiting the signature of the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, to be transferred. This delay is giving rise to real concern.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's views on this matter and the efforts the Government is making to have the repatriation process speeded up.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should acknowledge that over the summer months the British Government has made a move on the reclassification of prisoners which has been beneficial.  In Government we have continued to pursue and explore new ways of trying to speed up the process in relation to the transfer of prisoners and other matters which have been put before the British Government and have been talked about in bilaterals between ourselves and the British Government.  I accept fully the issue of prisoners, loyalist and republican, is a central part of confidence building measures.  Whatever progress can be made on this issue should be made.  I acknowledge the new British Government is forthcoming in endeavouring to make a number of classifications and administrative changes to speed up the process.  We will continue to pursue that with every haste.</P>

      <P>I would join the Taoiseach in acknowledging movement on the prisoners issue in Britain if that were the case in substantive terms.  What we have seen is a reclassification but in real terms what we have witnessed in recent weeks is a serious deterioration in the treatment of prisoners both in Whitemoor and in Belmarsh, matters which have been brought to public notice.  Certainly this must give rise to the real intent at this juncture.  We will need to see substance rather than a mere smokescreen which is very much the situation at present.</P>

      <P>On the subject of confidence building measures and the transfer of prisoners, I am glad to hear the Taoiseach say his concern is for loyalist and republican prisoners.  On the question of transfers to Northern Ireland, which mainly involves loyalist prisoners, I understand such transfers are on a temporary basis only and that gives rise to concern about parole and other matters.  Has the Taoiseach taken up with the British authorities the question of transfers without <Col N="890" /> the tag &ldquo;temporary basis only&ldquo;?  Also, for the applications of four republican prisoners to proceed, their tariffs &mdash; that is the time they will have to serve &mdash; will have to be set.  These prisoners are life prisoners so that before they can be transferred this matter has to be addressed.  Has the Taoiseach pressed the British authorities to set the tariffs so that this procedure can be put in place?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated he thought it was unfair to identify one aspect of the process in Northern Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> consent. Would he not accept that consent is fundamental to having accepted North and South an agreement which may be thrashed out in these negotiations, and that it is therefore important and essential that all participants should be at one in the process which will be put in place to achieve that consent?  Would he further agree that the Sinn Féin position is fundamentally different to that of every other single participant in these negotiations with regard to consent in that Sinn Féin denies the right of anybody other than themselves to have a view as to the self determination of the people of this island?  I welcome the Taoiseach's decision to reconvene the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle but would remind him the issue of consent was the issue at which Sinn Féin balked when that forum last met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to that as it is I who was trying to conclude the draft document.  The Deputy is correct on both issues. Consent is fundamental and the final discussions have to be based on consent.  However, there are other matters in the negotiations that have to be worked out and on which there has to be compromise and agreement.  I hope everybody involved in the dialogue, the bilateral and multilateral talks, the round table talks, the discussions of the two liaison subcommittees, the decommissioning and the three strands &mdash; all of which constitute a complex web and a mechanism for discussion &mdash; will see that we have to make compromises.  That is my overall point.  I readily accept that the issue of consent could be a major difficulty if people do not move in the course of talks.  I hope everyone will move on the various issues that divide them, and there are many.</P>

      <P>I join in the expressions of hope as a result of developments over the past week or so.  Having been involved in the previous most successful effort negotiated at Sunningdale, I recognise there are circumstances relating to the <Col N="891" /> talks now about to begin that did not exist then. At long last all of those necessary to a lasting solution to the Northern Ireland problem are around the same table.  That gives grounds for hope.  People have talked about the necessity for successful confidence-building measures.  I agree with the Taoiseach that confidence-building is a two-way process.  It would be of considerable help &mdash; Deputy Ó Caoláin, whose presence in the House I welcome, can make a major contribution in this regard &mdash; if the location of the bodies of the &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo;, the people murdered by the Provisional IRA, whose grieving relatives have no focal point for their grief, was disclosed by the republican movement to the Governments concerned or their relatives to allow them receive a Christian burial.  In passing on such a message to the leadership of the republican movement it should be pointed out that even in the most primitive, tribal and pagan societies bodies were returned for burial on the cessation of hostilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government attaches importance to keeping the public and the Oireachtas informed and to encouraging public debate on the Amsterdam Treaty.  The Taoiseach and I briefed the Dáil on 10 July on the outcome of the meeting of the European Council in Amsterdam.  This included a comprehensive presentation of the content of the treaty, the terms of which had been agreed by the European Council.  As the Deputy will be aware, the treaty has yet to be signed.  I will be signing the treaty, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland at a ceremony in Amsterdam on Thursday, 2 October.</P>
      <P>A White Paper is in preparation within my Department.  This will outline the contents of the treaty and will be one of the main instruments for informing the wider public of its provisions and their implications.  The Government has yet to decide the precise date of publication of the White Paper but it is likely to take place in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister the Government's intentions regarding informing the electorate of the contents of the Amsterdam Treaty.  While I welcome the fact that a White Paper is in preparation, the problem is that White Papers are often read only by those who are well informed about the issues involved.  Does the Minister intend to look at the possibility of providing freefone information lines to make the public aware of the arguments for and against ratification of the treaty?  As this is the first highly contentious issue to be put to the public in a referendum since the McKenna judgment, is it not time to be more creative and proactive in how we inform the public?  Does the Minister agree a page of terse almost unreadable print in a newspaper advertisement is not the best way to inform the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper will be a comprehensive and detailed factual document.  It is designed to be as reader friendly as possible to cover the point the Deputy has made.  I do not disagree with him in saying most people who read White Papers already have a detailed knowledge of them but in this case it will be as accessible as possible to the public and will brief the public on the background and context in which the negotiations took place.  The Minister of State will be familiar with that.  It will lay out the changes brought about by the provisions agreed at the European Council in Amsterdam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised the problem of the McKenna and Hanafin judgments.  This is one of the problems we have in drafting the White Paper and the information we make available to the public.  Subject to the views of the Attorney General given in the light of the McKenna and Hanafin judgments, the White Paper will offer the <Col N="893" /> Government's views on the outcome of the treaty negotiations.</P>
    <P>As regards other information, literature on the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; side of the campaign, I do not accept it will be as highly contentious as the Deputy suggested.  A good job was done in the negotiations; the Government of the day listened to many of the concerns expressed and negotiated a reasonable deal.  We should not talk it up as being a highly contentious treaty because that would not help the national interest.  However, in the light of the McKenna and Hanafin judgments we have to make decisions about the type of information that can be given.  On that matter I have already requested the advice of the Attorney General.  I note the Deputy's point that one way of tackling it would be via a free telephone information service.  I will take that on board depending on the type of legal advice I receive.</P>

Will the Minister say who is chairing the task force and how many times it has met since it was transferred?  Will he also say what preparations the task force has made for communicating the outcome of the Amsterdam Treaty so the public will be aware of the issues and can make a decision on a factual and informed basis when the question is put to them in the referendum.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the Communicating Europe task force has been transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs. It will meet on 9 October.  The membership of the task force is the same.  On this occasion it will be chaired by an Assistant Secretary within the Department rather than by a Minister of State. The important question of how Communicating Europe will get across the views and contents of the treaty to the general public will be on the task force's agenda.  At that initial meeting it will also take stock of exactly where it stands in financial and other areas to the end of the year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the task force worked on the basis of mail shots, by subsidising radio programmes and through other methods.  This will all be reviewed in the context of the upcoming referendum as well as in the context of the McKenna and Hanafin judgments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to bring the House up to date on the recent significant progress in the all-party negotiations in Belfast.</P>
      <P>A major breakthrough was achieved on 24 September when, after 16 months of deadlock, the participants adopted a procedural motion completing the work of the opening plenary session and launching the substantive political negotiations in the three strands.  This followed quickly on the entry of Sinn Féin to the negotiations, confirmed by its acceptance of the Mitchell principles of democracy and non-violence on 9 September.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies on both sides of the House will agree that these are historic developments. The British and Irish Governments are now sitting around the same table with representatives of elements of all traditions on these islands &mdash; Nationalists and republicans, Unionists and loyalists &mdash; for the purpose of bringing about a negotiated settlement covering relationships within Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland and between the people of Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>Last week's breakthrough required considerable effort and understanding from all those involved.  The momentum was provided by the two Governments &mdash; there had been continuous contact either between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and myself or officials in the lead up to last Wednesday. However, every one of the parties also played its part.  This is especially true of the Ulster Unionist Party which, in the face of constant attack from other elements within unionism, was prepared to overcome its reservations about sitting down with Sinn Féin and modify its stance on decommissioning in order to allow the negotiations to proceed.  I acknowledge David Trimble's courage in leading his party through these difficult decisions.</P>
      <P>Without revealing the details of last week's negotiations, it was no surprise to learn that it was John Hume, whose selfless commitment to the peace process has done much to bring us where we are today, who brokered the final breakthrough last Wednesday evening.  Similarly, I applaud the efforts of those within the republican movement who brought about the restoration of the IRA ceasefire of 20 July which opened the way for Sinn Féin's entry to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The business committee of the talks met this morning under the independent chairmanship of General de Chastelain.  Following that meeting, the intention is that negotiations in all three strands will open in Belfast next Tuesday.  Strand I negotiations will begin in the morning, Strand II in the afternoon and Strand III that evening.  I look forward to leading the Government delegation on this historic occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations, which will be based on an outline agenda adopted by the participants last Tuesday, will take place within three separate strands which will proceed in parallel.  Strand I negotiations involving the British Government and the political parties will cover the relationships <Col N="895" /> within Northern Ireland, including the relationship between any new institutions there and the Westminster Parliament.  Meetings will take place in Belfast and will be chaired by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Strand II negotiations, involving the two Governments and the political parties, will address the relationships within the island of Ireland.  Meetings will take place in Belfast, Dublin and London under the joint independent chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell, Prime Minister Harri Holkeri and General John de Chastelain.  Strand III negotiations on the wider British-Irish relationship will take place between the two Governments which will consult with the parties.</P>
    <P>The plenary will reconvene every two months or so, under the independent chairmanship of Senator Mitchell, to review progress across the spectrum of the negotiations and to consider whether the necessary confidence and momentum towards agreement is being sustained.  Two subcommittees of the plenary have been established to assist, as appropriate, with the implementation of all aspects of the report of the International Body on Decommissioning.  One subcommittee will deal with the issue of decommissioning and will liaise with the Independent Commission formally established by the Governments last Wednesday to facilitate the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.  The commission is made up of General de Chastelain of Canada, who will act as chairman, Brigadier Tauno Nieminen of Finland and Mr. Donald Johnson of the USA.  The other subcommittee of the plenary will deal with the other confidence-building measures identified in the report of the International Body on Decommissioning and any others which might be referred by agreement to the plenary.</P>
    <P>The launch of substantive negotiations gives the representatives of the main political parties in Northern Ireland and the two Governments a unique opportunity to achieve a lasting agreement, addressing the totality of relationships, which commands the consent of both Unionists and Nationalists.  Fully inclusive talks provide the best chance to achieve such an outcome.  Of those parties eligible to participate in the negotiations, only the DUP and the UKUP have refused to take their seats.  I appeal to these parties to reconsider their position.  Whatever the aspirations of any party, the present negotiations offer the only means by which they can realistically hope to attain them.</P>
    <P>I do not under-estimate the challenge facing the talks participants.  During the coming months it will be necessary to find acceptable political structures which can command sufficient consensus among the political representatives of both communities, and both Governments.  Once that agreement has been reached, the proposals will be put to the people in referendums, North and <Col N="896" /> South, before being placed before the respective Parliaments for ratification.</P>
    <P>I will keep the House informed of the state of progress in the negotiations through questions put to me on the matter, and through any other appropriate opportunity which arises.  The present negotiating framework has been carefully constructed and has many substantial assets, including international goodwill and the involvement of authoritative and skilled independent chairmen.  Balanced safeguards protecting the interests of all parties and the people they represent are in place.  As the Taoiseach stated last week, it is vital that all of the participants continue to work together constructively and in good faith to reach an agreed settlement as quickly as possible, in the interests of all the people of these islands.</P>

      <P>During my visit to the United States last week I emphasised the deep nature of the settlement we are seeking.  In my speech to the United Nations, for example, I described the all-party talks as a process in which the future of a peaceful and agreed Ireland is to be mapped out.  In making the same point to journalists in Washington, I also stated that while all parties would rightly come to the table with their respective agendas and proposals no one side could expect to gain everything it desired from the talks.  In this context, I gave a sense of the structure set out in the Framework Document but stated that nothing was predetermined or ruled out in advance and only in the context of the totality of relations could we find an historic solution.  In summary, I indicated we are seeking a fair, honourable and comprehensive settlement to this last residual problem in Anglo-Irish relations.</P>

      <P>On Thursday, 26 September <i>USA Today</i> reported that I stated: that an IRA ceasefire announced in July which led to talks is holding, within the letter and spirit of the law, a lasting peace in Northern Ireland would not mean an end to British authority, that this would not happen as a result of the talks and that Irish nationalists may argue for it but nobody at the table is going to get all of what they want.  I was expressing the reality of the talks in the context of the Framework Document.  While as an Irish Republican I would like to see a united Ireland emerging from the talks, I do not believe that will happen as a first step.  I believe there will be a three strand solution similar, in many ways, to that proposed in the Framework Document.  I do not want to outline the full extent of the Government's negotiating position at this early stage but we must be realistic about the outcome of the process.</P>

The outcome will be an historic compromise which will be acceptable to all, despite what I would like to come of it.  As far as the article in <i>An Phoblacht</i> is concerned, the Taoiseach expressed the views of the Government on the Thursday morning after it appeared.  Sinn Féin is aware of my views on that article and I do not think anything is being gained by going back over that.  There has been an historic breakthrough. There was an attempt to indict Sinn Féin at the talks this day last week and the two Governments have made a determination on that.  We have to look forward now rather than backwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Partnership for Peace was launched in January 1994 at a time when the Atlantic Alliance was coming under pressure to admit new members from Eastern Europe who wished to join the alliance in the new situation which had emerged following the end of the Cold War.  While Partnership for Peace was originally established with the aim of assisting such countries to democratise and develop their links with NATO, participation in Partnership for Peace was also made available to all OSCE countries.</P>
      <P>In March of last year, the previous Government announced in its White Paper on Foreign Policy its intention to explore the possible benefits for Ireland of participation in Partnership for Peace.  I subsequently raised the issue in this House on a number of occasions in order to seek clarification on the timing and substance of any Government decision on this matter.  The previous Government, however, never brought the issue of participation in Partnership for Peace to this House for decision.</P>
      <P>That is the background to the Deputy's question. For my part, I have consistently stated my position on Partnership for Peace on a number of occasions and I do so again today.  I do not believe that it is in the interests of this country to participate in Partnership for Peace.  My view on Partnership for Peace is in no sense isolationist or in conflict with our traditional support for peacekeeping under the UN.</P>
      <P>In my address to the UN General Assembly last week, I emphasised the importance of full international support for UN peacekeeping.  Such support must be forthcoming not only from states but also from regional organisations in a position to contribute.  The OSCE has a role to play in such support.  The European Union should have an increased role to play by virtue of the agreement at the Amsterdam Summit to include the Petersberg Tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management in the new Treaty on European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland already contributes to SFOR, the NATO-led stabilisation force, which operates under the mandate of the UN Security Council in Bosnia.  Irish participation in SFOR is in keeping with our firm commitment to play a positive peacekeeping role under United Nations auspices <Col N="899" /> and is in no way in conflict with our neutral position as a non-member of a military alliance.</P>
    <P>The priority of this Government will be to ensure that, as a militarily neutral State, Ireland continues to make a full contribution, in the framework of the UN, the OSCE and the European Union, to the prevention of conflict and the maintenance of peace.  We are prepared to co-operate on a practical basis, as and when we think it appropriate and warranted, with states and organisations involved in these joint efforts in the cause of peace, as our participation in SFOR amply demonstrates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister's view on this matter, but I do not know why he holds it. His approach is not in the national interest nor in the interests of international or European security. What have we in common with Tajikistan, a troubled country which has not joined Partnership for Peace even though the Russians, the other European neutral countries and approximately 50 OSCE members have?  What is so fragile about our neutrality that requires us, unlike any other European neutral country, to stand aside from membership of Partnership for Peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made the usual comment about Tajistikan.  He could also include Bosnia, Andorra and Liechtenstein.  Each state must make its own decision on these matters in the light of its circumstances and priorities.  The Deputy should refrain from making patronising and condescending remarks about those states which are not participating in Partnership for Peace.  The Irish people have a deep attachment to our military neutrality and that would be compromised by joining second class membership of NATO, the Partnership for Peace.  I do not believe we should do that.  We have a role to play in the United Nations, but not an isolationist one. By virtue of the Amsterdam Treaty and the Petersberg Tasks we are committed to a role in humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping matters and crises management.  Ireland would not benefit by formally joining Partnership for Peace.  The Deputy is anxious to know why I do not want us to join.  I would be interested to know why he wants us to do so.</P>

      <P>I refer him to paragraph 4.49 on page 130 which sets out the overall objectives of Partnership for Peace as being consistent with Ireland's approach in international peace and European security.  Is the Minister aware that <Col N="900" /> Russia is a member of Partnership for Peace and neither it nor NATO considers that to be second class membership of NATO?  Why can we not align with all the other neutral countries and participate in Partnership for Peace rather than aligning with trouble torn Tajikistan?  Why is it in our interest not to join?  What great threat would it pose to our neutrality?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to SFOR whose mission in Bosnia is worth noting in this regard.  Increasingly UN sanctioned missions will be subcontracted to regional structures and the debate in Europe on new practices in peacekeeping will be carried out in Partnership for Peace.  Will our military forces be at a disadvantage if they are not involved and informed about such discussions?  Is there not something bogus about a state which aspires to an active foreign policy and speaks grandly at the UN about what should be done, but will not even participate in discussions at this level?  Would our Defence Forces not learn something from Partnership for Peace and from their experience in peacekeeping?  Could they not teach others in the partnership?  How will they keep up with trends in this area if, like Tajikistan, they are isolated?  Is the Minister aware there is widespread concern in the Defence Forces about his approach to this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's last comment.  Many of the Deputy's points would have some validity had we not been actively participating in United Nations operations since the early sixties.  Our Defence Forces have a very honourable record, in excess of 75 of their members having given their lives in the course of United Nations peacekeeping missions since we began participation.</P>
      <P>I have already answered questions in relation to SFOR in my initial response.  I can confirm that there will be greater regionalisation of United Nations efforts, in addition to various regional organisations, on foot of the United Nations Security Council mandate within which we should work as far as possible and about which I spoke to the Secretary General when we met in New York last week.  I envisage nothing being gained from membership, rather considerable loss through joining.  If we found ourselves in circumstances in which we were isolationist there would be much validity in what the Deputy says but to join the club merely on the basis that everybody else is a member does not appear to me to be a very good reason.  We must examine the matter in the light of our national interests which I do not believe would be served through joining the NATO body Partnership for Peace.  We would be better served contributing from without.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to British plans to transfer republican prisoners from British to Irish prisons in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the transfer of republican prisoners in Britain to this jurisdiction under the terms of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, ratified by both Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have pursued the question of the transfer of republican prisoners within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference both on humanitarian grounds and as a confidence-building measure which would underpin the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The Government has consistently supported the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families. This view has been made clear to the British authorities.  We have repeatedly made clear that we stand ready to receive republican prisoners transferred under the provisions of the convention. Since the convention came into force for Ireland on 1 November 1995 six republican prisoners have been transferred to this jurisdiction. There are at present 21 convicted republican prisoners serving sentences in British prisons.  I am informed that to date 20 of them have made transfer applications.</P>
      <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, gives effect to the provisions of the European Convention in this jurisdiction.  It prescribes the steps that must be followed to enable a person serving a prison sentence in another jurisdiction to transfer here lawfully to complete the remainder of the sentence.  The Deputy will be aware that implementation of the Act is a responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Transfers from Britain to this jurisdiction require the consent of the person concerned, the Home Office in Britain and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Each case is considered separately.  Applications for transfer are first considered by the British Home Office and then forwarded to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The processing of the applications inevitably takes some time. However, I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to expedite the consideration of applications once they are received in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the applications which 20 republican prisoners have made are at different stages in the procedure set out in the Act.  I am further informed that, in the case of three republican prisoners currently serving sentences in <Col N="902" /> Britain, only the decision of the Home Secretary is now outstanding and it is expected shortly.  I am hopeful that a number of other transfers at present under consideration will take place soon.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue the expeditious processing of these applications and those made by other republican prisoners in Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the transfer of both loyalist and republican prisoners should be taken into account as part of the confidence-building exercise?  In regard to loyalist prisoners I understand the real problem arises through their transfer to Northern Ireland on a temporary basis only.  Is the Minister concerned about that aspect because of its implications for parole?  The Minister mentioned that 20 republican prisoners are seeking transfer to this jurisdiction. I understand that four have served over 20 years of a life sentence but they cannot be considered for transfer until their tariff has been set by the British Home Secretary.  Has the Minister raised the question of setting that tariff?  I understand it was to have taken place before the end of last December.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that as part of the process of transferring a prisoner to this jurisdiction consent is necessary from the Irish authorities, among others.  Is he satisfied that such consent has been forthcoming in all cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the transfer of the loyalist prisoners, we have consistently supported the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences as close to their families as possible, both on humanitarian grounds and as a confidence building measure.  I would strongly support any request by loyalist prisoners to be transferred to Northern Ireland if they so wish.  In this context I welcome the announcement last week by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that two loyalist prisoners are to be transferred at their request, one from Scotland to Northern Ireland and the other from England to Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the temporary nature of the transfers affects both loyalists and republicans.  I am conscious of the disadvantages which have been associated with temporary transfers to Northern Ireland, including the uncertainties they impose on prisoners and their families.  I have raised these within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I understand that as and from 1 October 1997, the British authorities will introduce new regulations on transfers under the Crime Sentences Act, 1997. From that date the prisoners on restricted transfer will become the responsibility of the Northern Ireland prison service and will be on the same footing as those convicted in Northern Ireland for all purposes except final release.  Issues to do with their final release will remain with the Home Secretary. I welcome this development which I hope will significantly improve the situation of the persons <Col N="903" /> affected.  It will give them certainty and should also allow for greater parole and movement.</P>
    <P>I have raised the question of the tariff and I understand it is being settled shortly.  It arises in connection with the cases to which I referred which are coming before the British Home Secretary.</P>
    <P>With regard the issue of consent from the Irish authorities, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, is co-operating in every way in an attempt to speed up the 20 of the 21 transfer requests that have been made.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that since the change of Government in Britain, the conditions under which Irish republican prisoners are kept has improved considerably and that they have been taken out of the special secure units, which probably contravene international human rights conventions?  Does the Minister agree that the British Government should be congratulated on the steps it has taken to facilitate the transfer of Irish republican prisoners to this country and to Northern Ireland?  I am advised that if the mechanisms are in place there will be no undue delay.</P>
      <P>In visiting these prisons and prisoners in England, the Council of Europe Subcommittee on Human Rights has considerably helped matters. Under the regime which existed, 15 of the 23 prisoners who were held in special secure units were Irish republican prisoners out of a total prison population of 62,000.  This was vindictive and was directed from a high political level in the previous British Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the British decision of 18 August to reclassify a number of republican prisoners as high rather than exceptional risk. This has meant most have been moved out of special secure units and can now receive the type of open visits for which we pressed.</P>
      <P>I have recently received a number of reports, which give rise to concern, regarding the conditions in which a number of prisoners are held. On foot of these, I instructed the Embassy in London to visit Belmarsh, Full Sutton and Whitemoor prisons last week, and to undertake a further series of consular visits to all republican prisoners in the next few weeks.  I have ensured the concerns of the prisoners and their families are brought to the attention of the British authorities. Because of the Deputy's ongoing interest, I will keep him informed of the outcome of these visits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 47 together.  As of 31 August 1997 the amount owing to Ireland by the UN arising from <Col N="905" /> our participation in peacekeeping operations was £11.6 million.  Most of these arrears are owed in respect of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, a peacekeeping operation to which we provide a troop battalion as our major commitment of personnel to the maintenance of international peace and security under the UN Charter.  The total deficit is accounted for as follows: UN Interim Force in Lebanon &mdash; £9,364,000; UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus &mdash; £1,390,000; UN Operations in Somalia &mdash; £1,086,000; Miscellaneous/Transport Costs &mdash; £19,793.  In the past six month period the UN repaid arrears totalling some £4.2 million.  It is a matter of serious concern that these substantial arrears are still outstanding. In contacts with the United Nations, we have consistently reiterated our view that every effort should be made by the UN Secretariat to reduce the amount of arrears owing to troop-contributing countries such as Ireland, particularly with regard to outstanding claims for death and disability, contingent-owned equipment and letters of assist.</P>
      <P>It is clear, however, that the problem of substantial arrears owing to Ireland and other troopcontributing countries is a direct result of the unprecedented financial crisis which the UN is currently experiencing and not due to any unwillingness on the part of the UN Secretariat to clear them.  This crisis has been caused by the failure of many member states, and in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This has led to a situation in which the Secretary General has been forced to delay normal reimbursements to troop contributors in order to deal with the serious cash flow situation facing the UN system.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, is firm in the demand that all member states of the UN must honour promptly and in full their financial obligations to the organisation under the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>While appreciating the difficulties caused by the financial crisis within the UN, Ireland and our EU partners are nevertheless resolved to maintain pressure on the UN to honour its obligation to make an early and full settlement of arrears owing.  We will continue to do so at every opportunity. We hope that efforts to resolve the financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries.  While attending the United Nations General Assembly session last week I met the Secretary General and asked him to accord priority to the full reimbursement of the sums owed as soon as possible.  I can assure the House that our permanent mission at New York will continue to make regular representations in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply.  Since President Clinton is endeavouring to meet the USA's commitments and to assist in removing this financial crisis does <Col N="906" /> the Minister know, following his recent visit to the UN, whether the £11.6 million due to us will be paid?  Is it likely to be this year or early next year?  Can the Minister confirm to the House that any contributions due from Ireland are paid on time?  Will he also confirm that such money returned from the UN goes to the Exchequer as an extra Exchequer receipt?  Will he consider raising with his colleague, the Minister for Defence, the possibility of earmarking that money for necessary capital expenditure and other facilities for the Defence Forces, rather than simply including it in the general Exchequer fund, which is already full with the contributions it has been receiving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>President Clinton has been helpful on this as on so many other issues and I thank him for his assistance on Northern Ireland.  I had the opportunity to meet him when I was in the US and his detailed knowledge of how the negotiations in Northern Ireland are proceeding is quite exceptional for a man with so many commitments world wide.  His commitment to and knowledge of Ireland are extraordinary and more than welcome.  He has played a leading role in repaying the US debt to the UN and he must work with both the House of Representatives and the Senate in that regard.</P>
      <P>The EU Foreign Ministers met the US Secretary of State, Ms Madeleine Albright, last week and we discussed the debt issue.  We were assured that a final decision will be reached before the end of the year.  We hope that when the decisions are made the debt will be paid over a three year period and that we will then see the payments of the moneys we are due.  I cannot tell the Deputy whether the money will be paid this year or next but it will be as soon as possible because we are pressing for it.  The debt will not affect requests from the UN to participate in other peacekeeping operations or prevent us from taking positive decisions in relation to requests for assistance.</P>
      <P>In 1997 we made a contribution of $2.236 million or approximately £1.542 million.  This is equivalent to 0.21 per cent of the UN budget. Member state contributions to the UN budget are based on <i>per capita</i> GNP.  The UN peacekeeping budget is separate from the regular budget to which we have also been contributing.  The Deputy can be assured that we contribute on time.  This has been a matter of honour for successive Governments.</P>
      <P>I listened to what the Deputy said regarding money for the Department of Defence for particular capital projects and suggest he table a question to the Ministers for Finance and Defence.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying there is no prospect of the outstanding debts owed to Ireland by the UN being paid until the United States and the Russian Federation pay the outstanding moneys due by them to the UN?  Did the US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, indicate during <Col N="907" /> discussions a greater likelihood of co-operation from Capitol Hill, which has been totally opposed for a number of years to paying further moneys to the UN?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not wish to give the impression that further progress on the matter was dependent on the US paying its debt. However, it is clear that we will not receive all outstanding moneys until the US clears its debt.</P>
      <P>There is a new reality on Capitol Hill regarding the role of the UN and I welcome this.  It is obvious from discussions between EU Foreign Ministers and Madeleine Albright that there is an expectation that this matter will be dealt with. President Clinton made it clear in his speech to the 52nd UN General Assembly last week that addressing the debt was important.  The Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, has put forward a reform package and there is a warmth in the US Administration towards it.  I believe this will result in an agreement between the President and Capitol Hill to pay the debts.</P>

I also expect the Government's commitment to growth in our overseas aid project to be reflected in the new <Col N="909" /> statement and to be in a position to spell out our approach to the European Union in more detail in light of the outcome of the Amsterdam summit and the Commission's proposals.  We will also look at the financial aspects of it because it affects any strategic target changes and financial operations. On the financial side, we want to see we are managing our resources as effectively as possible. The Deputy may be assured the plan will be reviewed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome this opportunity and I thank the House for agreeing to the taking of these expressions of sympathy.  This House is a poorer place after the sad, untimely passing of Deputy Jim Kemmy, the <Col N="911" /> chairman of the Labour Party.  We were all aware that our colleague was seriously ill, an illness which he bore stoically with courage and fortitude, as he approached all aspects of his life.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the many tributes paid to Jim Kemmy over the past few days that he was a very popular Member of this House and was respected by all sides.  That respect was earned by his many years of service in this House, as a trade unionist and as a member of Limerick Corporation where he very proudly served as mayor, and in his life in Limerick in general.</P>
      <P>Many have described Jim Kemmy as a big man on the landscape, and that he was.  He was born in Limerick in 1936 and he understood well the harshness of life for many in his native city, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s.  He also experienced the trauma of exile as he went to England in the 1950s.  On his return in 1960 he became an active trade unionist, particularly in the stonemasons' and bricklayers' union, and was an active stonemason.</P>
      <P>He had an active life in politics for over 30 years, some of which, as is well known, was outside the Labour Party when he led the Democratic Socialist Party.  I and my colleagues in the Labour Party were particularly glad that in more recent times he rejoined the Labour Party after the merger of our parties took place.  The high esteem in which he was held by our party was evidenced by the fact that he went on to become the vice-chairman and then chairman of our party.</P>
      <P>Of course, Jim Kemmy also had another life outside politics which was equally important to him.  He was, by and large, self-educated.  He was widely read and the proud editor of the <i>Old Limerick Journal</i> for many years.  He was a great supporter of the arts in his native city and throughout the country and his fine work, <i>The Limerick Anthology</i>, was published last year.  Many people are aware that he was looking forward to the publication of the compendium of Limerick literature, which was due to take place in November.</P>
      <P>His politics were influenced by strong views on poverty, personal freedom and the national question. He voiced his views without fear or favour over many years and on many occasions when it was neither fashionable nor profitable to so do. If anybody doubted his stature and standing in the city he loved so well, they would have been left in no doubt on the streets of Limerick yesterday afternoon.  The people of Limerick lined the streets to say farewell to one of its favourite sons.</P>
      <P>His companion Patsy, his brother Joe, his sisters Maureen and Joan and their families, all of whom are rightly very proud of Jim Kemmy and his achievements, will mourn his passing and they have our sincere sympathy on this sad occasion. Jim Kemmy was a man of the people in the truest meaning of that expression, whether as a stonemason, trade unionist, politician, local historian or friend of many Members of this House.  We all mourn his passing, untimely as it was.</P>

Frank McCourt calls his powerful story &ldquo;a small hymn to the exaltation of women&rdquo;.  Jim Kemmy stood for the real men and women of Limerick.  In the hearts and minds of Limerick people everywhere there has been &ldquo;a small hymn to the exaltation of Jim Kemmy&rdquo;, ever since they heard of his passing last week.</P>
      <P>He was a gifted man of contrasts in pursuit of the common good, driven like his heroes, Connolly and Larkin, and his feisty contemporary, Noel Browne, of whom he spoke here recently, to crusade without ceasing for the real causes of the real people.</P>
      <P>Rough as the stones he shaped with his stonemason's hands when the cause necessitated it, as we found in the Fianna Fáil Party on a number of occasions, he never allowed anyone to take him or his causes for granted.  He was the strong man for those who had not the strength to oppose the establishment, and the voice of those who were voiceless in their disadvantage or distance from the levers of power.  He was never afraid to break the links of comfort which can be found in party or power and go it alone for the sake of what, in his eyes, was right, just and equitable.</P>
      <P>Limerick can be immensely proud of this man who left school at 15 to become an apprentice stonemason and who, two years later, became the breadwinner of his family.</P>
      <P>His introduction to the trade union movement in London marked a decisive option for his life's work and it became the bedrock of his inspiration, his relentless campaigning and his lifelong pursuit and love of learning.</P>
      <P>All the strands of his life &mdash; his trade unionism, his publication of the <i>Limerick Socialist</i>, his proud task as editor of the <i>Old Limerick Journal</i>, his strong personal views on social and moral issues and that special fire that burned within him &mdash; all led inevitably to a role in public life.  He was elected to Limerick County Council in 1974 &mdash; without the robes &mdash; and became an alderman in 1979 and Lord Mayor of his beloved Limerick on two occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the history of his membership of this House, from his dramatic arrival as an Independent in 1981 to his even more dramatic actions in January 1982, his return in February and his departure for five years in November of the same year.  Whether as an Independent, a member of his Democratic Socialist Party or his final seven years as a high profile member of the Labour Party, Jim Kemmy's voice was never one which could be stilled.  He mellowed in his role as vice-chairman and ultimately chairman of the Labour Party, but no party structures could ever <Col N="913" /> quiet his restless spirit or keep his unique speaking voice off the national airwaves.</P>
    <P>It was my privilege to know him well and to visit him during his final illness.  I was deeply impressed by his wry fortitude and the silent bravery with which he bore his sickness, reminding me of Frank Cluskey who also battled so bravely with his illness.  For many years I knew him personally through his work with the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>No one could ever doubt his sincerity and integrity, but it took a while and personal contact to appreciate his great learning, his love of old buildings and art, his vast knowledge of global issues and local history, his love for life and people's right to live their lives as free people in a just society.</P>
    <P>Our sympathies go to his companion Patsy, his brother Joe, his two sisters, Maureen and Joan, and all his colleagues and friends in the Labour Party.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I wish to express our sympathy to all his parliamentary colleagues who I know miss him even more than the rest of us.  Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh anam dílis Jim Kemmy, and nár laige a chuimhne go deo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish to join with Deputy Spring and the Labour Party, who so grievously feel this loss, and with all Members of the House in expressing sympathy to Joe Kemmy, his sisters Joan and Maureen, and Patsy Harrold on this dreadful loss.</P>
      <P>I spoke to Jim Kemmy four days before he died and his interest in politics was as alive and acute then as ever.  He was experiencing extreme pain, as he did for most of his last illness.  He was a man of great fortitude who would describe himself as having a high threshold for pain, but he was shocked by the extent of the suffering he had to undergo.  However, he did not lose his dignity or his sense of perspective and could speak about it, even at that extreme moment coming towards the end of his life, with detachment and understanding. The way in which he bore his final illness gives hope and understanding and sets an example to all who face this dreadful moment of death, particularly those who experience a painful death, as Jim did.</P>
      <P>It is also worth acknowledging that despite suffering this illness he did not became self-centred. On my return from the other side of the world this morning I received a letter from Jim Kemmy, written by him two days before he died, thanking me for having visited him.  That says all that needs to be said about the way in which he appreciated what others did for him.  He thought of others and the generosity shown to him.  The way he lived his life and bore his final illness was an example and a service to all who knew him, whether as constituents, fellow politicians or others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would single out Jim Kemmy for the courageous stand he took on the national question.  It was not a popular point of view to advocate &mdash; that there are two legitimate nationalities on the island, British and Irish, and that both should be <Col N="914" /> respected.  He was a socialist who understood before many others that there could not be reconciliation between the two traditions without respect by each tradition for the other.  A sense of the paramountcy of respect for others, particularly those with differing opinions, was at the heart of Jim Kemmy's socialism.  His socialism was founded in respect for the dignity of each individual.  The quotations from <i>Angela's Ashes</i> to which the Taoiseach referred sum up aptly that sense of respect for others, no matter what the misfortunes they face, which characterised Jim Kemmy's life and work.</P>
    <P>He was a politician who had a great sense of history; a sense that our work here is but a moment, a passing phase in a great sweep of events.  He was proud of the history of his own city and through it he came to understand that the dilemmas we face today are not new.  Rather, there is a recurring process of problem solving which is part of our occupation.</P>
    <P>Jim Kemmy said something to me which is relevant to the House and which deserves repetition, although I cannot now ask his permission to repeat it.  He told me that we in politics should have more respect for our profession.  He said that we should not allow others to denigrate it. For the most part those politicians who stand for election and serve in office do so for good motives.  Whatever we may do to eradicate failings in our system we should not allow the public to get the mistaken impression that democratic politics in Ireland is other than service by people who enter the profession largely from selfless not self-serving motives.  That was the message from Jim Kemmy with which I left St. James Hospital a few days before he died.  I did not expect to pass it on to the House in these circumstances because he expected to recover from his illness.  However, it is a message of which we should take account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I join in the tributes and expressions of sympathy on the death of Jim Kemmy.  I was greatly saddened to learn of his death.  Although I knew he had been ill for some time the eventual speed of his death was shattering.  When he and I started out together in Limerick politics 30 years ago there were sharp differences between us.  I am glad that in recent years we became good friends and I recognised in him a man of great sincerity and integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday morning when I heard the sad news it struck me that we needed somebody like him at a time such as this.  One could say fairly about him that he gave politicians a good name.  He will always be remembered for that.  He was a man of great stature, particularly in Limerick.  At his funeral yesterday I was reminded that the last Deputy who died in Limerick was my late uncle Donogh O'Malley and although they were different people they were held in enormous affection by the people of Limerick, an affection I have not seen others acquire.  The large number of people <Col N="915" /> at the funeral yesterday were testament to that affection.</P>
    <P>Jim Kemmy had been a member of Limerick Corporation for 17 years before he was elected Mayor.  I was glad my party contributed to his election and helped him to achieve one of his great objectives in public life.  He was re-elected subsequently.  My party came to an arrangement with him at that time which, although it was difficult for him, he honoured scrupulously.  I admired the great scruples with which he gave and kept his word.</P>
    <P>He suffered a very severe and painful illness.  If any good can be seen in this sad event it is that he is no longer suffering.  We should be grateful for that because he fought his illness with great courage and dignity.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest reasons we should regret his passing is that he did not have the opportunity to write more about the history of Limerick, particularly its social history.  He had much to contribute in that domain and what he wrote was not just good because of its scholarship but because it encouraged others to take an interest in their native places.  His achievements in that regard were valuable.</P>
    <P>From time to time Jim Kemmy became disenchanted with aspects of public life, not least in this House.  However, he never became disenchanted with Limerick.  Our city has suffered a severe loss.  I offer his partner and his family my deepest sympathy, a sympathy widely shared by the many who came in contact with him.  I would like to think that he would wish that at the end of his life we would not just be sad but that we would take the opportunity to celebrate a remarkable life of great variety, generosity, talent and achievement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with colleagues of all parties in mourning the death of Jim Kemmy. He is a great loss to public life in Ireland, to the Dáil and to the left.  The greatest loss of all is that to his partner, Patsy, his relatives and the people of Limerick, whom he served well and with distinction and commitment for a long time.  As has been said, Jim Kemmy was a political giant.  He had a huge impact on the development of socialist thinking in Ireland and was a man of immense courage.  He was never afraid to confront difficult issues and was a political trailblazer who tackled those issues when others wanted to sweep them under the carpet.</P>
      <P>I particularly admired his innovative thinking on Northern Ireland.  He championed recognition of Northern Ireland as a separate entity and recognition of different allegiances on this island which have to be accommodated.  He challenged us all to accept the principle of consent, the idea that we must respect those who differ from us even though it may challenge our very notion of who and what we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jim Kemmy was much more than a political leader of stature.  He was a writer, historian and <Col N="916" /> craftsman.  He gave all of his intellect and ability to those pursuits.  He did much to document the history of his native city and to put the common man and woman at the centre of that history.  On behalf of Democratic Left I wish his partner, Patsy, his relatives and his colleagues in the Labour Party my deepest sympathy and the sympathy of all the members of Democratic Left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend on behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, our sympathy to Patsy and the family of the late Jim Kemmy, to his friends, to the people of Limerick and to his colleagues in the Labour Party.  Jim Kemmy was a giant of a man in every way, as has been said.  We will miss him in the House for his extraordinarily friendly manner in all circumstances.  His manner was always courteous, no matter who he was in conversation with, and he was admired greatly across all parties, which is clear from all speakers. He was a crusader for the disadvantaged in society.  He spent years trying to awaken this country to the wrongs of a two-tiered society, and we owe it to him to continue on that crusade as strongly as he did.</P>
      <P>Some would call him a maverick, but he was the kind of maverick we need more of in this House and in politics generally.  He was not afraid to speak his mind.  Many in the Green Party will warmly remember his courageous stance on issues such as Mullaghmore and on hare coursing, which was not easy to do in his area.  He criticised the tax amnesty, which was a difficult decision for him at the time.  He was also a humanitarian in the wider international sense.  He led antiapartheid protests, which should also be remembered.</P>
      <P>Jim Kemmy was a man of conviction and courage. Any student of politics will be reminded how he sacrificed a Dáil term because of his principles. In so doing, he associated courage with the world of politics in a way that will always be remembered. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I seek the Chair's guidance.  Standing Order 31 asks for leave to move a motion for the adjournment of the Dáil on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration.  If the Ceann Comhairle thinks there is a more urgent matter for consideration here today, I will eat my hat.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to take into account the advice given by the late Deputy Kemmy to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, when he said that &ldquo;if you do not respect yourself, you cannot expect other people to respect you&rdquo;.  This is the first opportunity we have had to debate this matter following the revelations over the weekend and if we are seen, once again, to bury this problem the public will begin to view this establishment as totally and utterly irrelevant.</P>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach, through the Whips Office, for Government time to debate this matter today.  Obviously time is not being granted as I did not receive any further communication on the matter.  The only step open to the Opposition is to invoke Standing Order 31 and the Ceann Comhairle, as an impartial Member of this House, should consider our position and our efforts to have this matter debated.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on numerous occasions, no Member of this House wants any other Member's reputation to be taken away without that Member having the opportunity to defend himself or herself.  We have been criticised for going easy on the previous occasion this matter was debated because we did not kick up a row.  I will not kick up a row about any Member of this House unless I have evidence to do so.  In view of the ongoing revelations, I think it only fair that an independent tribunal of inquiry should investigate this matter at a preliminary stage of proceedings and if there is no foundation for further investigation we can forget about it.  If there is further evidence we should investigate the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> All Members of the House are anxious to restore public confidence in the political system.  The Taoiseach made a statement in the public media on Sunday in relation to the establishment of a tribunal.  The terms of reference of the proposed tribunal have not been circulated to any Member of this House to date but there is, I understand, a promise to circulate them between five and six o'clock this evening.  There is a request for a one hour debate tomorrow on the terms of reference which we have not yet seen.  It is my experience that the terms of reference for all previous tribunals were subject to debate with all parties in the House.  That has not been the intent or the practice in this case.  Deputies on this side of the House are left in an invidious position in trying to focus on the restoration of confidence in public office.  We genuinely want to have this matter dealt with.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago we sought to have this matter included in the preliminary siftings of the Moriarty tribunal.  I believe that is still the correct way to proceed in this matter.  There is probably, at this stage, a majority of Members who would support the inclusion of this matter in the Moriarty tribunal.  That would be very much in the interest of politics and in the interests of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in order that he could proceed, without distraction, with the very important national work he has responsibility for.  That is not going to happen.  The view beginning to emerge is that the establishment of another tribunal is some kind of smokescreen; that will do the service of politics no good at all.</P>

The Ceann Comhairle has made his decision, and I accept that, on the basis that there is an anticipated debate.  The Taoiseach should at least take this opportunity to assure the House that adequate time will be provided to debate the terms of reference of the proposed new tribunal.  This is a complicated matter.  The Taoiseach has breached his own precedent by refusing to consult the Opposition on the terms of reference of the proposed tribunal.  It is absolutely bewildering as to why a separate tribunal is necessary when, only two weeks ago, this House divided on a motion proposed by my party which would have included this matter at the preliminary stages of the Moriarty tribunal.  The Taoiseach should give us an undertaking that the rumour that one hour will be provided tomorrow to discuss a matter as complicated as this is untrue; he should assure the House that adequate time will be provided tomorrow and, if necessary, the following day whereby we could have a Committee Stage style debate to deal with this matter. We have already set up an expensive mechanism to investigate the affairs of two politicians of yesterday but there seems to be an extraordinary reluctance on the Government's part to investigate the affairs of a politician of today.</P>

The Member made as fully comprehensive a statement as he thought necessary.  There was also a suggestion, one with which I agreed, that he should make a statement before this House.  Unlike the situation which pertained regarding Deputy Lowry last Christmas, it was suggested that the Member should participate in a question and answer session in the House according to the normal precedent of 20 minutes.  Opposition Members requested an hour and I suggested to Minister Burke that it should be so.  During the course of that debate, it was implied that Minister Burke's answers were not sufficiently good and that further investigation should be carried out.  I disagreed with that and still do.</P>
      <P>In the cases of Deputy Lowry and Mr. Haughey, the McCracken tribunal found them to be guilty of some wrongdoing and it is important that the McCracken report, which is now being passed on to the Moriarty tribunal, should deal comprehensively with those issues in relation to bank accounts and other related matters.  The Minister, Deputy Burke, is being blamed, without any substance, in regard to another issue.  It is obvious that at least one of the individuals concerned has a huge number of files &mdash; the word &ldquo;huge&rdquo; was quoted to me by others &mdash; which will be drip fed into the public domain.  It has been suggested to me that those files may not be concerned with lands but with other issues.  I have been asked to allow this matter come under the terms of the Moriarty tribunal, which would be totally unfair to the individual, and I have been advised it is not possible to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal once it has been set up.  It is possible to establish another tribunal with the same judge chairing both, but that would lengthen both tribunals. I am advised that it may be next summer before the matters being dealt with by the Moriarty tribunal are finalised.  That is not satisfactory but I cannot do anything about it.  To allow that tribunal investigate other issues would not be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made the decision to set up a new tribunal which will deal comprehensively with planning matters and issues related to the Minister, Deputy Burke, in that regard.  The Government is not stonewalling those issues but I will not allow one issue concerning £30,000 to come under the terms of reference of an appropriate <Col N="922" /> tribunal only to find that the day after it has been established, another piece of paper becomes available which must be investigated.</P>
    <P>In addition to setting up an inquiry to deal with all relevant matters concerning Bovale, JMSE, Mr. Gogarty, Mr. Bailey and any other persons associated with the 756 acres of land, the terms of reference will cover any other issue regarding any other planning matter in north Dublin that is brought to light in the sifting process, as referred to by Deputy Barrett.  They will then be dealt with as the tribunal progresses.  This and any other relevant issue will be dealt with in the fullness of time.  I do not propose to set up a tribunal to investigate every planning case over the past 25 years; that would sit for years.  Issues that arise from the tribunal will be investigated.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the House is trying to deal with this matter and I also appreciate the co-operation I have received from the other party leaders and the Whips in that regard.  I ask them to examine these terms of reference, which are neither long nor complex, and if they have any suggestions to make I will try to take them on board.  I hope the House will deal with this matter in the manner I suggest.  I am anxious to deal with it as speedily as possible and I ask the Members for their co-operation.  Perhaps the Whips can meet following this debate and hopefully we can then move forward.</P>

      <P>The type of inquiry the Government is proposing is simply a delaying tactic.  If the Taoiseach wanted to deal with the circumstances of this £30,000 payment, he would refer the matter to the Moriarty tribunal where it would be dealt with quickly.</P>
      <P>I wish to make two points that are important. Fianna Fáil was in control of Dublin County Council in 1989.  The letter from Mr. Bailey stated that he wanted a material contravention of the plan.  That was something to be delivered within two years i.e. within the period Fianna Fáil was still in control of Dublin County Council.  That letter was sent to Mr. Gogarty three days before Mr. Gogarty went to see the Minister, Deputy Burke, and handed over the money.  That coincidence of events and the short-term envisaged in the letter, in so far as the material contravention had to take place within a two year period which happened to coincide with the continued life of the Fianna Fáil majority in Dublin County Council, needs to be independently investigated.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's proposal for a broad ranging inquiry which will investigate everything that happened in north County Dublin is an attempt to avoid the issue.  I do not have any problem with a separate inquiry into this matter but the particular donation of £30,000 to Deputy Burke should be specifically investigated in the light of the letter that has been published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points. Unfortunately, once a debate such as this is allowed to commence, it can cause a difficulty, but I totally object to the way Deputy Bruton conveniently misrepresented everything I said.  If the Deputy is interested in dealing with this matter, as his party Whip said, he should wait to see the terms of reference.  The issue of the £30,000, and the related Bailey-JMSE land, can be dealt <Col N="924" /> with but the Deputy and I know, without allegation, that people are saying there may be six or seven other issues to be addressed.  I do not intend to get somebody to inquire into those but if information comes to light in the sifting process, it will be addressed.  Issues will not be dealt with unless they are raised.</P>
      <P>It is our belief that this entire matter can be dealt within three months.  The legal advice given to me, which is the same legal advice the Deputy would have received, is that if a tribunal is set up its terms of reference cannot be amended.  Even if it were possible to change the terms of reference, I believe that would be wrong.  It is far better to set up a separate tribunal which will deal with the issue of the 756 acres and then move on to the other issues.  That is the decision of the Government.  We are having this debate without seeing the terms of reference.  If people are serious, they might deal with that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to express my concern about the course of action suggested by the Taoiseach. Some weeks ago the Taoiseach sought co-operation from the Opposition parties and it was readily forthcoming.  At the same time the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, took a position which was turned on its head at midday last Sunday.  The situation has now changed dramatically.  The Chairman of the Progressive Democrats Party, a partner in Government, is calling for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to step aside.  The Taoiseach is ill advised if he is convinced he cannot put the matters now under discussion into the existing tribunal as there is a mechanism for so doing with the agreement of the chairman.  This should be done as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I have no information other than the fact that a £30,000 cheque was given to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, there is a letter and meetings took place.  If there are other matters then the Taoiseach owes it to the House to put them on the record and deal with them now.  Otherwise the innuendo, smears and destruction of politics will continue.  There is a way of dealing with the matter.  We have agreed on the setting up of a tribunal and this matter should be put into it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an enabling Bill, enabling Ireland to ratify the 1995 Europol Convention and related Protocols. The convention provides a framework for law enforcement co-operation in the field of international organised crime.  It provides for the establishment of Europol on a statutory basis to facilitate the exchange of information and intelligence between the law enforcement authorities of the member states of the European Union and to carry out in-depth analyses on the crimes within its remit.  Europol's central objective will be to assist member states in preventing and combating serious organised international crime affecting two or more member states.</P>
      <P>As a small island nation on the periphery of Europe, we might like to regard ourselves as, in some way, immune or removed from the full effects of international crime.  The reality is different. There is reason to believe that our geography lends itself to Ireland being used by highly organised criminals as a gateway to and from the rest of Europe, leaving us exposed to all forms of international crime.  This is particularly the case in the area of drug trafficking where Ireland's extensive coastline has been used for the importation of large quantities of illegal drugs for use not only here but also in other European countries causing untold misery and, sometimes, death of our young people.  Also, we are beginning to see Ireland becoming a focus for illegal immigrant smugglers.  It is all too clear to us that a small country cannot tackle these problems effectively on its own.  We need to share information and intelligence with other countries on the operations of these criminals, their <i>modus operandi</i>, their networks and the routes they use.</P>
      <P>Organised crime, particularly crimes such as drug trafficking which generate large financial profits, is especially hard to combat.  These criminals have vast resources at their disposal often exceeding those of states.  They are very versatile and exploit weaknesses or loopholes wherever they exist.  They have the resources to employ skilled people and to use a sinister carrot and stick approach by way of bribery and threats, to overcome any obstacles in their way.  It would be naive to think that such ruthless criminals could be defeated by anything other than an energetic, pro-active and multi-faceted approach, embracing effective international co-operation and a zero tolerance policy here.  My policy includes both of these elements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratification of the Europol Convention, on which I will elaborate further, will be a milestone <Col N="938" /> in the development of co-oporation between the 15 EU member states in the fight against international organised crime.  It will not only enhance the flow of information and intelligence but will give significant added-value to these through in-depth analysis with the aid of a sophisticated computed system.</P>
    <P>As any police or customs officer will tell us, access to intelligence and information is essential in the tackling of organised crime, be it on a domestic or an international scale.  It is crucial when crime goes beyond national boundaries.  Criminals exploit weaknesses in our legal systems.  They use sophisticated aliases.  They develop complex trafficking routes, often zig-zagging through several countries, to avoid detection.  National boundaries are no obstacle to them.  It is one of the tools they use to defeat the law enforcement authorities.  We must fight back.  The pooled information which Europol will have and the added-value it will give to it through in-depth analysis of criminal organisations, their <i>modus operandi,</i> ever changing trafficking routes and personnel will be of major assistance to all member states.</P>
    <P>The convention also includes provisions which will enable Europol to give and receive information from international organisations, for example, Interpol, and countries outside the European Union, subject to certain safeguards. This will assist in tackling crime on a world scale. This is particularly relevant in tackling drug trafficking and money laundering.  With the exception of synthetic drugs and home grown cannabis, all drugs of abuse are produced outside the European Union.  In the case of money laundering, vast sums of money can be transferred in a matter of seconds by electronic wire transfer not only from one country to another but through several countries anywhere in the world and through an intricate series of financial companies.  Ratification of the Europol Convention will be a significant step in tackling these crimes.</P>
    <P>In the recent past what the policy of zero tolerance means in the fight against crime has been the subject of heated debate.  There have been misinterpretations and misrepresentations by certain members of the Opposition.  The concept of zero tolerance is, above all else, directed at positive action against serious criminals, especially those involved in the drugs trade and organised crime. My clear objective is to provide the Garda with the means, equipment and manpower to investigate all crime.  My objective is to ensure that all crime is investigated, where possible, detected and, where the interests of justice and society so require, prosecuted.  The victims of housebreakers, burglars and car thieves do not regard these crimes as trivial or minor and neither does the Government.  It is entirely disingenuous of Opposition politicians to claim, as they have done in recent times, that the policy has somehow been put on the back burner and confined to the issue of drugs.  I repeat that no form of wrongdoing is <Col N="939" /> acceptable and none will be tolerated.  If that were the case, this House would not have passed laws which state quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>I intend to take seriously the duty of the State to protect the citizen's right to live in peace free from the fear of criminal intrusion.  Time and again I have said that in the hierarchy of obligations the obligation of a sovereign Government to protect its people and their property is a superior one.</P>
    <P>It is true, however, that by far the worst form of intrusion at this moment in our history is by thugs involved in drugs and other organised crime.  None of us in this House, irrespective of our political differences, would seek to minimise the damage being done by these people.  They blight and often destroy young lives and, thereby, sentence entire communities in city and country to an intolerable existence.  Recent research has shown again that drugs are responsible for up to two thirds of all crime.</P>
    <P>The zero tolerance approach I advocated in Opposition and which I now advocate in Government is about action on the ground and, by way of legislation, curbing drug dealers and other criminals.  Citizens demand that and they are entitled to it.  I want zero tolerance to meet that demand in full.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the following items as part of the successful implementation of its programme.  One thousand more prison places will be provided in two years.  This means we will increase the current number of prison places by 50 per cent and that will be a significant achievement providing in excess of 3,000 prison places. That will have a considerable bearing on the scandal of temporary release as currently operated.</P>
    <P>We intend to increase Garda numbers to 12,000 over a period of five years.  We intend giving agency status to the prison service and the courts to help them function more efficiently.  We intend to encourage serious Garda operational initiatives to strengthen their hand in fighting serious crime.  We will be presenting an imaginative and innovative legislative programme on which I will now expand to some extent.</P>
    <P>I am determined to fine comb the criminal law to remove every obstacle which exists to the fast, efficient and fair administration of justice and to close off any loopholes being exploited by criminals. As legislators, we must ensure that the fight against crime is enhanced by our work.  The Government has already approved the final drafting of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997 on the basis of detailed proposals which I have submitted.</P>
    <P>During the summer months a considerable amount of time was spent by me and my officials in drafting this extremely important legislation as one of the pillars of the zero tolerance policy. This major piece of criminal law will be introduced as early as possible in the current session. It will contain measures in relation to speedier trials, minimum ten year sentences for serious drug trafficking offences, initiation by the courts <Col N="940" /> of inquiries into the assets of persons convicted of drug trafficking and other serious offences and allowing technical evidence to be given by gardaí by certificate in court, thus freeing up their time to attend to other duties.  These proposals will clearly give effect to a number of commitments contained in the Government's programme in the context of the policy of zero tolerance, particularly against drug pushers and other serious criminals.</P>
    <P>Other criminal law reform Bills which I propose to publish either in this session or early in the next session include a revised Juvenile Justice Bill, a Bill to deal with child pornography, a Bill to amend the law in relation to criminal insanity, a Bill to enable Ireland to co-operate with the International War Crimes Tribunals and the United Nations Convention against Torture Bill.</P>
    <P>Work is also well under way on legislative proposals to deal with the substantive law on fraud. A discussion paper to review the law on sexual offences is being drawn up.  Extradition treaties with Canada and South Africa are being negotiated. In addition, a review is ongoing of criminal law issues relevant to the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, the approach is to give the Convention and its two subsequent Protocols the force of law in the State and to provide for certain ancillary matters.  The Bill itself, therefore, is comparatively short.  For ease of reference the Convention and Protocols are appended to the Bill in both English and Irish, the texts being equally authentic in both languages.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detail of the individual sections, I propose to give the background to the drawing up of the Europol Convention and then to concentrate on the provisions of the Convention and its subsequent Protocols.  The creation of the Single Market and the breakdown in borders within the European Union have facilitated an unprecedented increase in cross-border crime. Just as honest, law-abiding citizens can now move easily from one country to another within the Union, so also can Europe's criminals.  The Justice and Home Affairs Ministers of member states were acutely aware of the need for compensatory measures to prevent the exploitation of this free movement by criminals and to protect their citizens against organised crime.  This led to a decision to establish Europol by the European Council at its meeting in Maastricht in December 1991.</P>
    <P>From November 1993 onwards, work on the draft Convention was continued within the structures provided for in Title Vl of the Treaty on European Union.  In December 1993 the European Council meeting in Brussels decided that Europol would have its seat in The Hague.  It was to be some considerable time yet, however, before agreement could be reached amongst the EU member states on Europol's precise role and powers.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, and in anticipation of the time it would take for the Convention to be concluded and ratified, the Europol Drugs Unit or EDU was <Col N="941" /> set up by ministerial agreement of the then 12 member states.  The purpose of the EDU was to allow information to be exchanged concerning, initially, illicit drug trafficking and associated money-laundering activities involving two or more member states.  Its mandate was extended in March 1995 by the European Council to include illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, crimes involving illegal immigration networks and trafficking in stolen vehicles.  These crimes are of major concern to EU member states.  They are also frequently committed by the same organised criminal groups. Often the same trafficking routes and distribution networks are used by unscrupulous criminals who will smuggle drugs, people, stolen vehicles and radioactive substances into and around the EU for financial gain.  The aim of the criminals is to get their hands on the vast sums of money which accrue from these criminal activities.  The EDU's mandate was further extended in December 1996 to include trafficking in human beings, following the horrific paedophile incidents in Belgium which were uncovered last year.</P>
    <P>The EDU, which is now in its fourth year of operation in The Hague, has led to considerable successes, particularly in combating drug trafficking and money laundering.  The EDU was only ever meant to operate as an interim measure, however, with the result that it operates on a more limited basis than will Europol under the convention.  Its most obvious drawbacks are that it has no legislative status and it cannot store personal information.  Once in force, the convention will effectively replace the EDU.  The advantages of supplanting the EDU with Europol will include not just giving it a firm, statutory basis for its activities or the ability to store personal information, but also the provision of a sophisticated computer system, access to and analysis of pooled data, and liaison with countries outside the EU and with international organisations.</P>
    <P>Once the convention is in force, Europol's initial remit will cover illicit drug trafficking, trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, motor vehicle crime, trafficking in human beings and associated money laundering activities &mdash; the forms of international crime already covered by the EDU.  In addition, it will develop specialist knowledge of the investigative procedures of the relevant authorities in the member states, provide advice on investigations, provide strategic intelligence and prepare general situation reports.  Within two years at the latest of entry into force, Europol's remit will be extended to terrorism.  Furthermore, there is provision in the convention for Europol to take on a wide range of other forms of serious organised crime at the discretion of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>As to how Europol will achieve its objectives, I emphasise that Europol is established to operate as a non-operational team with the primary tasks of facilitating the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities and carrying out detailed analyses in <Col N="942" /> relation to the crimes within its remit.  I am mentioning this because, as some Deputies know, it is likely that the role of Europol in the field of law enforcement co-operation may in the future be enhanced arising from provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty agreed by the Intergovernmental Conference last June and due to be signed by member states this Thursday.  Any developments concerning the extension of Europol's competence would, however, require in the first instance consensus or unanimity among EU member states and they would have to be dealt with by separate legislation in this House.  They do not, therefore, affect the passage of this Bill since it is concerned with giving the force of law to the 1995 convention.</P>
    <P>The convention in Article 8 provides for member states to forward information to Europol concerning persons who are suspected of having committed or taken part in criminal offences in respect of which Europol is competent or have been convicted of such offences, or in relation to persons who there are serious grounds for believing will commit such criminal offences in the future.  In addition, Europol is to be informed of the means used in committing crimes, suspected membership of criminal organisations and criminal convictions of such persons.</P>
    <P>The information will be collated by Europol in a central computerised database consisting of three elements.  The first element will be an information system with a restricted and precisely defined content which allows rapid reference to the information available to the member states and Europol or, as it is sometimes referred to, an outer ring of information.  The second component will concern more sensitive information, a so-called inner ring of information comprising work files for the purposes of analysis containing comprehensive information.  Lastly, there will be an index system containing certain particulars from the analysis files.  Specialists will analyse the information with a view to making connections and arrive at an overview, the results of which will then be forwarded to the member states concerned.</P>
    <P>Member states will send liaison officers to Europol who will assist in the exchange of information and analysis work.  Each member state must also set up a national unit to act as the centralised contact point for all relations with Europol. The liaison officer will represent the interests of his or her particular national unit.  This is a formalisation of the arrangements which at present exist for the EDU.  This system operates not only to communicate information, but the liaison officers are also a valuable tool in overcoming problems which may arise between member states, for example, because of having insufficient knowledge of each other's legal system.</P>
    <P>In addition to liaison officers representative of each member state, Europol will employ analysts who will be under the Europol director's authority. The director will be appointed by the Council <Col N="943" /> of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs and will be accountable to it.  There will also be a management board comprising representatives of all the member states of the Union.</P>
    <P>Europol will only be as good as its information. It is imperative, therefore, that adequate safeguards are in place to guarantee the confidentiality and security of information exchanged and shared.  In this regard the convention lays down extensive safeguards.  It acknowledges that particular attention must be paid to the privacy rights of individuals and the protection of their personal information.  It requires that, as a minimum, each member state must ensure a standard of data protection at least as high as that required by the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.  That convention is implemented here by the Data Protection Act, 1988.  In addition, each member state must appoint a national supervisory body to monitor independently under national law the communication of personal data to and from Europol. There will also be a joint supervisory body to monitor the activities of Europol as a whole to ensure that the rights of individuals are not violated by storage and processing of personal data.</P>
    <P>Rules governing liability are laid down in the event of damage being caused by unauthorised or incorrect use of data.  Finally, confidentiality is also protected by rules governing the dissemination of sensitive information and the obligation of discretion imposed upon employees of Europol and liaison officers.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the two Protocols to the convention, starting with the Protocol on the interpretation of the convention by the European Court of Justice.  One difficulty which delayed the finalisation of the convention was the failure of member states to agree on whether the European Court of Justice should have a role in relation to the Europol Convention.  The Protocol solved this outstanding problem by giving member states the option to declare to accept or not the interpretation of the convention by the European Court of Justice by way of preliminary rulings.  For those member states which opted to accept the court's jurisdiction, they could make a further declaration setting out the conditions under which the jurisdiction of the court would operate in their country, either at the request of all national courts or at the request only of courts against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy.  In our case, we opted for the latter course so as to ensure, as far as possible, that there will be as little disruption as possible to the progress of a criminal trial once commenced.</P>
    <P>The Protocol on the privileges and immunities of Europol, its organs, its deputy directors and employees is needed for the practical application of the Europol Convention once it enters into force.  The purpose of the Protocol is to grant Europol and all those acting on its behalf the same type of privileges and immunities as are <Col N="944" /> usually granted to international organisations.  In addition to the two Protocols to which this Bill will give the force of law, there are a number of other legal texts necessary for Europol's operation. These deal with implementing measures concerning the rights and obligations of liaison officers, staff regulations, rules for analysis of data, confidentiality rules, rules of procedure of the joint supervisory body, Europol's budget, Europol's headquarters, agreement between it and the Netherlands, and bilateral agreements between the Netherlands and member states concerning privileges and immunities of liaison officers and their families.</P>
    <P>Of those still to be finalised are: the confidentiality rules; the rules of procedure of the joint supervisory body; the headquarters agreement; and agreements concerning privileges and immunities of liaison officers.  All of the measures must be formally adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council before Europol can take up its activities.  Luxembourg aims to have negotiations on the outstanding texts completed during its Presidency.  Having said that, while the legal texts are a prerequisite to Europol's entry into force, they are not necessary to the ratification process, and each member state can proceed with ratification of the convention and its two Protocols without the various implementation measures being finalised.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of when the convention will enter into force; when Europol will take up its activities.  Its entry into force is dependent on ratification by all 15 member states. At present, the United Kingdom is the only member state to have formally ratified, but several further ratifications are expected during the coming months.  My intention is that on the enactment of this Bill, Ireland's ratification procedure will be in place before the end of the year.  This would keep us in line with the European Council's stated aim of ratification by all member states before the end of 1997.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill earlier this month contains a detailed commentary on the individual sections and their related provisions in the convention.  The approach adopted in the Bill is to give the convention and the two Protocols the force of law in the State.  Section 2 contains this core provision.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is concerned with the national unit which will act as a centralised unit within the Garda Síochána for channelling information and intelligence to and from Europol.  The section proposes that the unit be headed up by a garda of at least Chief Superintendent rank, and that it operate under the authority of the Garda Commissioner. However, the assignment of staff to the unit will not be confined to members of the Garda Síochána.  Members of other services with specialist expertise &mdash; officers of customs and excise, for example &mdash; could clearly have a very important role to play in respect of certain types of crime.  For that reason, the Bill enables the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, <Col N="945" /> following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Finance, to appoint non-Garda personnel to be members of the unit.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for sending liaison officers from the national unit to Europol.  Liaison officers need not necessarily be members of the Garda Síochána and could potentially be members of customs and excise.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a technical provision amending certain sections of the Garda Síochána Act, 1989, to enable their application to members of the Force who are serving with Europol.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 are concerned with data protection. The main purpose of section 6 is to apply the Data Protection Act, 1988, to relevant provisions in the convention subject to modification where necessary.  As already stated, the 1988 Act gave effect to the principles contained in the 1981 Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection, which is the standard of protection laid down by the convention.  Section 7 designates the Data Protection Commissioner for the purposes of the Convention so that he will be empowered to monitor implementation of the data protection provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives Europol corporate status to enable it to enter into contracts and other commercial relationships and to sue and be sued in the courts.  There is provision in section 9 for the application of the Official Secrets Act, 1963 to those provisions of the convention which impose obligations of confidentiality not to make disclosures of information.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Protocol on the interpretation of the convention by the European Court of Justice, section 10 provides that judicial notice shall be taken in this country of any ruling or decision or expression of opinion by that court.</P>
    <P>There is provision in sections 11 and 12 for making ministerial orders, to be laid before both Houses, which appear to be necessary and expedient for carrying out the convention.  All matters of substance pertaining to the convention and its Protocols are covered by the Bill.  The purpose of the provisions in sections 11 and 12 is merely to enable incidental requirements from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 13 contains the standard expenses provision. The financial arrangements for Europol provide for annual estimates to be drawn up and approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. The budget will be financed from member states' contributions, which are determined by reference to a formula of the percentage of GNP attributed to each.  While additional cost will arise in respect of Europol's new computer system, in the absence of experience of operating the convention, it is impossible to say what level of contribution we will be obliged to make.  Some indications, however, may be gained from our current contributions to the EDU's budget.  The EDU budget for 1997, when savings made last year are taken into account, is ECU 7 million, 0.7 per cent <Col N="946" /> of which we pay for from the Garda Síochána Vote.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion on which a Bill concerning a convention under Title Vl of the Treaty on European Union has been introduced in the Oireachtas.  The convention is a very desirable measure which will provide a weapon to Ireland and its EU partners for combating international organised crime.  It will provide for greatly enhanced co-operation among the 15 member states at a level commensurate with the threat posed by the increasingly sophisticated techniques of today's organised criminals.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be acceptable to all sides of the House.  I shall give careful consideration to the points which Deputies may make and to any suggestions for amendment that may be made in the course of the debate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I congratulate to Deputies Jim Higgins and Shortall on their appointment as spokespersons on Justice, Equality and Law Reform by their respective parties.  They follow in auspicious footsteps. I look forward to robust and constructive debate in this House and outside in respect of tackling crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I thank the Minister for his fine contribution and his kind comments on my appointment.  I congratulate him on his appointment to the prestigious position of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I assure him that Members on this side of the House will, as always, be constructive in their comments.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the Government's introduction of this Bill which will incorporate the European Union Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office and its two Protocols into Irish law.  The convention was drawn up in 1995 and the two Protocols in 1996 and 1997.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, on her sterling work on behalf of the State in contributing to the successful conclusion of these instruments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen's tenure in the ministry for Justice will go down in history as the most energetic and productive period in the development of Irish criminal justice.  She introduced radical and far-reaching measures to tackle crime, particularly organised crime, within the State.  However, she was also keenly aware of the trans-national nature of much of the crime doing greatest damage to our society, namely, drug-related crime and the money laundering which often accompanies it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing Europol drugs unit, which was intended as an interim measure, has, as the Minister stated, had a significant impact on improving the fight against such crimes as drug trafficking, illegal car trafficking, money laundering and, more recently, trafficking in human beings.  It has shown that a properly constituted unit which is adequately resourced can be extremely effective in combating crime.  The former Minister for Justice, <Col N="947" /> Deputy Owen, brought this Bill to Cabinet on 11 February 1997 and Government approval was given for drafting, with the specific purpose that the success of the EDU should be built on with ever greater capabilities under the Europol police office.</P>
    <P>One of the achievements of the Government comprising Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left was the amount of legislation it introduced in connection with justice, particularly criminal justice, and law reform.  The Europol Bill is one of the measures inherited by the current Government and I am glad it is now being brought before the Oireachtas.  Co-operation in exchanging, collating and analysing information on crime is crucial. It is crucial, not alone in combating what might be described as established or orthodox crime but also in the early detection of new criminal activity which criminal ingenuity unfortunately conjures up occasionally.  I am pleased that at the signing of the convention, Ireland made a declaration that it accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in accordance with Article 2 (a) of the Protocol.</P>
    <P>This Bill is also welcome in that it not only consolidates the work of the EDU and expands on the types of crime covered by Europol but also because it widens the co-operation network to embrace not only police activities but also to include liaison with international organisations. There is the added dimension that liaison and co-operation will also take place between Europol and third countries.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt this Bill will be warmly welcomed by the Garda Síochána as a further instrument in enhancing its capacity to deal with crime. I know the Garda will relish the opportunity of building on the tremendous work it has already done in putting paid to the activities of many of the managers of organised crime by participating in our new national unit which will be an integral part of Europol.</P>
    <P>The previous Government was extremely proud of the new powers it conferred on the Garda Síochána, particularly the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill. Coupled with the determination and success of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the organisers of criminal operations have been dealt a succession of devastating body blows.  Criminals are now on the run as never before.  Many of them have fled this jurisdiction to exile, their empires crumbling under the sustained assault of the new legislation and new powers.  This Bill, which provides for the rapid and regular exchange of up to the minute information and the pooling of intelligence, will further assist in clamping down on organised crime.  Terrorism has to met in a full frontal manner, thwarted and combated.  We look forward to monitoring, on an ongoing basis, the success of this project on which we are now embarking.</P>
    <P>However, there is greater scope and a basic requirement for further productive liaison and co-operation in the area of crime.  Collectively as <Col N="948" /> Europeans we need to scrutinise the fundamentals. We need to study the origins of crime.  For example, what turns a ten year old into a gangster? We need to work out a series of effective early interventions so criminal activity can be nipped in the bud or create the kind of social conditions in which crime becomes less likely.</P>
    <P>I commend the Department of Justice for publishing in May of this year its excellent study and discussion paper, Tackling Crime.  This is the first such exercise by the Department of Justice.  It is an excellent document setting out in detail a myriad of facts about crime including homicide, violence against women, drugs, armed crime, the need to improve information, criminal law, the Garda Síochána, prosecution of offences and legal aid, courts, prisons, community sanctions and the victims of crime.  There is also a section on international co-operation, including an analysis of the work of the European Drugs Unit as well as a preview of Europol.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest is the excellent section emphasising the need to broaden the debate on crime by the introduction of a crime council, modelled very much on the same lines as the extremely successful Danish Crime Council.  The document delves in considerable depth into an examination of goals and strategies.  It is a stimulating, thorough and thoughtful document laden with a range of constructive possibilities and ideas.  It was widely acclaimed when it was published, yet what was the response of the then Opposition spokesperson, now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    <P>The document was dismissed by Deputy O'Donoghue as &ldquo;to a large extent a restatement of the obvious and an election selection box which must be treated with grave cynicism&rdquo;. &ldquo;Grave cynicism&rdquo;&mdash; what a great, grave and solemn soundbite.  This from the gentleman, who had just published a Fianna Fáil policy document, Leading the Fight Against Crime, a pamphlet full of the same overblown, overstated, pompous rhetoric that characterised the Minister's period as Opposition Justice spokesperson.</P>
    <P>That analysis of the document is not mine alone.  <i>The Irish Times</i> dismissed Deputy O'Donoghue's attempt as an &ldquo;unimpressive little document, devoid of fact, analysis, costings or reflection&rdquo;. That was when zero tolerance made a sudden and dramatic appearance, promising a crime free Utopia.  However, I am pleased that Minister O'Donoghue in his zero tolerance somersault in Galway last week also seemed to be in the process of developing another partial &ldquo;U&rdquo; turn on the merits of the Department of Justice's Tackling Crime document by grudgingly acknowledging that it is &ldquo;a worthy initiative&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I still do not know what the Minister's policy on zero tolerance is.  He seems to have watered it down to essentially dealing with drugs.  Tolerance indicates that something is tolerated.  There has always been a policy of zero tolerance in relation to drugs.  The acts of successive Governments in tightening the clamp on drugs finally resulted in <Col N="949" /> drug pushers and barons going on the run.  Is it the Minister's intention to equate all crimes, minor and major, on the same scale of priority and gravity?  If it is, the Minister will fill prisons, clog courts and make it more difficult for the Garda to operate.  The trust between the Garda and the community, which is so fundamental to successful cross-community partnership between the Garda and the citizenry, will be ruptured. This partnership is necessary if we are to solve minor and major crimes by using the intelligence the public provide.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Inter-Departmental Group on Crime and Disorder went a long way towards seeking to improve understanding of the background to crime.  It set out in clear detail a list of social and environmental factors which I believe cause or influence criminal activity.  In the context of understanding crime, this study should be looked at in further detail.</P>
    <P>One of the areas selected for particular mention is poorly planned housing.  What hope is there when thousands of people are condemned for life to huge monstrosities of flats, with large families grouped on top of each other, with few, if any, amenities such as shops, access to professional services, community halls or playgrounds? Despite the fact that the social chaos of such housing has long been recognised, the disaster continues to be repeated and replicated by the erection of thousands of little boxes as the urban sprawl eats its way into the countryside and huge badly planned housing estates with no amenities or social planning are built on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In these huge local authority schemes, few, if any, of the residents feel they have any stake in society, particularly when there is blanket second and third generation unemployment from one end of the estate to the other.  What hope is there for the thousands of young people who fall off the education conveyor belt at 15 years of age or earlier?  Often not a single teenager from terrace after terrace sits the leaving certificate, let alone enjoys the opportunity of attending a third level college.</P>
    <P>Why should anyone wonder that such social and economic deprivation provides easy and fertile pickings for the drug barons and their pushers? The reality is that these people have been the victims of social and economic neglect, discarded by society and by Government and left to carve out their own existence in hopeless ghettos. Their lot has always been extremely difficult because of social and economic deprivation. There is no hope of doing anything until the drugs problem is successfully tackled.  The strongest possible measures must be implemented to deal with the supply in the market, but measures to reduce the demand must be tackled with equal vigour and imagination.  Fifteen or 20 years ago drugs were mainly a Dublin problem.  Slowly but surely they penetrated other cities, they are now a reality in all provincial towns and the age threshold has been pushed down relentlessly.</P>
    <P>A sustained drugs awareness programme must <Col N="950" /> be implemented using all the organisations and resources at our disposal.  It must become an ingrained part of the education process at primary school level.  Children need to be shown graphically the awful consequences of drugs, the despair, the destruction and death.  They need to be enlightened and frightened about the reality of drugs.  They must be reached at school level before being exposed to the dangers.  The school system is a powerful agency, so let us make use of it.  Substance abuse education is far more important than any other subject on the syllabus.</P>
    <P>We must adopt a multifaceted approach to the drugs problem.  The Tackling Crime document refers to interagency co-operation and community involvement.  Unless youngsters have something to do after school, unless there are attractive alternatives, activities to fill in the vacuum and recreational facilities to house such activities, in the modern climate young people are easy prey for drug exploitation.  Community involvement in getting a collective consensus for action is crucial if the problem is to be rooted out.</P>
    <P>In a newspaper article last Sunday the retiring Garda Assistant Commissioner, Tom King, spoke about the success of Operation Dóchas after one year in operation.  He spoke about how communities now believe the Garda response has been real and sustained and has brought a meaningful change in the quality of people's lives and in the relationship with the Garda Síochána.  He is pleased at the new awakening in these communities to the point where they are now seeking to manage their own affairs and where they have the courage and conviction to demand a quality service from State agencies, including the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>These communities need leadership from within and without.  They need community leaders, paid by the State, to devise and implement imaginable and workable community programmes.  When in Opposition the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, proclaimed &ldquo;money is not an issue and, in fact, must never be an issue&rdquo;.  It costs approximately £40,000 per year to keep a prisoner in jail.  For the cost of keeping a single prisoner in jail for one year one could train and pay three community leaders, people with vision, leadership qualities, motivation and a capacity to bring communities along with them.</P>
    <P>The involvement of parents is central to this problem.  Many communities have shown they have the goodwill and genuinely want positive lives and lifestyles, but they need leadership, encouragement and resources.  The cost is put very clearly in context when one considers the £220 million of capital expenditure promised by Fianna Fáil for additional prison spaces and the £74 million in annual current expenditure to run our prisons.  Expenditure of that nature would make an enormous contribution to the economic and social transformation of north Cork city, Gallenstown, Ballyfermot, Dublin inner city, Coolock, Darndale, Ballymun or Southill in Limerick.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about learning from the social <Col N="951" /> catastrophe of building unserviced concrete local authority jungles, many of which have become the universities of crime, we must call a halt now. There must be purposeful and integrated planning with proper guidelines that set a direct ratio between the number of houses built and minimum specified social and recreational services.</P>
    <P>The Europol Bill is but one example of community co-operation at international level.  It is one welcome piece in the crime jigsaw.  The Justice and Home Affairs Council should seriously consider maximising co-operation across a range of areas including the study of the origins, causes and sources of crime.  Crime has many common dimensions, denominators, themes and so on. During our Presidency we identified the fight against drugs as a priority.  We should lead the way by launching this initiative.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the Bill is devoted to the six schedules which include the Irish and English language versions of the European Convention and its Protocols. I am pleased that Irish, as a Treaty language of the EU, is being given its rightful place.  I hope the Government takes steps to ensure bilingual versions of all Irish statutes are brought up to date and published, as required under Article 25.4.4 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is probably the most significant measure in terms of domestic law.  It proposes to establish a national unit, as required by article 4 of the convention.  This unit, which will comprise mainly members of the Garda and customs officials, will be the only liaison body between Europol and the law enforcement agencies of the State.  As such, it bears a heavy responsibility in terms of gathering, maintaining and supplying highly sensitive information.  This is clearly necessary for the effective operation of Europol and every member state has a vested interest in its success.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is written in very broad discretionary language and merely authorises the Garda Commissioner to appoint to the unit as many members of the Garda as he thinks fit from time to time. Likewise, the Minister for Justice, following consultation with the Commissioner and the Minister for Finance, may from time to time appoint customs and excise officers to the unit.  The Minister spoke of potential members when he referred to customs and excise officers.  The Bill should stipulate that there should always be a combination of gardaí, customs officers and perhaps other professionals in the unit.  Will the Minister review this provision, to which I may return on Committee Stage?  The customs and excise service has a great deal of expertise in this area and should definitely be part of this new and valuable service.</P>
    <P>Data protection is of the utmost importance in a co-operative enterprise of this kind.  This is clearly recognised in article 25 of the convention. No effort must be spared to strike a proper balance between effectively combating crime and protecting the liberties of the individual.  Data must be accurate and closely protected, particularly <Col N="952" /> as article 8 of the convention allows for data on persons who are suspected of having committed an offence to be entered in the information bank which comes within Europol's remit, as well as on those who have committed such offences.  Furthermore, the same article allows for information to be entered in respect of persons who there are serious grounds under national law for believing will commit criminal offences for which Europol is competent under article 2.  It is clear, therefore, that persons may be included in this information system on the grounds of suspicion alone, as opposed to the more firm ground of having been convicted.</P>
    <P>While it is accepted that police agencies must have regard to the intelligence available to them and remain alert to those genuinely suspected of being involved in crime, the necessity for stringent safeguards in such cases must also be accepted.  Therefore, I welcome the provisions of section 6 to apply the provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988 to the processing etc.  of information gathered under the terms of the convention and the designation in section 7 of the Data Protection Commission as &ldquo;the national supervisory body for the purposes of this Act and the Convention&rdquo;.  Bodies such as the Data Protection Commission are constantly being asked to assume greater responsibilities as our legal system becomes ever more complex.  I hope the Government will ensure that whatever additional staffing and resources are necessary will be made available to the Data Protection Commissioner to facilitate him in the execution of his duties under this convention.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the Europol Treaty and its Protocols, to which the outgoing Government made a major contribution, constitutes another important step forward in European integration, a fact recognised by this Government through its speedy introduction of this Bill.  Without such full co-operation with our European partners we cannot hope to deal with one of our most pressing social problems, that of crime.  It is important that we carefully consider the domestic provisions of this Bill and be satisfied as to their effectiveness. Subject to these reservations I support the general thrust of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate, my first as spokesperson on justice for my party.  I thank the Minister for his good wishes.  In turn I congratulate him on his ministerial appointment and genuinely wish him well in his new and very considerable responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to be a forthright spokesperson on justice, prepared to advocate and support difficult and tough measures whenever necessary, but also determine that the proverbial &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; which all too often dominated debate on crime will be exposed for what it is.  Empty rhetoric, of which we heard much from members of the Minister's party before and during the last general election campaign, will need to be replaced by well <Col N="953" /> thought out and concerted action, to which we look forward.  The Minister referred a number of times to zero tolerance and to his many proposals within the remit of his portfolio, to some of which I shall respond later.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the European Convention on the establishment of a European police office or Europol, that convention being among the first resolutions agreed under the third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty under the heading of Justice and Home Affairs, providing for a systematic scheme of co-operation between national police forces throughout the European Union to tackle crime without frontiers.</P>
    <P>The world has changed substantially over the past two decades.  Twenty years ago national Governments reigned supreme, managed their economies, promulgated and passed their own laws.  The fact that laws varied from country to country mattered little; national frontiers were crucial, having been protected by exchange controls and customs barriers.  Organised crime, such as did exist, also tended to be local.  Those days have passed.  The revolution in communications and transport which has taken place over the past ten to 20 years has dramatically changed the world in which we live.  In an era in which money can change hands simultaneously in a number of different countries national Governments have found themselves powerless to intervene.  Consequently, the European Community evolved into the European Union as member states realised that political co-operation was and is essential to enable them remain in control of events.</P>
    <P>The issue of security and crime in this State over the past 25 years or so has revolved around the issue of Northern Ireland.  Thankfully, due to a combination of the peace process and the two ceasefires that position has changed dramatically. This convention was signed by the outgoing Government within whose term of office and that of its predecessor the threat posed to our society by drugs and organised crime replaced Northern Ireland as our key criminal concern.</P>
    <P>This Bill is timely since over the past 12 months we have begun to turn the tide against drug pushers. Thankfully, the days when we read of the exploits of the General, the Penguin or other individuals with nick names, living lives of luxury and opulence around Dublin, are beginning to be something of the past.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that we understand the reason for our beginning to be successful in this fight. Recently the Minister made great play of what he described as his Proceeds of Crime Act, which is unquestionably important and I am happy to concede his role in having it placed on the Statute Book.  Nonetheless I do not consider it to be the main reason we have begun to win the battle against drug barons and organised crime.  Without doubt the key to that success has been the establishment, long overdue, of the Criminal Assets Bureau, in the run-up to which I and other Members had been pressing the then Minister for <Col N="954" /> Justice to improve the degree of co-operation between the various arms of our security forces. The fact that we read regularly about the exploits of various senior criminals in this State, particularly in the pages of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, graphically illustrated for us by the late Veronica Guerin, indicated the completely inadequate state of our inter-agency co-operation at that stage.  The establishment of proper and appropriate inter-agency co-operation has been responsible for the improved position.</P>
    <P>After the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau the fight against the drug barons was launched on all fronts and critically it was undertaken in a co-ordinated manner.  They immediately began to feel the heat and were no longer in a position to enjoy the proceeds of their evil trade.  For the first time the professionals who assisted in laundering drugs money &mdash; a crime which must be regarded as being as vile as handing children heroin &mdash; were also subjected to considerable pressure, resulting in many drug barons being forced to leave this country.  Those drug barons who previously dominated the pages of our tabloid and other newspapers now live in exile in places like London and Amsterdam, where no doubt they continue to run their so-called business empires through the use of intermediaries but the days when they could act with equanimity have passed.  For example, the individual who described himself as the chief suspect in the murder of Veronica Guerin is in London awaiting extradition here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Many were surprised when, a few weeks ago, Mary Banotti indicated her approval for the nomination of Derek Nally as a candidate in the presidential election.  However, I was not surprised because she has expressed the view on a number of occasions that we should democratise the nomination process for presidential elections, which is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The presidential nomination process in Ireland is more restrictive than in any other country except for France which provides for direct elections. <Col N="955" /> We cannot be proud of this.  While the nomination process in France is complicated, the President of France has executive powers out of all proportion to those held by the President of Ireland.  Indeed, excluding the nomination processes for those presidents in Europe with executive powers the nomination process in Ireland is the most restrictive.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to democratise this process, to establish a people's initiative and to ensure that the people who elect the President will also have a voice in the nomination process.  The Constitution provides that every candidate for election, other than a former or retiring President, must be nominated either by not less than 20 persons each of whom is at the time a Member of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or by the councils of not less than four administrative counties, including county boroughs, as defined by law.</P>
    <P>It may be asserted that the use of the council route to nomination by Derek Nally and Dana, Rosemary Scallon, destroys my argument. However, it proves my point because these two candidates were nominated despite the process rather than because of it.</P>
    <P>This issue has been examined by a number of independent bodies.  The one for which I have the greatest respect is the Constitution review group headed by Dr. Whitaker.  His team of eminent lawyers, political scientists and others concluded that the constitutional requirements for nominating a presidential candidate are &ldquo;too restrictive and in need of democratisation&rdquo;.  Given this recommendation there is an onus on the Oireachtas to initiate the necessary steps for change.  While this will not affect the presidential election, nominations for which closed today, one must look to the future when dealing with constitutional matters; one cannot simply take the short-term into account.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a democratic approach that is more symptomatic of the views of people today than were prevalent hitherto.  They did not obtain in 1937 when the Constitution was formulated, nor in 1967 when the first constitutional review took place.  At that time consideration of the nomination of President was concerned not with the question of establishing a people's initiative for the nomination but on whether the people's right to directly elect the President should be removed.  Discussion centred on the possibility of indirect election by electoral college as opposed to arguments adduced in favour of the system set out in the Constitution.  Fortunately no such changes were made.  However, now is the time for change by making the process more liberal and democratic and by allowing the people to have a say in the nomination process.</P>
    <P>According to a research paper on the presidency completed by Barry Doherty, the nomination process for the President of Finland involves one member of parliament and 20,000 voters; 20,000 voters alone are involved in the <Col N="956" /> process of Lithuania, which has a population approximate to ours; 7,500 electors are involved in Portugal, whose President has more powers than our President; 1,500 electors are involved in Iceland, which has a smaller population, while the constitution of Slovenia, with a population of approximately two million, has no threshold for nomination.  This Bill is not radical in that no concept is being introduced which is foreign to democratic practise in Europe, rather it draws on the experience of other European countries.</P>
    <P>It is important that we continue to examine what we have with a view to effecting improvements. While we have a good Constitution which has proved its worth over the past 60 years we must, as in the case of a good building, be prepared to update and modernise.  In seeking to modernise an aspect of the presidency this Bill fits this pattern.</P>
    <P>One of the best ways to amend the Constitution is to seek the support of other parties in the House.  That is why I am making this proposal in a non political and non contentious way.  While I acknowledge that we have a good Constitution I would like to see agreement on the need to improve it.  In this regard I wish to seek all party support for this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Government benches are made up of two parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. I know the Progressive Democrats' position because, in 1988, they circulated a draft of a new Constitution in which they made the following proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that the godless Constitution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not focusing on that aspect, more that, at the time, the Progressive Democrats provided for the nomination of a Presidential candidate by 30,000 electors.  This is on record in the party's document <i>The Constitution for a New Republic</i> produced in 1988.  The Progressive Democrats recently circulated a Bill along the same lines but reducing the requirement from 30,000 to 20,000.  Thus my proposal is enhanced by views expressed or placed on record by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>That leaves Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>We would be glad of their support.  I hope Fianna Fáil accepts that the views of the other parties in the House favour giving people a say in the nomination process and that this democratisation is in the best interests of the country.</P>

    <P>Concern has been expressed recently in the media that people like Dana, Derek Nally, and others are or could be precluded from being nominated.  It is easy to say that both candidates obtained nominations, but it was through a process never used before and was despite rather than because of the constitutional requirement. <Col N="957" /> That point is highlighted in the following comment in <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial this morning:</P>
    <P>Mr Nally's achievement &mdash; and the earlier endorsement given to Dana by local councils &mdash; does not, however, obviate the need to make the nomination procedure less restrictive.</P>
    <P>It continued:</P>
    <P>.a situation in which candidates like Derek Nally and Dana can only get their names on the ballot paper despite rather than because of the nomination procedure is not good for democracy.</P>
    <P>It behoves us as parliamentarians to take such views into account and weigh them against arguments to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason the people should not be given a say in the nomination process?  I can think of one possibility which was touched on in the report of the Constitution Review Group.  It referred to the difficulties of controlling and validating the process.  The review group felt the validation of such nominators would be difficult but went on to say that some alternative mechanism based on a specified number of voters ought to be explored.  I have examined this and am satisfied that the validation process, especially with modern technology, could be put in place effectively. It should be examined.  It works in other countries.  If Lithuania, Finland, Iceland, or other countries I mentioned can carry out this process, why can we not?  Secondly, with the way electoral registers are now framed and modern technology, it would be simple to ensure, by insisting on the appropriate references from the electoral register, that the list of nominating electors is valid. We will listen to anything said on this point, but I will not accept any blanket condemnation of a process which works effectively in other countries and which I am convinced can work here.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is whether we are prepared to give the people a chance or whether we are to persist in what is essentially a restrictive and undemocratic process.  Will we insist political parties continue to control the nomination process? There have been ten presidential elections of which five were contested.  It is clear people will not accept uncontested elections in future.  They feel what prevailed in the past, meetings in proverbial smoke-filled rooms producing an agreed candidate, is not acceptable any more, however it might have been judged in the past.  One aspect of the legacy of the Robinson era is that we will never again see a presidential election where party leaders agree on one candidate, which means no one else can be nominated.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that county councils are largely controlled by the political parties.  If a whip had been imposed by all parties, the two candidates outside the political process would not have been nominated.  In my county, Fianna Fáil applied the whip and refused to vote for a nomination. The largest party on the council is Fine Gael and, had it done likewise, it would have <Col N="958" /> ended the candidate's chances.  However, the Fine Gael leader on the council allowed a free vote.  In other councils, there were abstentions, the process was not obstructed and the nominations were allowed to proceed.  However, it was by chance that that happened and it was, to a degree, a reaction to popular will.  People insisted that, regardless of how they fared in the election, the two candidates should at least be given the chance of standing.</P>
    <P>Let us provide in the Constitution for that to be done in future so that people have the chance to nominate someone.  If the Derek Nallys or Danas of the future feel they have popular support and want to ensure their name is put before the electorate, they should be allowed to secure the requisite 20,000 signatures, which should be the only barrier to being nominated.  I want this Bill to be treated on its merits and not as a Fine Gael Bill or a Mary Banotti or Jim O'Keeffe and Paul McGrath Bill.  I want it to be treated as one which is a genuine effort to improve and democratise our Constitution by removing a restrictive barrier and replacing it with a process which allows people to nominate a candidate to contest an election to the highest office in the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, for sharing his time.  I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this Bill with the Deputy, who has done the bulk of the preparatory work on it.</P>
      <P>It is opportune that we should be discussing this Bill tonight.  In recent times there has been much public discussion about who should be a candidate in the presidential election.  There was talk about various people from political parties or complete outsiders; for some time it was speculated that there would be an agreed candidate from Northern Ireland.  Anyone who took an interest in what the people said would be aware that they wanted an election for the presidency. They did not want it to be agreed among a number of political parties that a certain person should be President and no one else should have a chance.  If the parties had done that, the county councils might well have nominated a candidate &mdash; as they have done &mdash; and it is quite possible that such a person would have swept the boards against an agreed all-party candidate.  It would have been a kick against the system &mdash; the public does not want cosy cartels or to have the political parties making arrangements among themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned the discussions of the constitutional review group and gave examples of what was happening in other European countries.  The review group, as quoted in the leading article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, suggested that we need to &ldquo;loosen the nomination procedure&rdquo; for candidates to the presidency.  We must take this suggestion seriously.  There are currently three ways in which a person can be nominated to the presidency &mdash; the outgoing President can nominate himself or herself, 20 Oireachtas Members can nominate a candidate, or four county councils can nominate someone.  In this <Col N="959" /> election, two people have managed to come in from the outside and gain nomination through the county council system.  This has not happened before and it is a sign that our democracy is alive and well.  It is interesting to note that many of the county councillors who supported the independent candidates did so against the wishes of their parties.  In some cases the party whip was applied and many councillors did not obey it.</P>
    <P>In discussing this Bill, someone suggested that it was strange that four county councils could nominate a person to contest the presidency, because that implies that two councillors in each of four councils could nominate a person.  This person wondered whether this was democratic, but I argue that if a person proposes a motion at a council meeting and has it seconded, it is up to the other councillors to disagree with or vote against it.  That is the essence of democracy.  If they do not vote against it or abstain on the vote, one can assume they go along with the wish and it is not fair to say that the wishes of two councillors carry the day.  It is a democratic process in which the councillors can vote for or against.</P>
    <P>This discussion has arisen because the presidency has changed.  Mrs. Mary Robinson brought a whole new outlook to it.  In the past the President resided in Áras an Uachtaráin, was seen on rare occasions and made the occasional trip abroad.  That was the order of the day and I do not criticise anyone for that.  During her election campaign Mary Robinson captured the public's imagination and in office she enthralled the people with the way she behaved and conducted her presidency.  There is scarcely a parish in Ireland that did not have some contact with Mary Robinson's presidency &mdash; if she did not visit the parish hall or a caring group in the community, members of a local group visited Áras an Uachtaráin. She won huge support &mdash; 92 per cent of the people felt she was doing a good job.  We politicians might be jealous of those returns but Mary Robinson achieved them.  In so doing, she has changed the nature of the presidency.  She has created a public expectation that a presidency of that nature will continue.  She was seen as outside politics, which is why people want a change to the existing procedure; they want to have a say.</P>
    <P>The Office of the President is serious, because he or she has a major role under the Constitution. The President must monitor what is happening in this House and, at appropriate times, refer Bills to the Council of State or the Supreme Court to ensure that everything is in order.  The President also plays an important role as our ambassador in portraying Ireland and what we stand for.  Mary Robinson did that job well.</P>
    <P>We live in changing times and Irish society has altered dramatically over the years.  Until recently, the public accepted, apparently without complaint, that whoever was nominated for the presidency would be a former politician.  As Deputy O'Keeffe said, on the ten occasions on which a President was appointed, there were only <Col N="960" /> five elections.  However, the public is now demanding wider involvement in many decisions which affect them.  On environmental issues, people want to know about planning applications or how developments will affect the environment. That did not happen 20 years ago &mdash; to a great extent people let those matters pass them by and accepted what they were told.</P>
    <P>Our changing society is also reflected in the presence of worker-directors on State companies, who are now given a say in how the company is run.  This shows people being involved in something which will ultimately affect their lives.  Education has changed considerably through the introduction of boards of management, parents' councils, and the presence of parents on interview boards.  People want to be involved in the decisions which affect their children, and rightly so.  Even within the church, so long dominated by our elders, dramatic changes have taken place. The laity are now in the driving seat on parish councils, representative and diocesan groups, etc. They will now be making the decisions and planning the future of that organisation.</P>
    <P>All this has come to Ireland in recent times and it influences the people's thinking on how a candidate for the presidency should be nominated and who should have a say in doing so.  In this Bill we propose that 20,000 voters should be allowed nominate a candidate for the presidency.  It may be asked why we chose 20,000 rather than 40,000 or 10,000.  Twenty thousand is a fair number because each Member of this House represents a population of approximately 20,000.  Electoral registers have been computerised and each voter has a specific reference number related to the county in which he lives.  For example, in Westmeath my registration reference consists of two letters and three or four numbers.  People might think it would be difficult to know who nominates a candidate for the presidency under this system and may worry about how the 20,000 names could be checked.  However, the rules will be drawn up by law and it would be simple to check.  The 20,000 people nominating a candidate could be asked to give their names, county where they vote and register reference number.  Will it be possible for somebody to stand on O'Connell Street and gather 20,000 signatures?  It would be easy, because the normal shopper on O'Connell Street will not have his electoral number on him. What is being proposed is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Will this proposal be acceptable to the House? Deputy O'Keeffe has rightly observed that the Progressive Democrats Party brought forward similar proposals in the recent past and it would be hypocritical of them to vote against this Bill. We wait with baited breath to hear the wisdom of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Dan Wallace, to see the reaction of Fianna Fáil.  I hope the Minister will be open to considering this reasonable proposal which will fulfil a demand among the public. Acceptance would demonstrate that Fianna Fáil <Col N="961" /> is prepared to favourably consider what is best for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues, Deputies O'Keeffe and McGrath, for sponsoring this Bill and for agreeing to share time with me.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill as presented.  We want to widen the process of nomination of candidates for presidential elections.  However, despite having the second most restrictive nominating process in Europe, we have done well in getting five different and well qualified candidates nominated to run in the election.  I hope everybody will support Mary Banotti, but four other candidates have succeeded in being nominated in accordance with the Constitution.  I see no difficulty in having more candidates if that is the wish of the people and therefore I support this Bill.</P>
      <P>Rosemary Scallon and Derek Nally have been credited with breaking new ground in using the local authority route to gain a nomination. However, this is not the first time such a route has been followed.  Twenty-one years ago when I was first elected a member of a local authority, a similar request for a nomination came before our local authority.  At that time the candidate wrote to councils and our council marked the letter read.  We thought he was not a serious candidate but at least the process was tried if not pursued as vigorously or professionally as it has been on this occasion.</P>
      <P>It is a reflection of the maturity of local authorities that Rosemary Scallon and Derek Nally were successful in seeking nominations with the support of councillors from all parties.  Their names will now appear on the ballot paper.  There is scope for expanding the nomination process of the local authorities and it would be no harm to have a greater number of candidates in presidential elections.  The heavy whip of parties was not applied, but even with the light whip applied candidates succeeded in getting nominations because they proceeded in a professional manner and councillors responded to public opinion which supported candidates being given the opportunity to run for election.  Many councillors said they would support the nomination of the two candidates but would not support them in the presidential election as they would support their party candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that students and those away from home will be allowed the facility of postal votes.  The Government has created the perception that this is to be lauded. However, the perception and the reality is entirely different because I found out from my own children who are students in Dublin and Cork that this facility is not available to students in the manner in which it is perceived.  For example, some students in UCD only returned yesterday and today and it was not possible for them to have their application for a postal vote stamped by the college and returned to the local authority by 5 p.m. this evening, the deadline for receipt of such applications.  The deadline would <Col N="962" /> have been 15 September were it not for the fact that there is to be a referendum on the same day as the presidential election.  Students in UCC, where one of my sons is studying, are only registering today.  According to last year's figures, 2,500 first year students registered in UCC last year.  Two thousand students remain to be registered this year, none of whom will qualify for postal votes simply because the college cannot stamp the necessary document until the student is registered.  It will be impossible for those students who registered yesterday and today to return their registration papers to the local authority today without the benefit of a fax machine. All of these people will be disenfranchised and they cannot apply to be placed on the supplementary register in Cork where my son will be living together with 2,500 more students from all over the country.  All these students will be based at their college address on the day of the election because it is being held on a Thursday.  They are not eligible to go on the supplementary register as it is first necessary to be registered for a postal vote.  Neither is it possible to be included on the supplementary register if already registered at one's home address.  Therefore, students are being denied the facility of having their names included on the supplementary register.  It is farcical to say that students and those away from home will have a vote in the presidential election. They will not have a vote because it has been denied them by the Government which fixed Thursday as the day of the election and which made no provision for a special extension of the closing date for applying for a postal vote beyond the day on which nominations for the presidency close.  The Government simply has not facilitated students and I wish to put that lie to rest.</P>
    <P>The provision for nomination through collecting 20,000 signatures would encourage others to seek nominations once the correct procedures, including each signatory supplying their correct register number, were adhered to.  At least the process was opened up on this occasion by two candidates who pursued what was already provided for in the Constitution by seeking local authority nominations, and that was good.</P>

      <P>Before discussing the Bill I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the former President, Mary Robinson, for the magnificent job she did over the past seven years.  She performed the functions of the presidency with grace and dignity while at the same time bringing a new dimension to the office and staying within the parameters set by the Constitution.  I wish her well in her new post with the United Nations and hope she will be successful in that important and demanding job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 1997, I am surprised at the timing of its introduction.  A similar Bill was published last March but the party opposite, which was then in Government, did not seek to provide <Col N="963" /> time for a debate on it.  A Bill passed at that stage could have been implemented for the current election, but that opportunity has now passed by. It therefore seems strange that the party concerned should introduce the Bill at this juncture.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, one of the sponsors of the Bill, was chairperson of the all-party Constitution Review Committee in the last Dáil.  The committee issued two progress reports earlier this year but it did not deal with constitutional matters concerning the presidency.  If the matter was urgent, why did the all-party committee not deal with this matter as well as other matters concerning the presidency in either of the two progress reports? Surely Deputy Jim O'Keeffe could have asked the other Members of the committee to give the matter priority.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the content of the Bill.  On the one hand, the proposed procedure would clearly imply a greater degree of democracy in the nomination process while on the other hand, it would present some practical difficulties which would have to be overcome.  There is a growing demand to have the procedure for the nomination of candidates for election as President made more open. I anticipate that contributors to the debate on the Bill will, to varying degrees, concur on the general desirability of making it easier for a person to secure such a nomination.</P>
    <P>The existing requirements for nomination of candidates for election as President were implemented in the Constitution which is in place for the past 60 years.  In examining the existing arrangements, it is important to look at the nominating procedure in its proper context.  As far as I can ascertain, there had been little, if any, criticism of the arrangement up to about a decade ago.  The fact that on only two occasions in the past &mdash; the first contested election in 1945 and the last election in 1990 &mdash; were more than two candidates nominated in itself suggests complacency about, if not satisfaction with, the procedure.</P>
    <P>In this context, it could be said that the arrangements put in place in 1937 in relation to the election of the President have, like the Constitution as a whole, worked reasonably satisfactorily in the past and served us well.  As a document, Bunreacht na hÉireann has been seen over the years as a model by newly emerging democracies which have in some cases based their constitution on ours and included some of its principles. This is a truly significant tribute to the framers of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>By its nature, a Constitution must consist of a fixed set of rules not open to challenge in any court of law.  As such, it is important that there be a procedure for amendment when this is warranted to take account of changing public attitudes and political demands.  There has been a trend in recent years to question existing arrangements in relation to access to elective offices and to ask why a different approach should not be <Col N="964" /> adopted.  I welcome this public interest in the wider debate on the ground rules which regulate public affairs generally and the private rights of citizens enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Ideally, fundamental changes to constitutional provisions affecting institutions of the State should be implemented only after a thorough and systematic review and examination of the available options.  This is particularly appropriate where the office of President is concerned.  Any changes which may be made to the Constitution now will, in all probability, outlive the citizens who vote for such changes.</P>
    <P>The previous Government, on coming into office in December 1994, included a commitment to establish an all-party Oireachtas committee to review the Constitution.  In March 1995 an expert review group was established to prepare a report on all aspects of the Constitution to assist the all-party committee in its work.  The expert review group completed its report in just over a year. I pay tribute to the members of the group and compliment them on their thorough and comprehensive report which examined every aspect of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee established in July 1996 produced two progress reports by the time the Dáil was dissolved in May of this year.  I am happy to say that this Government is re-establishing the all-party committee to continue with this work.  All sides of the House are committed to this review.</P>
    <P>In its report, the expert review group considered whether the procedure for nominating a presidential candidate is too restrictive.  It concluded that to be the case and that the system is in need of democratisation.  It referred to the procedure in other countries where a specified number of electors may conjoin to nominate a candidate.  However, it came to the conclusion that validation of such nominations would be difficult. It recommended that some alternative mechanism, based on a specified number of voters, should be explored.  It also suggested that the nomination procedure could be loosened by reducing the number of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas required to nominate a candidate.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee had not dealt with the constitutional provisions relating to the office of President before it lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil, but I expect that these provisions will be dealt with by the re-established committee in the near future.</P>
    <P>In democracies where a non-executive President is head of state, Constitution writers have devised different mechanisms for choosing their President.  In many countries, the function is assigned to parliament without a direct vote of the people.  We have chosen a system which provides for a direct vote of the people, with a nomination procedure involving directly elected public representatives.  In this regard, it could be said to be a finely tuned model of democracy, balancing involvement of the electorate with that of elected <Col N="965" /> representatives.  However, the evolving public attitude to the office of President and the increasing public awareness of the importance of the role of that office has generated an impatience with what are seen by individuals and some political parties as barriers to nominating a candidate for election as President.</P>
    <P>There has also been a widely held perception that political parties have this area all sewn up and that it is impossible for a non-party candidate to succeed in being nominated at a presidential election.  This is not true if we examine the record of elections to date.  The history of previous presidential elections since 1937 shows that of a total of 12 candidates for the office, four have claimed not to be members of a political party at the time of their nomination.</P>

      <P>Two other non-party candidates, the distinguished scholar, Dubhglas de hÍde, the first President, and the late Cearbhaill Ó Dalaigh, have served as President.  This at least helps put paid to the theory that the office of President is the preserve of party political candidates.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to note that as far as I am aware, until this election no serious attempt was made to explore the option of seeking a nomination from local authorities.  It has always been assumed that, as local authorities are controlled by political parties, that procedure for nomination was in effect closed off to a non-party candidate.  In nominating two candidates for the current election, individual local authority members and political parties have broken new ground and proved commentators wrong.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the presidential election campaign has been given a new and interesting dimension by the exercise of this procedure by the local authorities.  The public's imagination has clearly been captured and I hope this will be reflected in a very good turnout when the polling stations open on 30 October.</P>
      <P>It is also fair to say that this new development has led to further debate on the nature of the presidency.  Its role is being defined, not just in terms of the formal responsibilities laid down in the Constitution but also in terms of less tangible aspects.  There is a sense in which the public is beginning to see the presidential election as an opportunity to select as its Head of State a person who, in some way, encapsulates those ideas and aspirations which the voters feel would best represent those of today's Ireland.  The political parties have clearly recognised this in their choice of candidates.  The nominations of two further candidates by the local authorities gives the electorate an even wider choice, not just in terms of personalities but also in terms of quite different sets of ideas and aspirations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us within the political party system will, of course, be fully supportive of our own candidates and will each feel that the candidate <Col N="966" /> we have selected has the most to offer in terms of symbolising the ideas and aspirations of Ireland as we enter the 21st century.  However, we must also welcome the wider choice that is available now to the electorate as a result of the decisions taken by the local authorities.  I welcome this development as an expression of local democracy and a demonstration that it is possible to get nominated for the Office of President other than by political parties.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the specific proposal before us in this Bill.  It proposes to amend the Constitution to add an extra mechanism for securing a nomination as candidate for election as President.  This would involve an aspiring candidate getting at least 20,000 presidential electors to join in a nomination.</P>
    <P>This nomination procedure has also been suggested as a possibility for other types of elections down the years as an alternative to a deposit requirement.  The main area of potential difficulty relates to validating the signatures.  The register of electors would have to be checked to verify that every single person joining in such a nomination is, in fact, registered.  After that task was completed, there would have to be some reliable way of establishing the authenticity of the signatures. The expert review group in its report acknowledged that difficulty and seems to suggest a much smaller number of people joining in such a nomination.</P>
    <P>I am sure I do not need to remind the House of the importance of requirements, both constitutional and statutory, governing the election of the Office of President being rigidly complied with.  Any doubt which might hang over a nomination could result in a petition questioning the result of an election.</P>
    <P>We would also have to bear in mind that we have had experience already which allowed for a procedure involving participation of registered electors in initiating legislation.  The Free State Constitution provided for a so-called right of initiative under which legislation could be initiated by a petition of 50,000 registered electors. However, that provision was repealed by an Act of Parliament within a few years of the coming into force of that Constitution without the procedure having ever been exercised.</P>
    <P>In short, there is an obvious potential difficulty which would need to be addressed if the procedure proposed in the Bill is to work satisfactorily. I will listen with interest to the views of Deputies on how this problem might be overcome.</P>
    <P>Apart from the existing arrangement for the nomination of candidates and that proposed in this Bill, requiring a deposit fixed at a reasonable level is another mechanism for acting as a disincentive to non-serious candidates who have no serious expectation or hope of getting elected and to prevent the ballot paper from being flooded by such candidates.  A deposit is a reasonable earnest of serious intent.  It has the advantage that it is a simple requirement of long-standing and is well <Col N="967" /> known and understood.  It is refunded if the candidate attracts a certain minimum of support. Compliance with the deposit requirement is easily verified.  A genuine candidate, with serious policies, should have little difficulty in putting such a deposit together.</P>
    <P>The level of deposit which will deter frivolous candidates without inhibiting genuine contenders is a matter for judgment.  A deposit pitched too high appears élitist, while it has no effect if pitched too low.  While the deposit requirement applies in the case of Dáil, European and local elections, it is a matter for debate whether it would be regarded as appropriate at a presidential election.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to refer briefly to the demands by Opposition Deputies for polling to take place on Friday at the presidential election and referendum.  Under our electoral law, the polling day at each election or referendum is appointed by order made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in accordance with, and subject to, the constraints specified in the particular electoral code. It is a matter for decision on each occasion which day of the week should be appointed for taking the poll.  The decision is reached after taking into consideration such factors as time of year and other events coinciding with polling day.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the only two occasions on which polling was on a Friday were the divorce referendum in 1995 and the general election this year.  Interestingly, the polling day at the bail referendum last November reverted to a Thursday. This is also related to the broader question of weekend voting.  Suggestions for weekend voting have been raised off and on in the past.  Strong arguments have been made in respect of this.  For example, it has been asserted that it would reduce or eliminate school closures.  Other arguments put forward are that it would facilitate voters generally by giving a wider choice as to the time of day at which they could vote and that it would possibly increase the percentage turnout.  While the Minister has power under existing law to appoint Saturday or Sunday as polling day, there are a number of considerations which would have to be considered.</P>
    <P>There could be objections on religious grounds from some denominations.  The question of Sunday voting was raised some years ago with church leaders and the minority churches indicated that they would be opposed on religious and moral grounds.  The Catholic church had no objection. Saturday, of course, is the Jewish sabbath and consideration would have to be given to the views of that community.  It is possible there could be a reduced poll because of people going away at weekends.  Major sporting events coinciding with a weekend polling day would pose problems for persons wishing to attend.  Likewise, the strain on Garda resources could be greater on Sunday because of such sporting events, especially in summer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> Overall, it is not clear that more people would have an opportunity of voting if elections and referenda took place on weekends rather than midweek, as at present.  Neither is it clear that voting on weekends would be the only way, or the best way, of facilitating those for whom the existing practice is not suitable.  In any event, it is open to a Minister to consider polling at weekends in the future under existing electoral and referendum law.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention that since the general election, a number of changes to electoral law relating to the registration of electors have come into force which would be of relevance to students in facilitating them to vote at elections and referenda.  The Electoral Act, 1997, provides for the extension of postal voting arrangements to electors who satisfy the registration authority that the circumstances of their occupation, service or employment are such as to render it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their polling station on polling day.  Students pursuing a course of study on a full-time basis at an educational institution in the State come within the meaning of &ldquo;service&rdquo; and &ldquo;employment&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act.  The provisions of the Act relating to postal voting were commenced on 11 June and, therefore, enable students who are living away from their registered address who satisfy the conditions to apply for entry in the postal voters list and to vote by post at future elections and referenda.</P>

      <P>Registration authorities gave public notice advising electors wishing to be included in the postal voters' list for the current register to apply to their local registration authority by 18 July 1997.  This was the subject of a national publicity campaign organised by my Department in July.  In addition, eligible electors may apply for entry in the supplement to the postal voters' list to be published in connection with any election or referendum to be held while the current register of electors applies.  The closing date for these polls is today.  My Department also arranged for newspaper advertisements to this effect early last week.</P>
      <P>The 1997 Act also provided for extending the eligibility of voters to get on the supplement to the register of electors.  The effect of the new provision is to expand, with effect from 11 June 1997, the grounds on which applications for inclusion in the supplement to the register may be made to include persons who take up ordinary residence at an address subsequent to the qualifying date &mdash; 1 September &mdash; provided they are not already registered at any address and persons who reach 18 years of age during the currency of the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that returned emigrants, nonnationals taking up residency in the State and persons not already registered who move house <Col N="969" /> are likely to constitute the principal categories who will avail of the supplement facility following relaxation of the requirement in relation to ordinary residence at place of registration on the qualifying date of 1 September.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for new supplements to the postal voters' list and special voters' list.  A new section 15A provides for the preparation and publication, in advance of an election or referendum, of a supplement to the postal voters' list containing the names of certain qualified electors who are not already on the postal or special voters' lists &mdash; members of the Garda Síochána, persons unable to vote in person due to a physical illness or physical disability who are ordinarily resident at their residence and persons who because of the circumstances of their occupation, service or employment are likely to be unable to vote in person at their polling station on polling day.</P>
    <P>In addition, a supplement to the special voters' list containing the names of qualified electors who are unable to vote in person due to a physical illness or physical disability who are ordinarily resident at an institution and who are not already on the postal or special voters' lists will be prepared in advance of an election or referendum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the new arrangements provided for in the Electoral Act, 1997 requiring the disclosure of donations in excess of £500 received by candidates at a presidential election will apply at this election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be delighted we are recognising it now.  The 1997 Act provides for similar disclosure requirements for donations received by presidential candidates as apply to candidates at a Dáil election.  Each candidate is required to appoint an election agent for the purposes of accounting for donations received.  The agent must be appointed not later than the latest date for receiving nominations, which is today.  Details of agents must be furnished to the presidential returning officer by that date.  It is the duty of the presidential election agent to make such inquiries and maintain such records as are necessary for the purpose of furnishing the presidential donation statement and making the statutory declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A candidate may not accept directly or indirectly anonymous donations in excess of £100. Any such donation received must be surrendered to the Public Offices Commission.  Details of donations exceeding £500 must be disclosed by the agent of the candidate within 56 days from <Col N="970" /> polling day.  Where the same person makes more than one donation to the same candidate at the election, they must be aggregated and treated as a single donation.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;donation&rdquo; includes a contribution from any person for the purpose of promoting the election of a candidate and includes a donation of money, property or goods.  It also includes the conferring of the right to use, without payment or other consideration, any property or goods or the supply of services.  The difference between the commercial price and the actual price charged for goods or services, that is, where a discount is offered, is also regarded as a donation.  Under the Act, failure to furnish a donation statement or make the required statutory declaration within the specified period &mdash; 56 days after polling day &mdash; or the making of a false or misleading statement in the statutory declaration is an offence.</P>
    <P>The question of nomination procedures is one of a number of issues relating to the election of the President which will have to be addressed between now and the next presidential election which, barring unforeseen circumstances, will not take place until 2004.  For example, suggestions have been made that the age requirement should be reduced.  I have no doubt that the all-party committee will have recommendations to make on this and a number of other issues related to the presidency.</P>
    <P>The fact that there are a number of issues which merit consideration of the current arrangements for presidential elections, makes it inevitable that in the course of this debate we will have to consider whether it would be best to deal separately with the single issue in the Bill which is before us at present, or whether it would be better to work towards an eventual package of proposals which would be complete and comprehensive. In that context, I should point out that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, in his capacity as chairman of the all-party Constitution Review Committee during the last Dáil, stated in his report on the committee's work it was recommending that changes should be effected through a series of omnibus proposals.  We will certainly have to consider whether this would be preferable to having a number of single-issue Bills such as the present one.  However, that is not to take away in any sense from the value of having the debate that is now under way.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a general consensus that debate on this area is worthwhile, and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.  The date of the election has been referred to, but we have no control over that.  A presidential election must be held within 60 days of the President's resignation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State began his speech by paying tribute to the former President, Mary Robinson, and I begin by also paying tribute to a remarkable President who, for the last seven years, reformed the office of President and <Col N="971" /> changed all our thinking on the role of the office of President in the political, social and public sense and how it relates to the very essence of the affairs of the country.</P>
      <P>Those of us who supported the candidacy of Mary Robinson seven years ago did not envisage the sweeping changes she would bring about.  She brought those changes about not by fundamentally altering the Constitution, but by bringing the constitutional role to its natural limit.  She graced the office in a way that brought huge public support, as opinion poll ratings of 92 per cent satisfaction evidenced.  Like the Minister of State, I wish former President Mary Robinson well in her new endeavour, a very demanding and challenging role with the United Nations in furthering human rights.  That is an area with which she was long concerned and we will be hearing of the successes of Mary Robinson in this new endeavour for many years, to the credit of herself and her country.  I am sure I am not alone in being extremely proud of all she has done.</P>
      <P>I am heartened by the concluding remarks of the Minister of State.  He did not shoot the Bill down by saying the Government would vote against it.  I presume from his concluding remarks that he will listen attentively to Deputies' comments and that he is open to persuasion.</P>
      <P>I accept the logic in the rounded approach he is advocating, as there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.  One is the nominating procedure. Deputies have outlined the three procedures. An outgoing President can renominate himself or herself.  The most used and readily understood mechanism is that 20 Members of the Oireachtas nominate a candidate.  For the first time, we have seen the third constitutional provision utilised where four county or borough councils can nominate a candidate.  In essence, what is envisaged in this simple amendment is a popular franchise where 20,000 citizens could also provide an avenue of nomination.  That would have been a very compelling argument a month or six weeks ago and some might feel that the argument has been somewhat eroded by the ease with which two non-party candidates procured nominations by seeking and getting the support of at least four county councils.  I welcome the opening up of that avenue and I strongly support the independent stance taken by individual councillors who said they had a constitutional right to act in that regard and no party whip from Mount Street or any other street in Dublin would tell them what they could do in their own council chambers.  That is right and proper.  There would have been a very negative reaction from the general public if that had not been allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the people of Ireland who will ultimately decide who the President of Ireland will be and they want as broad a range of choice as possible. If somebody has the ambition and the tenacity to seek to fight an election campaign, I certainly would not be in the business of putting barriers <Col N="972" /> in their way.  We have all contested elections and know it is not an easy task to undertake.  I heartily welcome the broadness of the choice available in the forthcoming presidential election.  All of us, even the professional political pundits, will admit that this is a totally unpredictable election because of that.  That is no bad thing; the race is a very open one between very competent and able candidates, each of whom brings a dimension which will attract a degree of popularity.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, it will be decided on who will attract the most support &mdash; probably through preferences because I do not think anybody in a five candidate race is going to win on the first count &mdash; and best reflect the modern Ireland in the concluding years of the twentieth century. The chosen person will be the one who can mirror the essence of Irishness today and who will best represent the Irish character and nature of modern Ireland to people abroad.  That is only one of the tasks which the new President, whoever he or she may be, will take on.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe managed to mention his party's candidate, Mary Banotti, at least five times during his contribution.  I suppose that when my party colleagues are reading my contribution I should ensure that Adi Roche is mentioned at least as often as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Adi Roche &mdash; that is twice I have mentioned her name.  There are good candidates in the field, people of stature who have already made a contribution to society.  I am looking forward with genuine enthusiasm to the coming weeks where each of those candidates will present their view and their vision of the presidency which will bridge &mdash; I hope my use of the word is not taken to be an endorsement of another candidate &mdash; the twentieth and the twenty-first century.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party supports this Bill because it broadens the franchise.  There was much speculation throughout the summer that the political parties would decide on a single candidate and, in so doing, would foreclose the debate making it impossible for anybody else to be elected.  Had the political establishment done that, there would have been a very negative reaction from the public. It has now become clear to all of us that people want to make up their own minds.  They do not want anybody in this House doing that for them.  They want choice and they want an election. I agree with earlier speakers who said that probably will be the trend from now on.  None of us in politics should make long-term predictions because they often turn out to be short-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a new understanding of the role and potential of the President, and there is a new pride in the office.  That is not intended as a slight on any of the excellent holders of that high office since the foundation of the State.  People want and will demand a say in the election of the President. <Col N="973" /> There will be a reaction to any political closing of the options available to the people.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the Fine Gael proposal to broaden the avenues available for nomination is welcome.  It is interesting to examine the difficulties that might arise from the procedures.  Under the current procedures, there are 29 county councils &mdash; three in Dublin, two in Tipperary and one each in the other 24 councils.  In addition, there are five county borough councils, making a total of 34 nominating councils.  Together they could theoretically nominate eight candidates for the park; many of them are well minded to do that. That is certainly a much broader entry gate than we would have envisaged heretofore.</P>
    <P>Would practical difficulties arise if there was, say, a petition system where 20,000 electors could nominate a candidate?  Deputy McGrath referred to the fact that every elector now has a reference number and there should not be any difficulty in cross referencing 20,000 names.  I have visions of a nominating officer sitting in the Custom House going through 20,000 names and numbers to ensure everybody was on a register somewhere, which obviously would have to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have such faith in computers. I could envisage the signature of the nominating officer being a little bit shaky when validating that those 20,000 were registered thereby ensuring there would be no challenge subsequently to that determination.  Notwithstanding that, the nominating procedure exists in other countries and there is no reason this jurisdiction should not be as capable as jurisdictions in Portugal, Lithuania, Iceland or anywhere else in ensuring that such nominations are valid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time remaining to me I want to raise a number of fundamental issues that the Minister of State might address tomorrow night.  Yesterday I published in my name the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, l997 which deals specifically with the presidential election.  From our experience of the last general election, I strongly believe that polling should be held on a Friday to facilitate young people.  We took that view in the general election.  Many students will not be able to take Thursday off college to travel home to vote.  We should make it as easy as possible for everybody to vote and Friday voting would enable young people to exercise their franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the Government did not see fit to set Friday as polling day.  Maybe it did not think the matter through.  Legislation would be required to change the day and while the Minister of State <Col N="974" /> was open in his comments I do not know if he is open enough to accept the Bill I published yesterday which would change the voting day to Friday and thereby enable young people to exercise their franchise.  Such an act of generosity might encourage them to vote for the candidate being promoted by the Minister and Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>They may not have voted for her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume all wounds are now healed in that regard.</P>
      <P>I have the highest respect and regard for my successor the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dempsey.  However, the director of elections of a candidate should not be the Minister for the Environment.  The returning officer is an officer of the Department of the Environment and he or she should not be placed in the invidious position of making a determination in a dispute about the nominating procedure with the director of elections of a candidate who happens to be the political master of the Department.  My Bill provides that the Minister charged with responsibility for the electoral process should not be a director of elections.</P>
      <P>A technical defect has arisen in connection with the supplement to the postal and special voters register which I hope can be amended by way of regulation.  I ask the Minister of State to deal with this point in his reply.  The relevant statute, which I introduced, is very strict on this matter. The Electoral Act provides that an application to be included in such a supplement delivered after making an order appointing polling day shall be disregarded for that election or referendum.</P>
      <P>The problem in this case is that different orders were made for two electoral procedures to be held on the same day, one being the presidential election order which was made on 13 September and the other being the referendum order which I understand was to be made today.  I would like the Minister to clarify if it was made today.  On a literal interpretation of the Act, anyone who registered after the presidential order was made will only be entitled to vote in the referendum. My legal advice is that we need amending legislation to deal with this matter.  There is a great repository of wisdom on electoral law in the franchise section of the Department and perhaps this point can be clarified by a Government speaker tomorrow night.  That would avoid any difficulty when a person votes on the appointed day and is presented with one rather than two ballot papers. I would welcome clarity on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my former role as Minister I referred a number of issues related to the holding of elections to an all-party committee of the House, but such was the pressure on that standing committee dealing with legislation that it did not have time to deal with all the issues.  This is not a party political issue and I invite the Minister of State to find a mechanism to deal with it as soon as possible. <Col N="975" /> For example, what day should be polling day?  I advocate it should be a Friday.  Some people argue it should be a Sunday, but I know there are religious concerns.  The Minister of State pointed out some difficulties concerning administration and policing.  We need a consensus on this matter.</P>
    <P>The issue of ballot papers should also be considered. We experimented with the placing of photographs on European ballot papers.  There is a case to be made for including photographs on ballot papers particularly for those with literacy or sight difficulties.  There should not be party political division on these matters, they should be debated and decided on.  A number of issues including those I mentioned are in the public domain for some time and we have never got around to having a comprehensive electoral Bill.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I tried to be as supportive and helpful to the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition in regard to good proposals that emanated from the then Deputy Mary Wallace.  Good proposals on postal voting were incorporated into law in an agreed Electoral Act.  We need to consolidate these matters, have a forum for debate to address the issues and have political consensus on a consolidation Bill to make these changes in a co-ordinated and structured way.</P>
    <P>It is important to have a debate on the mechanisms for nomination for the presidency.  There is a popular will and consensus that it should be as open and as unrestrictive as possible.  I welcome the amendment proposed by the Fine Gael Party as a valuable contribution to opening up the mechanisms.  There are three existing avenues and this proposal constitutes a fourth.  There are those who say that following the experience of the past few weeks it would be infinitely more difficult to get 20,000 electors to sign up than it is to get four local authorities to sign up.  There are those who feel that citizens of a political persuasion, or not of any, should be entitled to have a candidate nominated if they so wish.</P>
    <P>As the proposer of this amendment, Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, supported this concept in the Progressive Democrats' policy document.  I hope the tone of the Second Stage contribution of the Minister of State, which indicated an openness to hear and act on the suggestions from this side of the House is indicative of the tone of the reaction to Private Members' business.  When I was in Government I argued there should not be a knee-jerk reaction to reject proposals simply because they come from the other side of the House.  There is no need for that.  Some good ideas can emanate from this side of the House and if a convincing argument can be made for this Bill I hope the two Government parties will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the important issue of the imminent closure of Sea Ray Boats, Little Island, County Cork.  Sea Ray is an American company which set up in Cork some years ago and until recently had been very successful.  It employs over 100 people in Little Island, County Cork.  Last month the people of the area were shocked on hearing of the possible closure of Sea Ray, especially at a time of economic boom. Oireachtas Members, including the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, met the IDA and senior management of Sea Ray some weeks ago on site and were informed that, due to a slump in the sale of boats in the European market, the parent company in Florida had decided to close the plant at Little Island.</P>
      <P>The loss of 103 jobs to the Cork economy, even at a time of economic expansion, is a severe blow and cannot be explained away &mdash; as has been attempted &mdash; by saying the workers will get jobs in the US or in other companies around Ireland.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter to allow the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, explain what attempts she has made to prevent the closure, if she has made direct contact with Sea Ray in Florida and, if so, at what level, and the response of Sea Ray management in Florida.</P>
      <P>The news of this closure has been softened by statements from Government Deputies who say jobs are readily available for some of the staff in the US and in other companies throughout Ireland.  This approach is regrettable.  Why should any Irish man or woman have to travel to the US in these good times to find employment?  The performance by Deputies &mdash; I exempt the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, who has always been level headed in his approach to issues such as this &mdash; was, to say the least, sheepish.  They had been tigers in Opposition but are lambs in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I share the Deputy's concern regarding Sea Ray Boats' announcement that it is to close its manufacturing facility at Little Island, County Cork.  I regret the loss of jobs and the impact on the employees, their families and the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sea Ray Boats is a subsidiary company of the US Brunswick Corporation, a major sporting goods manufacturer.  The plant in Little Island, Cork, was set up ten years ago to manufacture a <Col N="977" /> range of luxury cruisers for the European market. The company had been successfully selling its luxury cruisers against strong European competition but since the mid-1980s the market has reduced throughout Europe, leaving the company dependent on the French and German markets for over 50 per cent of its sales.</P>
    <P>The company has operated in a very competitive market and has been at risk for some considerable time.  Vigorous efforts have been made to avert the closure.  IDA Ireland had been co-operating with the Irish management through R&amp;D and other incentives to encourage diversification into larger and more profitable boats with the co-operation of the parent company.  I fully appreciate the efforts of the IDA and the company to reposition.  These efforts were continuing when the critical German market for the company's products collapsed.  Sales by the company in that market failed to reach the level necessary for break-even and there was no prospect of early replacement sales in other markets to compensate for the shortfall.  Despite the efforts of all the parties involved, closure became an inevitable commercial decision.  In this context it should be recognised that redundancies and closure decisions are matters for companies themselves.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the workers have been offered a redundancy package which they have accepted and that in excess of 50 per cent of the staff have been offered alternative employment in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>The IDA is continuing its efforts to find a replacement industry and is confident, given the interest expressed to date, a suitable alternative industry will be found for the excellent facility and site at Little Island.</P>
    <P>The IDA and the other development agencies retain a strong commitment to job creation in the Cork region.  This year already investments by the IDA have been announced which will lead to the creation of a further 2,000 jobs in Cork city and county.  I have asked the IDA to continue to do everything possible to find a replacement industry. They have assured me they are confident, given the level of interest expressed already, that they will find a replacement for this facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this item.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, on his appointment as Minister for Education. It is an onerous responsibility.  He worked very hard as spokesman on Education when he <Col N="978" /> was in Opposition.  I wish him every success over the next few years in a key area of Government policy.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the issue of pre-school education with the Minister. Ireland lags far behind our EU partners in the provision of State funded pre-school education, but it would be remiss of me if I failed to recognise the sterling work of the former Minister for Education, former Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach, who pioneered the initial response by establishing a pilot programme in this area and set the foundation for the emergence of a well funded pre-school education system.</P>
      <P>We are only beginning to learn about the first response to the pilot programme, but unless the present Minister for Education prioritises the issue and fights for additional funding for this area within his Department, the entire advance of pre-school education will be stopped in its tracks.  The advance of pre-school education, particularly in some of the most deprived areas, can only succeed if the Minister for Education wins the argument in financial terms at the Cabinet table.  The success of the early start pilot programme and of the breaking the cycle of educational disadvantage programme can only be realised if there is a financial commitment by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and all Ministers in the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister should prioritise this area of education policy because if the work that was pioneered by the last Government continues over the next few years we can make a real dent in the issue of educational disadvantage.  This, in conjunction with the programme breaking the cycle of educational disadvantage and the school attendance legislation promised by the Minister would do more to help disadvantaged children than anything the Minister could do over the next few of years.  Extending the early school programme, increasing the number of teachers in disadvantaged schools and putting in place a well resourced system of school attendance officers would make a vital difference to parents, teachers and children in gravely disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>My advice to the Minister is to concentrate resources on the basis of educational need, namely the children at primary school level in disadvantaged areas.  The extension of the early school programme could have a dramatic effect on the lives of parents who sometimes have to cope with insurmountable odds.  In communities where attendance at school can be as low as 60 per cent of the eligible school-going population, it is vital that the culture of school as a vehicle for life chances and life opportunities be part of a child's development from the earliest time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pre-school system is also of crucial importance to parents.  Young parents in particular need the space and time it can provide for their children. It is as much a resource for them as their children.  By making pre-school education central to a community with huge social problems we will <Col N="979" /> lessen the chances of children displaying signs of dysfunctional behaviour in school at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the application of St. Brigid's national school in Brookfield in my constituency for inclusion in the next phase of the early start programme.  The school is situated in a parish where the rate of unemployment stands at 82 per cent, which consists entirely of local authority housing and where lone parents account for 38 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>The school was informed by the Department that it failed to meet two of the main criteria for inclusion in the 1996-7 pilot programme.  It was informed that there was no great need to provide a pre-school option in the area and that two rooms would have to be made available.  Any assessment of social conditions in the area would lead one to the conclusion there is not alone a need for such a facility but that it is necessary. There are also two rooms available.  The school management cannot understand how the Department has failed to recognise this.</P>
    <P>An imaginative response is required from Government.  The school should be included in the next phase of the programme as a matter of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy has raised this matter on the Adjournment and thank him for his kind comments.  I, in turn, congratulate him on his election to Dáil Éireann.  The development of the early education system is one of my top priorities.  When in Opposition I invested much time and energy in preparing policy documents on this extremely important matter.  I am a convert to the concept that the earlier one intervenes in the life cycle of a child the greater the dividend for that child and society ultimately.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, I recently announced my intention to establish a national forum on pre-school education.  This stems from the commitment given in the Action Programme for the Millennium.  This consultative process will allow all interested bodies in the field to put forward their proposals and views aimed at co-ordinating services and developing a coherent national policy on early education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The output from the forum will inform my policy decisions on the development of the early start pre-school pilot project.  I will also have the report of the committee established by the previous Minister which is monitoring the progress of the early start programme.  The committee includes representatives from my Department, the Department of Health, all the voluntary bodies involved in pre-school services for this age group as well as the teacher unions and relevant third level colleges involved in staff training.  The committee also advises on the co-ordination of pre-school provision.  There is regular consultation between my officials and those of the Department of Health.  There are approximately seven Departments involved in the provision of <Col N="980" /> early education.  There is therefore a clear need for co-ordination of their activities and to develop a coherent national policy.</P>
    <P>The early start pre-school pilot programme, which was introduced in 1994, is targeted at the most disadvantaged children in the areas in which it is based.  It is being developed as an integral part of the existing primary school system to which the pre-schools are attached.</P>
    <P>The objective of the pilot project is to provide young children with an educational programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful attainment in future years.  The service is being targeted on areas of particular disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Decisions on the selection of locations for the pre-school projects established by my Department were taken after consultation with the relevant health authorities and having full regard to the range of pre-school activities already in place in an area.  The criteria used were the degree of social disadvantage and the availability of vacant classroom accommodation.  I am not entirely responsible for decisions that were taken in the original pilot programme in terms of the selected schools.  The previous Minister would obviously have had an important role in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the case of each area chosen, the intention is that the pre-school project will serve children from the catchment area of the school to which the project is being attached.  Eight centres of greatest disadvantage &mdash; one each in Cork and Limerick, and six in Dublin &mdash; were selected in October 1994 for the provision of this service on a pilot scheme basis.  The areas in question were selected after detailed consideration of needs across the disadvantaged areas.  The programme was extended to a further 32 schools in disadvantaged areas for the 1995-6 school year, bringing the total number of schools with this service to 40.</P>
    <P>In terms of preparation for this September, the allocation of demographic dividend was a matter for the outgoing Minister.  The issue of extending the early start initiative would have been possible in that context but, unfortunately, St. Brigid's national school was not included.  However, there were some problems concerning vacant classroom space in the school.  In the context of the evolution of our policy on early education and an extension of the early start initiative, we will give strong consideration to St. Brigid's application.  A number of Deputies from both sides of the House have been in correspondence with me on that issue.  I note their concern and I will give the matter consideration when it comes to extending the scheme and allocating the dividend next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a high regard for the Minister and for that reason I am all the more concerned by the inauspicious start she has made in her present Ministry.  For 20 years Tallaght, Clondalkin and other parts of west Dublin have been <Col N="981" /> waiting for this service.  It is ten years since the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, announced the go-ahead for the Luas system.  Now, just when it looked as if the prize was within our grasp, it is being snatched away as a result of dithering by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that half the citizens of Dublin who are not served by the DART and who had for the first time the prospect of a decent public transport system now find themselves in a situation where, because the Minister felt compelled to honour a foolish promise made at the time of the general election, the entire project is at risk.</P>
      <P>The European Commission warned publicly that funding would be at risk if we did not get on with it.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dukes, had a consultants' review of the merits of the underground system conducted during his term of office.  That concluded that the overground dimension was the favoured project. Despite that, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, blithely ordered another review against a background of warnings from the European Commission that have put the entire funding at risk. It is especially alarming that CIE has reportedly already begun to examine alternative ways of spending the money.</P>
      <P>I want to share my time with Deputy Olivia Mitchell.</P>

      <P>The previous Government set up a public inquiry under Judge Seán O'Leary to examine the Luas question and this could have dealt with the understandable concerns of traders and residents in the city.  However, this inquiry has been postponed until next April to facilitate the Minister's unnecessary consultancy study.</P>
      <P>It is unconscionable that the residents of Dublin not served by the DART should be condemned for years to an inferior and inadequate transport system because the Minister has buckled to lobby groups in the interests of political expediency.  It is a most inauspicious start to her tenure as Minister and one for which she will not easily be forgiven by generations of Dubliners to come.  A decent public transport system is now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the shock, dismay and consternation at yesterday's <Col N="982" /> announcement which was an inevitable footnote to the announcement made in July to consider an underground option.  There must also have been shock and dismay in the Department, the DTO, CIE and the local authorities, given the work they did in preparation for a public inquiry. They based their new development plans on the expectation that a light rail system would be in place in the next few years.  However, that is nothing to the shock, dismay and anger felt by the people and I do not know if the Minister appreciates that.  Deputy Rabbitte said the Minister will not be easily forgiven.  The people will not forgive and forget if this project does not go ahead as soon as possible because Dublin cannot wait.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand what the Minister hopes to achieve.  It would be better if this inquiry recommended no change so that we could receive money from this tranche of EU funds.  If it recommends change which requires new design work, etc., we will not meet the deadlines.  The Minister said we must have the best option.  That is why millions of pounds of taxpayers' money was spent employing Steer Davies Gleave to carry out the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  That is why the last Fianna Fáil Government accepted the recommendations of that investigation and negotiated the money for the light rail system for Dublin. Why change it now?</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister considering an underground option when the philosophy of the DTI is to obtain a modal switch between private car transport and public transport?  Why put people underground and leave more room for cars?  If one major part of this strategy, such as the light rail system, is run underground, it will no longer be a seamless garment.  The money already invested on the Government's behalf by the Dublin Transportation Office will be undermined; it will no longer form part of a strategy but will represent a series of <i>ad hoc</i> measures.  That will be the real risk we face if the light rail system is shelved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Rabbitte's apology. I realise he was involved in business with the Government.  I thank him and Deputy Mitchell for their contributions.  I do not know whether this was Deputy Mitchell's maiden speech but I welcome her contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish to scotch two untruths which Deputy Rabbitte, I am sure unwittingly, uttered during his contribution.  Deputy Dukes did not commission an independent study.  There is no independent study available in my Department. At a meeting yesterday with the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of my Department, they agreed that there was no independent study, in written form, available to me which was left in the Department by Deputy Dukes.  It is correct that Deputy Dukes commissioned and paid a person to carry out a synopsis and study and I am sure that the individual involved did much valuable <Col N="983" /> work.  However, that study is not available to me in any form.  I wish to correct Deputy Rabbitte's statement because it is untrue.  Studies were carried out at the behest of Luas, much valuable information was garnered but no independent study was carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte is aware that I do not operate in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>No study was carried out.</P>
      <P>Neither Deputy Dukes nor I received a study in written form from Mr. Doyle.  I understand that he gave the former Minister an oral report.  That is very interesting but it is not available to me. The synopsis was commissioned and paid for and I am sure that much valuable work was done. However, I am informed that the report was given in oral, not written, form.</P>
      <P>I wish now to deal with the Deputy's impression that I woke up one morning and decided to instigate this study.  A commitment to such a study is contained and clearly laid out in the Government's manifesto which was made available to everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should take that matter up with the relevant Minister.  I must make it clear that no independent study in written form was left in my Department or given to the previous Minister and that I am carrying out a Government remit in instigating this study.  If the Government had not given me that remit I believe we would be listening to a different story this evening.  I fulfilled the brief given to me.</P>
      <P>On 8 July the Government decided to honour the commitment given in its &ldquo;Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; to investigate the option of putting the city centre section of the light rail network underground.  The Government did so in order to provide convincing answers to the persistent and lingering doubts and concerns expressed by certain interested parties about the feasibility of introducing on-street light rail in the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Independent commentators, business interests and others expressed serious concerns regarding possible negative consequences for transport and traffic arrangements and economic and business activity in the city centre in the short and long-term. I wish to scotch any suggestion that the light rail project has been abandoned.  In reply to Deputy Mitchell's concerns, my office was flooded with telephone calls today from people thanking me for using common sense.  There are <Col N="984" /> two sides to every story and the Deputy must recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>This Government is fully committed to implementing the light rail system for Dublin and its agreed programme puts that beyond doubt.  It was decided to instigate the study at the first Cabinet meeting following the one which took place at Áras an Uachtaráin.  Invitations to tender for the underground study were invited through advertisements placed in national newspapers and the EU Official Journal.  The final date for receipt of tenders was 22 September last.  Tenders have been received and are being urgently evaluated. I expect to be in a position to announce details of the successful consultants in the near future.</P>
    <P>The issues which will be addressed by the underground study are so fundamental that it would be irresponsible of me to proceed to the construction phase without a fully independent examination of the matter.</P>
    <P>I challenge the belief that I should not be in full possession of the facts of underground versus overground rail.  I am lucky I am not passionate about either.  I am passionate about having a proper light rail system for Dublin.  I wonder about and challenge those who do not want the facts to come out in the open.  Is there an agenda I do not know about?  Are there people who are so entrenched in their views that they will not allow any independent study&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It strikes me as astounding and bizarre that constant untruths are circulating, for example, that there was an independent study done on underground rail.  There was not and it is not available to me.  I did not wake up one morning and decide to do this; it was in the Government manifesto to the nation.  It is also untrue to say this will not go ahead &mdash; it will.  That is why I am glad both Deputies raised this matter. <Col N="985" /> I challenge anyone who says I must do something because that is what the Luas commissioned studies said.  Despite what Deputy Rabbitte may say in any of the jousts we will have, and have had, with much enjoyment, and what Deputy Olivia Mitchell may say as she goes through her career, I have never acted without having knowledge. I do not act in a witless or stupid way.  Is Deputy Rabbitte part of the lobby that says the money is there and we should run with it?  That is utterly unbelievable.</P>

I am amazed that anyone would say the money is there and I should go ahead and do it a certain way because everyone else thinks that is the right way.  I want to do it the right way and to spend the money wisely.  In 40, 50 or 60 years time when ten more Ministers for Transport have come and gone, I do not want to be the one who introduced a system without the proper knowledge.  I will do it with knowledge, based on certainty.  I will not do it based on half-truths and studies which do not exist even though it is constantly being said they do.  I want truth and knowledge.  Whatever is the result of that, I will go at it hell for leather and it will be implemented.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy de Valera, the best of luck and good fortune in her ministry.</P>
      <P>The issue of the National Museum concerns me and I do not want to go over old ground.  It is important we have a national museum of the finest type available to all of the people, for the presentation of our heritage and past, for educational, social and accessibility purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the report of the Interim Board of the National Museum of Ireland presented to the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, in May 1995 was to preserve and make accessible the portable natural and cultural material heritage of Ireland, to communicate to the people and visitors to Ireland a vision and understanding of that heritage and to act as a major educational resource.  I support that strongly as a former Minister for Tourism especially given the level of <Col N="986" /> visitors to the National Museum in Kildare Street and the Natural History Museum.  These institutions run more than parallel to many other international museums.  In that sense, the National Museum should be one of the finest.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the former Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht's strategy was to oversee the development of capital projects for cultural institutions, including the National Museum facility at Collins Barracks. The Minister knows what is happening.  There has been a 33 per cent decrease in professional technical staff since 1975, the Department of Finance's review of museum staffing needs has been suppressed, the recommendations of international museum consultants have been ignored to a large extent, there are no keepers in the museum's curatorial departments, there have been no substantial promotions for 20 years and 60 per cent of curatorial staff act in higher grades without promotion.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised these matters in the House on 8 April and was replied to by the then Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  On that occasion she asked: &ldquo;Will the Minister of State agree that the nub of this issue is that the jobs were advertised by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht before consultations with the union were completed?  Will he also accept that this is yet another example of how cultural institutions have been treated shabbily by this Government, they are obviously not a priority with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht?&rdquo; The matter is now the Minister's responsibility.  She spoke to representatives of IMPACT prior to her appointment. She should meet them again because they are prepared to work out a compromise.  Following a meeting with them she should meet the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and find out why the required staff are not being appointed.  We are talking about highly trained professional staff whose morale is low.</P>
    <P>I sent a person to the museum today to get an objective visitor's analysis of what has taken place.  That person told me that what has been completed has been done very well.  The media displays, the musical instruments and CD ROMs are first class, but the project is far from complete. There are numerous advertisements for the Fonthill Vase, but the vase is not on display. There are 30 empty display spaces, 526 unlabelled items and five prepared but empty rooms.</P>
    <P>Following the Minister's meeting with representatives of IMPACT and the Minister for Finance she should prepare a structured and strategic plan for the development of the National Museum, which has consequences for the £5 million development in Castlebar.  The Minister can be assured of my co-operation because we should be proud of our heritage.  We want the developments at Collins Barracks and in Castlebar to be to the forefront of museums internationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish the Minister well.  I have no doubt she is committed to her portfolio, <Col N="987" /> but tragically she has failed her first real test.  This must be embarrassing for her, particularly as the dispute could be easily resolved.  The indications are that for a cost of £20,000 per annum great progress could be made.  It must seem extraordinary to the public that museum staff should be treated so shabbily.</P>
      <P>The opening of the Collins Barracks museum should have been a great occasion, but it was a showcase for Government intransigence.  The abortive opening by the Taoiseach sent out a loud message about the Government's failure to deal with what was a manageable dispute, but has become a major embarrassment for the Minister. The opening is reported to have cost £70,000, but I am not sure if that is the correct figure.  This has had an impact on those who are committed to the museum and who want to be on good terms with the management but cannot because of the way they have been treated.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the role of the Minister for Finance in this matter.  He is responsible for the logjam.  He has adopted a macho attitude to public sector workers and wants to make a case of this small number of museum staff who, if the matter were resolved, would not create a precedent for any other section of workers.  It would not have the same knock-on effect as a large group of workers.  These workers have a legitimate case.  They have been treated shabbily. They want to see the dispute resolved properly and fairly.  I hope the Minister will call on the Taoiseach to deal with the situation in the Department of Finance because the problem seems to be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for their good wishes which are much appreciated. I look forward to future discussions with both colleagues and with many others which I hope will not only be fruitful but enjoyable.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the seriousness of the dispute in the National Museum, and I share the desire of both Deputies to reach a practical resolution to ensure that the museum is in a position to tackle the many challenges that lie ahead at this key time in its development.  On my appointment as Minister, I inherited a situation of industrial action among the professional and technical grades in the museum.  The origins of this dispute go back over many years.  For example, the museum was particularly badly affected at curatorial level by the voluntary early retirement scheme in the late 1980s.  This has served to slow down the normal train of promotion within the museum.  It was an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of this scheme when posts, particularly at the top of the promotion chain, were lost, and it permeated down to the recruitment level.  In a relatively small staffing structure such as the museum, this problem was accentuated and the staff could see little career prospects over the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> The staff in question, many with long service in their recruitment grades, have given exceptional, dedicated service to the National Museum over the years, especially in recent times with the exciting development of the Collins Barracks project. In addition, the requirements of a modern museum necessitated skills in areas not provided for in the museum in the past.  Skills in disciplines such as conservation, marketing, information technology, etc., were required especially at this time when the museum was expanding given the development of the new facility at Collins Barracks, and staff with these skills were recruited.</P>
    <P>IMPACT, the trade union involved, sought a structure which involved promotion for a number of their members.  While much of the discussion has focused on the case within the museum, all claims for promotions and additional staff within the public service must be considered in the context of the wider public sector pay and staff numbers policy, under which museum staff have benefited.</P>
    <P>The assertion in publicity material that a significant percentage of curatorial staff of the National Museum are on allowances for higher duties has been frequently used as an example of the neglect of the museum.  I would regard the payment of additional remuneration to any staff where it has been established that the person in question is carrying out either higher or additional duties as being a positive sign of recognition that where additional remuneration is warranted, it should be paid.</P>
    <P>Some of these staff are being compensated for performing a range of additional duties temporarily, for example, in the preparation of the Collins Barracks development.  In the case of one of the acting keepers, the individual concerned does not yet have the requisite minimum service to be substantively promoted to that grade.  What I am attempting to stress is that there are genuine reasons behind each &ldquo;acting-up&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>ex-gratia</i>&rdquo; payment being made to staff in the museum.  Far from it being a negative feature, it should be regarded as a positive measure.</P>
    <P>Despite the industrial relations problem in the National Museum, I am continuing to try to find a resolution.  It saddened me, and I know it was a source of great sadness for those involved in the demonstration to whom I spoke at the time, that the opening of Collins Barracks, which should have been a joyous occasion for everyone, was overshadowed for those who had put so much effort into the preparations, whether it be the staff of the museum, including those who are now involved in the dispute, the Caretaker Board, under its able chairperson Barbara Nugent, management of the museum, or the staff of my Department and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the inaugural exhibitions are not fully complete due to the industrial dispute they still provide an enjoyable visitor experience. I am confident that when the dispute is resolved the Collins Barracks project, both the first phase and subsequent ones, will be recognised <Col N="989" /> as a major landmark in the development of our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties that surround this dispute, I have assured the staff and I am assuring the House that I am doing everything possible to resolve it so that we can get on with the work that is so necessary to develop the expanded National Museum and the presentation of its wonderful artefacts to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 36, 59 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The agreement that was reached at the negotiations in Oslo on a global convention banning anti-personnel landmines represents a major step forward in the struggle to eliminate these inmhumane and indiscriminate weapons which have been a major scourge.  It will be particularly welcomed by those countries which have suffered so much as a result of the use of these barbaric devices.  Under the Convention, landmines will be banned without reservations, without exceptions and for all time.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased with this development, as I have long advocated the abolition of these horrific weapons and while in opposition I tabled a Private Member's Bill aimed at banning these weapons.  Since taking office I have set the conclusion of a global ban on landmines as the immediate priority of Irish disarmament policy.</P>
      <P>The Convention agreed at Oslo enjoyed the support of more than one hundred participating delegations, including in particular the mine affected countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.  Ireland, together with a core group of nations including Canada, Austria, Mexico and South Africa, at the Oslo Conference played a key role in bringing about agreement on the Convention text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of significant states including Russia, China, India and Pakistan and two of our partners in the European Union, Greece and Finland, did not, despite our best efforts, participate in the conference.  While the United States did participate, its delegation declared that it was not in a position to forego the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines for the foreseeable future.  The vast majority of participating states at Oslo including Ireland would not agree to an exception which would have compromised the fundamental global approach we were <Col N="992" /> pursuing, and would have defeated the goal of a total ban which we set out to achieve.  The United States was the moving force behind a 1996 UN resolution calling for the total abolition of these weapons, and we still hope that by signing at Ottawa or soon afterwards, it will give concrete expression to its commitment to bring about an end to these hideous devices.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to sign the Convention in Ottawa in December, where I will be examining with other foreign Ministers the ways in which we can promote the universalization of this Convention, in particular the early accession of the remaining states of the European Union and other states whose adherence to this Convention would be of significance.  The Government intends to take the necessary measures to ensure that Ireland is among the first countries to ratify the Convention.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the role played by the NGO community, in particular the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its affiliates, in helping to bring about this major achievement.  The International Committee of the Red Cross made a very valuable contribution to the negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 37 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Agenda 2000 proposals which have been brought forward by the Commission related to the future enlargement of the European Union and to the future financing and development of Union policies taking account of that enlargement.  A copy of the main Agenda 2000 documents has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>A number of important elements of Agenda 2000 are within the primary responsibility of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  European Union foreign Ministers have, however, been given overall responsibility for the negotiations and it is on that basis that I am outlining in a summary way the Government's general approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Agenda 2000 the Commission recommends that five Central and Eastern Europe countries, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, should join Cyprus in the accession negotiations which are to commence early next year.  Proposals are outlined for a reinforcement of the pre-accession strategy for the associated states by means of a new instrument, accession <Col N="993" /> partnerships, which are to be elaborated with each of the ten associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  A new multilateral forum, the European Conference, involving member states and associated states is also proposed.  The meeting of the European Council to be held in Luxembourg in December is expected to take decisions on the launching of enlargement negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 package also deals with the financing priorities of the Union from the year 2000 to the year 2006, during which period the first wave of further enlargement is set to take place, and it addresses in that context the development of existing EU policies including the Structural Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>What is involved at this stage are Commission proposals.  It will only be at a much later stage, after lengthy negotiations in the Council with key decisions to be taken at the level of the European Council, that the present proposals can be translated into the precise level of funding for each member state.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to the process of further enlargement which is in the interests of the European Union as a whole.  In the course of the enlargement negotiations Ireland will, like every other member state, seek to protect and promote its own interests and to ensure that the consequences of enlargement apply in a balanced way to existing member states.</P>
    <P>The scale of the enlargement now contemplated is without precedent and will have significant implications for the future of the Union.  It will be essential in the enlargement process to preserve what the Union has achieved thus far and the very features of the Union and its policies which have made it so attractive to prospective new members.</P>
    <P>The financial framework proposed by the Commission for the post-1999 period, which remains to be examined in detail, is based on an annual ceiling for Community expenditure of the equivalent of 1.27 per cent of the combined GNP of the member states.  This is the same level as already provided for 1999, but the formula allows for expansion in line with growth of Community GNP.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has already been subject to extensive reform.  That process of reform, the so-called MacSharry reforms, is set to continue.  It is in Ireland's long-term interests that European agriculture should become more competitive on world markets and be developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  However, it must also be done in a way which ensures that the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy are preserved, that the interests of all member states are taken into account in a balanced way and, above all, that the interests of farmers and rural communities are fully protected.</P>
    <P>As far as the Structural and Cohesion Funds are concerned, the Government's aim will be to <Col N="994" /> ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland and to maximise receipts in the next funding round.</P>
    <P>As regards the Structural Funds, the Commission proposes that a transitional period will be necessary where eligibility criteria have been overtaken and that there should be no abrupt withdrawal in funding.  Any transitional arrangements for Ireland must be adequate in terms of the level and time-frame of funding so as to address our continuing significant development needs.  We will therefore be arguing very forcefully that the principle recognised by the Commission must be given effect throughout the next funding period in a way which fully addresses our needs.</P>
    <P>The thrust of our argument will be that arrangements during the next funding period from 2000 to 2006 should ensure that the purpose of the Structural Funds under Objective 1 is met fully and in a sustainable way.  It is important to recall that the purpose of the Structural Funds under Objective 1 is to help certain regions to catch up with the Community average and to maintain a higher level of prosperity on a sustained basis.  While we have made rapid progress towards the EU average in GDP terms, we will, in view of our substantial remaining development needs, require significant levels of funding for the period ahead if we are to consolidate our economic progress.  Our aim is to reach a situation in which our higher levels of prosperity are copperfastened on a permanent and sustainable basis.</P>
    <P>Subject to these considerations, the Government view the Agenda 2000 proposals as representing overall a clear and coherent framework for addressing the challenges which Europe faces in the years ahead.  Of course, like every other member state, we will seek to protect our interests in the forthcoming negotiations and to ensure that the consequences of enlargement apply in a balanced way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been significant increases in Ireland's official development assistance in recent years. Since 1992 the budget has increased from £40 million which was equivalent to 0.16 per cent of GNP to £122 million this year which will be equivalent to 0.31 per cent of GNP.  In other words the allocation has more than trebled in volume over a five year period.  The present Government is committed to making steady progress in Irish ODA towards achieving the UN recommended target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  Specifically, we are committed to having the Irish aid budget reach 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002.</P>
      <P>The increase in budget has enabled us to develop programmes in new countries -Ethiopia and Uganda were established as priority countries for Irish aid in 1994 and Mozambique became a priority country in 1996.  In addition the programmes in our existing countries &mdash; Lesotho, Tanzania and Zambia &mdash; were expanded.  The first priority of Irish aid is to provide assistance to poorer developing countries; this assistance is designed to meet basic needs with an emphasis on poverty reduction and to contribute to long-term economic and social development.  There is also an emphasis that assistance provided is both targeted and cost effective.</P>
      <P>Ireland's bilateral aid programme also places particular emphasis on fostering democracy and respect for human rights.  It recognises the need to address the causes of conflict and human disaster before they occur.  The increase in the ODA budget has allowed Irish aid to support projects in the areas of human rights, building up democracy and rehabilitation of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expansion in Irish aid has given Ireland a stronger voice in the multilateral development arena.  We have continued to support the work of <Col N="996" /> the UN agencies and efforts to restructure their organisations to become more effective and responsive.  Within the European Union, Ireland plays an active role in the formulation of EU policy towards developing countries.  A particular concern for Ireland will be to ensure the Union's special relationship with the countries of sub-Saharan Africa is maintained.</P>
    <P>Irish aid enjoys a particularly close and fruitful partnership with the development non-governmental organisations.  The part of the Irish aid budget channelled through NGOs has been increasing both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the increasing aid budget.  In 1996, total expenditure through NGOs amounted to £17.32 million equivalent to 15 per cent of total ODA.  This compares with a figure of £3.39 million, 8 per cent of total ODA in 1992.  This increase is a reflection of the positive collaboration between Irish aid and NGOs.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue to work closely with the NGOs in a spirit of genuine partnership and dialogue so that we can work together to improve the quality and effectiveness of the Irish aid programme.</P>

Such an occurrence would be a particularly grave matter.  However, I have seen no evidence substantiating these reports.

The Russian Government has also reiterated that all of its nuclear weapons remain under its control.  I have no reason to doubt these assurances.</P>

      <P>The Government attaches the greatest importance to developing North-South co-operation.  I intend to actively pursue this policy at every opportunity, in particular through the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and in the context of the three-stranded negotiations on which we are now embarking.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office, I have discussed the importance of North-South economic and social co-operation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the Minister of State, Adam Ingram, MP, who has special responsibility for this area.  At a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 18 July, while noting the significant co-operation already taking place, we affirmed our intention to look at ways in which this could be further built on.  Discussions are continuing at official level with a view to identifying areas which could be considered in more detail within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
      <P>There are significant financial resources available to assist the further development of North-South economic co-operation.  Should additional resources be required to meet new opportunities or changing circumstances, the Government will look positively at any proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the longer term, of course, the launch of the substantive three-stranded negotiations opens up the prospect of a strong North-South body invested with the necessary powers to maximise the potential for mutual co-operation between the two parts of the island.  We are a small island with relatively few natural resources.  It makes no sense not to do all we can to harness our collective energies and resources in the service of the <Col N="998" /> common good.  There is also the point that a strong North-South body will allow Northern nationalists the chance to share with unionists the sense that their aspirations and identity are reflected in the governance and administration of their home place.</P>

Following technical discussions with Irish officials, the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced on 18 September that the Russian authorities had agreed to lift the ban on beef from Wexford and that there would be a further review of the situation regarding BSE next January.  This is a welcome development and represents the first easing of the restrictions which have been in place since November 1996.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seriously concerned at the continued plight of political detainees and the unacceptable <Col N="999" /> lack of due process in the case of the Ogoni 19 which are disappointingly indicative of the human rights situation and the pace and manner of the transition to democratic rule in Nigeria.</P>
    <P>In my address to the 52nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly last Thursday I raised these concerns about the abuse of human rights in Nigeria.  At the session, Ireland and our EU partners continued to express our dissatisfaction with the slow pace of transition to democratic government in Nigeria and the human rights situation.  We also called on the Nigerian authorities to ensure full respect for human rights and the rule of law including the review of all cases of political prisoners and persons detained without charge.  The General Affairs Council, in its Conclusions of 2 June 1997 has expressly renewed its appeal to the Nigerian authorities for the release of all political prisoners and for the holding of free and fair elections leading to a civilian government.</P>
    <P>While noting some potentially positive developments, the Council remained profoundly concerned about the overall situation and did not consider that sufficient progress had been made to warrant the removal of EU restrictive measures against Nigeria.  Consequently these measures were extended by the Council for a further six month period.  The Government strongly supported their retention as a measure of our continuing concern about the Ogoni 19, other political detainees and the many unresolved human rights and democratisation issues in Nigeria. The extended EU restrictive measures include <i>inter alia</i> the suspension of military co-operation, visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian military or government and their families, the suspension of all high level visits, an arms embargo and the interruption of sporting contacts.</P>
    <P>While extending these measures, the Council also clearly signalled the Union's commitment to engaging in a constructive dialogue with the Nigerian authorities as well as to supporting civil society.  Although it is not yet clear if the Nigerian Government will be receptive to this offer of dialogue, Ireland and our European partners are continuing our efforts to ensure that they remain fully conscious of our serious concerns.  Earlier this month, EU heads of mission in Lagos met with the President of Nigeria's newly established National Commission for Human Rights.  This follows previous demarches which have been made by the Union to the Nigerian authorities.</P>
    <P>At last April's 53rd Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights Ireland, as a current member of the Commission, strongly supported an EU-sponsored Resolution on Nigeria. This Resolution, which was adopted on 15 April, has sent a clear signal from the international community to the Abuja authorities by deciding to appoint a special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Nigeria.  It called on the Nigerian authorities to release all political prisoners, <Col N="1000" /> trade union leaders, human rights advocates and journalists currently detained.</P>
    <P>The Nigerian authorities are being kept fully aware of the stance of Ireland and our EU partners regarding the case of the Ogoni 19, political detainees and the overall human rights situation in their country.  The Government will continue to take all appropriate measures in support of an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the Rule of law in Nigeria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 48, 54 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has been monitoring closely the serious humanitarian crisis in North Korea where a situation of chronic food shortages has been exacerbated by severe flooding in the last two years followed by drought.</P>
      <P>The Government has, in the past year, given a total of £615,000 in emergency assistance for North Korea.  This assistance was channelled through the United Nations World Food Programme and through Trócaire and its sister agency Caritas Hong Kong.  A further grant of £100,000 was approved this week to supply emergency food aid.</P>
      <P>The international response up to now has been good.  The two appeals issued so far by the World Food Programme have been almost fully funded. The European Commission has donated 56.7 million ECU, mainly through the World Food Programme.  However, it is estimated that 70 per cent of the harvest due next month has been destroyed by drought and North Korea will face severe food shortages this winter.  Ireland has suggested that the situation be further discussed at the next Food Aid Committee meeting in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> We share the view that, if a measure of food security is to be assured in the future, the serious underlying structural problems in the agricultural sector in North Korea must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be appropriate for an Irish Minister to visit North Korea at this time.  It is the agreed approach of EU member states to keep such contacts to a minimum while encouraging a positive stance by North Korea in the ongoing four-party talks process.  However, my Department is considering sending a technical mission in the near future to monitor the impact of our assistance and to assess future needs.  We have been following developments continuously and been in close touch with international organisations and NGOs such as Trócaire which have visited North Korea in the recent past.  We will also continue to work closely with all of these agencies in seeking to assist the North Korean people in whatever way we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 15th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party took place in Beijing from 12 to 18 September.</P>
      <P>The Party Congress meets every five years.  It is primarily concerned with the internal political affairs of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The principal focus of interest at the 15th Congress was the keynote address of the Party's Secretary General, Jiang Zemin, on 12 September which set out the policy guidelines for the next five years and unveiled wide ranging proposals for the reform and modernisation of China's state enterprise system.  He also clearly reaffirmed China's commitment to continued economic reform.</P>
      <P>In his speech, President Jiang furthermore promised to expand recent experiments in local democracy, to strengthen the rule of law, to step up the fight against corruption and to reduce China's armed forces by 500,000 over the next three years.</P>
      <P>The Congress also elected a new central committee which in turn elected a new political bureau and a seven member standing committee. The central committee also re-elected Jiang Zemin as General Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be premature at this early date to offer a definitive assessment of the 15th Party Congress.  It is clear that the economic reform process initiated by Deng Xiaoping will continue through the reform and restructuring of China's state enterprise system and the development of what is termed a market-led socialist economy. This commitment is to be welcomed by all who wish to see China realise its huge potential as a major world economy.  Strengthening of the rule <Col N="1002" /> of law and extension of local democracy are also features to be warmly welcomed as an indication of the Communist Party's recognition of the importance of political reform.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to follow with close interest political and economic developments in China in particular the implementation of the policy commitments outlined at the 15th Party Congress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 73, 74 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>I attach the greatest importance to the full implementation of the Middle East Peace Process in accordance with the Oslo Agreement of September 1993.  It was, accordingly, with considerable dismay that I noted the gradual slowing down of the process since early this year.  Continued Israeli settlement activity in East Jerusalem, the closure of the border between Israel and the Palestinian administered territories, and the refusal by Israel to reimburse the Palestinian authority taxes collected on its behalf following the recent terrorist atrocities &mdash; which I have condemned &mdash; effectively brought the process to a standstill by last month.</P>
      <P>At the UN last week, I drew attention in my statement to the general assembly to the dangers arising from the current impasse in the peace process and the need for all the parties to put the process back on track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In bilateral discussions with the US Secretary of State, and with the Egyptian and Jordanian Foreign Ministers, and with others, I reiterated <Col N="1003" /> the commitment of the Government to continue to work, together with our EU partners, for the re-activation of the peace process.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that the discussions to which both sides agreed during the recent visit of the US Secretary of State will shortly take place. If these are approached in the right spirit the process can be re-activated in the near future.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and I met with the Palestinian delegate general in early July.  A senior official of my Department paid a visit to the region earlier this month when he met with representatives of both sides, including members of the Palestinian authority in East Jerusalem.  I will continue to monitor the evolution of the situation and to encourage both sides to advance the process as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>At the General Affairs Council on 15 September, the Council considered the current state of the peace process, including the economic consequences of Israel's recent actions.  The Commission identified some 4 million ecu which could be used to assist the Palestinian authority in the wake of the Israeli refusal to reimburse the Palestinian tax revenues.</P>
    <P>A meeting of the EU Troika with the Israeli Foreign Minister took place last week <i>en marge</i> of the United Nation's General Assembly at New York.</P>
    <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the settlement policy of the Israeli Government and has availed of all appropriate opportunities to make known our concern.  Together with our partners in the EU we see further settlements as a clear and dangerous obstacle to the dialogue for peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>This assessment is shared not only by our European Union partners, but also by the wider international community.  This was clearly evidenced at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in July by the overwhelming vote, including Ireland's, in favour of a resolution which recommended that UN members actively discourage activities which contribute to Israeli settlement-building in the occupied territories including Jerusalem.  Together with our EU partners we will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="1004" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to be concerned about the political and human rights situation in Kenya.  This concern has been heightened by recent outbreaks of violence and fatilities which have underlined the danger of civil strife in Kenya.  The EU has strongly condemned such acts of violence in its Declaration of 13 August 1997.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, a general election is expected to take place in Kenya in the near future although a final date has yet to be announced by the authorities.  In anticipation of these elections, the EU and other international donors have been engaged in efforts to ensure a free and fair electoral process with full regard for human rights and the rule of law.  The EU has strongly stated its position on the creation of such an open political climate in Kenya in its statement to last April's 53rd Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  Last week, while attending the 52nd session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, I was able to join our EU partners in reiterating our strong support for early electoral and constitutional reform in Kenya, as stated in the Union's memorandum to the Assembly.</P>
      <P>The EU has already raised its concerns directly with the Kenyan Government.  Through its participation in the international Donors Democratic Development Group in Nairobi, the Union has also raised them jointly with like-minded countries such as the United States, Canada and Japan.  The Government strongly supports this approach and the fact that these concerns are being pursued by the Union, as a potential provider of electoral observers and support, with the Kenyan authorities on an ongoing basis.  The main elements in the approach are: full access to the ballot and voter registration; full access by parties to the electorate; access to information and the media; and freedom of assembly.</P>
      <P>An inter-party parliamentary group recently agreed a legislative reform package.  This, if implemented, will be a significant step towards the removal of legal impediments to freedom of movement and assembly.  While I welcome this development and the undertakings for further reforms which have been taken, much will depend on the manner in which the Government of Kenya and the opposition respond to this package in concrete terms over the coming weeks. Along with our European partners, the Government will be monitoring developments closely with a view to ensuring that real progress is made towards the holding of free and fair elections under the aegis of an independent national electoral commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will continue to maintain pressure, both bilaterally and in co-operation with our EU partners, on the Kenyan authorities to intensify the democratic process taking full account of the concerns which have been expressed about the role of the Kenyan police. <Col N="1005" /> In so doing, we will adhere to the principles of meaningful participation by all parties, civil society and the electorate in that process with full regard for human rights and the rule of law.</P>

      <P>The Vienna Declaration of the Council of Europe, adopted in October 1993 by European Heads of State and Government, initiated a major reform of the role and activities of the Council of Europe and its subsidiary organs as part of a new institutional framework for postcommunist Europe.</P>
      <P>The declaration assigned new political tasks to the Council of Europe in consolidating democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in the new democracies of central and eastern Europe.  It also proposed reform of the European Court of Human Rights, recommending replacement of the existing European Commission and Court of Human Rights by a single court, to enable cases to be processed more speedily.</P>
      <P>The programme of reform arising from the Vienna Summit is ongoing.  A second Summit of Heads of State and Government is to take place in Strasbourg on 10-11 October 1997.  The purpose of this meeting is to review the progress made to date in fulfilling the obligations undertaken at Vienna; to assess the impact of recent enlargement on the work of the organization; and to provide clear direction for strengthening further the role, priorities and functions of the organization in the new Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The serious food shortages which have arisen in North Korea have implications for the political and economic stability of the entire Korean peninsula. To the best of our knowledge, famine conditions do not currently exist in North Korea but malnutrition is believed to be widespread and any failure of this year's harvest could have catastrophic consequences.  The Government has already made available £615,000 to the World Food Programme and to Trócaire &mdash; and its sister agency Caritas Hong Kong &mdash; for the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of North Korea.  A further grant of £100,000 was approved this week to supply emergency food aid.  Much credit must be given to those agencies who have visited the affected areas and set up relief operations. We shall continue to monitor the situation very closely and we are prepared to give further assistance to suitable projects to help meet the urgent needs of those most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since its inception as a state following the Second World War, North Korea has adopted an aggressive and militaristic stance towards much of the outside world. Although the Korean War came to an end in 1953, a formal peace treaty between the belligerents in that war has yet to be concluded.  Talks aimed at such a settlement took place in New York earlier this month and involved representatives from both parts of Korea, the United States and China.  The parties were, however, unable to agree on an agenda to permit formal peace negotiations to commence.  It would appear that the latest impasse has arisen as a result of the continued demand by North Korea for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and for the signing of a separate peace treaty between itself and the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government continues to hope that an agreement between the parties may still be possible and that formal peace talks can commence as <Col N="1007" /> planned in Geneva before the end of this year.  It is clear, however, that the intransigence of the North Korean side must be recognised as the major obstacle preventing such an agreement being reached at the present time.</P>

On my instructions the republican prisoners received consular visits from an official of our embassy in London between 21 and 25 July 1997.  The Deputy will be aware that there have been some recent improvements in the situation of prisoners who were previously classified as exceptional risk and held in the special secure units.  Their classification has been revised downward and they are now entitled to receive open family visits.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware of continuing concerns expressed by the prisoners and their relatives particularly with regard to the situation of those on remand who remain in a special secure unit at Belmarsh prison.  For this reason, an Embassy official visited Belmarsh, Whitemoor and Full Sutton prisons at the end of last week.  On the basis of his report, these concerns will be pursued as appropriate with the relevant British authorities. A further round of consular visits to all republican prisoners will take place in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the transfer of republican prisoners to this jurisdiction is one which is accorded high priority by the Government and which I have also raised in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The Government have consistently supported the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families and this view has been made clear to the British authorities. We have repeatedly made clear to the British authorities that we stand ready to receive <Col N="1008" /> republican prisoners transferred under the provisions of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
    <P>Since the coming into effect of this Convention in Ireland on 1 November 1995 six republican prisoners have been transferred to this jurisdiction. Under its terms transfers from Britain to this jurisdiction involve the consent of the person concerned, of the Home Office in Britain, and of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We have emphasised our view that transfer applications ought to be processed as quickly as possible.  I would hope that a number of transfers, which are currently awaiting the consent of the Home Secretary, can take place in the near future.  The Deputy will appreciate that, under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, responsibility for the implementation of the Convention lies with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to monitor the status of individual prisoners' requests for transfer and their other humanitarian concerns.</P>

The press section in my Department is currently staffed by four permanent civil servants and my adviser will work with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is firmly committed to the establishment of an international criminal court to prosecute violations of international humanitarian laws.  This commitment has been reiterated on many occasions in the various relevant fora, including at the UN General Assembly.  Ireland recognises that there is a growing acceptance throughout the international community that violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security. In the light of the proliferation of heinous offences in the world, Ireland feels that the case for the establishment of a permanent international criminal court is stronger than ever.  It is only through such a body that the international community can effectively demonstrate that massive human rights violations must never go unpunished.</P>
      <P>President Clinton's recent statement at the United Nations General Assembly calling for the establishment of a permanent international court is therefore to be greatly welcomed.</P>
      <P>Ireland has participated actively at the several meetings of the preparatory committee which has been set up to discuss the establishment of an international criminal court; and it is intended that Ireland will participate at the diplomatic conference to be held in 1998 which will be charged with finalising and adopting a convention establishing an international criminal court.</P>
      <P>Ireland has supported the principle that the court should be independent, in particular from non-legal and non-judicial considerations, and that its prosecutor should be able to investigate all cases free from political pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, certain practical reservations to be taken into account with regard to giving the power to bring cases before the court <Col N="1011" /> to individuals and non-governmental organisations. Such an approach could discourage a large number of states from becoming party to the convention which will eventually establish the court. From a pragmatic point of view, the widest possible level of ratification of the convention is necessary to ensure the success of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that two official-level committees which deal with human rights issues have been established this year, under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights held its inaugural meeting on 18 February and met again on 17 July.  Meeting approximately quarterly, the committee is mandated to consider all aspects of Ireland's international human rights obligations.  It is particularly concerned with ensuring the timely preparation of comprehensive national reports under the various international instruments already ratified and with expediting the legislation necessary for the ratification of additional instruments.  I should add in the latter regard that I am keen to see the United Nations Conventions on Torture and the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination ratified as soon as possible. The preparatory work for this is under way in the Department concerned.  The committee will play a useful role in expediting these ratifications and as a forum for co-ordination and co-operation between Departments on human rights issues generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second new committee is the Joint Department of Foreign Affairs/NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights.  This Committee had its inaugural meeting on 11 June and met again on 17 September.  The committee provides a formal framework for a regular exchange of views between my Department and representatives of the NGO community.  I know that successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs have found the contribution of Irish NGOs on human rights issues extremely valuable.  The placing of the network of contacts on a more formal footing by establishing this committee was, therefore, a logical and very worthwhile step and will be of considerable value both to myself and to my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for Human Rights, Deputy O'Donnell.  The committee has already had a number of useful discussions and has charted an intensive programme of work for itself, covering a wide range of topics. At this important time for human rights internationally, as Mrs. Mary Robinson assumes her <Col N="1012" /> post as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and as we approach the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I am delighted to have the expertise and experience of the NGO community and independent experts available to us in this new way.</P>
    <P>I should add, of course, that ongoing, informal contacts on human rights matters between NGOs and the various Divisions of my Department continue and have, in no sense, been replaced or restricted by the establishment of the Committee. Moreover, to ensure the fullest utilization of the experience of the broader NGO community, we intend to hold an Annual NGO Forum on Human Rights to which all interested organisations will be invited.  We propose to hold the first of these in advance of the next Annual Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which takes place in March 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been significant progress in recent years in relations between the European Union and Asia.  The Union now has ongoing institutionalised dialogues with many Asian countries. The establishment of ASEM, Asia-Europe Meeting, has been a major factor in the development of closer relations between the participating European and Asian countries.  The very successful inaugural summit meeting of ASEM in Bangkok on 1-2 March 1996 was attended by almost all the Heads of State or Government of the 15 EU member states and the President of the Commission on the European side, and of the seven ASEAN, Association of South East Asian Nations, member states and China, Japan and Korea on the Asian side.</P>
      <P>This summit established a new comprehensive Asia-Europe partnership aimed at strengthening links between Asia and Europe to promote peace, global stability and prosperity.  The partnership is to be specifically forged through fostering political dialogue, the reinforcement of economic co-operation, and the promotion of co-operation in the cultural and social fields.  The Bangkok meeting established an extensive list of follow-up activities, mainly in the economic area, and various additional follow-up actions have been proposed.  This is a welcome reflection of the interest and enthusiasm which ASEM has generated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first ASEM Senior Officials Meeting, SOM, following the Bangkok Summit took place in Dublin last December under the Irish EU Presidency.  This prepared the way for the ASEM <Col N="1013" /> Foreign Ministers meeting which was held in Singapore in February of this year.  Ireland has therefore been centrally involved in the ASEM process from the beginning and it is my intention to ensure that Ireland maintains and develops its profile in the ASEM process, which is of great importance to relations between Europe and Asia, and to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The second ASEM summit which will be held in London on 3-4 April 1998 will bring together at the level of the Heads of State or Government the representatives of all the participating states, including Ireland.  It will offer us the opportunity to meet with the leaders of the participating Asian countries and thus continue to improve our relations with these very important partners.  It is my intention to attend the meeting of Foreign Ministers to be held on the eve of the summit.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recently launched ASEM, the EU-ASEAN relationship has been developing for over twenty years.  Regular meetings take place between the foreign Ministers of the two organisations to provide for an exchange of views on a wide range of political, security economic and other issues of mutual concern. The latest such meeting was held in Singapore on 13-14 February of this year.</P>
    <P>Bilaterally, Ireland maintains close ties with many of the nations in the region.  In addition to our resident embassies in New Delhi, Canberra, Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul, there is now an embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and we have established diplomatic relations with a number of other countries on a non-residential basis.  Senior officials of my Department and our Ambassadors in Asia met last February in Singapore to review our profile in Asia and see how the interest and image of Ireland might best be further promoted, particularly in the economic field.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question refers to the meetings I had with US political leaders during the course of my visit to New York and Washington last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a reception hosted by President Clinton on the evening of Sunday, 21 September 1997, for visiting Heads of Delegation to the UN General Assembly, I had the opportunity to convey to the President the Government's deep appreciation of his strong and continuing support for the peace process.  The President reiterated his dedicated commitment to the process and his determination to support the all-party talks in every way possible.  He said he attached high priority to achieving a lasting settlement to the Northern Ireland problem.  In a subsequent address to the assembled Heads of Delegation, <Col N="1014" /> the President spoke of the importance of finding a solution to the troubles &ldquo;in the land of my ancestors&rdquo; I thanked the President for his encouragement of, and support for, the restoration of the IRA ceasefire and for continuing to act as a friend to all sides in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also had an opportunity at the reception to have discussions with the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger.  I invited the Secretary of State to visit Ireland at a convenient time, an invitation which she was very pleased to accept.</P>
    <P>In the course of my visit to Washington, I had separate meetings with Senators Edward Kennedy and Connie Mack; with Congressman Harold Rogers, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee on Justice and State, and Congressman Charles Schumer.  The latter two meetings were specifically concerned with visa issues. In addition, I met the Friends of Ireland and the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on Irish Affairs, chaired by Congressman Ben Gilman, the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee and Co-Chairman of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee.</P>
    <P>I also had a meeting at the White House with the National Security Adviser, in which we reviewed the recent encouraging developments in the peace process and discussed how best to achieve further progress.  We also discussed the appointment of Mr. James M. Lyons as special adviser to the President for economic initiatives on Ireland, an appointment which I warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>The ambassador also hosted a dinner in Washington at which I had the opportunity to brief some leading Members of Congress, including Senators Dodd and Leahy, and members of the media, including the executive editor of the Washington Post, on current issues, in particular in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In New York I hosted a dinner for some senior friends of Ireland in the community, and met the Immigration Liaison Committee.  I also had discussions in their offices with both Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki.</P>

      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the situation in East Timor.  I expressed our concerns in my address last week to the 52nd session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the EU Common Position <Col N="1015" /> on East Timor which was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 25 June 1996, Ireland actively supports international efforts to promote respect for human rights and to bring about a just and peaceful solution to the East Timor question which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.</P>
    <P>The Government supports the current talks between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Annan.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that the latest meeting, the ninth round, last June in New York was constructive and led to agreement on a new framework to continue more frequent discussions at a nonministerial level.  Agreement was also reached to have an open agenda, to include such subjects as military questions, migration, human rights and &ldquo;timorisation&rdquo; of the regime in the territory.  The first of these lower level meetings took place on 4-8 August.</P>
    <P>The Government also supports the decision by the two Foreign Ministers to continue the intraTimorese dialogue between broadly pro-independence and pro-integration groups.  I understand that the third in this series of meetings is to take place next month in Austria.</P>
    <P>Ireland co-sponsored the resolution on the &ldquo;Situation on Human Rights in East Timor&rdquo; which was adopted at the Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva in April of this year.  This resolution calls on the Government of Indonesia to take the necessary measures to ensure full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of East Timor as well as to ensure the early release of East Timorese detained or convicted for political reasons.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that the appointment of the UN Special Envoy for East Timor, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker, and the work he has already done should provide a new impetus towards a peaceful and just solution to the situation in East Timor.</P>
    <P>The two East Timor leaders, Bishop Belo and Mr. Ramos-Horta, have both been received on separate visits in my Department in the recent past.  The Government will continue to monitor the situation in East Timor very closely and to play an active role, particularly within the European Union, in the seeking of a solution to the plight of the people of East Timor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The municipal elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina which were held on 13 and 14 September, having been postponed twice last year, must be seen as a significant achievement when viewed in <Col N="1016" /> the light of frequently imperfect local conditions and the present stage of the peace process.  They went ahead on this occasion despite threats of boycott from two of the major parties.  These threats were withdrawn because of the strong stance of the international community.</P>
      <P>The international community had entrusted the OSCE with the task of supervising the preparations and the running of the elections.  This required the provision of considerable financial and personnel resources by the international community to the OSCE and Ireland made a significant contribution in this regard, including some 80 election observers and IR£150,000.</P>
      <P>The elections provided the citizens of Bosnia and Hercegovina, including refugees and displaced persons, with the opportunity to reassert their rights in their original home localities, and to voice their rejection of ethnic cleansing.</P>
      <P>Although the elections had to be held in a difficult, post-conflict situation, the experience of the general elections of 1996 led to the establishment of new electoral rolls with stringent registration procedures in order to combat fraud.  In addition, political parties found guilty of offences against the new rules and regulations were penalized; polling hours were extended and the number of polling stations reduced so that international supervisors could be present throughout the period in the maximum number of locations.</P>
      <P>The large number of citizens who re-registered and the very high turnout for the polls right across the country reflected the wish of the citizens to exercise their fundamental democratic right.  The fact that the elections passed off without any major incident must be attributed in part to the effective security measures put in place by SFOR, but also reflected the wish of the electorate that the elections be carried out in a peaceful and orderly way.  The large number of new parties and politicial alliances which participated is evidence of a serious attempt to escape from the monolithic ethnic blocks, thereby offering a possibility of more democratic political activity in the future.</P>
      <P>The elections were held in 135 municipalities and the votes are still being counted in a central location, in what I understand is an especially meticulous but lengthy process.  This means that it will be some time before the final results are available, and even longer before they are all certified. It may also be expected that the implementation of the results in some locations may require particular efforts, including the support of the international community.</P>
      <P>While there should be no illusions about the work still to be accomplished across a broad spectrum of areas, the installation of duly elected local government is an indispensable part of the process to restore democratic institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, the fact that other key aspects of the Dayton Agreements remain largely unimplemented &mdash; notably the establishment of conditions which will permit the return of refugees and the bringing to justice of indicted war <Col N="1017" /> criminals &mdash; means that the international presence in Bosnia and Hercegovina is likely to need to be extended beyond next year if the current peace is to be maintained.</P>

      <P>The Government believes it is essential that the United Nations system be modernised so that it can more effectively face the complex and difficult challenges in the coming millennium, particularly in fulfilling the major objectives of the UN charter, namely to secure international peace and security and to promote the economic and social development of all member states.</P>
      <P>The main objective of this effort must be to have a UN system which is revitalised, more coherent in purpose and more co-ordinated in its activities, and which has set itself clear and key priorities for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU has developed its position on reform of the UN, and has made a substantial set of proposals for renewing the activities of the UN in the economic and development sector, an area of <Col N="1018" /> particular interest to poorer developing countries. Ireland fully supports these proposals.  They include such suggestions as a new Deputy Secretary-General to oversee the reform process in this area, a more unified and better co-ordinated UN presence and activity in developing countries, an amalgamation of the departments responsible for development programmes in the UN Headquarters in New York, a better pooling of resources and expertise among the various UN programmes to ensure a better impact of these on the ground in developing countries, and a more prioritised and coherent approach system wide by the various UN agencies in tackling poverty reduction and underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note that many of these proposals were taken up in the comprehensive package of reform measures drawn up by the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and presented to the UN General Assembly on 16 July last.</P>
    <P>In my statement to the UN General Assembly last week I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the modernisation of the UN and pledged our full support for the reform proposals of the Secretary-General, as a fair and balanced compromise between different approaches of member states on the reform process.  Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners in seeking the agreement of all member states of the UN for implementing these proposals to modernise and revitalise the UN system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The major recent development in regard to Cyprus was the start of the process of direct talks between the leaders of the two communities on the island with the objective of seeking an overall political solution to the Cyprus question.  This process was established under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General.  Two sessions of meetings have taken place between the two leaders, in July in New York and in August in Glion, Switzerland.</P>
      <P>There has not as yet been any substantive progress in the talks process.  At the August session in Switzerland, Mr. Denktash, the Turkish-Cypriot leader, indicated an unwillingness to continue the process further until he had received an undertaking that the intended EU-Cyprus negotiations on accession to the EU be postponed. However the General Affairs Council on 15 September reaffirmed that there could be no link between face-to-face talks on Cyprus and the start of the accession negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Cyprus, Mr. Diego Cordovez, is currently in contact with both leaders with a view to agreeing a resumption of the direct talks process in early <Col N="1019" /> 1998, after the period of Presidential elections in Cyprus later this year.</P>
    <P>Another recent and welcome development has been the agreement reached between the two leaders, following an initiative by the United States, to hold direct talks in Cyprus on the important issue of security arrangements in respect of both communities.</P>
    <P>During my visit to the UN General Assembly in New York last week, I had the opportunity to meet with the Foreign Minister of Cyprus.  Mr. Kassoulides and with the Turkish Foreign Minister Mr. Cem.  On both occasions I recalled Ireland's particular interest, underlined by our longstanding participation in UN peacekeeping in Cyprus, in seeing a political and peaceful comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity in my discussion with Foreign Minister Kassoulides to stress that Ireland and her EU partners wished to see the direct talks process between the leaders of the two communities come to a successful conclusion. In recalling the decision of the EU to begin accession negotiations with Cyprus, I mentioned that there was a clear wish on the part of the EU to see a united Cyprus accede to the Union.  Foreign Minister Kassoulides assured me that his Government was fully committed to the talks process and its success.</P>
    <P>I also made clear that both communities on the island, and in particular the Turkish-Cypriot community, would benefit greatly from accession to the Union.  In response to my suggestion that it was also important that representatives of the Turkish-Cypriot community participate in the accession negotiations, the Foreign Minister assured me that he agreed with this and confirmed that a formal proposal to this effect had been made by President Clerides to Mr. Denktash.</P>
    <P>During my meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister I raised the Cyprus issue and repeated our interest in seeing a final political settlement. I underlined the importance the Government attaches to supporting the UN sponsored talks process and its wish to see a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>I also stressed that the prospect of accession by Cyprus to the European Union offers a real and unique opportunity to achieve a just settlement, and that accession would be of particular benefit to the Turkish-Cypriot community.</P>
    <P>I asked Foreign Minister Cem to help ensure that the Turkish Government uses its influence with Mr. Denktash to secure a positive and constructive approach to the talks process.  Mr. Cem indicated in reply that whilst there were considerable difficulties in the way of a solution, Turkey also wished to see a peaceful settlement to the Cyprus question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office, I have met many of our ambassadors.  On 1 September, I addressed a Heads of Mission Conference in Dublin and set out the Government's priorities in foreign policy. This conference was also attended by representatives of the State's promotional agencies who participated in a discussion of how our diplomatic <Col N="1021" /> missions and the agencies can co-operate most effectively to promote Ireland's economic interests.</P>
      <P>As part of the normal process of managing the Department, the Secretary General, assisted by the management advisory committee, monitors and reviews the work of our missions on a continuing basis to ensure that staff and other resources abroad are utilized as effectively as possible.  In addition, the inspection unit in my Department, headed by an assistant secretary, carried out detailed reviews of the work of missions abroad.  So far in 1997, the inspection unit has reviewed the work of four missions and a further three inspections are scheduled to take place before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>It is clear to me that the principal strength of our diplomatic service is the commitment and dedication of our staff.  Embassies are an important resource for the conduct and deepening of our relations with the countries to which they are accredited and this, in turn, supports the pursuit of our international objectives.  The access our missions have to their host Governments enables us to develop influential links and contacts with political, economic and media figures to promote Irish interests and concerns.  Equally important is their work in providing consular care and assistance to Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The principal weakness of our diplomatic network is its small size.  With the exception of Luxembourg, we have the smallest diplomatic service in the European Union.  Most of our missions have only one or two diplomatic officers which means they must cover a wide range of activities with very limited staff resources.  There are also regional gaps in our overseas representation &mdash; for example, we have only one mission in the whole of South America.</P>
      <P>I will give consideration to the disposition of our diplomatic network and to ensuring that we use our diplomatic resources overseas to best effect in the coming months.</P>

      <P>In the case of former Yugoslavia, full co-operation with the Hague Tribunal by all parties to the peace agreements, in the effort to bring war criminals to justice, is a fundamental obligation which must be honoured if genuine stability and lasting peace are to be consolidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As specified in the peace agreements, it is primarily <Col N="1022" /> the responsibility of the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to ensure that indicted persons are handed over to the tribunal. The Government has availed, and will continue to avail, of every opportunity to press these governments to fulfil their obligations towards the Hague Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Our EU partners fully share our concern about the need for the parties to co-operate with the Hague Tribunal.  For that reason, the issue has been kept at the top of the EU's agenda both in dialogue with the countries in question, and also in the context of international conferences concerned with the peace process.  Co-operation by the parties with the tribunal has been made a key political condition in the EU's regional approach, which will govern any and every improvement in relations with the countries involved.</P>

New certification requirements were agreed relatively quickly and the trade resumed.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 83 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>Along with our partners in the European Union, we are deeply concerned at the situation in Haiti.  In a statement on 2 July of this year, the EU reacted to the indefinite adjournment of the second round of the political elections in Haiti and the resignation of the Government of Prime Minister Rosny Smarth by expressing the strong hope that the Haitian people would be able to express their wishes in free, honest and transparent elections.  These elections must offer citizens the widest range of opinions and choices in accordance with rules and procedures accepted by all.</P>
      <P>On 4 April 1997, Haiti and the European Community signed a National Indicative programme of Community aid for the preiod 1995-2000. Under this programme, the Community intends to make available to Haiti an indicative allocation of ECU 148 million.  An initial tranche of 70 per cent or ECU 103.6 million became available immediately.  A second tranche will become available when about 80 per cent of the first tranche has been committed and after a review of the implementation of the indicative programme.</P>
      <P>Among agreed priorities for EU-Haiti development co-operation will be the promotion and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and also sustainable economic and social development, with a particular emphasis on human resources, especially gender issues and environmental issues.</P>
      <P>Aid from the European Community will be targeted on the following activities so as to assist in consolidating democracy in Haiti: reforms aimed at democratising the judicial system to enable all citizens to protect their rights; institution building with a view to making government more effective, notably by supporting the decentralization of public services so that they can be integrated into local development programmes; local development programmes involving local authorities, decentralised administration and civil society.</P>
      <P>Ireland participated in the preparation of the indicative programme and will continue to take an active part in the consideration of individual projects, especially those designed to support and strengthen democracy in Haiti.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to work to ensure active European Union support for the strengthening of the rule of law and the economic and social development of Haiti.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial volume of material has emerged recently which has cast the events of Bloody Sunday in a new light.  Much attention has focused on the civilian eyewitness statements which were recorded shortly after the events and which were published earlier this year by Mr. Don Mullan in <i>Eyewitness Bloody Sunday, the Truth.</i> The account of events as described in great detail and with compelling clarity by civilian eyewitnesses is dramatically at variance with that presented in the British Government's official version, presented by Lord Widgery in April 1972 in his report on the tribunal of inquiry.  Additionally, other information, some of which has been available for some time and some of which has only recently emerged, combined to support the version of events offered by the civilian eyewitnesses.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that care must be exercised in the use of the term &lsquo;new&rsquo; material.  In many crucial instances, it is the fact of the material being &lsquo;old&rsquo; which gives it its devastating force as a critique of the Widgery report.  Much of this material was in fact available at the time of the Widgery Tribunal, but was not considered properly by it.</P>
      <P>The material in question includes eyewitness accounts from 1972 and, more recently, the emergence of very significant archival material, fresh insights into the role and activity of the British Army at the time and new ballistics and medical evidence.  All of this, combined with a reexamination of the contents of the Widgery report itself, was considered in detail in the course of the Government's assessment of the new material prepared earlier this year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this assessment was handed over to the British authorities on 24 June last.  Since then, there has been ongoing contact between both sides through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I discussed the issue both at the Anglo-Irish Summit meeting of 3 July 1997 and at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference of 18 July last with the Secretary of State and was assured that there would be no undue delay by the British Government in giving their response to the emergence of the new material and our assessment of its significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to pursue this matter within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and that the Government will stay in contact with the relatives of the Bloody Sunday victims and others <Col N="1026" /> who have been involved in bringing the new material to light.</P>

      <P>I have seen certain press reports regarding the sentences announced by a court in Saudi Arabia in the case involving two UK citizens to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on a matter which is primarily one between two other states.  In addition it is not the practice to comment on the workings of the judicial system of another state.  However, I would point out that there is a requirement on states to ensure that all such actions are in conformity with international human rights norms.  In particular, I would refer in this context to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by consensus at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for 1998 have still to be negotiated but I am confident that the amount of money allocated to official development assistance in 1998 will show a substantial increase.  The action programme for the millennium has set the interim target that Ireland's official development assistance will reach 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002 on the way to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  The ODA allocation for 1998 will take the first step in the increase towards that target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on ODA in 1997 is expected to amount to £122 million which will be equivalent to 0.31 per cent of GNP.  Of this total, £78 million (almost 65 per cent) has been allocated for bilateral assistance and £39 million (32 per cent) for expenditure on multilateral assistance.  I intend that the main focus of Irish aid will continue to be bilateral assistance and that the focus on our priority country programmes will be maintained as the budget is increased.  Currently Ireland's bilateral aid programme concentrates on six priority countries: Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Mozambique.  Bilateral Assistance also comprises expenditure on emergency humanitarian relief, rehabilitation, human rights and democratisation projects as well as providing <Col N="1027" /> for a range of other schemes such as fellowships, development education and the NGO cofinancing scheme.  The number of priority countries and the range of programmes we undertake will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Multilateral assistance includes our mandatory contributions to the European Development Fund, Lomé, and to the aid programmes of the European Union and also voluntary contibutions to the UN development agencies, UNICEF, UNHCR etc.  I intend to further strengthen the coherence of our bilateral programme and its multilateral dimension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Irish point of view, the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in the area of institiutional reform and indeed the overall result of the Intergovernmental Conference has been highly satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In the area of institutional reform, Ireland shared the concern of other member states to preserve the broad balance within and between the European Union's institutions which has been essential to the success of the Union.  In particular, Ireland attached priority to maintaining the right to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  We continue to believe it is central to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Commission and of the Union's institutions as a whole that each member state is entitled to nominate a full member.  I am very pleased this priority was realised and I would indeed pay tribute to the previous Government, of which Deputy Rabbitte was a member, for its efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the treaty provides for a future review of institutional arrangements, including the composition of the Commission. However, the outcome of such a future review is not prejudged, and there has been no decision to limit the size of the Commission to any definite number of commissioners.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the larger member states agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference to give up their right to nominate a second Commissioner at the time of the next enlargement of the Union, provided that, by the date, the weighting of the votes in the council has been modified, whether by reweighting of the votes or by dual majority, in a manner acceptable to all member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Rabbitte the Government remains committed to protecting the interests of Ireland as a smaller member state in any future negotiations on institutional issues, not only with our own benefit in mind but also with the objective <Col N="1028" /> of maintaining the cohesion, balance and effectiveness of the Union as a whole.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some Irish emigrants are homeless. They find themselves in that position either because they leave Ireland inadequately prepared for life in a different environment or because of family or other difficulties of the kind that people everywhere experience.</P>
      <P>The relevant statutory and voluntary organisations discourage prospective emigrants from leaving this country if they are not sufficiently well prepared or equipped to adjust to living abroad.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the emigrant advice information and counselling service have recent leaflets with practical advice for people thinking of going to London or the United States; FÁS, the training and employment authority, recently produced an information pack of comprehensive and country-specific information about how to cope with problems of living and working abroad.</P>
      <P>In addition to the assistance available to Irish emigrants from the official social services of the countries in which they live, advice and assistance is also provided to homeless Irish people in Britain, the United States and Australia from many local voluntary Irish organisations whose valuable work is supported by grants from the Irish Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Following concerns expressed by the National Graves Association on the preservation of the Croppies Acre, a meeting took place between officials of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Office of Public Works, the National Museum, representatives of the Government's 1798 Commemoration Office and public interest groups including representatives of the National Graves Association.</P>
      <P>At that meeting, the historic importance of the Croppies Acre site was acknowledged and it was agreed that any development of the site would be undertaken with great sensitivity.</P>
      <P>It was agreed, in principle, that the existing green space would be appropriately treated as a 1798 memorial and plans for that process will be announced in 1998, it is hoped, in the first half of the year.  The treatment of the Croppies Acre site will be undertaken in the context of the next phase of the Collins Barracks scheme which is at an early stage and subject to the requirements of the introduction of the LUAS light rail line along the northern boundary of the Esplanade.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that two members of the public interest groups represented at the meeting will be nominated to liaise with the design team of Collins Barracks who will advise and consult those nominees on developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member state of the European Union is obliged to include tobacco products in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  The HICPs will be used as one of the four criteria in measuring the degree of economic convergence by member states in order to participate in stage III of Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>In parallel with the HICPs most member states also continue to publish their national Consumer Price Indices.  With the exception of Italy, tobacco products are included in these national CPIs.</P>
      <P>The Irish CPI is compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  Under the Statistics Act, 1993 the Director General of the CSO has sole responsibility for, and is independent in deciding, the statistical methodology and professional standards to be used.</P>
      <P>The CPI is designed to measure the change in the average level of prices, inclusive of all indirect taxes paid for consumer goods and services by all private households in the country.</P>
      <P>The CSO advises that tobacco products account for a significant portion of household expenditure and are, therefore, correctly included in the CPI.  This is consistent with standard international practice.  Furthermore, a CPI sub-index for tobacco is published by the CSO and it is thus possible to monitor its effect on the overall CPI.</P>

      <P>I met the chairman and chief executive officer, and other senior executives of Fruit of the Loom Inc.  in Chicago on 25 August in order to discuss the US company's plans for its Irish operations.  The company assured me that it is strongly committed to maintaining employment levels in Ireland until at least the end of 1998.  The company was optimistic about maintaining the level of employment after that but, given the increasing competition in world markets, considered it difficult to predict further.  I emphasised to the company the importance of Fruit of the Loom to Donegal and the north-west generally.  The company undertook to keep in close touch with IDA Ireland and my Department concerning its future plans.</P>
      <P>I also met recently with SIPTU officials representing Fruit of the Loom Inc.  Both the IDA and my Department will keep the union briefed on ongoing developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>On 4 September 1997, Guinness Ireland Group, following discussions with me and my officials, notified their proposed take-over of United Beverages Holdings to the Competiton Authority seeking clearance of the proposal under the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>I understand that the notification is being considered by the authority and I have requested them to treat this matter as a priority.</P>
      <P>I am therefore satisfied that the proposal will be investigated thoroughly by the independent authority and, accordingly, it is not necessary for me to invoke any powers available to me in this regard such as those provided for in sections 11 and 14 of the Competition Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussions which culminated in Guinness Ireland Group notifying the proposal to the authority were initiated following the withdrawal by me, on 15 August 1997, of a referral of the proposal to the Competition Authority for investigation <Col N="1035" /> under section 7 of the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts.  I made that referral on 8 August but I was obliged to withdraw it on being advised by the Attorney General that it was out of time, the deadline under the legislation having expired on 3 August.  That deadline was allowed to pass as it was understood, incorrectly as it transpired, that a request for further information from the parties which was made on 31 July would have the effect of extending the deadline. However, this was queried by the Competition Authority and the Attorney General confirmed that the deadline of 3 August was unaffected by the request.</P>
    <P>To prevent any recurrence of errors of this type, I have issued strict instructions, based on the legal advice received in this case, concerning rigid adherence to the time scales laid down in the Mergers Acts.</P>

      <P>Recycling paper plants will only be established in Ireland when they are shown to be a commercial proposition. On 4 February 1997, the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Mr. Richard Bruton, in a reply to Question No. 40 from the Deputy indicated that the cost of establishing a paper recycling plant is extremely high being in the region of £80 million.  For that size of investment companies require a level of sales that implies substantial exports.</P>
      <P>Forbairt on several occasions has provided support to companies to establish the feasibility of paper recycling projects but none of these have proved positive to date.  I understand from Forbairt that in 1995 an Irish company examined the feasibility of establishing a paper recycling plant in Ireland to produce some of the paper required in the manufacture of corrugated cases.  However, it has postponed a decision indefinitely for a variety of commercial reasons.</P>

      <P>Community Employment (CE) is designed to provide temporary rather than ongoing opportunities for unemployed people, whereby they can update their existing skills, develop new skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience that will enhance their prospects of securing a mainstream job.  Since April 1996 the programme has consisted of the following two distinct options:</P>
      <P>Part-time Integration Option (30,000 places) aimed at long-term unemployed people with reasonable prospects of employment and whose prospects of obtaining mainstream employment would be enhanced by participation on the programme. Under this option participants are generally engaged for a 12 month period.  However up to 10 per cent of participants may be reengaged for a further 12 month period with the agreement of FÁS, where such participants are key participants and no other suitable eligible person is available, or where the participant would benefit from an additional period on the programme.</P>
      <P>Part-time Job Option (10,000 places) aimed at older long-term unemployed people with poor employment prospects, i.e. those over 35 years and more than three years unemployed.  These participants have an annual contract of engagement for 12 months, but may have their contract renewed for up to three years.</P>
      <P>Decisions regarding extensions for individual participants, including the length of time individual participants spend on the programme are matters for FÁS as part of their operational remit for the delivery of CE and not matters in which I have a direct function.</P>

      <P>I received numerous requests for extensions to the 1997 commercial salmon fishing season in various regions around the coast.  Having carefully considered all the submissions made to me, the advice of relevant Regional Fisheries Boards and the scientific assessments by the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute, as well as the particular local circumstances, I decided as an exceptional measure to grant a limited <Col N="1040" /> number of extensions as follows: the draftnet fisheries in the North Western Fisheries Region, the Rivers Cashen-Feale, and the Waterford Fisheries District were extended from 1 August to 9 August, giving five days additional fishing time. The estuarial driftnet fishery in Waterford Estuary was extended from 1 August to 9 August &mdash; four days additional fishing time.  The snapnet fishery in rivers Suir, Nore and Barrow was extended from 15 August to 22 August &mdash; five days extra fishing.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing the conservation measures introduced for the 1997 season.  My decisions on conservation measures for 1998 and future years will be informed by:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a comprehensive analysis by our salmon scientists of the state of Irish salmon stocks as well as of the international data;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the impact and effectiveness of the conservation measures taken this year, and</P>

      <P>The international prognosis on the worrying state of salmon stocks in the North Atlantic and the initial reports available to me on Irish catches and stocks this year underline the need to continue, at minimum, with the existing conservation measures.</P>
      <P>I have already announced my intention to move to a catchment-based approach for inland fisheries management involving and empowering all users and beneficiaries at local community level.  The catchment approach will also address the specific and localised impacts of salmon management and conservation strategies through ongoing review and consultation with all stakeholders in the salmon resource.</P>

      <P>Fingal County Council holds a foreshore licence administered by my Department in repsect of part of the landfill site at Ballealy.  The licence is for a term of 99 years from February 1978.  A licence in respect of the balance of the site developed on foreshore lands expired in 1992.  There is, however, a longstanding application from 1993 for a renewal of the aforesaid licence and to develop, in the medium term, the entire site &mdash; covered by both licences &mdash; into an amenity area.  The consideration of this application is on hold pending the submission of an EIS and full details of Fingal County Council's proposal in respect of the total dumpsite.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Among the objectives set out in Chapter 33 of Agenda 21, the blueprint for international action for sustainable development agreed at the Earth Summit in 1992, is the provision to developing countries of substantial new and additional financial resources for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21.  In particular, this involved a reaffirment by developed countries of their commitment to reach the accepted United Nation target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overseas development assistance (ODA).</P>
      <P>Ireland has adopted a range of measures to honour this undertaking and, specifically, the Government is committed to making steady progress towards the UN target figure.  Since the Earth Summit, Irish overseas development assistance (ODA) has increased from £40 million &mdash; 0.16 per cent of GNP &mdash; in 1992 to £122 million &mdash; a projected 0.3 per cent of GNP &mdash; in 1997, giving Ireland the fastest growng aid programme of any donor country.</P>
      <P>New and additional resources have been provided under the Irish aid programme for expenditure on key conservation and development sectors identified in Agenda 21.  Chapter 33 also urged that the new and additional financial resources be provided on grant and concessional terms.  All of Irish aid funding is provided on a grant basis.</P>
      <P>Chapter 33 also called for bilateral assistance programmes to be strengthened in order to promote sustainable development.  The principles of Agenda 21 have been fully integrated into the Irish aid programme.  It is a fundamental principle of Irish aid that sustainable development demands that adequate attention be paid to environmental issues.  Accordingly, systematic attention is given to environmental questions at all project stages, including project identification, appraisal, implementation, review and evaluation.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Irish aid programme, Ireland also contributes to a series of multilateral agencies and funding mechanisms concerned with the promotion of sustainable development.  Since the Earth Summit, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has been restructured in line with Chapter 33.  Ireland has become a party to the GEF since 1992 and is committed to conributing a total of £1.64 million over the 1996-8 GEF funding cycle, of which £825,000 has been paid to date, in fulfilment of our obligations under the UN Biodiversity and Climate Change Conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Earth Summit, Ireland has also increased its annual contribution to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) from £60,000 in 1992 to £100,000 in 1997.  Over the same period, our annual contribution to the <Col N="1045" /> multilateral fund under the Montreal Protocol, which assists developing countries in phasing out ozone depleting substances, has increased from £94,000 to £260,000.  Voluntary contributions of more modest sums have also been made to the UN trust funds for the Climate Change Convention, the Desertification Convention, Small Island Developing States, and the Commission on Sustainable Development.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a participant in European Union programmes to assist developing countries in the field of sustainable development and in the provision of funding for Agenda 21 related activities. The EU has strongly argued at international level for efforts to deal with global environmental problems and to promote sustainable development. It allocates considerable resources to environmental programmes in developing countries under Lomé IV.  Its aid programmes are environmentally assessed in order to ensure that they make a positive contribution to environmental protection and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The World Bank, of which Ireland is a contributing member, has taken increasing account of environmental considerations since the Earth Summit and of the need to promote sustainable development.  In addition, the bank in association with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has launched a debt relief initiative for highly indebted poor developing countries, the HIPC Initiative, which responds to the call in Chapter 33 of Agenda 21 for durable solutions to the debt problem of developing countries in the interests of their sustainable development.</P>

      <P>This case concerns the welfare of a child whose custody is one of a number of matters in dispute between the Irish and Italian parents.  The child has been in State custody in Italy since March 1997.  In the interests of the welfare of the child, who is an Irish citizen, my Department and the Embassy in Rome have been giving every assistance possible to the Irish parent.</P>
      <P>The situation is complicated by the fact that two courts, a civil court and a juvenile court, have been involved.  The Italian Supreme Court has been asked to adjudicate as to which of them has competence regarding the child's welfare.  There is no indication yet when a ruling on this may be expected.

      <P>It is assumed that the question refers to the role of national parliaments in the European Union which is the subject of Declaration 13 annexed to the Treaty on Europen Union.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam contains a Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union.  With regard to the provision of information for national parliaments of member states, the Protocol provides, <i>inter alia</i>,:</P>
      <P>(a) for the prompt forwarding of all Commission consultation documents &mdash; green and white papers and communications &mdash; to national parliaments of the member states.</P>
      <P>(b) that Commission proposals for legislation are made available in good time, so that the Governments of each member state may ensure that its own national parliament receives them as appropriate.</P>
      <P>(c) for a minimum six-week period between a legislative proposal being tabled and its being placed on a Council agenda for decision, except in cases of particular urgency.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Conference of European Affairs Committees of national parliaments and the European Parliament (COSAC), the Protocol contains a number of provisions concerning its right to (a) make contributions it deems appropriate for the attention of the institutions of the European Union, (b) examine any legislative proposal in relation to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice which might have a direct bearing on the rights and freedoms of individuals, (c) address to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission any contribution it deems appropriate on the legislative activities of the Union, notably in relation to the application of the principle of subsidiarity, the area of freedom, security and justice as well as questions regarding fundamental rights.</P>
      <P>The Protocol makes clear that contributions made by COSAC do not bind national parliaments or prejudge their position.</P>
      <P>The text of the Protocol is as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Center">PROTOCOL ON THE ROLE OF NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,</P>
      <P>RECALLING that scrutiny by individual national parliaments of their own government in relation to the activities of the Union is a matter for the particular constitutional organisation and practice of each Member State,</P>
      <P>DESIRING, however, to encourage greater involvement of national parliaments in the activities of the European Union and to enhance their ability to express their views on matters which may be of particular interest to them,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, <Col N="1048" /> which shall be annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaties establishing the European Communities,</P>
    <P>I. Information for national parliaments of Member States</P>
    <P>1.  All Commission consultation documents (green and white papers and communications) shall be promptly forwarded to national parliaments of the Member States.</P>
    <P>2.  Commission proposals for legislation as defined by the Council in accordance with Article 151(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, shall be made available in good time so that the government of each Member State may ensure that its own national parliament receives them as appropriate.</P>
    <P>3.  A six-week period shall elapse between a legislative proposal or a proposal for a measure to be adopted under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union being made available in all languages to the European Parliament and the Council by the Commission and the date when it is placed on a Council agenda for decision either for the adoption of an act or for adoption of a common position pursuant to Article 189b or 189c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, subject to exceptions on grounds of urgency, the reasons for which shall be stated in the act or common position.</P>
    <P>II.  The Conference of European Affairs Committees</P>
    <P>4.  The Conference of European Affairs Committees, hereinafter referred to as COSAC, established in Paris on 16-17 November 1989, may make any contribution it deems appropriate for the attention of the institutions of the European Union, in particular on the basis of draft legal texts which representatives of governments of the Member States may decide by common accord to forward to it, in view of the nature of their subject matter.</P>
    <P>5.  COSAC may examine any legislative proposal or initiative in relation to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice which might have a direct bearing on the rights and freedoms of individuals.  The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission shall be informed of any contribution made by COSAC under this point.</P>
    <P>6.  COSAC may address to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission any contribution which it deems appropriate on the legislative activities <Col N="1049" /> of the Union, notably in relation to the application of the principle of subsidiarity, the area of freedom, security and justice as well as questions regarding fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>7.  Contributions made by COSAC shall in no way bind national parliaments or prejudge their position.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Cases Review Commission in Britain in April this year took over from the Home Office responsibility for cases of alleged miscarriage of justice.  It has the power to refer cases back to the Court of Appeal without the need to obtain the approval of the Home Secretary. The case of the Irish prisoner in question is one of those currently under consideration by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The Embassy in London has been maintaining regular contact with the commission about progress in the case and has been assured that it will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  Representatives of the commission visited the prisoner two weeks ago and had a lengthy discussion about the case with him.  I am hopeful that the recent emergence of new evidence will enable the commission to arrive at an early decision on this case.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Embassy to continue closely to monitor the situation.</P>

      <P>The Government is closely monitoring the evolving situation in Montserrat and the difficulties currently experienced by the population of the island.  As the Deputy will be aware, continuing volcanic eruptions on the island have gradually rendered large parts of the island uninhabitable. Citizens of Montserrat have been provided with emergency shelter assistance by the British Government and a large percentage of the population have been voluntarily evacuated from the island over the past number of weeks.  I understand from the British authorities that due to further volcanic activity in the past few days, the total area of the island considered safe has been further reduced.  An estimated 5,000 now remain on the island and latest reports indicate that over half of these have now signed up for voluntary evacuation.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in common with our EU partners, has supported the people of Montserrat through the provision of financial support under the Lomé Convention.  A total of 7.9 million ECU was provided to the island under the 7th European Development Fund.  In addition to this, a total of 350,000 ECU was allocated to Montserrat for the provision of emergency housing under the EU humanitarian budget.  I understand that proposals for further support will be considered by the Commission within the coming week.</P>
      <P>We have received no requests for additional assistance.</P>

      <P>The licensing of televisions deflector operators is a very complex issue.  The legislative position is that while I have a policy role in relation to the allocation and use of radio frequency spectrum, the legal power to issue licences to television deflector operators pursuant to section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 was transferred, with effect from 3 June 1997, to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation appointed under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>It is accordingly a legal function of the director in the first instance to address the question of licensing such operators.  Any licensing regulations proposed by the director would be subject to my consent.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the director has initiated a consultancy study in relation to this matter with a view to determining the appropriate course of action.</P>

      <P>The construction of new masts is as the Deputy is aware subject to planning legislation with limited exemptions.</P>
      <P>The Government is, however, committed to promoting the sharing of masts where possible. In this regard guidelines for planning authorities entitled Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures, published by the Department of the Environment in July last year, provide that planning authorities should encourage the sharing of facilities.</P>
      <P>The recently adopted European Union Directive on Interconnection of Networks (97/33/EC) also requires member states to promote the sharing of facilities and for arbitration of disputes in relation to sharing arrangements.  Regulations to give effect to the directive will be signed before the end of this year and will provide for a role for the telecommunications regulator in settling disputes.</P>
      <P>Finally, my Department is also looking at the possibility of bringing forward proposals to provide a legislative basis for the mandatory sharing of masts and other telecommunications infrastructure.</P>

      <P>Current policy is that transatlantic air carriers wishing to serve Ireland must operate at least an equivalent level of service to Shannon as to Dublin.  This is designed to ensure that Shannon receives at least 50 per cent of direct transatlantic services to &mdash; from Ireland.  The policy is enshrined in the Ireland-US bilateral air services agreement.</P>
      <P>This policy of course applies only to transatlantic services.  Within the European Economic Area (EEA) airlines are essentially free to operate on any route within the EEA without any restriction on frequency, capacity and fares.  Outside the EEA access is governed by the provisions of the relevant bilateral air services agreement.</P>
      <P>The question of whether any airline wishes to exercise traffic rights available to them is a matter for the airline on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> I have no plans at this time to make any modifications to policy in relation to Shannon.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department's published Statement of Strategy contained a commitment to review, by the end of 1997, the current transatlantic Shannon stop requirement in the context of the likelihood of an EU/US &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; aviation agreement being negotiated in the years ahead.  This review has been initiated and interested parties have been invited to offer their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government, under the Transport heading, says that key priorities will include resistance to EU plans to abolish duty free shopping after June 1999.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the economic and social consequences of the scheduled abolition of duty free sales for Ireland, in particular the effects on employment and access costs for tourism and trade, and I am taking an active role in the campaign to raise awareness of the duty free issue.</P>
      <P>At the <i>Duty Free in Europe</i> Conference in Brussels on 24 September 1997 I highlighted the Irish Government's position and I called on the EU Commission to conduct an EU-wide study into the economic and social effects on Europe of ending duty free.</P>
      <P>I believe the results of such a study would pave the way for an open-ended derogation, which can be reviewed as circumstances change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At their Council meeting in June this year, Transport Ministers supported the concept of this <Col N="1055" /> EU-wide study.  I should point out, however, that reversal of the scheduled abolition is primarily a matter for Finance Ministers and requires a proposal from the EU Commission and unanimous agreement of the Council of Finance Ministers.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance has commissioned a study to establish the impact on Irish employment, transport and Government revenues from the abolition of intra-EU duty free.  This study, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, should provide a useful basis for future discussions.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Public Enterprise, in June last, there have been discussions involving the Government's strategic partner in Telecom Éireann, KPN/Telia, Telecom Éireann management and the union representatives about a proposed employee share ownership programme.  One of the major elements of the programme is to be a scheme for the issue of shares to employees to encourage their active participation as shareholders in the company in return for the implementation of a transformation plan which requires, <i>inter alia</i>, major change within the company.</P>
      <P>As these discussions are ongoing, it is too early at this stage to comment on the terms under which a share scheme might become operational.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for nine animals on 18 April 1997 under the 1997 deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme.</P>
      <P>One animal is under investigation at present and the herdowner has been written to in relation to this query.  If this animal is found to be eligible, payment will issue without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount due on the remaining eight animals was £480.72. However, £228.96 was offset against an overpayment which was made on 7 October 1996 under the 1996 BSE top-up on special beef premium.  The EU regulations governing <Col N="1061" /> the payment of 1996 top-up provided for payment on the basis of animals paid the 1995 special beef premium with an adjustment upwards or downwards later on to take account of the number of animals paid 1996 special beef premium.  When a comparison was made between the 1995 and 1996 schemes, the person named was not due any top-up payment since he was not an applicant under the 1996 special beef premium scheme.  It was, therefore, necessary to recoup the £228.96 already paid.</P>
    <P>The person named was paid the balance of his 1997 deseasonalisation slaughter premium of £251.76 in respect of eight animals on 10 June 1997.</P>
    <P>The agri-monetary top-up payment in respect of the eight animals on which 1997 slaughter premium has already been paid and in respect of the one animal under investigation &mdash; if it qualifies &mdash; will issue as soon as this latter matter is resolved.</P>

When she applied for her second year payment on 20 February 1997, she was randomly chosen for inspection for compliance with the scheme conditions and with the Department's agri-environmental specifications. During the inspection a number of deficiencies were found.  As a result, letters issued to both the applicant and her planner outlining the shortcomings and requesting that they be rectified. Until these matters have been satisfactorily resolved the applicant's second year payment cannot be made.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium in respect of eight animals under the June 1997 suckler cow premium scheme.  His quota has been increased from seven to eight quota rights for 1997.  His premium application is being processed at present and if found to be in order, he will be paid as soon as possible after payments commence on 1 November 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms and conditions of the cattle headage scheme specify that a cow or heifer must calve within the calendar year of application i.e. by 31 December, in order to attract the higher grant rate of £84 per animal.  Otherwise the cow or heifer qualifies for the lower grant of £40 per animal. In his application for grants under the 1997 cattle headage scheme, he declared that two of his cows would be calving after 31 December <Col N="1070" /> 1997 and as a result these two cows will qualify for payment at the lower rate of £40 per animal when payments issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef reform package adopted by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 1996 required member states to introduce either a calf processing scheme or an early marketing premium for veal calves in order to reduce the number of calves available for the production of beef in the EU.  Since there is no indigenous veal calf production in the country, Ireland is obliged to implement the calf processing scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme is operated under strict conditions. Only male calves less than 20 days old are eligible for the calf processing scheme.</P>
      <P>The rate of payment is £87.02 per head for dairy breeds and £109.72 per head for beef breeds.  These amounts are paid directly to approved processors.  The open market value of similar calves outside the scheme is approximately the same as the rates of payment available under the processing scheme.  To date, approximately 18,600 calves have been slaughtered.  Of these, 95 per cent were dairy breeds and the remaining 5 per cent were beef breeds.</P>
      <P>The scheme is to operate over the two years from December 1996 to the end of November 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports of cattle to EU destinations &mdash; other than the United Kingdom &mdash; comprised 111,246 animals in 1994, 92,214 animals in 1995, and 42,469 animals in 1996.  The main reasons for the reduction in exports have been the increased restrictions placed on the carriage of animals by sea in the EU and the effect on trade of the EU decision in 1996 to prohibit exports of cattle from the United Kingdom.  My Department has always been of the view that no restrictions should be applied to the export of livestock from Ireland and that any trade which complies with the strict animal welfare conditions applicable in Ireland, as well as appropriate EU animal welfare conditions, <Col N="1073" /> should be allowed to travel unhindered to its intended EU destination.</P>
      <P>The refusal of the principal provider of ferry services from Ireland to the Continent to carry most categories of live animals has therefore placed the Irish livestock sector in a wholly unacceptable position particularly in the context of a single EU market.  However, the Government has agreed to provide assistance for the provision of an alternative ferry service which will carry all types of livestock and I am currently examining a number of proposals in that context. I am confident that, subject to clearance by the European Commission of the State aid involved, access to continental markets for all types of livestock will be secured in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The Government's joint programme &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; states that public service pensions will be protected.

      <P>Humanitarian assistance payments were made by the Government to people who suffered damages as a result of flooding in early 1995 and early 1996.  These moneys were allocated under two separate schemes, the Government humanitarian assistance &mdash; home relocation scheme &mdash; administered by the Office of Public Works, which provided some £750,000 for the victims of flooding in 1995 whose homes were damaged beyond economic repair or flooded for a prolonged period &mdash; in excess of three weeks &mdash; and £750,000 for a general humanitarian aid scheme to assist victims of flooding in 1995 and £280,000 in 1996.  All entitlements under the latter scheme were determined, and the payments distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.  Moneys under both schemes were provided as humanitarian aid as opposed to compensation.</P>
      <P>Details of payments on a county basis are as follows:</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is a married woman and that most of the couple's tax-free allowances has been allocated to the taxpayer's husband.  During the current tax year 1997-98 the taxpayer had been unemployed until she commenced employment in July.  Up to that time the amount of unemployment benefit she had received exceeded the tax-free allowance which had been allocated to her for the year.  A &ldquo;nil&rdquo; certificate of tax-free allowances was therefore issued when the taxpayer took up employment.</P>
      <P>As soon as the inspector of taxes became aware that the taxpayer's husband was no longer in employment due to an accident and was receiving disability benefit, arrangements were made to transfer the tax-free allowances which had been allocated to him to the taxpayer.  A revised certificate of tax-free allowances issued on 26 September 1997.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on every taxpayer to inform his or her inspector of taxes about any change in his or her employment circumstances.  In this particular case the inspector had not been informed that the taxpayer's husband was no longer in employment.</P>

      <P>Work has been under way for some time to ensure that Information Technology (IT) systems and other office equipment in the Civil Service will not be adversely affected by the Year 2000 problem.</P>
      <P>An Interdepartmental Group on the Year 2000 was set up in 1996 to focus on common technical issues affecting Government Departments and Offices.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, each Department and Office was required to ensure that their IT systems and office equipment were Year 2000 compliant and to draw up plans for dealing with any non-compliant systems by early 1999.  This planning exercise is now complete and all plans have been reviewed by the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>It is evident from the plans that many potential Year 2000 problems have already been eliminated by the replacement of ageing computer systems and infrastructures.  Considerable remedial work is on-going in Departments and Offices, particularly in those most affected and they expect that this remedial work will be completed by early 1999.</P>

      <P>The decision to end duty free sales for intra-EU travel was taken by the ECOFIN Council, with broad agreement reached in December 1991.  This was enacted into Community law in 1992 as part of the agreements governing the Single Market, which came into effect on 1 January 1993.  The decision was, as required by EU law, made on the basis of unanimous agreement of the member states.</P>
      <P>The initial proposals by the European Commission would have ended duty free sales in December 1992.  The extension of the concession to 1999 was agreed in response to pressure from Ireland, among others, to allow time for the industry to adapt.  Duty free or tax free sales for travellers to non-EU destinations are not affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been explained in this House before, the decision to end duty free facilities for intra-community travel can only be reversed by unanimous agreement at Council, following a proposal from the Commission.  So far the Commission, <Col N="1086" /> which has always held the view that the principle of tax-free trading on intra-Community journeys is incompatible with the concept of an internal market without internal frontiers, have maintained that they are not prepared to put any fresh proposals to the Council for any extension beyond 30 June 1999, and have confirmed this position as recently as last week.</P>
    <P>My predecessor raised the matter at the November 1996 ECOFIN while Ireland was in the Presidency.  Ireland was not able to convince the Commission to carry out a study of the economic impact of ending duty free sales.</P>
    <P>In order to inform any future discussions on this issue my Department has now engaged consultants to conduct an independent study into the direct consequences for Ireland of the ending of duty free sales for intra-EU travel.</P>
    <P>After examination of the results of this study - which should be completed by the end of the year - I will be able to consider what further action, if any, can be taken in addition to lobbying the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 10 of the 1985 Finance Act, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first £ 4,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years and in respect of £ 6,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years.  The exemptions are <Col N="1087" /> available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>The tax exemptions in respect of leased land are available to qualifying lessees.  In this context qualifying lessee specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives.  The question of connection is determined by reference to section 131 of the 1996 Finance Act which is the standard test for connection for income tax purposes.  Previously, section 16 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968 applied the same test.  A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife.  A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendent. The restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is an anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by the lessee.</P>
      <P>In the case of more permanent transfers of land between family members such as by gift or sale, very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs already apply.  It should not be necessary to provide an incentive to encourage land leasing between family members especially one which is open to abuse as mentioned above.</P>

In additon, recent capital developments funded by my Department, include improvements to the medical records and catering departments.  The appointment of an additional consultant cardiologist is a matter for further discussions between the hospital and my Department and will be progressed as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>With regard to the budgetary situation at the hospital, in line with Government policy, the hospital is required to produce a plan to manage its services during the year in accordance with the approved level of funding.</P>
      <P>The South Infirmary/Victoria has submitted a wide range of proposed capital and revenue developments to my Department, including those referred to by the Deputies, and these will be considered in line with the priorities of the hospital authorities and the service needs in the Cork area in the context of the resources available for the development of hospital services.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible children and the maintenance of waiting lists is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected/handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity/handicap.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the health boards that, at present, average waiting times for children seeking orthodontic treatment vary.  In most health boards there is no waiting list for category A patients, which are the cases of greatest need. However in the North-Eastern Health Board there is a waiting period of approximately two to eight months.</P>

      <P>The consultant orthodontist in charge of the orthodontic department as well as one other member of the orthodontic staff of the department resigned last year.  This put a heavy burden on the department.  The situation was then made more acute by the recent illness of another staff member.  A new consultant orthodontist has now commenced work with the board.  The board has also been successful in the recruitment of another staff member who has commenced work in the Orthodontic Department.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 321 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of payment varies considerably throughout the country, determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.</P>
      <P>In the Southern Health Board, where the payment is currently £ 1.40 per hour, negotiations have taken place with SIPTU and an offer has been made to increase this rate on a phased basis. As I understand it, a formal written offer has been made to the trade union representing this group - the increase of 30 pence the Deputy refers to is the first phase of this increase, with a further increase of 30 pence per hour with effect from 1 July 1998.  In all, this will be an increase of over 40 per cent on the current rate.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that the underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based good neighbour scheme which would attract volunteers primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service.  The service does not come within the realm of conventional employment. Income in respect of services provided is a payment which is not intended to compensate fully for the nature of the task undertaken.  Such income does not come within the scope of the PAYE code and is not taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a home help, or the spouse of a home help, is in receipt of a means-tested welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The issue has been raised on many occasions in the House.  My Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, is considering a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A discussion document submitted by the Chief Executive Officers Group formed the basis for this examination of the home help services.  Following on from these discussions, my Department decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services. <Col N="1101" /> Following receipt of tenders for this review, the contract has been awarded and work has commenced on the project.  It is expected that the review will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The following progress is being made on the implementation of the recommendations contained in my Department's policy document on Services to Persons with Autism:</P>
      <P>The National Intellectual Disability Database, which was launched this year, collects information on the needs of persons with autism.  This information is supplemented locally by health boards as part of their service planning for autism services.</P>
      <P>The majority of persons with autism avail of the generic mental handicap services which have been substantially developed in recent years. Specialist services, which may be required, are being developed with services most recently developed in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards.  The health boards' development plans for the mental handicap services include plans for the development of autism services.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education has put in place two pilot initiatives in Dublin and in Limerick for children with autism.</P>
      <P>In relation to research, my Department has made funding available to the Irish Society for Autism for research into the mortality rate and causes of mortality in persons with autism.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recommendation on staff training, my Department provided funding in 1997 for a series of training seminars for frontline staff working with people with autism.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to pursue the development of these services with the health boards, the voluntary mental handicap agencies and the Department of Education as part of the implementation of &ldquo;Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap - An Assessment of Need 1997-2001&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to implement the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap, including those with autism, from psychiatric hospitals and other unsuitable placements to more appropriate care settings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the service developments to be put in place in each health board region from any <Col N="1102" /> additional funding which may be made available are agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region. Representatives of parents and families are included in the membership of these committees. Individual parents and families would be involved in the preparation and implementation of personalised care and educational programmes for their family members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 253 together.</P>
      <P>A basic tenet of Government policy is that older people should be maintained in dignity and independence in their own homes for as long as possible.  The health boards' primary obligation is to support individuals and families in achieving this very desirable objective and to ensure that when this is no longer possible, older people have access to the best possible medical and long-term care.</P>
      <P>The cost of maintaining a patient in a private nursing home is not generally comparable to that of a health board long-stay home for older people.  Health board homes provide ancillary services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy etc.  as standard with a wider range of staff employed.  Such services are not generally provided in the private nursing home sector.</P>
      <P>The provision of care in health board long stay homes for older people is based on social and medical need.  In general, patients admitted to long stay homes for older people tend to be medical card holders who are very dependent.</P>
      <P>The subvention scheme provided for under the Nursing Homes Act is intended to assist persons in need of nursing home care in meeting the costs of such care but is not intended to meet the full costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely accepted in society that sons and daughters who may be in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees have an obligation to do so.  The Third Schedule to the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 was drafted with this principle in mind.  I believe that sons and daughters who are in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's <Col N="1103" /> nursing home fees should do so.  The State recognises this contribution in the tax relief it gives on such payments.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am aware that despite the annual budget of £ 17 million made available to the health boards by my Department for the implementation of the subvention scheme, certain difficulties continue to be encountered by some providers and persons seeking nursing home care.  I will endeavour to address these problems on a phased basis within the resources available to me.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason bandages, dressing and incontinence wear must be paid for in a nursing home when there is no charge for them in the community.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14361/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>A person in receipt of a nursing home subvention is entitled to items which are covered by the subvention, including incontinence wear, aids and appliances.  Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 provides that a registered proprietor of a nursing home shall not seek any additional payment from a subvented patient for any service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in nursing homes.  Among the services which are considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in most nursing homes are incontinence wear and bedding, laundry services and aids and appliances necessary to assist a dependent person with the activities of daily living.</P>
      <P>I understand that in February 1995 the then Minister for Health was informed of cases where patients in receipt of subvention were being charged for incontinence wear.  My Department subsequently wrote to the health boards asking them to draw the attention of each proprietor of a registered nursing home in their board's area to the requirements of the Nursing Home Regulations and to advise them that they may not seek additional payments from subvented patients for services such as incontinence wear and aids and appliances.</P>
      <P>The supply of bandages and dressings to patients in receipt of subvention is being investigated and I will communicate with the Deputy when the position is clarified.  In the interim, if the Deputy is aware of a particular problem in this area, perhaps he would forward details to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board who will investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>Orthodontic treatment services in the North-Eastern Health Board are being developed on a phased basis in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of primary and secondary care orthodontic treatment through the development of consultant-led orthodontic services. The North-Eastern Health Board is continuing in its efforts to employ a consultant orthodontist.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected/handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity/handicap.  Category C patients are those with a non-handicapping malocclusion.</P>
      <P>My Department, in consultation with the health boards and their consultant orthodontists, is currently reviewing the guidelines issued in 1985.  The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the Dental Health Action Plan for developments in orthodontic services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further development of orthodontic treatment services in the North-Eastern Health Board region will be considered in the context of the Dental Health Action Plan and the additional <Col N="1106" /> resources available for developments and the competing priorities.</P>

      <P>In November 1993 the North-Eastern Health Board adopted a new policy regarding the future direction of services in the acute hospitals in the region.  As a result, 16 new and replacement consultants posts have been approved for the Cavan/Monaghan hospital since July 1994.  In addition, 58 new support posts have been approved across the range of services.  Over £ 1 million has been invested in equipment and a similar amount in capital improvements and maintenance.</P>
      <P>There are now 25 consultant posts in the Cavan/Monaghan Hospital.  The departure of a small number of consultants over the past couple of years arose for a variety of reasons, including consultants returning to their native areas and moving to larger teaching hospitals.</P>
      <P>I understand from the North-Eastern Health Board that the level of developments in their area and particularly the Cavan/Monaghan region is unparalleled nationally.  The result is that public confidence in the region is very high, as is evident by the number of patients availing of the services. The North-Eastern Health Board has indicated that where permanent posts fall vacant, it employs consultants on a temporary basis.  This ensures a continuity of service in the hospital.</P>

      <P>A 24 hour epidural service was introduced at Sligo General Hospital on 1 July 1997.  This follows a review of consultant anaesthetic services at the hospital and the recruitment of four junior anaesthetic staff.  In Letterkenny General Hospital the North-Western Health Board has submitted proposals for the introduction of an epidural service at an annual cost of £ 150,000.  I am considering these proposals at present in the light of available funds.</P>

      <P>The board's current development plans in relation to the St. Ita's Hospital campus provide for the closure of old wards in the main hospital block in line with the reduction in patient numbers in the psychiatric service and mental handicap service.  It is envisaged that the main hospital, which is over 100 years old, will be closed as a residential facility.  Closure will be facilitated by the provision of purpose built residential facilities in the community for those patients with a mental handicap, and the transfer of long-term older patients with a mental illness from the main hospital block, to more modern accommodation on the hospital campus, as vacancies arise.</P>
      <P>The board is at present in the process of drawing up a development control plan for the hospital campus taking into account the more modern residential and other accommodation on site and the eventual phasing out of the main hospital block.

      <Quest>the guarantee, if any, he can give if a person is diagnosed negative for hepatitis C, that this diagnosis will hold for a lifetime; and whether it can unexpectedly change as seems to be the case for over 500 people mentioned in the media, owing to a bad batch of Anti-D in the mid-1970s.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>In his question, the Deputy refers to approximately 500 people whose diagnosis for hepatitis C has unexpectedly changed.  This is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Blood Transfusion Service Board's screening programmes for hepatitis C, approximately <Col N="1109" /> 75,000 people have come forward for testing. In the latter part of 1996, the BTSB became aware that, in spite of their intensive efforts, not everyone who had been exposed to potentially infectious doses of anti-D in 1977-78 had come forward for testing.  Persons who had not come forward were identified following a cross-check of the lists of people tested under the programmes against available anti-D record cards from 1977-78.  Through this process, the BTSB identified over 500 women who, earlier this year, were invited, either directly or through their general practitioners, to consider coming forward for testing as they had received anti-D from potentially infectious batches.  This is the group of approximately 500 which was recently mentioned in the media.</P>
    <P>In addressing the Deputy's question in relation to a negative diagnosis for hepatitis C, this is clearly a medical issue.  However, I understand that the protocols for hepatitis C testing are as follows:</P>
    <P>Initial tests are performed by the Virus Reference Laboratory (VRL) at UCD or by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Both organisations currently use the third generation ELISA test. This is a highly sensitive test which is specifically designed to detect the viral type identified in the infected anti-D immunoglobulin produced in 1977, as well as to detect past exposure to the virus.</P>
    <P>Where an ELISA test is positive, a confirmatory RIBA test is performed by the VRL.  Where the RIBA test is positive, or indeterminate, a further confirmatory test called PCR is performed by the VRL.  This test detects the presence of current infectivity.</P>
    <P>Both the VRL and the BTSB utilise the most up-to-date and reliable diagnostic tests available. In all cases, the person's general practitioner is notified of the results of all the tests performed, and expert scientific support is available at the VRL and at the BTSB to advise on the significance of the results.</P>
    <P>In two cases, where the original tests showed ELISA positive, RIBA negative, recent RIBA tests were performed which showed positive results, with confirmatory evidence of weak levels of antibody reaction.  In both cases, subsequent PCR tests were negative, showing no evidence of current hepatitis C infection.  The VRL and the BTSB are currently examining the virological implication of these cases, and their relevance to other cases where original tests showed ELISA positive, RIBA negative results.</P>
    <P>There is a further group which requires some examination, namely that group which the BTSB are aware received potentially infected anti-D but who have tested negative for hepatitis C. I have decided to establish a group of experts to make recommendations on the clinical and non-clinical management of this group.  While such recipients have been advised of their negative test results, they have not been advised that the product they received was from a potentially infectious source. <Col N="1110" /> Currently, information is available from the BTSB on request on the infectivity status of known batches.  Issues to be addressed by the Group of Experts will include the psychological implications of directly informing the recipients that they received a potentially infected product, and the question of referral to one of the designated Anti-D clinics.  The group will be chaired by the chief medical officer at my Department and will hold its first meeting shortly.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the application and selection process operated by the Nursing Applications Centre for this year's intake of student nurses to the nursing registration-diploma programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nursing Applications Centre was established on a pilot basis in 1995 in order to provide a national centralised appliction and selection system for applicants seeking places on the new pre-registration nursing registration-diploma programmes. Price Waterhouse Management Consultants are currently carrying out an evaluation of the centre with the overall aim of ensuring that the most up-to-date application and selection procedures are employed, with continued maximum equity and effectiveness.  As part of this evaluation, Price Waterhouse are project managing the application-selection process for the 1997 intake of student nurses.  They have been assisted <Col N="1112" /> in this task by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>Certain modifications to the procedures employed in previous years were introduced this year with the objective of streamlining the application-selection process.  These include the replacement of the preliminary interview by a written assessment test.  The tests used were selected by Price Waterhouse psychologists in consultation with professionals from the Local Appointments Commission.  I have been informed that the decision to substitute a written assessment test for the preliminary interview is supported by a body of independent research which indicates that carefully chosen ability testing programmes as a method of shortlisting candidates for the final interview stage from large-scale applications is a fairer and more equitable system than using a large number of preliminary interview boards.  In this context, the Deputy may be aware that assessment tests are used for screening applicants for entry to the Garda Síochána, the Prison Services and the officer ranks of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I would also make the point that the suitability of those applicants who successfully came through the written assessment test was subsequently decided by interview boards composed of a Matron-Director of Nursing, a Senior Nurse Tutor and an independent chairperson nominated by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse will report on their evaluation of the Nursing Applications Centre after the completion of the 1997 student intake to the nursing registration-diploma programmes. Decisions as to the future operations of the Nursing Applications Centre and the procedures employed by it will be made in the light of the recommendations contained in the management consultants' report, which will be informed by their experience of project managing this year's application-selection process.</P>

      <P>The 1996 budget made provision whereby persons who have been unemployed for at least one year could retain their medical cards for the period of three years after entering employment.  The budget provision covers medical card holders who have been unemployed for at least one year i.e. persons on the live register who take up paid insurable employment.  These persons are deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical care for a period of three years.  This measure is effective from the date of the 1996 budget, i.e., 23 January 1996.  The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed including community employment.</P>
      <P>Arrangements which were in place prior to 23 January 1996 provided for persons who held medical cards while on the live register to retain the medical card for a period of two years after securing a placement on any of the schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed.  I presume that these are the persons to whom the Deputy is referring.  Since these persons were already on schemes prior to January 1996, they are not covered by the budget provision allowing for retention of a medical card for three years. However, after the expiry of the two year period of their entitlement, such persons would have their community employment income disregarded when their eligibility for a medical card is being assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that secondary benefits operated by the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs, such as supplementary welfare allowance, rent supplements and the back to <Col N="1115" /> school clothing and footwear allowance continue to be payable to people on community employment schemes, regardless of the duration of the scheme, provided the income of the person in question is no more than £ 250 per week. However, a maximum of £ 250 per month is payable in either rent supplement or mortgage interest supplement in such cases.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs has commissioned an independent review of secondary benefits and other benefits, such as the medical card, in relation to their effect on labour market participation.  This review will examine, <i>inter alia,</i> any anomalies in the operation of the provisions relating to retention of medical cards by persons participating in community employment schemes.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy's question refers to facilities and programmes for persons with a mental handicap who also present with extremely challenging behaviour.</P>
      <P>My Department has had discussions with the Western Health Board about their proposals for the development of services to meet the needs of this client group.</P>
      <P>As a first step, £ 11,500 was provided in 1997 for services at Aras Attracta, Swinford.  The funding of further development proposals, including those related to the Aras Attracta services, is currently under consideration in the context of any additional funding which may be made available to my Department in 1998 for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>

      <P>The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructuring, as provided for under the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement. This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers and gardaí, who have concluded or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the PCW.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in many cases even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this question is being considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place between the Department of Finance and the Public Services Committee of ICTU about this matter.  Consideration is still being given to the implications of the restructuring deals for existing pensioners and pensions increase policy across the public service.  When this general policy issue has been resolved my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Mater Hospital that the person in question is on the waiting list for cardiac surgery since December 1996 but due to the number of emergency admissions the hospital is not in a position to give a date of admission. However, it is hoped that this person will be admitted within the next six months.  The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.  The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the South-Eastern Health Board concerning this case and have been informed that the person's financial assessment was substantially in excess of the medical card guidelines.  Following further assessment on medical grounds the person was deemed ineligible for a medical card.</P>
      <P>I am advised, however, that the person is the holder of a drugs cost subsidisation scheme (DCSS) card since May 1996.  The DCSS is available to persons who do not hold a medical card, but who are certified as having a long-term medical condition, usually in excess of twelve months, with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines costing in excess of £ 32 per month.  Eligible persons are obliged only to pay £ 32 each month to their community pharmacist in respect of all prescription medication dispensed to them.  In the absence of this card the person would have to pay for all medication dispensed to them by their community pharmacist, though they could, of course, under the drug refund scheme, later claim from the local health board, a refund of any cost incurred in excess of £ 90 in a specified three month period.</P>

      <P>In addition to the development of new services, resources have been provided in recent years by my Department to meet identified needs in existing mental handicap services.  As part of this ongoing process officials from my Department recently had discussions with the agency which is the subject of the Deputy's inquiry with a view to identifying the priority needs within that service. The question of the provision of additional funding to begin to meet the needs identified by this process will then be considered in the light of the resources which may be made available to my Department in 1998.</P>
      <P>Some £ 10 million additional funding was made available to the mental handicap agencies this year for the development of day and residential services to persons with a mental handicap.  Some £ 2.475 million of this was allocated to mental handicap agencies in the Eastern Health Board region, including the agency referred to by the Deputy.  I am aware that since this allocation was provided there have been a number of emergency admissions to the services which have placed an additional financial burden on them.  In order to minimise the impact of these emergency admissions on existing services, I provided an additional grant of £ 350,000 to assist the Eastern Health Board and the relevant mental handicap agencies with the provision of additional placements, including the agency referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, based on information from the National Intellectual Disability Database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.  The Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap and, as outlined in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, particular emphasis will be put on the provision of adequate residential and respite services for those with a mental handicap.  As I have already explained, I am not yet in a position to comment on the level of funding which may be available for any particular services in 1998.</P>

      <P>With regard to the cost structures and payment system to pharmacies, the position is that the General Medical Services (Payments) Board reimburses the pharmacies in respect of the ingredient cost of the products dispensed under the GMS scheme, plus a dispensing fee in accordance with an agreed schedule of fees.</P>
      <P>In the case of patients covered under the drugs cost subsidisation, long-term illness, EEA visitors and the Health (Amendment) Act schemes, the board reimburses the pharmacy the ingredient cost of the medicine, plus the normal retail markup on ingredient cost and a standard fee.</P>
      <P>In the case of dispensing under the high tech scheme, the pharmacy is paid a monthly patient care fee in respect of each patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical card holders may have their GMS prescriptions dispensed at no cost to them, at any community pharmacy which is the holder of a contract.  There is no requirement under this scheme to register with any particular pharmacy. Under the high tech scheme, which covers a limited number of high tech medicines, both GMS and private patients are required to nominate a <Col N="1123" /> community pharmacy of their choice in order to obtain their medicines.</P>

      <Quest>the number of complaints received in 1996 or other recent year in relation to the refusal of general practitioners to prescribe certain drugs on the grounds that they were not available on the GMS; the system of incentives or inducements, if any, offered to general practitioners who keep the cost of their prescriptions under control; if he has satisfied himself that patients are receiving proper medical prescriptions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is a comprehensive list of essential drugs and medicines under the general medical services (GMS) scheme, which are available free of charge to medical card holders, on foot of a general practitioner's prescription. A number of products, generally those available without prescription on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis, are not available under the scheme. Approximately 15 representations are received each year by my Department on behalf of members of the public seeking to have OTC products included on the list of items reimburseable under the scheme.  As a prescription is not required for OTC items, the question of a doctor refusing to prescribe these products does not arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second element of the Deputy's question relating to incentives for doctors to prescribe efficiently and effectively, I should point out that the indicative drug target (IDT) scheme was introduced for general practitioners contracted under the general medical services (GMS) scheme on 1 January 1993.  The introduction of the IDT scheme followed a review of the GMS scheme in 1992 by the Department, the health boards, the Irish Medical Organisation, and the Irish College of General Practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the review mentioned above, it was agreed by all sides that medicines were not always prescribed in the most effective manner and that there was significant potential for an improvement in prescribing practice leading to better patient care and better use of available resources in the development of general practice. To assist in this process, doctors are provided with indicative drug targets each year for GMS patients on their panels.  These targets are constructed on the basis of average prescribing costs weighted by age and sex criteria.  As an incentive to doctors, the IDT scheme provides that a portion of the savings made would be made available to the individual doctor for practice development projects designed to improve the delivery of GP services.  The balance of the savings made is allocated <Col N="1124" /> to the relevant health board and for investment in general practice projects within the board's area.</P>
    <P>At every stage during the process of reaching agreement on the IDT scheme and in the subsequent implementation of that agreement, all of the parties to the review mentioned above clearly understood and accepted that it was the duty and obligation of doctors, individually and collectively, to provide the most appropriate management and to optimally utilise the available resources for patient care.  I would emphasise that the IDT scheme is a voluntary scheme and the right of the doctor to prescribe for the patient as he-she considers necessary, remains absolutely in place.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied therefore, that the IDT scheme places the utmost importance on patient care from the viewpoint of safe, rational and cost effective prescribing.  It is important to point out that the IDT scheme does not provide the general practitioner with a personal remunerative advantage, rather it provides a means for investment in facilities, equipment and services in his-her own practice in the first instance and for other practices in the health board's area.  Such investment is to the advantage of all patients of general practitioners.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities regarding this matter and I have been advised that urgent requests for MRI scans are assessed by a consultant radiologist in consultation with the referring clinician and given an immediate appointment.  I understand that there are currently 923 patients on Beaumont Hospital's MRI waiting list.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that an expert study of the existing arrangements for the provision of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) facilities nationwide and likely future demand in this area was carried out by Professor David Banta, MD, MPH, an international expert in health technology assessment.  Professor Banta identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital, with the Galway location as the top priority.  A timescale of three years is envisaged for the programme of enhancement for MRI facilities at the three sites. Professor Banta's recommendations have been adopted by the Department.  Currently the public hospital service avails of MRI facilities from Beaumont Hospital and the location of the new equipment at the three sites will further improve the accesss to this important diagnostic tool for patients and consequently will impact positively on national waiting times.</P>
      <P>The hospital authorities have further advised me that they have no record of a request for an MRI scan for this patient.  However, I understand that this patient has an out-patient appointment in Beaumont Hospital on 6 October 1997.  The scheduling of admission to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and each patient is assessed to determine their medical priority. Should this patient feel that her condition has deteriorated, she should return to her general practitioner, who will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case to the consultant directly.</P>

      <P>The report of the Expert Group on the Establishment of a Protocol for the Prescribing of Methadone set out recommendations for the involvement of general practitioners and community pharmacists in methadone maintenance programmes. It recommended that general practitioners should become involved by taking on responsibility for the care of opiate dependent persons who had first been stabilised at community drug treatment centres.  It also outlined the criteria necessary to ensure that methadone prescribing occurred in a controlled, responsible fashion.  Many elements of the protocol have been implemented.  Most notably, a central treatment list of patients being prescribed methadone has been established.  Under this arrangement a general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is on this treatment list and so minimise the possibility that the patient concerned is receiving methadone from more than one source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to proceed with the implementation of the protocol a methadone maintenance pilot project, involving general practitioners and pharmacists in the Eastern Health Board region, commenced <Col N="1129" /> in 1996.  It involved the selection of a number of patients who had been stabilised in drug treatment centres and who were referred to general practitioners in their own local area for continuation of methadone treatment and overall medical care.  This pilot programme included the key elements of the protocol which were: the provision of a personalised treatment card to each patient - this card was in turn presented to a local pharmacist who held it for the duration of treatment; support to GPs and pharmacists through the appointment of a GP facilitator; close liaison and communication arrangements with health board services in the event of a patient destabilising; and contractual arrangements with GPs, pharmacists etc.  Although the final results of the pilot programme have not been published, preliminary results show it was successful in providing a controlled system for the prescribing of methadone to opiate misusers.</P>
    <P>In January 1997 in the light of the evaluation of the pilot programme and also arising from the major developments in the Eastern Health Board in regard to the provision of treatment services for opiate misusers, my Department set up a group to review methadone treatment services for opiate misusers.  The review group set out a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring that the necessary supports and controls were in place to allow general practitioners and pharmacists to become more involved in methadone treatment programmes.  The group's recommendations are now being implemented.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 329 and 330 together.</P>
      <P>No compensatory payments were made to people by my Department in respect of flood damage in the period 1995 and 1997 and there are no funds available to me for such purposes. Local authorities are responsible for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads and bridges in their area, the costs of which are financed from their own resources supplemented by State grants.  In the normal course, the cost of remedial works arising as a result of flooding and storm damage must be met from these combined resources and local authorities are aware that they should set aside a contingency sum to finance any restoration works which may be necessitated by severe weather conditions.  In relation to north Mayo, the county council sought special grant assistance of £ 294,930 for repair works.  The bulk of this sum, £ 213,000 related to Glencullin bridge.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I approved an initial grant allocation of £ 50,000 under the EU co-financed scheme on 5 August 1997 towards the cost of emergency works and replacement of Glencullin bridge.  I understand that the council intends to submit an application under the EU scheme for funding the balance of the work in 1998.</P>
      <P>The provision of funding for national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority which has statutory responsibility for the management of the national road network, including the allocation of grants.</P>
      <P>In relation to housing, householders would normally be expected to have buildings and contents insured against losses of this nature and there are no funds available to me to assist householders in respect of any damage caused to houses by flooding. Local authorities may help through the provision of temporary accommodation, as was provided during the flash flooding in Mayo, and in necessitous cases, it is open to the health board to provide assistance to householders under the task force on special housing aid for the elderly to remedy damage to the householders' living conditions.  A health board may also assist a person, under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, where an urgent need arises.</P>

      <P>The valuation of all property for rating purposes is entrusted to the Commissioner of Valuation in the Valuation Acts, 1852-1988.  Local authorities are obliged to levy rates on all properties in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the Commissioner.  Nursing homes are exempt from rates if the buildings are used exclusively for charitable purposes and no private profit or gain results.  For the most part nursing homes are rateable because they do not meet these criteria and are, therefore, rateable in the same way as other commercial undertakings.  Where nursing homes fall to be rated, the rates liability falls not on the individual patients, but on the undertaking itself. Domestic dwellings were derated under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978.</P>

      <P>Article 9(1)(b) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 provided that antenna support structures, subject to certain criteria, would be exempted development for a transitional period of six months from the coming into force of the Regulations on 16 May 1994.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997 provided that, with effect from 12 February 1997 and subject to certain criteria, restrictions on the size, number and type of mobile phone antenna and compliance with certain emissions standards, the addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast and the replacement of an existing mast, were exempted development.  I have no plans for further exemptions.</P>
      <P>Guidelines on telecommunications antennae and support structures were published by my Department in July 1996.  The guidelines are intended to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications antennae and support structures within the planning system.  Together with the 1997 regulations referred to above, they promote co-location of antennae by mobile phone operators as a key measure to avoid the unnecessary proliferation of masts.  Local authorities and An Bord Pleanála are already statutorily obliged to have regard to the guidelines, being an expression of Government policy.</P>

      <P>The composition of litter was examined in a national litter survey undertaken in 1995.  The survey found the average breakdown of litter by weight to include the following: plastic content (e.g. bottles, bags, wrapping etc.), 15 per cent; paper content (e.g. newsprint, cardboard, packaging), 28 per cent; glass content (e.g. bottles, jars), 14 per cent; metal content (e.g. aluminium cans), 7 per cent; organic content (e.g. fruit, food), 29 per cent; other (e.g. cigarette ends, lollipop sticks), 7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now a matter for local authorities to avail of their enhanced powers under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, to combat litter pollution in their own functional areas.  To support local authority implementation, my Department will shortly promote a public information campaign on the duties and responsibilities of individuals <Col N="1138" /> and occupiers of property under the Act to raise public consciousness of the new law on litter.  I will also be making some limited grant assistance available to local authorities in the current year for selected projects by them to promote greater public awareness and education in relation to litter at local level.  Applications for grants from local authorities are currently being examined in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of effective measures for the management of their housing estates, including participation by tenants, is the responsibility of local authorities.  All housing authorities have adopted statements of their policy for the management of their housing stock as required by section 9 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.  The statements set out the authorities objectives and aims in relation to housing management, and the general strategies and specific measures to be employed in the attainment of these objectives and aims.  The Department circulated to authorities a memorandum on the preparation of statements of policy on housing management in order to assist and guide them in this task.</P>
      <P>There is no single uniform system of housing management which meets the requirements of all authorities.  In devising its system, a local authority must take account of many factors, such as the overall size of the authority's housing stock, the size of the individual estates, their location and environment etc. a system of management must be used flexibly and adapted to the different situations on each estate, local area and housing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the importance attached to the management of housing estates and to further assist local authorities in this task, my Department has taken a number of initiatives: a housing management group, representative of the main social housing interests, has been established to promote best practice in housing management.  Its first report contained best practice guidelines covering key aspects of estate management, <Col N="1139" /> including tenant involvement and staff-tenant training.  The group arranged regional workshops to promote the implementation of the guidelines throughout the country together with a workshop for city and county managers to secure commitments for early implementation.  A comprehensive regional network programme, which is being facilitated by the Institute of Public Administration, commenced last week.  This 1997-8 programme will build on, and develop, the dissemination of best practice.  The housing management initiatives grants scheme has funded pilot projects many of which related to training and development of staff and tenants to enable them to participate more fully in estate management.  The allocation for the scheme has been increased this year from £ 100,000 to £ 200,000.  A handbook on tenant participation in housing management, prepared by the Irish Council for Social Housing, was grant-aided by the Department.  My Department has co-operated with Area Development Management Ltd.  in the development and implementation of a training for trainers course in estate management and also co-operates in cross departmental initiatives which impact on the area of estate management.</P>
    <P>The housing management group is considering what further measures should now be taken to secure better estate management.  When its second report - expected shortly - is received, I will consider what further action may need to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The building regulations do not in themselves place a restriction on the height of buildings using timber frame construction. However, the use of combustible materials, including timber frame construction, is among the matters dealt with in the technical guidance documents which accompany the regulations. These documents provide guidance on how to comply with the requirements of the regulations.  While designers are free to depart from the guidance, they tend in practice to follow it.</P>
      <P>The technical guidance documents generally have been under review in my Department, in consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB).  Technical guidance document B, which deals with fire safety in buildings, provides guidance on requirements for fire resisting construction for particular situations e.g. party walls between buildings, walls and floors which divide a building into fire compartments, etc.  Such requirements are principally related to the height and use of the building.  The present guidance states that where 60 minutes fire resisting construction is required, the materials of construction should be wholly non-combustible. However, the guidance allows timber frame construction to be used for the party walls in the case of one and two storey houses.</P>
      <P>It is currently proposed that the existing guidance will be modified to limit the situations where 60 minute fire resisting construction is required to be non-combustible to the following: high buildings i.e. where the top floor is ten metres or more above ground level; residential institutional buildings e.g. hospitals and nursing homes; and party walls between buildings, except in the case of dwelling houses of one or two storeys, where the wall is part of a timber frame construction system.</P>
      <P>The proposed guidance in relation to party walls in houses of timber frame construction is still under consideration.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back-to-work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to long-term unemployed people to return to the active labour force.  The scheme is, therefore, designed to encourage persons who have been without a job for more than 12 months to return to work by providing them with a financial incentive for three years.  It is targeted at people who are unable to find employment without such a financial incentive.  It is a requirement of the scheme that an applicant must apply for the allowance prior to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned took up employment on 24 April 1997 but did not apply for the allowance until 4 July 1997.  Her application was refused on the grounds that she had been able to obtain employment without recourse to the scheme.  She submitted a letter of appeal but on review it was decided that there were no grounds for changing the original decision.  She was so informed on 18 July 1997.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of widow's non-contributory pension <Col N="1147" /> at the rate of £ 38.50 per week, based on a means assessment of £ 31.63 per week.  The means were derived mainly from her British retirement pension.  Her means were reviewed recently and on the basis of an increase in her British pension, her means were reassessed at £ 59.86 per week which had the effect of reducing her widow's pension to £ 13.50 from 27 June 1997.</P>
      <P>Her appeal against this decision was considered by an appeals officer who has decided that the means have been properly assessed in accordance with social welfare legislation.  She has been notified of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

An application for an increase in their pensions was made in January 1997.  This was considered and refused by a deciding officer on 11 April 1997.  The basis of this refusal was that the person concerned had failed to account for the disposal of £ 25,000 realised from the sale of a property.  An appeal was made on their behalf and an oral hearing has been arranged for 8 October 1997 in Ballina.</P>

      <P>The underlying purpose of the student summer jobs scheme is to provide income support for less well-off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and who are unable to obtain summer work.  In order to qualify under the scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to that applying in the case of unemployment assistance.  Those who established a minimum entitlement to unemployment assistance were approved to participate and issued with a job certificate.  As the person concerned did not satisfy the means test, he did not qualify to participate in this year's scheme.  He was so notified during week commencing 7 July 1997.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is under 66 years of age and in receipt of an invalidity pension from my Department.  Under the current free travel scheme conditions, invalidity pensioners may be entitled to a companion free travel pass if they are permanently confined to a wheelchair, or if a carer's allowance is in payment to people who are giving the applicants full-time care and attention, or if they are medically confirmed as visually impaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal method by which visual impairment is established for companion free travel pass purposes is that the applicant must either be registered as a blind person with the National Council-League of the Blind of Ireland, or provide a certificate from an ophthalmic physician for assessment by the Department's medical adviser to determine if the person concerned <Col N="1150" /> would satisfy the impairment condition as applied to the blind person's pension scheme.  A medical certificate was received by the Department for the person concerned from his doctor.  This stated that the person's eyesight had deteriorated and that he was unable to travel alone.  In the opinion of the Department's medical adviser, the evidence available was insufficient to establish that the person concerned was entitled to a companion free travel pass due to visual impairment. He continues to hold a valid standard free travel pass.  However, in the light of this question, the</P>
    <P>Department will arrange immediately for further information to be obtained about the visual impairment of the person concerned, with the aim of issuing him a companion free travel pass quickly if it is appropriate in his circumstances.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme is based on the assumption that people, mainly elderly, who are living alone on limited means, need a telephone in their home in case of an emergency and as a way of keeping in touch with friends and relations.  The allowance is limited to the payment of the standard rental plus a unit credit for free calls.</P>
      <P>The extension of the scheme to include the use of mobile telephones would therefore extend the remit of the scheme and could involve significant additional expenditure both for the Exchequer and the pensioner.  Any changes to the free telephone rental allowance scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 381, 390, and 398 together.</P>
      <P>The totals of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office in the years 1995 to the end of August 1997 were as follows: 1995, 12,353; 1996, 12,183; 1997, 9,212 (to 31 August).</P>
      <P>The average processing time of appeals finalised during 1996 was 18 weeks, an increase of one week on 1995.  Appeals involving oral hearings tend to be above this figure, whereas those where the appeal can be determined on the basis of the documentary evidence would be less. The period includes all phases of the appeals process, including, for example, where adjournments have been sought or where questions affecting the estates of deceased claimants are at issue.</P>
      <P>Social welfare appeals involve a degree of conflicting contentions which must be resolved.  For an appeal to get the attention it merits, the grounds advanced in support of it must be investigated. This often requires a further report by an investigating officer where, for example, a person's means are at issue or, for disability benefit claimants, a further examination by a medical assessor.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office has made significant progress in the six years since its establishment in 1991.  Up to the end of 1996 over 92,000 appeals had been processed and the number of appeals in hand has decreased from 8,287 at 31 December 1991 to 4,686 on 31 December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two additional appeals officers have been appointed with a view to eliminating remaining arrears as quickly as possible.  The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the achievement of further improvements in response times by reducing the time taken to process appeals is a high priority.  However, it is necessary to ensure that <Col N="1152" /> progress in this area is achieved in a manner which is consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all of its merits.</P>

      <P>A new payment - the one parent family payment - was introduced from 2 January 1997.  This scheme replaces the existing lone parent's allowance and incorporates the deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.  Where a separated spouse makes a claim after 2 January 1997, his-her entitlement must be considered under the legislation applying to the new scheme.  The person concerned claimed one parent family payment on 21 February 1997.  To qualify for this payment, she must have a dependent child living with her.  As the person concerned does not satisfy this condition, payment on her claim had to be refused.</P>
      <P>The person concerned did not claim deserted wife's benefit or allowance prior to January 1997 when those schemes were replaced.  Further inquiries are being made at present into the circumstances giving rise to her failure to make a claim.  When these inquiries are completed the question as to whether a claim can now be accepted will be determined.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 391, 394 and 400 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of July 9,516 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at an estimated full year cost of £ 36.4 million.  To extend the scheme to include members of religious orders would involve a significant increase in expenditure and I am not convinced <Col N="1156" /> it would be the best use of additional resources at this time.  In this year's Social Welfare Act a change was introduced to the rule which required that the carer must provide full-time care and attention in order to cater for those situations in which recipients of care attend approved rehabilitation courses.  The respite care fund, which was introduced by my Department in 1993 and is now administered by the Department of Health and Children, enables the carer to take short breaks from caring.</P>
    <P>In its An Action Programme for the Millenium the Government is committed to: progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; increasing the value of the allowance in real terms and in line with these commitments, I will consider the potential for the further development of the scheme in the context of an overall review of the provisions for carers, which is being carried out by my Department.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, as well as certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 497,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost of £ 32.4 million.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception.  They apply generally from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday inclusive and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4 p.m. to 7 a.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, those attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been put in place on city and provincial bus routes because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme, in common with the other free schemes operated by my Department, is kept under constant review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements.  The operation of the scheme is based on the use of spare capacity.  While the issue of time restrictions has been discussed with the CIE companies on a number of occasions, their position remains that <Col N="1157" /> the capacity constraints they face at peak hours do not allow for an easing of those time restrictions. I, however, will keep this issue under review.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who are physically or mentally challenged.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is an effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families. It is of particular importance to families on low incomes, as it is not taxable, is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc.  Child benefit, therefore, does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy direction over the past number of years, has been to concentrate resources on improving child benefit and the level of child benefit payments has been increased substantially. This year's improvements in child income support have been targeted to benefit low income <Col N="1158" /> families and in particular, larger families.  This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children by £ 5 to £ 39 per month and in addition, increasing the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child by £ 1 to £ 30 per month.</P>
    <P>Any proposals to extend entitlement to children up to the age of 21 in full-time education, would have to be considered in the light of available resources and overall budgetary priorities.</P>

His case was reviewed recently and, on the basis of increased means, his unemployment assistance was reduced to £ 50.90 per week.</P>
      <P>The case is at present with the Social Welfare Appeals Office which has requested the necessary documentation.  The appeal will be considered by an appeals officer when this is available.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 8 June 1995.  Payment was disallowed by a deciding officer from 21 December 1995 following an examination by a medical assessor who considered that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>In the context of her appeal against this decision she was examined by another medical assessor who was also of the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>Following an oral hearing of her appeal on 2 September 1996 an appeals officer of the Social Welfare Office decided that she was not incapable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts and disallowed her appeal.</P>

    <P>In June 1997 further medical evidence was submitted on behalf of the person concerned which has been considered by the appeals officer and the Department's chief medical adviser.  The appeals officer has decided that this additional <Col N="1161" /> information would not warrant a revision of his earlier decision.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for deserted wife's benefit in October 1996.  Her application was disallowed as the social insurance contribution condition was not satisfied.</P>
      <P>Her entitlement to a lone parent's allowance was subsequently examined.  One of the conditions for receipt of this allowance is that the claimant must make and continue to make reasonable efforts to prevail upon her husband to contribute to the support and maintenance of herself and her children.  This is based on the underlying principle, set out clearly in social welfare legislation, that the primary obligation lies with spouses to maintain each other and their children.</P>
      <P>In November 1996 the person concerned was requested by the Department to make appropriate efforts to get adequate maintenance from her husband through the District Court under Family Law.  Again in March, May and August of 1997, she was asked to provide evidence that she was seeking maintenance from her spouse through the courts.  During this period, the Department became aware that her husband had agreed to pay her informal maintenance of £ 20 per week. However, the deciding officer considers that this would not be adequate maintenance in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The person concerned indicated on 5 September 1997 that she intended to initiate court proceedings for maintenance from her husband. A decision will be made on her entitlements as soon as the Department receives confirmation from her of this action.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to a similar question on 9 July last.  As stated in that reply the steps necessary to give effect to the change of name of the Department will be implemented on a progressive basis as stocks of materials become depleted and replenished in the normal course.  Where opportunities arise other aspects of the name change will be effected with a view to minimising <Col N="1162" /> costs.  Additional costs have been negligible so far in 1997.</P>

      <P>The introduction of legislation to promote equality of people with disabilities is primarily a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who I understand has a number of legislative proposals in this area.</P>
      <P>My Department's mission is to promote social wellbeing through income and other supports which enable people to participate in society in a positive way.  The various income support and other schemes administered by the Department are designed to ensure that individuals, families and communities have the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country.  Accordingly, the existing social welfare legislation, which underpins the social welfare income support system, already promotes equality by providing the financial means whereby people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients can participate more fully in society.</P>
      <P>This year's Social Welfare Act, for instance, contained a comprehensive package of measures to further assist people with disabilities, including special increases in social welfare rates over and above the rate of inflation, which bring invalidity pension up to the target rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare; and disability allowance, blind person's pension and disability benefit up from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the CSW rate; a new part-payment of disability allowance for those in part-time residential care; and an additional payment of 50 per cent to recipients of carer's allowance providing care to more than one person.</P>
      <P>In addition, 1,000 places have been reserved under the back-to-work allowance scheme for a pilot scheme for people with disabilities, to facilitate their integration into mainstream employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further improvements in the income supports available to people with disabilities are being examined in a budgetary context, having regard <Col N="1163" /> to the commitments contained in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, and the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <P>Under the existing Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, an additional payment of £ 12 per acre is available to farmers who have land included in a proposed Natural Heritage Area (NHA) and, provided that the farmer has any NHA land, the additional payment is made on all of the farmer's land, up to a maximum of 100 acres.  There has been no change in this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food have had extensive negotiations with the farming organisations on the implementation in Ireland of the EU Habitats Directive, which requires member states to protect their most important natural areas by designating them as special areas of conservation SACs.  It has been agreed to propose to the European Commission that REPs will provide for additional top-up payments for those with land in these SAC areas, and again, it has been agreed that these additional amounts will be payable; where a farmer has any SAC land, on all of his land up to 100 acres; and between 100 and 300 acres, top-ups will be paid on SAC land only.  The amounts payable and <Col N="1166" /> eligibility criteria are currently the subject of discussion with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal to modify this agreement. However, it appears that in a limited number of cases very small areas of SAC land are being acquired purely to avail of additional payments under REPS and mechanisms are being looked at to ensure that the system is not manipulated in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422 and 423 together.</P>
      <P>The practice of falconry, including the issuing of licences for the taking of peregrines from the nest, is facilitated by Articles 7 and 9 of Council Directive (79/409/EEC) on the conservation of wild birds (the Birds Directive) and is regulated by the Wildlife Act, 1976 (Birds of Prey) Regulations, 1984.  These regulations provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the issue of licences to (a) possess eagles, hawks or falcons and (b) engage in falconry with eagles, hawks or falcons.  While in most cases applicants for licences under these regulations apply for both licences, they are not mutually dependent and can be issued independently. Accordingly, there is no statutory requirement on persons possessing peregrine falcons under licence to engage in falconry.  In some cases, peregrine held in captivity may not engage in falconry due to injury or involvement in breeding programmes.</P>
      <P>The Widlife Act, 1976 (Birds of Prey) Regulations, 1984 also provides for the taking of wild birds from the nest under licence.  In the case of peregrine falcons, the current population within the State is estimated at 350 breeding pairs.  With a reproduction rate of 1.5 to 2 young per year, this would give an estimated maximum population of some 1,400.  The number of nestlings permitted to be taken from the nest is determined by reference to EU pre-set criteria.  Since 1994 five nestlings per annum are permitted to be taken from the nest and since 1993 a total of 26 were taken under licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population of sparrowhawks in the island of Ireland is based on the 1988-1991 New Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland and is estimated at some 11,000 pairs.  With the exception of two white tailed eagles introduced and <Col N="1168" /> released on Inishvickillane, County Kerry, no species of hawk has been introduced and released into the wild in Ireland in the last ten years. However, a number of miscellaneous birds of prey such as harris hawks and goshawks are imported from time to time for falconry.</P>
    <P>No figures or estimates are available of the number of wild birds killed by birds of prey each year.  However, in the natural order of things, a healthy balance is usually reached and maintained between predator and prey.</P>
    <P>The use of falcons to hunt and kill wild birds is very much part of the ancient sport of falconry and replicates the natural predatory instincts of the birds in the wild.  Falconry is regulated and permitted by the Wildlife Act, 1976 (Birds of Prey) Regulations, 1984.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that falconry in Ireland has no adverse impact on the conversation status of our native wild birds and conforms with the principles of wise use set out in the Birds Directive.</P>

      <P>The population of skylarks in Ireland is estimated to be of the order of 400,000 to 500,000 breeding pairs.  There is some evidence of a decline in the population in some lowland farmland due to agricultural intensification and changes in farming practices, e.g. spring grass rolling, silage cutting, autumn sowing of cereals and the use of herbicides.</P>

      <P>Some 147 proposals involving requests for assistance amounting to £ 61.7 million were received under Phase II of the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme, including an application in respect of the development of a music school in Clonmel, County Tipperary. A total of £ 4,912 million was available for allocation to projects.  The promoters of the Clonmel music school project, Tipperary South Riding County Council, were informed on 25 June 1997 following completion of the evaluation procedure that the application had not been successful.  In these circumstances I am not in a position to provide funding for this project.</P>

      <P>On 4 June 1997, Bord Scannán na hÉireann established, under section 16 of the Film Board Act, 1980, a committee to which would be delegated the functions of a Screen Commission on behalf of the board.  I am considering the appropriateness of this structure in the context of my review of film policy generally.</P>

      <P>Both the PIANO and FORTE reports recommended the establishment of an Irish Academy for the Performing Arts. However, the Deputy will appreciate that while this is a matter of cultural significance, the question of establishing such an academy is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 453, 454, 465, 467, 470, 478, 484, 485, 486, 488, 489, 494, 500, 501, 504, 507, 508, 509, 524 and 532 together. <Col N="1181" /> I have already made an Order commencing sections 1, 2, 5, 22 and 25 of the Refugee Act, 1996, with effect from 29 August last.</P>
      <P>There is in being at present a High Court injunction preventing the appointment of a Refugee Applications Commissioner under the Act. Because of this litigation, I am not in a position to appoint a Refugee Applications Commissioner, an appointment central to the introduction of the remaining sections of the Act.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the number of applications for asylum in the State continues to increase.  This is a source of concern to me, as Minister for Jutice, Equality and Law Reform, and also to my ministerial colleagues having regard to the impact on State services dealing with welfare, housing, health care and so forth.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing the entire situation, in conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues with responsibilities in these areas, with a view to taking whatever measures are required to deal quickly and fairly with asylum applicants.  Should those measures include proposals for legislation, such proposals will be brought forward in the usual way.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam, which was agreed unanimously by the member states subject to the relevant national ratification procedures contains a Protocol on asylum for nationals of member states of the European Union.  The preamble to the Protocol states explicitly that the Protocol &ldquo;respects the finality and the objectives of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the status of refugees&rdquo;.  The Government is fully satisfied that the new Protocol is consistent with the obligations of member states under the 1951 Convention, and this was an important point for Ireland in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Moreover, a Treaty Declaration explicitly confirms that the Protocol &ldquo;does not prejudice the right of each member state to take the organisational measures it deems necessary to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the status of refugees&rdquo;. Ireland will, of course, continue to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Convention and to take the organisational measures necessary in that regard.</P>

    <P>Any outcome will have to be reconciled with the overall policy of the Government on public service pay.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 459, 460 and 461 together.</P>
      <P>While it was initially proposed to refurbish and extend the Garda station at Claremorris, consideration is now being given to building a new district headquarters on the site of the existing Garda station.  The legal formalities to complete the purchase of an adjoining strip of land are in train.  In the meantime, the brief of requirements is under review by Garda management.  It is not possible to say when the work will be carried out. However, detailed planning will proceed in line with overall priorities.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of policy that prisoners are provided with medical treatment equivalent to that available to citizens covered by the public health/general medical services.  Part-time medical officers are assigned to each prison and place of detention and are responsible, in general, for the medical welfare of offenders. Medical officers are assisted by specially trained prison medical orderlies who normally possess a knowledge of nursing and first aid.  Where it is not possible to provide the treatment recommended in the prison environment an offender may be escorted to and from a local hospital for outpatient treatment or may be admitted to hospital if a longer stay is required.</P>
      <P>Depending on the individual circumstances, a decision is made in each case as to whether the prisoner is given temporary release or is kept under escort while in hospital.  A prisoner admitted to hospital can only be returned to prison when discharged by the hospital.  If ongoing treatment, or further hospital visits for tests etc., are required, this is arranged by the Prison Governor on the advice on the Prison Doctor acting in consultation with the external consultant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the convention on the transfer of sentenced persons, the two states involved in processing a transfer request are required to exchange information about the sentenced person.  The information includes a copy of the judgment and the law on which it is based, sentence administration particulars and medical/social reports.  These must be obtained from a number of different sources, including various agencies who have to be contacted in order to submit reports, etc.  Owing to the complexity of the documentation required and the fact that some of these cases go back twenty or so years, the process of information exchange is not one which can be completed quickly.  For these reasons and the fact that each case is considered on its own individual and particular merits, the timescale for completing a transfer can vary significantly from one case to another.  It is therefore difficult to state how long it may take for any application to be processed, but on the basis of the transfers completed to date (24 September 1997) from the United Kingdom, the average processing period from date of receipt of the application to date of transfer ranged from two to 18 months and averages out at nine months approximately.</P>
      <P>While the person referred to in the question has, I understand, declared his interest in a transfer to this jurisdiction, no formal application from the United Kingdom authorities has yet been received in my Department.  However, my Department is in regular contact with the United Kingdom authorities in relation to each application received.  In this case, a request has been made for the necessary documentation to be transmitted as soon as possible for our consideration. I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to process this application, as indeed with any other application, as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to comment in detail about the individual Garda investigations.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the specific area mentioned in this question has suffered considerably from the drugs problem but that considerable improvement has been made there through the Garda and the community working closely together.</P>
      <P>A member of the public may make a complaint about improper conduct by a member of the Garda Síochána to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board.  Any such complaint will be investigated provided it is deemed admissible by the Chief Executive under the terms of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.  Any decision by the chief executive that a complaint is not admissible may be appealed by the complainant to the board.</P>

      <P>Up to December 1995 the Probation and Welfare Service assisted the courts by providing reports in family law cases although there was no statutory requirement to do so.  The Family Law Act, 1995, and subsequent Family Law legislation has put a statutory obligation from 1 August 1996 on the Probation and Welfare Service to provide reports to the courts.  Due to increasing work demands, especially in regard to criminal law work, the Probation and Welfare Service has not been able to deliver a family law service since the end of 1995.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in regular contact with the Department of Finance in an effort to secure additional resources to meet these new demands.  These efforts are continuing.  I am fully aware of the need to meet the court's requirements in this regard and I would be hopeful that progress can be made fairly soon.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area in question is patrolled by mobile units from Kilmainham Garda Station. Furthermore, the area is adjacent to Rialto where there is constant Garda presence, through Operation Dóchas, and this cover extends to the adjoining streets and provides a noticeable Garda presence.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the area will continue to receive appropriate Garda attention.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in March 1996 the person to whom the parliamentary question refers was involved in a traffic accident arising from which proceedings were instituted against the other person involved in the accident.  A summons was issued and subsequently reissued.  However, the Gardaí report that they were unable to effect service of the summons on the defendant.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> In relation to the Circuit Criminal Court, prior to the legal year 94/95 Circuit Court statistics were collated on the basis of the number of new cases received in each legal year rather than on the number of cases dealt with.  Statistics on the number of criminal cases dealt with by the Circuit Criminal Court in the legal years ending 31/7/90 to 31/7/94 are therefore not available.</P>
    <P>Statistics on the number of accused persons convicted or acquitted are only available for both the Circuit Criminal and Central Criminal Court for year ending 31/7/97.</P>

      <P>The deployment of Garda personnel and resources to different areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the current strength (all ranks) at Balbriggan Garda station is 31 members.  There are three mobile units allocated to Balbriggan Garda station which is open for 24 hours per day. The district patrol car operates on a 24 hour basis and is augmented by patrols performed by detective branch and crime unit members.  I am also informed by the Garda authorities that there are 11 neighbourhood watch schemes in the Balbriggan Sub-District.  Crime figures show a downward trend from 1995 to 1996 while the provisional figures for 1997 would indicate that this trend is continuing.</P>
      <P>The divisional officer remains satisfied with the present policing arrangements and he feels that the present strength is adequate to meet the demands placed on the services.  However, I am assured by the Garda authorities that policing arrangements are kept under continued review and changes made as necessary.</P>

      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, a visa was sought to enable the person concerned to make a short visit here.  The visa was issued last January solely for this stated purpose. In supporting the visa application, her sponsor guaranteed that she would abide by the laws of the State and would leave within the three month time period specified in the visa application. The person concerned has not complied with the conditions attached to the granting of the visa based on the guarantees given which precluded, for example, seeking employment while <Col N="1196" /> in the State and, in addition, she is now residing here without the necessary permission as required by law.  As a general rule, non-nationals who are subject to visa controls are required to abide by the specific conditions attached to the granting of a visa in any particular instance.  Such a requirement is essential in the national interest to protect the integrity of our visa procedures and to ensure that the genuine reason for which a visa is sought is advanced at the time of application. A visa national seeking to enter the State for the purpose of employment is required to obtain an appropriate work visa in advance of entry following the issue of a work permit relevant to the employment in question.  I have no proposals to amend the procedures which are in line with accepted international practice in this area and which are necessary to prevent, for instance, potential abuse of the labour market.</P>

      <P>I understand that in the light of concerns which had been raised about the position in relation to security of tenure of long-term tenants in private rented accommodation, a working group was established by my predecessor in 1994 to examine and report on the position of security of tenure in the private rented sector, with particular reference to any changes which may be desirable to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980.  The group consisted of representatives of the legal profession, the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute, Threshold and the Departments of the Environment and Justice.</P>
      <P>The working group submitted proposals in relation to the issue of the right of such tenants to a new tenancy.  I am examining these proposals at present with a view to submitting them, together with my recommendations, to Government as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current manpower strength (as of 31/8/97) of Tipperary Garda station is 27 members (all ranks) and they have no plans at present to assign additional gardaí to the station.  The gardaí in the area enjoy strong levels of support and co-operation from the community they serve.  They are also alert to the need to deal with any drugs problem and, in fact, have carried out 61 searches under drugs legislation in the last two years in the area.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a decision on the establishment of a specialised unit must be considered in the context of the potential benefits of having such a unit and the potential loss of redeploying Garda members from regular (non-specialised) duties.  The gardaí are not satisfied, at present, of the need to establish a local drugs unit in Tipperary town.  The matter will remain under review, however, with due regard to operational requirements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 522 and 526 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for a disabilities Bill, which will set out the rights of persons with a disability, together with means of redress for those whose <Col N="1201" /> rights are denied, are included in the list of promised legislation contained in the Government press release of 25 September 1997.  These proposals will be considered by Government in the context of the plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities which will be submitted to it by an inter-departmental task force chaired by my Department on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  In the course of their deliberations, the Government will have regard to legal advice in relation to the matter of reasonable accommodation.  Reasonable accommodation was one of the provisions of the Employment Equality Bill, 1996 found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Also, the Government is committed to the introduction of an Employment Equality Bill as soon as possible and a revised Equal Status Bill is also being prepared.  The former Bill will prohibit discrimination in employment on nine distinct grounds, including the ground of disability.  The latter Bill will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds including disability and will apply to non-workplace issues such as the provision of goods, services and accommodation.</P>
    <P>These Bills, while drafted along similar lines to their predecessors, will require to be modified having regard to the Supreme Court's findings.</P>
    <P>The question of whether further legislation will be required to improve the situation of people with disabilities will be considered in the light of the plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities which is being prepared by the inter-departmental task force.</P>

      <P>The position is that certain local community-based youth diversion projects, which are funded by the probation and welfare service have, from time to time, arranged visits abroad for a small number of young people participating in the projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions are made, not by the probation and welfare service itself, but by the local project management committees - though the probation and welfare service is represented on these committees. <Col N="1203" /> It is a matter for local project management to assess the value of such trips in each individual case.  The position in 1997 to date is that:</P>
    <P>(1) Six young people attending the WHAD project in Ballyfermot went on a trip to Wales by minibus as part of a training programme. The cost of this trip was under £ 500 and it was an integral part of outreach work with troubled young people who are making a fresh start.</P>
    <P>(2) As part of a merit scheme in a behaviour modification programme one youth residing in Lionsvilla Probation Hostel, run by the Dublin Lions Club, won a trip to Livepool to see his team play in a premiership match.  The cost of the trip was £ 150, which was sponsored by the management committee.</P>
    <P>In 1996, six trainees from the Tower Programme, North Clondalkin, went to Germany for one week as part of an exchange programme.  This programme was in receipt of EU funding and the transitional exchange requirement was an integral part of the EU Programme (HORIZON).</P>
    <P>My Department also makes funds available to a number of Garda community based youth diversion projects which are aimed at young people at risk of getting involved in crime.  Information on possible trips abroad by young persons involved in these projects is not readily available and it would cost a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources to obtain it.</P>

      <P>The law already prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail without a licence.  Under section 7 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924 it is an offence to sell, expose for sale, or keep for sale by retail any intoxicating liquor without being licensed to do so.  Persons convicted of such an offence are liable to a fine of up to £ 50, with up to six months imprisonment in default of payment, and to for-feiture of all intoxicating liquor found in their possession.  In addition section 50 of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, as amended by the Finance Act, 1992, provides for a £ 1,000 penalty for the unlicensed sale of intoxicating liquor.</P>
      <P>I shall take into account the Deputy's concerns in relation to the penalties for unlicensed trading in the context of any suitable amending legislation in this area.  Amendment of the Finance Acts would of course be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <P>(* It should be noted that the decisions taken do not necessarily relate to applications made in the period).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> It is currently taking of the order of two years to decide on individual cases.  The delay is due to the fact that the current procedures, which date back to 1985, were adequate to deal with 30 to 60 applications a year but these procedures are totally inadequate to deal with the large increase in asylum applications over the past three years, and over the past year in particular.  This has caused the build up of a significant backlog of cases awaiting finalisation.  Mechanisms for the clearance of this backlog are currently being examined in my Department and the UNHCR are being consulted in the matter.</P>

    <P>In the light of applications from all three post-primary <Col N="1210" /> schools in Naas for the provision of increased accommodation, the Planning Section of my Department undertook a major review to determine the short, medium and long-term needs of these schools.  This review was subsequently extended to include the future accommodation needs of primary schools in the Naas post-primary school catchment area, including those in the areas referred to by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>The review is now well advanced and when completed and assessed, the planning section of my Department will be in contact with the schools.  I can assure the Deputies that I am aware of the situation and that there will be no undue delay in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 544, 545, 546 and 578 together.</P>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grant) Act, 1968 provides for the award of grants by local authorities for the pursuit of third level studies based, <i>inter alia,</i> on compliance with means test limits that may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Act also provides that means shall be calculated in such manner and by reference to such matters as may be specified from time to time by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specfic means test arrangements adverted to by the Deputies have been in operation since <Col N="1211" /> 1983 and are applied nationally.  It would not necessarily be anomalous to have different criteria applied for the purposes of assessing individuals for tax and for the purposes of allocating limited resources as fairly and equitable as possible. For example, certain forms of income are exempt from tax to encourage particular activities.  It is also important to have regard to the fact that net income is the result of personal financial decision making.  Assessment of gross income avoids discrimination on the basis of such personal financial decisions.</P>
    <P>I recently announced that arrangements have been made to examine the question of rationalising the various student support schemes and having them administered by a single agency.  A group has been established to examine the issues involved and to report back.  Means testing arrangements, including issues such as those raised by the Deputies, will be examined as part of the group's work.</P>

      <P>A uniform pupil teacher ratio of approximately 22 to one applies to all mainstream rural and urban primary schools.  I assume, therefore, that the Deputy is referring to the reduced class size which is a feature of the urban dimension of the breaking the cycle pilot project.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in question applies to the junior classes of the 25 schools selected for inclusion in the urban dimension of the pilot project. These schools were selected on the basis of objective criteria devised by the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>The support measures made available to urban and rural schools under Breaking the Cycle were recommended by the ERC following a detailed study of educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings.  The support packages differ only to the extent that the reduced pupil ratio of 15 to one applies to urban schools but not to rural schools.</P>
      <P>There are 123 schools included in the rural dimension of this pilot project and a total of 25 locally based co-ordinators have been appointed to service these schools.</P>
      <P>The ERC has been commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of both the rural and urban dimensions of this pilot project.  As part of this review, the appropriateness and effectiveness of the two distinct approaches, urban and rural, will be examined.  The effect of the reduced pupil teacher ratio in the urban schools will be an important part of the review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 548, 558 and 600 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the action programme for the new millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 103 one teacher primary schools throughout the country which have ten or more pupils.  A further 24 primary schools were due to become one teacher schools from September 1997.  However, following my appointment as Minister for Education, I made special arrangements to ensure that these schools would retain their two-teacher status for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to all one teacher schools with ten or more pupils.</P>

      <P>In general, primary school transport routes are organised so that no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils who live off the main route are expected to make their own way to a pick-up point.  Home pick-ups were never envisaged as part of the school transport scheme.  To provide a door to door service on a countrywide basis would be unsustainable for operational and cost reasons.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, Gaelscoileanna have enjoyed a lower pupil-teacher ratio because of their significant role in strengthening the position of Irish in the education system in areas where Irish is not the spoken language.  Successive Governments have operated this policy over a number of years, and I am satisfied that this favourable treatment is warranted.  It is particularly important in the European context that we promote our unique identity by fostering and developing our language and culture throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am committed to reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in all primary schools, including schools located in the Gaeltacht.  However, unfortunately resources currently available do not permit me to apply the same staffing schedule to Gaeltacht primary schools as applies to Gaelscoileanna.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>For both pupils and schools, roll books constitute a historically important record of pupils' names, dates of birth, dates of enrolment, addresses, class divisions, attendances and absences.  It is the responsibility of the principal teacher to ensure that the information contained in the roll books is accurate.  The cross-checking and correlation of data entered on pupils' attendances and absences form an essential part of this process.  While the principal carries ultimate responsibility, this task may be delegated to the vice-principal or to holders of posts of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to its historical importance, the information recorded in school roll books is crucial to the administration not only of each individual school but also of the system as a whole.  In the case of each individual school, among the matters which are determined on the basis of the information contained in roll books are the school staffing, capitation grants, principal's allowances, posts of responsibilty, maintenance grants, accommodation needs and future planning, transport services and special needs provision. The availability of this information is obviously of crucial importance also to the administration of the system at a national level. <Col N="1221" /> While I am conscious of the need to minimise the additional duties imposed on principals, in light of the value of the information provided, I have no plans at the moment to alter the need for primary school principals to correlate all the details required by the traditional roll books in use in each school.</P>

      <P>My Department is acutely aware of the standard of accommodation available at St. Enda's national school, Scotshouse, County Monaghan and accordingly this school was included in the capital building programme to enable the project progress through the various planning stages.  In view of the particular circumstances an outline programme of works was agreed with the school authorities and urgent minor works have been completed prior to commencement of major works for which architectural planning is under way.  Upon completion of architectural planning, a decision will be taken regarding the timing of the tender/contract process having regard to competing priorities and the availability of funding.</P>
      <P>With regard to remedial teachers, I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools.  My capacity to allocate such posts in any year is dependent on the availability of surplus posts arising from the demographic decline in the primary system.  Such posts as became available from this source for the 1997-98 school year were largely allocated by my predecessor as part of an agreement with the Irish National Teachers Organisation on overall staffing arrangements.</P>
      <P>For the current school year, a total of 54 additional remedial teachers have been allocated to primary schools.  This brings the total number of remedial teachers in the primary system to 1,242.</P>

Grant-aid of some £ 14,000 was provided to the girl's school in the same period.  Due to lack of available capital, it was not possible to undertake major building projects at either school.</P>

      <P>I understand that the individual appointed as remedial teacher to this cluster left this position on 31 August 1977.  It is the responsibility of the board of management of the base school to fill the resulting vacancy by recruiting a suitable replacement teacher.</P>

      <P>The psychological service provided by my Department is currently available to a limited number of national schools, with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  My Department shares the concern expressed in the question in relation to young people who are poorly motivated and who drop out of school.  There has been a psychologist available from my Department to the schools referred to since April 1995.  Pupils, parents and teachers have access to this service through the school principals.  The psychologist assigned to the schools visits them on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Members of my Department's psychological service who are deployed in primary schools carry out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow.  In addition, they engage in a certain amount of casework with those pupils and parents who would benefit from counselling in the school situation.  The psychologists also provide advice to teachers in relation to pupils who have emotional and behavioural difficulties.</P>
      <P>Where difficulties are perceived to be more serious, the psychologists refer pupils to appropriate specialist agencies, including the social work services of the health authorities.  Parents also have access to these agencies through the school medical service or the family doctor.  Availability of these services is a matter for the appropriate health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> I have already announced my intention that there should be a national educational psychological service available to all schools as well as to preschool children and to students who drop out of school at late primary or early second level. Decisions on the level of service appropriate to particular areas will await the report of the planning group which is to present detailed proposals for the national educational psychological service to me early in 1998.</P>

      <P>The matter of this child's long wait for an assessment was first brought to the attention of my Department in June 1997, shortly before the schools closed for the summer break.  The child attends one of the primary schools served by my Department's psychological service.  Now that the new term has started, the psychologist concerned will arrange to assess the child during his next visit to the school.</P>
      <P>Members of my Department's psychological service who are deployed in primary schools carry out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow.  After consultation with school principals, the psychologists give priority to pupils who are perceived in school to be most urgently in need of psychological help.  Because of the constraints of time, it is possible that some pupils may have to wait longer than is ideal for assessment. Parents who are concerned about any apparent delay may approach the psychological service directly for advice.</P>
