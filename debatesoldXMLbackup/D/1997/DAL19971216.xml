    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The previous Government established a Cabinet committee on drugs, chaired by the Taoiseach, to give overall political leadership in the fight against drugs, to review all trends in the drugs problem, to assess progress in the strategy to deal with it and to resolve policy and organisational difficulties which might inhibit an effective response.  Recognising the links between social exclusion, drug abuse and alienation, the Government decided the most strategic way to tackle the problem of social exclusion was to reconstitute the drugs committee into a wider Cabinet committee which would address disadvantage in its broadest sense.  That committee, which continues to be chaired by the Taoiseach, links the work being done under the Local Development Operational Programme and the national anti-poverty strategy as well as the national drugs strategy.</P>
      <P>The committee meets, as appropriate, to review progress in the implementation of these strategies, to resolve difficulties that might arise and direct the work of bodies such as the National Drugs Strategy Team, which was set up to progress the implementation of the various strategies.  Between meetings, relevant Ministers, individually and acting together on relevant issues, ensure the various elements of the Government's social inclusion programme are progressed in so far as they relate to their areas of responsibility.</P>
      <P>As announced in the budget, an initial allocation of £1.25 million has been made by the Government towards the establishment of a youth services development fund in 1998, which will be administered by the Department of Education and Science.  Detailed arrangements for the administration of the fund, including the issue of corporate contributions, are currently being developed by the Department of Education and Science for final consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sixth week in which I have tabled Questions Nos. 1 and 2 and I thank whoever who is responsible for arranging to have them taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the youth services development fund established by the committee of Ministers of which I was chairman be implemented by the Government?  The Minister of State said an initial payment of £1.25 million has been allocated in the budget.  Does that mean the previous Government's commitment to provide £20 million for the fund is being honoured in full?  Are procedures laid down for accessing money from the fund?  If so, will the Minister of State make them available to the House?  How widely will the moneys be disbursed?  Will they be disbursed within the areas identified by the local drugs task forces only or does he propose to disburse them on a wider <Col N="191" /> basis?  Has he had any success in leveraging similar funding from the private sector?  Does he recall the recommendation of Deputy Currie and others was prompted by a speech from Dr. Michael Smurfit who drew attention to the menace of drugs and their significance for society. The implication from different soundings at that time was that the corporate sector would contribute substantial funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats might talk to Smurfit about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Administration promised to establish a youth services development fund to deal with the misuse of drugs.  The Government has decided to establish the fund and has provided the initial capital to do so. Deputy Rabbitte raised a number of issues.  In regard to accessing funds, the fund will be administered by the Department of Education and Science. Allocations from the fund will be made on the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs.  We will continue to have a significant role to play in the allocation of funds.</P>
      <P>It is expected the youth services development fund will be targeted at the areas covered by the local task forces on drug misuse.  Some 12 of these task forces have been established in Dublin and one in Cork.  Private sector and corporate funding is an important issue.  We have already received what I might describe as feelers from the corporate sector about the provision of funding for the youth services development fund.  These matters must be thrashed out in detail and the specific mechanism for allowing the corporate sector to participate will be worked out by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.  It is an important fund which will be targeted at the areas covered by the local drugs task forces.  It will make a further contribution, particularly in the youth services area, to tackling the underlying causes which give rise to drug misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify if total funding of £20 million is provided for in the 1998 financial year?  Is it a good idea for the Minister for Education and Science to have this budgetary role?  Given its specific purpose, the Minister's responsibility in the area of local development and his involvement in the drugs strategy, would it not be more appropriate within his remit?  What does he mean by saying the Cabinet subcommittee meets as often as appropriate?  How many times has it met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Administration of which he was a member recommended that a sum of £20 million be provided over a three year period for the youth services development fund.  While £10 million was provided by his Administration in 1997 for the local drugs task forces and the national drugs <Col N="192" /> strategy team, no such funds were provided for the youth services development fund, although it was recommended that it should be established on 1 January 1998.  The Government has given a commitment to establishing the youth services development fund and has provided £1.25 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that although £10 million was provided for use in 1997 by the local drugs task forces, much of that money cannot be drawn down until the programmes and projects are in place.  That is a matter for the local drugs task forces operating through the national drugs strategy team.  We must proceed with the establishment of the youth services development fund and the various criteria attaching to that.  An announcement will be made shortly about the mechanism for the establishment of the fund for tapping into the corporate sector.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's comment about the involvement of the Department of Education and Science in this fund, it has considerable experience of funding youth services projects.  It will have an important role to play in the fight against drug misuse.  The decision to place this fund within the remit of the Department of Education and Science is good bearing in mind the skill and expertise it has displayed in similar situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm it is still the Government's intention to set aside £20 million for the youth services development fund over a three year period and that 18 per cent or £1.25 million will be spent within the next year?  How many times has the sub-committee met since its inception?  Is it intended to establish riding instructions for the Department of Education and Science so that there will be a sufficient bias in favour of communities worst afflicted by the drugs problem?  Will he ensure such instructions will be given to the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and local development on drugs is chaired by the Taoiseach and meets as often as required.  It has met once since the Government came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of its members continues. The purpose of the sub-committee is to co-ordinate efforts to tackle social exclusion and to deal with and clear up policy difficulties which might arise.  That has happened and one decision it took is covered in the budget.  A sum of £0.75 million has been made available to establish a number of pilot projects to seek to co-ordinate the delivery of services into areas of most disadvantage in a better and more effective way.  Many of these areas are covered by local drugs task forces and we must try to develop a system whereby the provision of services by all statutory agencies and the community and voluntary sectors will be carried out on a co-ordinated basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="193" />
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that all that is clear from his replies is that the Cabinet sub-committee has met once and an allocation of £1.25 million has been agreed?  Will he state specifically the contribution his Government intends to make to the fund?  Will it be the sum of £20 million recommended by the previous Government or will it be another amount?  I am sure he accepts there are many communities, projects and organisations trying to fight the drugs threat in areas of social exclusion waiting today for answers to these questions.  They have no chance to deal with this problem without a commitment from the Government to the sum of £20 million at the very least.  This contribution is critical to divert young people away from heroin and other drugs in areas with which he is familiar.</P>
      <P>Will he state clearly the amount of money the Government is committed to spending on youth services' funds?  Is the Government, which made such a hue and cry about the drugs issue prior to the last election, sending out the wrong message by virtue of the fact that its special sub-committee has met once, the intended allocation has been cut from £20 million to £1.25 million and we cannot get answers to very simple questions?  Many communities see the allocation of £1.25 million in the context of a £20 million contribution to an organisation that does not need it, to build a stadium it is fully able to finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Government to establish the youth services development fund is a signal that the proposal contained in the ministerial task force on this matter is being implemented.  The Cabinet sub committee responsible for local development, the national anti-poverty strategy and the national drugs strategy brings the three groups together.  The Government has continued to provide funding for the local drugs task forces.  In the financial figures for 1998 is a sum of £10 million, a continuation of the funding of £10 million provided each year for the implementation of the policy of the national drugs strategy team.  A significant issue, as we campaign to fight against the misuse of drugs, particularly in the targeted areas, is that these areas have suffered extreme neglect by different statutory authorities in the past for different reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on social exclusion and drugs has decided to tackle this issue in a co-ordinated way, to implement the efforts of the local drugs task forces and to identify <Col N="194" /> the underlying causes of specific areas being ravaged by the effects of drugs misuse.  It has decided to involve the local community and voluntary sector and to challenge the statutory agencies on why these specific areas were allowed deteriorate to such an extent that they have become ravaged because of drugs misuse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The local drugs task forces will seek to tackle the underlying causes in the specific areas where there is massive drug misuse.  That is the proper and the best mechanism for dealing with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs chaired by the Taoiseach has met only once and, seemingly, has made only one decision, which effectively was to reduce the level of spending from a high of £20 million to £1.25 million, will he agree that to do its work this committee should meet on a regular basis to monitor the work of the other agencies? The effect of its meeting only once in six months is that it is simply a window dressing exercise and is a new level of neglect of this area of social exclusion and the menace from drugs.  Will he indicate when this committee will meet next?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>

      <P>As a member of that sub-committee I spend practically all my time dealing with the misuse of drugs, the local task forces and the national drugs strategy team, which is responsible to me.  The other constituent members continue with their work in terms of the national anti-poverty strategy.  I am responsible for local development which plays a fundamental part in tackling the issue of neglect in some of these areas.  It is incorrect to say the work of the Cabinet sub-committee is not continuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently the Government approved the balance of the funding for the local drugs task forces.  The amount is significant.  At its meeting today the Government approved funding of £922,000 for Ballyfermot; £645,000 for Ballymun; £752,990 for Blanchardstown; £820,000 for the canal communities; £943,000 for Clondalkin; <Col N="195" /> £566,700 for Cork; £636,000 for the Dublin 12 area; £567,865 for the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area; £716,500 for the Finglas-Cabra area; £728,000 for north-east Dublin; £770,000 for the north inner city; £986,220 for the south inner city, and £695,700 for Tallaght.  The local drugs task forces will be notified by the national drugs strategy team of the individual allocations from each of these sums.  The decision was based on the work of the Cabinet subcommittee on social exclusion and drugs.  The total amount to be allocated comes to £4.9 million.</P>

      <P>In a year when a commitment was given to provide £20 million to tackle the drugs problem the same sum was provided for a project at Croke Park which in no sense shares the priority attached to the committee which is addressing the problem of social exclusion.  This indicates a strange set of priorities.  On 15 October the Minister of State said he would finalise the £20 million fund with the Minister for Finance.  Following their discussions, is the commitment to provide £20 million over a three year period still intact or has it disintegrated under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach?</P>

We have established the fund and provided the requisite seed capital.  If later, during the year, it is found that everything is in order, the matter of additional funding can be examined. The important decision was to establish the fund, thus implementing a decision of the previous Government in respect of which no funding had been provided.</P>

Will he come clean and state clearly that the Government has now abandoned its predecessor's decision to provide £20 million over a three year period, commencing in 1998, for youth services designed to tackle the drugs problem?  Does he also agree that all we have heard from him so far has been waffle, while the redevelopment of Croke Park has been allocated £20 million, accompanied by a reduction in the £20 million commitment to tackling the drugs problem to £1.25 million, and children in this city die through abuse by drug pushers and dealers? That is an utter disgrace, especially since that Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs is chaired by the Taoiseach who represents one of the areas worst hit by drug abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>To contend that we have abandoned any aspect of the previous Government's approach to tackling the drugs problem is totally inaccurate because we have taken developments considerably further.  It is an absolute commitment of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs to ascertain the position at ground level and tackle the causes of drugs misuse.  That is the crucial task now confronting us.  The resources are available this year provided by the previous Administration and, as the record will confirm, we shall continue to provide <Col N="197" /> them in 1998 and 1999 to fund the local drugs task forces.  The underlying causes of drugs abuse must be tackled.  As I understand it, the previous Administration did not set itself the objective of tackling those causes which could remain regardless of what we do.</P>

Does he not agree that the time for pilot projects and examination of its causes has long since passed, that what is needed is positive action since we know the problem, its causes and cures?  Is he aware the report laid down in straightforward terms that what is needed is positive action by way of diversionary programmes, recreational facilities, youth training programmes and job opportunities?  In ghettos of this city there are no job opportunities or training programmes, there is no sustained thrust or dynamic approach to tackling the drugs problem and there is no hope.  The amount announced by the Minister of State, whether it is £1.25 million or £4.9 million, is hopelessly inadequate in the context of the problem.</P>

In light of that can he give an assurance in this regard to regain some of the credibility the Government has lost?  Will the Cabinet sub-committee meet regularly and, if so, how often?  Will the £20 million recommended as a minimum be allocated over the period recommended?  As the money allocated will be for certain geographical areas, can he say what identifiable target groups will be involved?  Will voluntary youth organisations be involved in the process?  Will he bear in mind that the geographical areas he mentioned do not include areas outside the remit of Operation Dóchas?  These are being increasingly invaded by the notorious drug dealers evicted from Operation Dóchas areas who are now preying on peripheral areas such as my constituency.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree it is not desirable, either in the answers or the questions, to confuse the moneys allocated to the local drugs task forces and the youth services development fund?  They are two distinct and separate matters.  Does he agree the previous Government allocated £14 million to underpin the work of the local drugs task forces, £3 million of which was allocated towards State refurbishment by my colleague, the then Minister of State, Deputy McManus, at the same time as she approved the project in Carlow which the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, <Col N="201" /> reversed?  Some £1 million of it went to combat non-opiate abuse outside Dublin and £10 million went to underpin the work of the task forces, the first tranche of which was allocated at the beginning of this year.  Does he agree that some of the money he has now announced is in the second tranche of that allocation?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State also agree that the youth services development fund is a separate objective?  Is it not the case that that recommendation, which I think was made in May by the previous Government, could not have been provided for since the Book of Estimates was not to be published until October?  Is it not the case that the entire contribution of this Government towards that objective is £1.25 million?</P>
      <P>If the Cabinet sub-committee met more frequently, it could have its discussions in the Cabinet room.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> It is nauseating to see certain parties using the heroin crisis as a means to trade insults across the floor of the Dáil.  I have seen the suffering caused by that crisis which was caused by the neglect of the political and economic establishment and six successive Governments.  Will the Minister of State indicate if the Taoiseach was present when the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs met?  As chairman of that sub-committee, why has the Taoiseach not appeared in the House with the Minister of State to provide answers on these crucial issues when he gives replies each week on matters which are relatively trivial?  I put it to the Minister of State that the fact that one meeting has been held shows that the Government is not really aware of the desperate suffering caused by the heroin crisis which continues to affect communities.</P>
      <P>The waiting lists about which the Minister of State provided information show that 367 people were on the Eastern Health Board waiting list in October.  Does he agree that this is completely out of touch with the reality?  A recent study carried out in Finglas shows that increasing numbers of young people are smoking heroin and have become addicted to it, but they have not been placed on any waiting lists.  There is a real need for the Government to take emergency action in respect of this crisis.</P>
      <P>With regard to the financing of the youth services development fund, is it not pathetic for the Government to be seeking handouts from big business for paltry amounts a week after handing back £15 million per year to the two biggest banks through reductions in corporation tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>If any insults were traded in the House on this issue, I wish to place on record that I was not responsible.  I would not engage in such activity, because of the suffering experienced by those who misuse drugs, their families or communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was present and chaired the committee meeting on social exclusion.  He drove <Col N="206" /> the proceedings forward and challenged everyone to meet their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the Eastern Health Board waiting list.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, is responsible for that health board and would be better placed to provide more detailed information.  I agree there is an urgent need to establish the precise situation in respect of levels of addiction and the waiting lists to which the Deputy referred.  That information should be available from the Minister for Health and Children, through the Eastern Health Board.  I will convey the Deputy's request for that information to Deputy Cowen.  I am not trying to avoid the issue, I merely do not have access to the information requested.</P>
    <P>The youth services development fund is an important tool in the fight against drug misuse and in dealing with the need to divert young people in areas of great disadvantage from becoming involved in such misuse.  Consequently, I believe the fund is complementary to the work of the local drugs task forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that there are some matters, namely, Northern Ireland and the drugs crisis which, because of their gravity, should be above party politics? Would he agree that anyone looking at the drugs crisis in order to determine the Government's priority and commitment will note that the Taoiseach's committee has met on one occasion &mdash; 8 October &mdash; since this Government came into power?  Does that not indicate a lack of priority which, I say more in sorrow than anger, is scandalous in the circumstances?</P>
      <P>My next question may be helpful to the Minister. Why is it that a Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has been given prominence in this anti-drugs drive?  Previously this issue was driven and led by the Department of Health, as it used to be called. Is it because of infighting, power struggles or empire building that this role has been taken from the Department of Health and Children and given to the Department of Education and Science, which was seriously deficient in its discharge of past responsibilities in this area?</P>

      <P>It is a difficult job but the Minister is trying his best.  Will he clarify whether the youth services fund was discussed at the only meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee.  If so, was the amount to be allocated to it discussed?  Did the sub-committee take the decision to cut the youth services fund from £20 million to £1.25 million so that the Taoiseach could give £20 million to Croke Park?  That is how people in deprived communities will see it.  Does the Minister agree he cannot do the job for which he has been given responsibility with £1.25 million?  To quote himself, he cannot tackle the underlying causes of the drug problem in Dublin, never mind the whole country, with that sum.  If I were in his position I would resign because I would accept that I could not do the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not walked away.  Regarding the work of the Cabinet sub-committee, I understand it is the policy not to disclose specific discussions, rather to convey decisions taken through the Cabinet in the normal way.  As to tackling the issue mentioned by the Deputy, if I had £20 million for the youth services development fund it would not make a significant impact on the problem.  He knows well from his long experience in this area that it is the underlying <Col N="208" /> causes we must tackle.  If we do not do so in a co-ordinated way, we will make no progress &mdash; we will simply heal one generation of drug misusers and inherit another.  That is not the way to tackle this issue.  In communities covered by the task force areas, we must first provide for current needs through the local task forces, which we are doing and, more importantly, we must find out why individual, clearly identifiable communities have suffered the ravages of drug misuse, particularly heroin misuse, when other communities have not been so affected.  When we find the answers, which I feel we have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and deliver the co-ordination of services and target the resources to those areas, we will deal with the underlying causes.  We will then make significant progress, first in healing those who currently suffer the effects of drug misuse and second in putting in place structures, services and resources which will prevent new people encountering drugs.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's presence to answer questions on the issue.  Does the Minister favour having fewer Cabinet sub-committee meetings and more of a &ldquo;ground-up&rdquo; approach to the drugs problem &mdash; that is, solving it in local areas, rather than the &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; approach which Deputy Gregory seems to advocate? Will he spell out the co-ordinating role he plays in the sub-committee and confirm that he co-ordinates activities between meetings?  Will he also give a detailed breakdown of the Clondalkin and Tallaght allocations?</P>

Tallaght received an allocation of £695,700 and Clondalkin received £943,000, which sums were to complete the implementation of the original recommendations of the task force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the Commissioner for Regional Policy and Cohesion, Monika Wulf-Mathies, on 28 November.  The Commissioner expressed her satisfaction with the general progress in spending Structural Fund moneys in Ireland.  I briefed her <Col N="209" /> on the current position in relation to the Luas project and reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the construction of a light rail system for Dublin.  I also confirmed that the study of the underground option <i>vis-à-vis</i> the overground option would be completed by the end of April next.  This will tie in with the review of the EU funding for the project which will take place in spring 1998.</P>
      <P>We reaffirmed an earlier agreement that the planning and design of the Ballymun to city centre route would proceed in parallel with the construction of the Tallaght-city centre-Dundrum route, with a firm target of commencing the construction of the Ballymun route immediately the Tallaght to Dundrum route is completed.  In doing so both the Commissioner and I noted with satisfaction the decision of the Community Support Framework Monitoring Committee to allocate 10 million ECU of Structural Fund assistance at an aid rate of 65 per cent for planning work on the Ballymun route and the Government decision to fund the balance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify her public remarks after that meeting to the effect that these funds will not be lost to Ireland, which implies that if they are lost to Luas other projects will be found for them?  Is the Minister trying the patience of the Commissioner to exhaustion, to the point of jeopardising the 123 million ECUs for the Luas project?  Will she confirm that the CSF monitoring committee is to meet in the spring to clarify whether this funding will go ahead, and that there is a real risk that because of further procrastination Luas will become the most over analysed public transport project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The money will not be lost to Ireland if the study finds it would be preferable for Luas to go underground.  The Deputy asks whether I am trying the patience of the Commissioner. If so, it was not apparent.  We had a most amicable meeting.  I found her an admirable woman, straightforward and commonsensical, very much in tune with my own ideas about how people should conduct themselves publicly.  I enjoyed the interview very much, and we had a very pleasant social interlude when the business was over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also said the Luas project was the most over analysed public transport project in history.  That is true.  Every study commissioned was commissioned at the behest of the sponsoring group, namely, CIE-Luas.  I find it extraordinary that any administration would be willing to run with a project without instigating a study to find out the best way of doing it.  The study is to be completed by mid-April.  If it concludes that the better option is to build the Luas overground we will be able to avail of the funding.  If, however, the study concludes that the best option is to build it underground, we will make our plans accordingly.  This is a project which will have to stand the test of time for decades.  I want to take <Col N="210" /> the right decision based on proper research and, until now, no study has been done by an objective outside group on the underground option.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to how secure EU funding for Luas is?  I understand the Commission needs to have commitments for expenditure within the time frame set out.  Is the Minister saying she is so anxious to get it right that she is prepared to jeopardise the funding?  What is the Minister's view on whether these EU funds will be spent on the Luas project?  Is she saying they are absolutely secure, that there is a small risk that they will be lost, or that the 123 million ECUs awarded on the operational programme will go to Luas as planned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it as plain as I can.  If the study concludes in favour of the overground option, tight as the timetable may be, the money earmarked for Luas will go to Luas.  If the objective study concludes the underground option is better, in this operational programme, the money earmarked for Luas will not be available for it because the timetable would not allow for fresh planning etc.  That is not a new discovery for the Deputy.  I have said it conclusively. Equally, I have said that if it is the result of the study that Luas should go underground &mdash; and we do not know what the result will be &mdash; the moneys will not be lost to Ireland.  Studies will be put forward for the next round of funding.  The Government is committed to a light rail system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if this report concludes that Luas must go underground, then Luas will not go ahead, given that she has acknowledged that it will lose European funding? Will she also agree that, given that the cost will rise by at least £70 million, there is no way the Exchequer will fully fund Luas?  Will the Minister now accept that she is putting the Luas project at risk if it is proposed that it should go underground and, if it is to go overground, that she has wasted six months?</P>

I cannot understand that somebody who is so bright, smart and intelligent, continues to dig himself into a culvert on this question.  When I came into the Department I found, to my disbelief, that no study had been conducted into the question of putting the Luas underground. Indeed, a very eminent member of the Deputy's party, Dr. Garrett FitzGerald, is far more passionate about putting the Luas underground than I am.  I am entirely dispassionate about it and <Col N="211" /> wish to make the right decision, but to my disbelief no objective assessment was done on whether to put the Luas underground or overground.  It was a case of &ldquo;grab the money and run&rdquo;, because the money was there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's shareholding is in the Aer Lingus Group.  TEAM, in turn, is a 100 per cent wholly owned subsidiary of the group.  While my approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, is required under section 14 of the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993 for the establishment of a subsidiary, there is no such statutory requirement for the disposal of a subsidiary. However, it is an administrative requirement that proposals regarding major disposals would be brought to my attention and that of the Minister for Finance as shareholder.  No such proposal has yet been made to me in regard to the disposal of any shareholding in TEAM.</P>
      <P>The conduct of negotiations with potential investors in TEAM Aer Lingus are matters for the board and management of the Aer Lingus Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been aware of the process of identifying possible investors engaged in by the group.  This process has reached the stage where management has identified its preferred investor but, due to <Col N="212" /> legal issues and shareholder requirements on the part of the investor, is not in a position to identify the party until later this week.  In this regard I am advised a meeting scheduled for today with union representatives has been postponed until next Thursday.  Once in a position to reveal its preferred investor, management must continue and intensify consultations and negotiations with staff interests in order to finalise a suitable proposal for consideration.  The board must in turn refer the proposal to me.  I have insisted in my meetings with the unions and representatives of the company that the proposal must take account of all relevant issues affecting the future of TEAM. Any proposal from the board will be considered by me on its merits, having regard to the interests of all parties.</P>
    <P>My prime concern in examining any proposal from the board regarding TEAM is to ensure a long-term viable future for the company.  Furthermore, I will seek to ensure that the prospects for maintaining and strengthening employment opportunities at TEAM are maximised.  More importantly, I will insist that employee rights are fully guaranteed and considered in any proposal. For these reasons, I am willing to examine any proposal which the board may put before me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex and unusual matter in so far as a State property is for sale and there is no requirement on the Minister to bring the proposal before the House.  Has the Minister instructed Aer Lingus to sell 100 per cent of the shares in TEAM?  Does she have the authority to do this or does she require authority from the Dáil?  Given that the sale involves public property, that we live in an era of openness and transparency and that the rights of the 1,500 workers must be guaranteed, will the Minister bring the deal before the Dáil for approval?  If we were dealing with the sale of any other State company she would be required to seek Dáil approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not instructed Aer Lingus to instruct TEAM to sell 100 per cent of the shares in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, therefore, selling the shares without the Minister's authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a complex issue.  The Cahill plan, introduced when Fianna Fáil and Labour were in Government, contained a proposal in regard to TEAM.  I have not instructed Aer Lingus to sell TEAM.  I called in the unions some weeks ago because I thought matters were moving too far forward without ground rules being laid down by me.  I said that management must give full information to employees, that I wanted to maximise employment in TEAM and that employees' rights must be honoured to the full.  I set out my stall, so to speak, and these still remain the criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not given instructions to Aer Lingus to sell the company, nor have I received any proposals <Col N="213" /> from it.  Three firms have indicated an interest in the company, which is considering one firm.  For legal reasons and in order to let the employees know first, the information in this regard will be disclosed on Thursday.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked if I would bring the proposal before the Dáil for approval.  While my approval is required under the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993, for the establishment of a subsidiary, there is no such statutory requirement for the disposal of a subsidiary.  Following a full debate by the employees and agreement between the employer and employees, I will be disposed to accepting any proposal put before me.  I fully accept that I must come before the House with the proposal and make a statement and also answer questions on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter of guarantee held by the employees gives them various legal rights.  It also contains a legal agreement that no more than 49 per cent of the company can be sold.  Given this legal agreement and that the Minister has given no instructions for the sale, how can the management tell the unions it will sell 100 per cent of the shares in the company to its preferred investor? How was the preferred investor selected as there was no tendering process, no option and nothing was visible?  Will the Minister explain the selection process which was certainly not transparent?</P>
      <P>In the press release issued today by Aer Lingus reference is made to a shareholder clearance consideration. Does this refer to the difficulties arising from the legal agreement with the employees in Aer Lingus that no more than 49 per cent of the shares in the company can be sold and that part of this amount must be dedicated to an employee share option proposal?  Has the delay arisen because of the legal difficulties arising from the letter of guarantee issued to the staff on compulsory transfer from Aer Lingus to TEAM and which is now held by the employees?  Incidentally, the letter of guarantee is before the High Court which will make a decision on its status next April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Letters of guarantee or comfort are letters of employment.  However, I will not quarrel with the Deputy's description of them as letters of guarantee.  The company clearly knows that the employment rights of the employees must be fully recognised, underpinned and honoured in any proposal.  I have been absolutely clear on this point.  The proposal is still in the realm of probability or possibility.  Any proposal which lands on my desk will not leave my office the same day.  It will receive the utmost scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how three parties came to indicate their interest in the company.  Aer Lingus owns 100 per cent of the shares in TEAM.  I set the ground rules on how management must proceed and the sale will clearly not proceed unless the three criteria laid out by me are fulfilled.  I presume that <Col N="214" /> the three parties have an interest in the area of aerospace matters, maintenance and aviation generally.  This is only proper.  There will be no patronage in regard to this matter.  Every &ldquo;i&rdquo; must be dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed in any agreement between management and employees. Following this the proposal will be sent to the board and then to me.  There is still a long road ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incomprehensible that neither the Minister, the shareholder, nor her departmental officials have been fully briefed on the sale of TEAM.  Is the Minister saying the management will present the results of the negotiations as a <i>fait accompli</i> to her?  Is it not the case she has discussed this with the chairman and the senior management in Aer Lingus have discussed this extensively with senior officials from her Department? What are the &ldquo;legal and shareholder&rdquo; reasons for the postponement of the meeting from early to late this week?  Is the Minister, as the shareholder, in favour in principle of the sale of 100 per cent of TEAM Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said he found it extraordinary that I would not be fully briefed.  I have explained to him exactly what I know and what I have been briefed on.  I obviously know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We own it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the names of the three interested parties, so I am fully briefed.  I am also fully aware one cannot overlook the fact that the employees should be told many of these matters directly by the management before they are put into the public domain.  The three companies which declared an interest are B.F. Goodrich, F.L. Schmidt-fuller of Aerospace and Allied Signal. The company is now dealing with one of those proposals but I cannot for legal reasons &mdash; nor would I wish to &mdash; name the company involved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy then asked about the legal and shareholder difficulties which caused the meeting to be deferred from Tuesday to Thursday.  Those difficulties relate to the proposal being discussed at present by the TEAM Aer Lingus management and the company in question.  They are matters for the shareholders of that company.  I do not know if they relate to the letters of comfort or guarantee.  That is a matter between that company and TEAM Aer Lingus.  I have been fully briefed.  I met the chairman and spoke to him by telephone after my meeting with the unions where I demanded and received assurances that the employees would be fully informed of matters as they proceeded.  I then met the chairman three weeks ago and told him again to ensure there was full information and transparency within the confidentiality requirements of the company.  When I met the unions and the workers they respected the need for such confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> The Deputy asked me if I am in favour of a 100 per cent sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the company becoming viable and of any strategic partnership which ensures the maintenance of employment and that the rights and guarantees given to workers are fully honoured.  I want all the facts to be given, while bearing in mind the need for commercial confidentiality.  I do not have any strong ideological objections but I insist that the whole engagement be as open as possible.</P>
      <P>I would be very cautions about drawing conclusions about the end result as there is still a reasonably long road ahead of us.  Any conclusion reached with the company would require engagement with the employees.  The matter would then have to go to the board of Aer Lingus, then to me and to the Cabinet.  There would then have to be full statements in the Dáil.  It is not an open and closed issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the status of the legal agreement between the company and its employees that not more than 49 per cent of the shares of TEAM Aer Lingus will be disposed of in any way, and that within that 49 per cent there is a legal requirement for an ESOP for the workers? Does the Minister agree it is not sufficient to make workers aware of a <i>fait accompli</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be accepted that these workers have considerable muscle.  They can use the legal agreement they have in their hands to stop any sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not enough to make them aware of any sale &mdash; their agreement is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I used the word &ldquo;concurrence&rdquo; three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  However, TEAM Aer Lingus management told them they were selling the whole lot, regardless of whether they liked it. I am sure the Minister heard that from the same source I did, the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it deemed necessary to sell the company now when it is in the third year of a recovery plan?  It recently recruited 60 craft workers, its revenue has increased by £10 million this year, it will make a profit in 1997 and its recovery plan is ahead of schedule.  Why is it deemed necessary to hive off this company now to an international organisation over which we will have as much control as we have over Seagate?  There is no necessity to sell TEAM Aer Lingus to make it viable.  It is already viable &mdash; its order books are <Col N="216" /> full, it is recruiting additional craftworkers and it is making a profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there cannot be a <i>fait accompli</i> because, as I have said all along, the concurrence of the workers is required.  This is an entirely different matter from normal management and trade union discussions, arrangements or divisions where the majority vote of the union membership is accepted.  Each person has an individual letter of comfort, guarantee or employment.  I cannot stress enough that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a veto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because each individual member must signal his or her agreement to the management on foot of those letters.  That is why I said earlier there is a long road ahead if this is to be proceeded with.  It is not a <i>fait accompli</i> in any sense because of that previous correspondence.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the legal agreement which refers to the 49 per cent limit and the letters of comfort.  Both those matters will have to be teased out individually with each employee. There will be no deviation from that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked why Aer Lingus is keen to sell the company now when it has just taken on extra craftworkers and is heading towards viability.  The company is not yet viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that but it is ahead of schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are behind with their payments, which were delayed as a result of PCW negotiations.  There are also other outstanding moneys under that programme.  While the company is staffed by creative and outstanding employees, it finds it difficult to become fully viable.  I repeat with caution and understanding that there are many hurdles to be overcome.  I will come back to the House again and give full answers on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is frank in her answers.  I asked her attitude in principle to the sale of the company and she gave a pragmatic answer, that she would agree to it if it were in the best interests of the company.  Where the board and management believe company A put forward the best offer and the Government has no objection in principle, 900 workers vote to accept the offer and 114 individuals go to the High Court on the matter, if the consensus is that the deal should go ahead but a small number of people do not accept the union's right to negotiate on their behalf, will the Government agree those employees should be offered continuing employment in Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have thought of that and every other scenario regarding this matter. Because each individual person received a letter, <Col N="217" /> the matter is much more complex than a collective agreement where a trade union takes a majority vote.  The matter is before the High Court in a technical sense and, concurrent with that, the letters were laid before the High Court to test their authenticity.  The scenario where 900 people vote in favour of the offer and 100 do not is hypothetical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree.  Were that position to be arrived at, the desires of the 100 people would have to be taken into account.</P>

      <Quest>if she will give details of the current situation regarding her intervention earlier in 1997, particularly in relation to Bus Éireann, in the industrial relations negotiations regarding the CIE viability plan; and if the deadline she imposed for conclusion of the current talks will be met.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22619/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to questions in the House on 12 November last, I had consultations with the parties involved in those negotiations shortly after taking office and suggested <Col N="218" /> a possible way forward on this difficult and sensitive issue.  I made no attempt to impose a deadline for the conclusion of the talks, but recommended the parties concerned should commit themselves to reaching agreement at the earliest possible date and should also agree on a timetable for the successful conclusion of negotiations in each of the three companies within the current calendar year, with appropriate intermediate benchmarks.  I understand that reasonable progress has been made and that both parties are participating in the negotiations in a positive manner, assisted by the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
      <P>While it is clear negotiations will not be concluded by the end of 1997, a basis exists to enable them to be finalised within the next few months. I would urge unions and management in each of the three CIE operating companies to make every effort to conclude their restructuring negotiations as early as possible in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall, at the time of her intervention when it was possible there would be a national bus strike, she set a deadline for completion of this matter by the LRC by the end of the year?  I am informed it will be the middle of next year before that process is finalised.  Does she now regret her involvement in the matter?  Is the Minister aware dozens of new buses, which have been bought to provide an improved public bus transport service in areas such as Galway, lie idle because all issues are caught up in the overall viability plan?  Will she seek to allow the most urgent issues, such as the introduction of mini-buses, to be negotiated on individually and separately so that the public may enjoy a better service?  Those issues should be allowed proceed rather than deal with every issue at the pace of the slowest aspect of the viability plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regret my intervention in this matter.  We talked earlier about a <i>fait accompli.</i>  Two weeks after coming to office I was faced with the possibility of a national bus strike but I did not take up that challenge, nor did I wish to.  I met all those involved and laid down my objectives.  I did not impose a deadline.  I looked up the minutes of the meeting I had with the trade unions and management at the time and I said in as far as possible I would like talks to be concluded by the end of the year.  They have not been concluded but they are proceeding satisfactorily. I spoke to the chairman of the Labour Relations Commission and he informed me that, while the pace of talks is slow, achievements are being made.  There is positive interaction between the labour relations facilitators and the union representing the various companies within the CIE group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the buses which are not being used because negotiations have not concluded.  I expect negotiations will proceed quickly and within a few months there will be a <Col N="219" /> definite result.  On whether certain issues should proceed to ensure those buses are put on the road, I am not conducting the negotiations.  They are being conducted by the Labour Relations Commission under the aegis of the Tánaiste.  The commission has devoted immense time to the CIE group of companies.  I am an interventionist, but not to the point of telling the Labour Relations Commission it must deal with one issue over others.  It is dealing with a range of issues for the CIE group of companies.  I am remarkably positive about CIE.  Rather than a piecemeal settlement that would fall asunder as soon as the first challenge is raised, I want full involvement with all concerned and a proper framework of consultation that will result in equitable decisions.</P>

      <P>The viability plan deals with rail and routes for Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann and proposes a cut of £60 million.  That is major reform and we should let those talks proceed.  There are 32 newly purchased buses standing idle in Bus Éireann's garage that cannot be made available to the public because of a relatively small issue of rostering.  Does it not make common sense to take such issues out of the overall viability plan and deal with them by way of normal industrial relations so that the public can get a better service and management and unions can get on with the job of providing a public transport service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all questions together.</P>
      <P>Amerscan Pulmonate II is a product used in the diagnosis of abnormal lung perfusion in patients.  Certain batches of this product have been recalled by the Irish distributors.  The Irish Medicines Board was informed on 18 November by the UK Medicines Control Agency regarding the relevant batches of Amerscan Pulmonate II Agent.  The board took immediate steps on 19 November in co-operation with the distributors of the product, to quarantine the unused products and ensure their full recall.  All nine hospitals involved have confirmed to my Department that none of the product was used after that date.</P>
      <P>The Department became aware of the need for the recall on the evening of 26 November and obtained detailed information from the Irish Medicines Board on 27 November.  The Department wrote to the nine hospitals involved on 28 November, emphasising the importance of completing a full recall of the product and asking for formal confirmation that the products had been returned to the distributors.  It was subsequently confirmed to the Department by the hospitals that all unused product, having been quarantined, was returned to the distributors by 27 November.</P>
      <P>The delay which occurred in the Irish Medicines Board notifying the Department is a matter of concern to me.  I have already made it clear to the board that in future I require to be informed immediately of any similar incident and the nature and extent of the board's response to it.</P>
      <P>The number of vials of the relevant product which was used is 268.  Following the decision to advise patients, taken on 12 December, my Department has now been in contact with each hospital involved and has established that hospitals may treat more than one patient with each vial, depending on the circumstances of each patient.  Accordingly, the information from the hospitals today suggests that the total number of patients who will have to be contacted and counselled is up to 467.  I have issued a statement this afternoon clarifying the position with regard to the numbers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's assessment of the matter indicated that its handling raised complex medical, scientific and ethical issues.  I will elaborate on these later.  It was, accordingly, decided to seek the advice of the CJD Advisory Group, <Col N="222" /> which met on 4 December.  The group concluded that the risk involved was unquantifiable but likely to be very low.  It gave detailed consideration to the ethical issue arising in balancing the benefits which might accrue to the patient knowing of his or her exposure and the possible serious psychological distress which this knowledge might bring.  It agreed the chairman should continue to seek ethical advice on this matter.  It advised that, if recipients were to be identified and informed, appropriate counselling should be available and that a national policy should be formulated on the handling of the problem.  Finally, it considered that it would clearly be inadvisable for these patients to donate blood.  During the following week, further consideration was given to the ethical issue having regard to the extremely low risk, the lack of a diagnostic test for new variant CJD, the lack of any treatment and the unknown incubation period of the disease.</P>
    <P>On 12 December, the Department's chief medical officer met the chairman and two other members of the advisory group.  It was agreed, in principle, that, on balance, patients should be informed of the facts and appropriate mechanisms should be put in place as soon as possible to give effect to this.  As Deputies will be aware, the story was reported in the media on the evening of 14 December, the day prior to a scheduled meeting in the Department to make the detailed arrangements for the identification, notification and counselling of patients.</P>
    <P>I will outline the arrangements being made to notify patients, having regard to the extreme sensitivity of the issue and the absolute need to maintain the doctor-patient relationship.  I am informed by eight of the nine hospitals concerned that they have already identified all the patients who were diagnosed using the product in question. The remaining hospital has almost completed this task.  A clinical information pack is being prepared and will be sent to each of the hospitals.  This pack will consist of briefing material on the scientific data in relation to Amerscan's composition and operation and on the clinical issues in relation to new variant CJD and the possibility of transmission through this product.  Each hospital is being asked to arrange with the appropriate consultants, generally the treating consultants responsible for the care of patients known to have been treated with the relevant batches, to meet each patient individually and to brief them fully on their circumstances using, as appropriate, the background information contained in the clinical information pack. I take this opportunity to request the full co-operation of medical consultants and other hospital staff in carrying through this sensitive task.</P>
    <P>Counselling will be arranged by the hospital according to each patient's needs and wishes.  Following the initial consultation, the consultant will send a report to the patient's general practitioner and will enclose a copy of the clinical information pack.  Copies of this pack are also being made available to the headquarters of each health <Col N="223" /> board, to be given to any general practitioner who may wish to have this information in dealing with his or her patients.</P>
    <P>Hospitals will be requested to inform the Department when all patients have been contacted. The Department will then issue a statement so that all those who may have concerns about this matter can be reassured, particularly those who have had medical investigations for lung conditions not including the use of the relevant batches of Amerscan pulmonate II. Hospitals have already been requested to make special arrangements to deal promptly and fully with any queries they may receive from patients who are concerned about their situation, and each has confirmed that this has now been done.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware from various commentaries in the last few days, we are dealing with a complex scientific, ethical and practical issue. Such is the uncertainty surrounding both the scientific and ethical aspects, it is already clear that there are a number of possible ways in which the matter can be addressed and defended.  As indicated by Dr. Paul Browne of the National Institute of Health in America during a radio interview broadcast on RTÉ this morning, the advice given by the appropriate experts to the Food and Drugs Administration in the USA is that, given the level of risk, this product should not be withdrawn from use.  On the other hand, the UK authorities decided to remove the product from use but decided, given the level of risk, the lack of a diagnostic test and of treatment for CJD, that patients should not be informed.</P>
    <P>We have decided to do both but, as I have outlined, that decision required a level of consideration and consultation commensurate with the importance and complexity of the issue.  The immediate safety aspects were addressed promptly by quarantining the relevant product and subsequently returning it to the distributors. The BTSB confirmed that the questionnaire completed by prospective donors has the effect of excluding any recipients of this product from donating blood.  This having been done, time and thought had to be given to getting as much information as possible on the risk involved and, most of all, deciding if and how the patients should be informed.  The Irish Medicines Board acted correctly and promptly in arranging to have the product quarantined and withdrawn.  The Department acted promptly to reinforce the immediate safety arrangements and dealt with the key ethical issue in an informed and thoughtful manner. I assure the House that all the further steps I have outlined will be implemented immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that neither he nor his Department recognised the need for urgent communication with those to whom this product had been administered?  Is he aware that this day last week, when dealing with another issue in the House, he stated: &ldquo;irrespective of how minimal is the risk, I have a duty to <Col N="224" /> inform the public of it&rdquo;?  Does he accept that at the time he said that, he was aware of the difficulties in this area, that no decision had yet been made to inform the public and that his Department was in a dilemma as to what it should do? Does he accept there has been a lack of sensitivity and insight in the manner in which this issue has been dealt with by his Department?  Does he acknowledge that it was scandalous that those to whom this product was administered heard about this matter on RTÉ and read about it in the national newspapers and that this is an inappropriate way to deal with such an issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter that it is unfortunate this matter has come into the public domain before people have an opportunity to be counselled or advised on their position.  I was not responsible for bringing this issue into the public domain so I cannot take the credit or blame for it, depending on what side of the argument one wishes to take.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the Department is not committed to its primary objective of helping those who are affected by dealing with this issue.  A dismissive attitude has been taken to the complex ethical issues which must be considered.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that I was inconsistent in my approach to this issue compared to the matter we discussed last week.  However, I am taking the same approach.  When clear advice was given to me by the CJD expert committee on the meat on the bone issue, I promptly acted on it. When that committee considered this issue, it was not in a position to give clear and complete advice after its first meeting on 4 December.  The minutes of the meeting I outlined in my statement confirm that it sought further advice from within the committee and from the Irish Medical Council on the ethical issues involved.  Every medical person who has commented on this issue supports the view that this matter raises serious ethical issues.  My approach has been consistent because when it was decided on Friday, 12 December that complete advice could now be given to me and that the patients concerned should be informed, I immediately acted on that advice and a scheduled meeting was fixed for Monday, 15 December to begin the process of identifying, notifying and counselling those patients.</P>
      <P>I have also been criticised for not meeting those contingencies sooner.  I was not in a position to act on this matter until the medical and ethical issues had been resolved.  It would not have been proper or appropriate for me to involve the hospitals in a scheme involving the identification of patients before I had been fully advised by the CJD expert committee on whether it was ethical to pursue that course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I did was totally consistent with the approach I have taken in these matters.  The problem with this matter compared to the other one is that it is more complex and therefore more consideration must be given to it.  If the Deputy wishes, I can quote from the chairman of the CJD <Col N="225" /> expert committee, who is a consultant virologist, professor of microbiology and head of the virus reference laboratory in UCD.  The line of political attack is flawed to the extent that it seeks to dismiss the serious ethical issues involved in this case which have been confirmed by the medics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that this is not a political attack but is about informing individuals to whom a product has been administered?  Does he also acknowledge that the central ethical issue is whether to inform or not to inform such individuals and that as Minister he must make that decision?  The Minister cannot tell the House last Tuesday about an obligation to inform on minimal risks and then come into the House today and say this is not a decision he makes.  He decides how to deal with information based on what other people tell him. Will he clarify and confirm that in future, if a similar difficulty arises, those who may be affected by it will be informed more quickly?  Will he also clarify why his officials withheld information from him for five days and it then took him a further two weeks to make a decision that should have been made within 24 to 48 hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue eventually crystallised itself as to whether the patients were to be informed.  The medical advice upon which I depend before making the decision &mdash; and it would be a very irresponsible Minister who would make such a decision without medical advice &mdash; became available to me on December 12, last Friday.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that he and his Department do not seem to have learned any of the tragic lessons of the HIV infection experience and the hepatitis C scandal?  The response of the Department in this instance has been miserable and ineffectual and even to this day the people who underwent those tests have not been given the information to which they are entitled.  Will the Minister explain how nine days passed before the Department of Health and Children discovered, by accident rather than design, the true situation and why there is a representative of the Minister and the Department on the Irish Medicines Board?  It took nine days for the Department to be informed by another source and then a further five days for the Minister to be advised.</P>
      <P>Will he explain how such a lengthy time passed in terms of the initial phase when the Minister did not know and the second two week phase when he did not know what to do next?  Does he agree that, in the same way as the beef on the bone issue was dealt with, he appears to be more keen to ape the British view on such matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He might also respond to a question I put to him earlier.  What will he do for those people who <Col N="227" /> underwent investigations and tests in Irish hospitals but who did not undergo this test and are living in anxiety and fear because they simply do not know the position?  Why is it only now that he has some notion about the number of people affected?  Why did he not start at the very beginning to assess and identify the people?</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody can make sense of the point he makes in regard to ethics when it comes to identifying the number of patients who underwent tests in Irish hospitals but I have no doubt that hospitals have no problem finding these people in order to send them bills for these tests.  Is it the case that the Minister had a duty to find out initially how many people were affected and to immediately provide information and access to advice for those people and others who are living without knowing where they stand irrespective of whether they had the test?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister accept that, even at this point, he appears to be blind to the anxieties people have?  Will he further accept that blood products are part of medical treatment but that the only way they can be used properly in a fashion that people can trust is if full, immediate and adequate information is presented at all times?  Private sector manufacturers responded instantly and in a proper fashion and it shows up in the most negative light possible the slow, lethargic, ineffectual approach his Department has adopted in this case.  It a case of obfuscation rather than information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy dressed up a number of assertions as facts which I wish to address.</P>
      <P>First she suggested that she cannot understand why this should be regarded as a complex ethical issue.  I quote Professor William Hall, chairman of the CJD advisory committee, who is a consultant virologist in Beaumont Hospital, professor of microbiology in UCD and head of the virus reference laboratory.  He states:</P>
      <P>However, this is really a very, very complex area and it has far reaching implications both for the medical aspects, that's, both physical and psychological, and considerable ethical implications.  And so we decided to spend some time, discussing this among ourselves, on how we would proceed, specifically how we would counsel these people, this is quite different from, what we had in the past with hepatitis C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hepatitis C was relatively simple.  We could contact the people who we knew had received infectious material, we could bring them in, we could do a blood test and if it was positive, we could then counsel them appropriately on the clinical aspects of the disease and discuss what treatment options were available.  Here we are dealing with material that we are not sure is infectious, we do not know if it has been transmitted, we cannot test for it.  We do not know if the people were infected, how long it would take to develop the disease, 1 year, 5 years, 10 <Col N="228" /> years and again the treatment options are not there.</P>
    <P>It is really a very, very complex area, one of the most complex I have ever been involved in and so we spent the following week, discussing among ourselves.  I contacted people outside the advisory committee.  I contacted people both in Ireland and, in fact, in North America and discussed this and last Friday I actually sat down with the chief medical officer, Jim Kiely, in Hawkins House and we went over this finally and we decided we were going to proceed and we were going to put everything in place, including very, very good and consistently high counselling to get involvement with and advise GPs, etc.  So I think there has not been a delay. I think it is an extremely complex and difficult problem.  We have put the health care of the individuals as our priority and I think our approach was very solid and very thoughtful and I think in the long-term this will be of benefit, so there was not a delay, it was just a very complex procedure.</P>
    <P>That is the answer from the head of the CJD advisory committee, who is far better placed than I am, to explain the complexity of this issue.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the chief executive of the Irish Medicines Board in regard to the fact that a Department representative is on the board.  There was no board meeting during this period and as a nonexecutive member he would not have been made aware of it.  Therefore, he would not have been in a position to make me aware.  I have discussed the matter at length with the chief executive and I understand precisely the scientific basis on which he was operating, that he was prioritising, as the licensing authority, the withdrawal of the product and its return to the distributors.  The initial focus was to ensure the product was taken out of circulation.  I have made it clear to Mr. Kelly and the Irish Medicines Board that in future, as political head of the Department, I need to be informed immediately because at the end of the day I have to answer for the IMB.  I have to explain the situation on behalf of the IMB to this House.  I am glad to do that, it is an exercise in accountability.  I have explained that that situation is not to recur.  That was an unsatisfactory aspect of the reporting mechanism and it is not to be repeated.</P>
    <P>Our officials were informed on Thursday evening.  They went to the Irish Medicines Board on Friday and got a full and detailed brief of the situation, the risk assessment, the statistical background and so forth.  On Monday morning I was informed and had a comprehensive brief from my Department officials which could answer the questions I was asking.  That is the reason for the delay, if one could call it a delay.  It was simply a question of getting, collating and presenting the information to me in a comprehensive fashion.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest we are lethargic or that I have not got the health care of these patients as my primary focus.  The contrary is the case.  I can <Col N="229" /> show what we have done since 27 November.  On being notified on 1 December, I immediately referred this matter to the CJD advisory committee. That is my consistent approach in these matters. As Minister for Health and Children I am not qualified to make those decisions without expert advice.  When the experts suggested to me on Friday, 5 December, that there were ethical issues they wanted to discuss further among themselves, with the Irish Medical Council and, as has been said by Professor Hall, eminent biologists and others further afield in North American and elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was prepared to wait one week for those people to come to certain conclusions and to get clear, full and complete advice from the expert committee set up specifically to advise in relation to the new emerging disease.  I would have thought it most inappropriate for me to do otherwise.  Once I received that information on Friday, 12 December, I immediately set in train, as in the matter a week before, procedures to deal sensitively and sympathetically with this matter. The way to do that was away from the cauldron of media attention, systematically on the basis of counselling, advice and with the co-operation of consultants who have a doctor-patient relationship they wish to honour and who may have an opinion in relation to this matter.  Unfortunately it became public news at six o'clock on Sunday. That made the job more difficult but it has not changed the Department's approach which is seeking to deal with the issue comprehensively, sympathetically and prudently.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I am happy to acknowledge that unlike the previous blood scandals, action was taken immediately by the Irish Medicines Board, though the Minister did not state categorically that not a a single patient was administered with the suspect substance after being informed.  There were still 11 or 12 days when unelected people, either in the Irish Medicines Board or in his Department, were aware of this crucially sensitive and important information before they deemed it proper to pass it on to those with political responsibility.  Will the Minister agree it seems officials have not learned from the previous scandals, the primary lesson being they must be accountable?  It was lack of accountability that caused previous tragedies.  I put it to the Minister that the most vital ethical issue is the right of each patient to know what has been administered to them.  That should have been the primary concern of those who spent a week, or in some cases a number of weeks, deliberating and thinking this matter over.  The 470 people were the last to know.  The Minister and his officials should have known that if nine hospitals &mdash; the whole administrative apparatus &mdash; were informed it was inevitable it would leak into the public domain through the media, in the wrong way to inform 470 people who then had to rely on the media to get bits of information here and there to find out if they were involved.  It is intolerable that patients became aware of it in this way.  It is inevitable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge Deputy Higgins's recognition that action was taken.  The nine hospitals concerned were St. Vincent's, St. James's, Crumlin, the Mater, the Meath, UCH Galway and Merlin Park &mdash; a joint operation &mdash; Cork University Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  I confirm that the Irish Medicines Board was notified on 18 November.  The product was withdrawn from St. James's on 19 November, at St. Vincent's the product was exhausted on 14 November, in Crumlin the complement was exhausted on 13 November, the complement at the Mater was exhausted on 17 November, the product was withdrawn at the Meath Hospital on 19 November the day it was informed, UCH Galway and Merlin Park on 19 November, Cork University Hospital on 19 November and Limerick Regional Hospital on 19 November.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said patients have a right to know. Believe it or not, patients also have a right not to know in relation to the clinical decisions taken by doctors.  A person telephoned the Department today to say they did not wish to be informed.  The decision was made in the United Kingdom not to inform.  This is not to suggest the authorities there acted unethically.  It is not a black and white issue. When one asks the medics about ethics they point out that one weighs up the benefits and the disadvantages in coming to a decision.  In this case the disadvantages are obvious.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about is half a drop of blood divided by 1/20,000 per patient.  Albumin is the blood base of the product in question.  There is no scientific evidence that the disease is passed through blood.  Dr. Michael Brown from America who has conducted much research in this area and is an acknowledged world expert stated that the Food and Drug Administration had been advised not to withdraw the product, that the risk was regarded as minimal.  I presume the same ethical standards apply.  It is, therefore, a judgment call.  Given the complexities involved the CJD ethics committee ruminated on the matter over the period in question and sought expert advice from around the world.  It reached its decision on 12 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that a snap decision could have been taken but this flies in the face of the expert medical evidence available not alone here but in other countries.  The product in question was distributed to 48 countries.  There is a recall mechanism in each of these.  It was not open to me to make contingency arrangements for the reason mentioned by the Deputy.  If I had contacted the radiology department in each of the nine hospitals concerned immediately to have lists drawn up and was subsequently informed that, taking everything into account, people <Col N="232" /> should not be informed, as happened in the United Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was my responsibility to deal sensitively with the health care requirements of a cohort of people who had received this product in a lung scan.  I was not prepared to act until I had received advice.  That was the proper, appropriate and prudent thing to do.  The suggestion that I should have done otherwise not alone flies in the face of logic and common sense but the expert medical advice available to me.  Everyone in the House would concede that the medical advice must take precedence. I accept the point &mdash; I made this point to Mr. Kelly of the IMB &mdash; that I have to answer for the political implications but I require the House to recognise that it was not a simple yea or nay decision.</P>

Are the Department and the Irish Medicines Board aware of their constituent parts, including white cells, red cells, plasma and its by-products, and the effect of each?

Adequate information and counselling services should have been made available.  That was not done.

They do not have access to proper information and counselling services.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that he and his Department have been unduly slow in dealing with this issue and should take that lesson for the future?  Within the context of his telling us that he is not responsible for leaks to the media, would he not acknowledge that it was his responsibility to understand that inevitably something of this nature would be leaked; that it was his obligation to identify the individuals concerned and communicate with them before the relevant information was leaked but failed to do so?  Can he now clarify for the benefit of the House, whenever something important comes to the knowledge of his Department on a Thursday evening, whether it is the normal approach of his Department that no one tells him until the following Monday morning?  Would he not acknowledge that, once his Department had been informed of this on Thursday evening &mdash; even if a full, detailed information pack could not be provided for him the following morning &mdash; it is unacceptable that a delay of four and a half days should elapse before he is informed?</P>
      <P>Arising out of these events, can he confirm to the House that, since receiving this product, none of its recipients has donated blood to the Blood Transfusion Service Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice of the BTSB that no person who has had any surgical procedure or who was admitted to hospital within the preceding 12 months can contribute to its blood pool. Therefore, anybody who was involved in this unfortunate circumstance would not be eligible to donate blood.  Mindful of that fact in this case, the BTSB is reinforcing that safeguard by asking anybody who approaches them to donate blood to respond orally to the relevant question on the questionnaire, thus ensuring an accurate response.  I have been in touch with the BTSB on this matter and am absolutely satisfied that is the case.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Shatter has a view on the management of my Department I was informed by Dr. Catherine Keohane after closing time on Thursday evening last.  She went to the Irish Medicines Board, got the relevant information, discussed it in detail and, in turn, informed me on Monday morning.  If somebody wants to suggest that I should have been informed on Friday morning, that is all right, but I could not have done anything about it.</P>

That was the priority and was done effectively.  I said openly yesterday, and repeat here today that I should prefer to know just how more effective it might have been had I been informed somewhat sooner, and made that abundantly clear to the Irish Medicines Board.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is no information line available within his Department for the benefit of those seeking information, the public is still dependent on media reports?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clearly state what is his responsibility to all those people who have not undergone this test &mdash; who do not know whether they have undergone it &mdash; since he has not declared how he will ensure that their doctors or hospitals advise them that they have not undergone this test?  The Minister has refused to answer that question but rather dealt solely with those people who have had this test.  Will he please clarify what line of communication will be made available so that doctors and hospitals can identify those who have undergone tests or investigations for pulmonary conditions and who may well presume they are one of those involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question. The commonsense answer is that those who have been in hospital for a lung scan or for anything to do with their lungs can contact their GP immediately who will inform them of their position through their consultant.  The quickest way of getting that information is to take that proactive step oneself.  It is unrealistic to expect that there is a more direct way involving an approach to the Department; it would have to do what the patient could do far more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have told the Secretary General that I want medical personnel, from the Deputy Chief Medical Officer down, to be available to deal with queries to the Department.  Many of those concerned <Col N="237" /> about this matter have made arrangements to contact their GPs and their local hospital consultants to deal with this issue.  I commend them on that because it is the commonsense thing to do.  They are being reassured, not just from that source but by the various medical experts who have indicated in the media over the past 24 hours their assessment of the level of risk and the fact that we have taken what many others regard as an over cautious approach.  If I were to be indicted on anything it would be on the fact that we are taking the most conservative approach possible to this matter.  Other countries in similar situations with a far worse incidence of CJD are not taking these steps.</P>

Why is it that nobody in the Department knew how to calculate the number of people likely to have been treated?</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister what procedures he had established to ensure that IMB would notify him immediately when difficulties arose.  He said that he instructed the chief executive.  Would he agree that telling the chief executive is not establishing a procedure?  Is he aware that it is not simply a question of a delay in IMB notifying him, given that after eight days it only happened by chance that the Department was involved?  What procedure will he establish to ensure that he is notified immediately when difficulties arise?</P>

      <P>Deputy Shortall supported a Government which introduced the strategic management initiative and the devolution of functions to agencies.  However, the culture in this country is such that if a problem arises in IMB the public will hold me responsible politically.

      <P>This is a serious point.  We all set out to strategically improve the State agencies, entailing the devolution of functions and day to day management.  However, if a problem arises it comes to me, not Mr. Kelly.  With regard to these matters it is crystal clear that I am to be informed immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea of a procedure is not to establish a joint interministerial task force to tell somebody how to do something.  It is a direct order that is well understood and comprehended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of numbers, when we decided to inform as of the 12 December our task was to identify, notify and counsel.  When this story <Col N="238" /> broke on the &ldquo;Six O'Clock News&rdquo; on Sunday the Department was asked for a statement.  Working from the fact that 268 vials had been used, we issued a statement to the effect that the Department understood approximately 270 patients were involved.  That was based on an incorrect assumption of one patient per vial.</P>
    <P>The identification procedure began on Monday in detail.  It was only late this morning and early this afternoon that full details from the nine hospitals became available.  Once it became apparent that the procedure involved in practically all of the hospitals entailed more than one patient per vial I immediately issued a statement to make that clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure is based on information regarding the number of patients who have received the agent from the nine hospitals. We have no reason to believe that the figure will rise because the nine hospitals have identified those who received the agent.  One of the nine is completing its arrangements with regard to the exact figure but I am taking the upper figure it has provided.  On that basis the total figure is up to 467.  It may be a little less than that.  I do not expect it to increase because it is provided on the basis of full information with the exception of one hospital which is completing its analysis.</P>

      <P>This is the third last occasion between now and 28 January on which on the Order of Business we can ascertain the Government's intention with regards to legislative proposals. I want clarification on what the Tánaiste said in respect of the Green Paper on what is known as the substantive issue.  Will she confirm that it had been proposed, all other things being equal, to refer the conclusions of the Green Paper on the substantive issue to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and legislation would subsequently be referred to the electorate under Article 27?  I understand that is no longer necessarily the Government's position.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste stated there are other ways in which this matter can be referred to the public. Does the Government have legislative proposals to provide for a plebiscite to give effect to that or is it envisaged there will be a referendum to change the wording of the Constitution?  As I understand it, other than changing the wording of the Constitution there are no legislative provisions for what would be termed a &ldquo;reference&rdquo; or &ldquo;plebiscite&rdquo;.  Has the Tánaiste committed the Government to some form of plebiscite?  Will she indicate if there are legislative proposals to make way for the mechanism, in legislative terms, for a plebiscite procedure which does not currently exist?</P>

When the Green Paper is completed it will be sent to the all-party committee. The Government has already expressed the view that if it is to introduce legislation to deal with this issue on foot of the judgment in the X case it will be anxious to consult the public. However, the Government may not make such consultations under Article 27 of the Constitution because of the obvious difficulties in respect of that matter.  What is important is not the Article under which we consult the public in respect of possible legislation, but that we will consult the people on this matter.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann</P>
      <P>1.  affirms, in accordance with the principles of international human rights law, the right of everyone to live free of violence, discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, colour, national or ethnic origin or membership of the traveller community;</P>
      <P>2.  condemns sentiments and manifestations of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism as inimical to respect for the dignity of all human beings and particularly deplores hostile statements or acts directed against those from other countries seeking refuge in the State;</P>
      <P>3.  supports all appropriate efforts to promote harmonious relations between different groups characterised by reference to race and related factors;</P>
      <P>4.  notes</P>
      <P>(i) that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, building on the work of his predecessors, has initiated the Employment Equality Bill which would, <i>inter alia</i>, make provision for the promotion of equality and the prohibition of discrimination and harassment in employment and related areas on the basis of factors including race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin or membership of the traveller community, and</P>
      <P>(ii) the Government's stated commitment to bring forward an Equal Status Bill which would have a similar effect in relation to non-employment areas;</P>
      <P>5.  requests the Government, following enactment of the legislation referred to in paragraph 4, to take steps for the ratification of the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 21st day of December, 1965;</P>
      <P>6.  notes the measures taken in Ireland resulting from the Resolution of the European Union Council of Ministers designating 1997 as European Year against Racism;</P>
      <P>7.  commends the efforts of voluntary groups who have taken initiatives to combat racism and xenophobia;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> 8.  urges the earliest possible implementation of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
    <P>This motion is in the names of Deputies John Bruton, Quinn, O'Malley, De Rossa, Gormley and myself.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the context in which this debate is taking place.  The Taoiseach recently agreed to a proposal by Deputy Bruton that the terms of a motion should be agreed by the Whips and that this motion should make clear the position of all sides of the House on the matter. The motion before us today has been agreed by all parties and makes clear that the House rejects racism in all its forms.</P>
    <P>It is possible one of the factors in the emergence of racist attitudes here, although such attitudes are never justifiable, is the confusion which currently exists about illegal immigration, in particular confusion between an illegal immigrant and a refugee.  The distinction has wide recognition internationally.  An illegal immigrant, as the title suggests, is a person who enters any State in breach of the law.  A refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality etc.  It is obviously not an option for the State to turn a blind eye to the problem of illegal immigration.  The only rational and responsible course is to enforce the law.  If the law is not enforced, in other words, if the &ldquo;blind eye&rdquo; approach is adopted, it increases rather than reduces the risk of racist attitudes and actions.</P>

      <P>There are a number of reasons for this.  First, the general public in the jurisdiction affected by illegal immigration soon become aware that there is abuse and, not surprisingly, there is public and media comment concerning this abuse.  Second, the criminal elements who organise illegal immigration are encouraged to press their advantage even further, which can considerably worsen the problem within a short period of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the international experience which we cannot ignore.  There is no doubt illegal trafficking in people is being well organised by criminal elements and a great many people who fall into the hands of these elements are being exploited in the process.  A number of arrangements have been put in place to enable <Col N="256" /> us to deal effectively with the problem of illegal immigration on one hand and to ensure fair treatment for genuine refugee applicants on the other.</P>
      <P>With regard to the implementation of the Refugee Act 1996, I have told this House on a number of occasions that I have implemented sections 1, 2, 5, 22 and 25 of the Act with effect from 29 August last.  I have also told the House that there is at present a High Court injunction preventing the appointment of a refugee applications commissioner under the Act.  Because of this litigation I am not in a position to appoint a refugee applications commissioner, an appointment central to the introduction of the remaining sections of the Act.  In the absence of a commissioner no applications for refugee status could be considered.  In fact, the whole process would come to a complete stop.  This would be highly undesirable for all concerned.</P>
      <P>In light of the impasse over the appointment of the refugee applications commissioner, my desire to deal with all applications for refugee status fairly, efficiently and in a timely manner, and the need to put in place an interim arrangement to deal with the current large caseload, I arranged for my officials to meet the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Both the UNHCR and I were satisfied that the arrangement made in 1985, involving formal consultation with UNHCR in each case, was no longer workable due to the huge increase in numbers applying and that a new approach was necessary. Extensive consultations with the representative have resulted in a new arrangement being put in place establishing a procedure to deal with the backlog of cases which has built up over the last two years or so and currently stands at about 4,000.  In a letter regarding the new arrangement the UNHCR said, <i>inter alia</i>,</P>
      <P>overall we believe that the revised document provides for a balanced administrative procedure pending the entry into force of the Refugee Act.</P>
      <P>Details of the new arrangement have been circulated to Members of this House and a copy has been placed in the Library.</P>
      <P>In addition to the new arrangement, the House will be aware I have received Government approval for the recruitment of additional staff to help deal with the applications on hand.  I expect the new staff will be in place in early 1998.  New accommodation has also been obtained to house the new staff, together with the Eastern Health Board's refugee unit, the UNHCR and a proposed legal advice service for asylum seekers. This will be a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for asylum seekers and should be ready in spring 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new arrangement, which follows broadly the philosophy of the Refugee Act, is an interim measure pending a review by me of the Act and the conclusion of the legal action currently taking place.  In this latter regard, a statement of claim in the matter was only received by the Chief State Solicitor from the plaintiff last week.  In so far as <Col N="257" /> a review of the Act is concerned, this has been necessitated by the large increase in applications over the past year.  When the Act was drafted it was envisaged that applications would be of the order of a few hundred per annum not thousands as has turned out to be the case.  When the number of applications began to increase last year, it was decided that the refugee applications commissioner position should be changed from a part-time appointment to a contract of employment for three years.  With current numbers, even this solution will be unworkable.  The Act provides for only one commissioner, with no powers of delegation.  One person could not possibly cope with the number of applications on hands, and the current backlog would only be exacerbated.</P>
    <P>The level of new applications has begun to fall over the past few months.  If this level of decrease continues and the new arrangements result, as is the intention, in the backlog being cleared, then it may well be possible to implement the provisions of the Act pertaining to the commissioner as currently drafted.  If not, I will bring forward fresh proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>I am confident the measures now being put in place will speed up significantly the processing of asylum applications.  I also stress that I do not believe that the procedures for dealing with asylum applications, be they statutory or administrative in nature, have in themselves anything to do with the issue of racism.  The provisions of the Act and the new administrative arrangement are procedural in nature and ensure that Ireland meets its international obligations in the area of asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
    <P>In referring to the Refugee Act, there is one point I want to make absolutely clear.  Those who are in need of protection and who are entitled as refugees to the protection of this State from persecution will receive that protection.  That is a reflection of our humanitarian concern as a civilised people and a commitment willingly entered into in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees, and in accordance with our role in the international community generally.</P>
    <P>I have seen references recently to refugees being deported and denied the opportunity of protection in Ireland.  I dismiss those ill-informed claims out of hand and reiterate what I believe is the will of the Irish people &mdash; to ensure that those who are genuinely in need of and entitled to protection in the State are granted it.  However, there is an important need to distinguish between our humanitarian response to refugees in need of protection and the duty of the Government to respond to the pressures of illegal immigration and those who may seek to abuse our humanitarian concerns.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees commented recently on the abuse of asylum procedures by illegal immigrants and persons who have already achieved protection in one country but move in an irregular manner to another.  It is worth <Col N="258" /> recalling what was said.  The UNHCR said the intentional misuse of asylum procedures is to be discouraged, and attempts by people with no valid claim to international protection take advantage of asylum procedures and create serious problems by clogging those procedures. The UNHCR went on to say such claims have greatly contributed to the confusion between refugees and illegal immigrants and that this, in turn, reflected negatively on the asylum process and, hence, on bona fide refugees.</P>
    <P>It also commented recently on another major concern, the phenomenon of asylum seekers who leave countries in which they have or could have found protection to seek asylum elsewhere. The UNHCR emphasised that movements of this kind have a destabilising effect on international efforts aimed at finding durable solutions for refugees.</P>
    <P>One thing that concerns me &mdash; and it is referred to in the motion &mdash; is that there should be no hostility to those of other races or national origins who come here seeking asylum.  We owe these people basic standards of decency and courtesy in our dealings with them.  My Department and all the staff involved are pledged to uphold those standards.  What I am doing is ensuring that all persons who come here seeking asylum are treated in a fair and humane way with due respect for their dignity.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that in recent years such applicants have been left waiting for long periods for decisions on their applications.  The uncertainty that causes can have an unsettling effect on genuine refugees.  I have taken steps to put new arrangements in place to deal with applications for refugee status in a fair, efficient and timely manner.  These arrangements, which have been welcomed by the UNHCR as providing for a balanced administrative procedure, will benefit from the addition of more than 70 new staff to ensure that applications are processed as efficiently and as quickly as possible.  Applicants deserve that their cases be subject to fair and effective procedures and that is what will happen in accordance with the measures I am taking.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the issue of improving relations between the traveller community and the settled community.  In July 1995, the Task Force on the Travelling Community, established by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government in 1993, referred in its report to the need to improve relationships between travellers and settled people through the development of mutual understanding and respect.  It said this requires an adjustment in attitudes towards one another and an acceptance of each other's culture.  It called for increased levels of contact, particularly at local community level, and expressed a view that this would result in a better understanding on the part of the settled population of the general needs of travellers and would enable travellers to understand more about the anxieties of the settled community.  In this way the present levels of conflict and tension could be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> Since the publication of the task force report, Government Departments have been working on the implementation of at least some of its recommendations. However, the previous Government decided against centralised monitoring of the implementation of recommendations.  This was in contrast to the follow-up on the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the report of the Commission on the Status with People with Disabilities.  This approach to travellers was flawed and mistaken.  Accordingly, I have decided to set up a monitoring committee, representative of all relevant interests both in Government and outside, which will be chaired by my Department.  Already my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Mary Wallace, has had preliminary discussions with traveller organisations about this monitoring structure, and my Department will be in contact with those organisations shortly to discuss the matter further.  My hope is that we can put a monitoring arrangement in place in the near future.</P>
    <P>In arriving at this decision I drew on previous Fianna Fáil work on improving the welfare of the travelling community.  In March of this year we published a position paper entitled A New Deal for the Travelling Community.  This paper called for the implementation of the recommendations of the task force and for periodic reports of the progress made on this.  Commitments on these lines were repeated in our election manifesto.  It remains for me to implement these in a practical way.</P>
    <P>I have recently initiated the Employment Equality Bill.  It covers essentially the same ground as the Bill which was found repugnant to the Constitution by the Supreme Court earlier this year except that it no longer contains the unconstitutional features.  It is my intention that the Bill will be debated by the House in the next session and will be enacted as speedily as possible. As far as the subject of our debate today is concerned, namely, race issues, the Bill is substantially the same as that brought forward by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am also committed to bringing forward an equal status Bill in the course of next year.  This will cover similar ground to the previous Equal Status Bill.  As Deputies may be aware, in ruling that the previous Bill was unconstitutional, the Supreme Court did not review each and every constitutional issue relevant to the Bill.  For this reason, revising the Bill to produce a new equal status Bill is necessarily more complicated than was the case with the Employment Equality Bill. I can assure Deputies, however, this work will be pushed ahead with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>The enactment of employment equality and equal status legislation first became Government policy when Fianna Fáil and Labour entered office in 1993.  I pay tribute to that Government and to my predecessors in the most recent Government for their work on this important <Col N="260" /> legislation.  It is my intention that what remains to be done will be speedily accomplished during my term of office.</P>
    <P>Not unrelated to equality legislation is another issue mentioned in the motion, ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  This important human rights convention has been ratified by the overwhelming majority of the international community, including all other member states of the European Union.  Therefore, it behoves us to proceed to ratification as soon as possible.  The advice available to Government has been that the enactment of the equality legislation is necessary for Ireland to fulfil her obligations under the convention.  As the motion states, when the legislation is in place we will take the necessary steps for ratification.  One of these steps would be the introduction of a motion in the House to approve the terms of the convention in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to European Year Against Racism 1997 which was designated as such by the EU Council of Ministers.  It arose from concern at a perceived rise in racism and xenophobia throughout Europe.  Its key objectives included the need to highlight the threat posed by these phenomena to economic and social cohesion within the EU and to promote exchange of experience and effective strategies for dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>As called for in the EU Council Resolution designating the year against racism, a national co-ordinating committee was established here with representatives from Government Departments as well as non-governmental organisations.  The committee is chaired by a representative of the Platform Against Racism, an umbrella body of organisations concerned with this problem.  I pay tribute to representatives of non-governmental organisations who have participated in the work of the national co-ordinating committee and in the many activities which have taken place around the country in connection with the European Year Against Racism.  Without the active participation of the NGO sector, the year against racism would have lost much of its significance.</P>
    <P>Some activities were organised as part of the European Year Against Racism.  In the area of education, my colleague, Deputy Micheál Martin, Minister for Education and Science, designated 23 October as a special anti-racism day for schools and youth clubs.  A special education pack was published by the national co-ordinating committee to facilitate awareness raising in this area. Associated with this was an award scheme.  The schools that participated in the scheme will be specially recognised at the closing ceremony of the year.  This will take place tomorrow evening and the President will officiate.</P>
    <P>Another awards scheme initiated by the national co-ordinating committee concerns the media.  The winners will be announced tomorrow night and the prizes will be presented by the President. <Col N="261" /> The objective of this scheme was to recognise the work of journalists in highlighting issues of racism, anti-racism measures, and the promotion of cultural diversity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have approved grants of more than £12,000 for regional and local projects linked to the aims of the year against racism.  In all, more than £20,000 out of the total allocation has been spent in assisting such projects.  This was money well spent because there is a need to articulate the message of the European Year Against Racism at local as much as at national level.  In addition, a number of Irish projects have been successful in securing European funding.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see the national co-ordinating committee placed a strong emphasis on co-operation with counterparts in Northern Ireland.  The significant event in this co-operation was a conference held in Dublin Castle in October which explored the issue of racism on both sides of the Border.  The European Parliament Office, the National Union of Journalists and the Platform Against Racism were all involved in the organisation of this conference, and a report on it will be published in due course.</P>
    <P>Overall, the national co-ordinating committee was concerned that the European Year Against Racism should not be a series of discrete events which would begin and end in 1997.  Instead, they wished to bring about a long-term change of attitude on the part of all relevant sectors so that they would take account of any race dimension, in the broadest sense, in their work.</P>
    <P>Deputies are likely to suggest that, given the effectiveness with which the 1997 allocation of £100,000 from my Department for the European Year Against Racism was spent, such funding in this area should be continued into the future. Although, in the nature of things, this was a oneoff allocation, a case can be made for the continuation of such funding.  Accordingly, my Department is prepared to consider, within the constraints of the available resources, applications for assistance, including support for research, in the general area of combating racism.</P>
    <P>On the issue of discouraging intolerance and racism in our society, I reject recent efforts at demonising the officials involved in the delicate task of working with asylum applicants and implementing the immigration laws generally. Suggestions that the individuals involved are racist or devoid of human decency are not just wide of the mark, they are grossly untrue and offensive and I reject them out of hand.</P>

      <P>I remind the House of the background to the Taoiseach's agreement to provide time for this debate.  There was great concern in the House at remarks made by Deputy Ivor Callely which were construed as being anti asylum seeker.  These remarks included disparaging references to the religious practices of some asylum seekers.  In order that the House would not become inflamed by this issue in an unproductive way I suggested that all party leaders should sign <Col N="262" /> a motion giving a clear political signal of all parties' opposition to racism in all its forms.  I greatly regret the Taoiseach scheduled this debate for a day on which he could not be present.</P>
      <P>I also regret the content of the speech by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. No doubt it was prepared with great care by the sections in the various Departments which contributed to the different parts of it on a scissors and paste basis but it contained no clear message from Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>We are in the final days of the European Year Against Racism.  Sadly, Ireland can look back on its contribution to the year with more shame than pride.  This year our attitudes to those who are different from the majority of us, whether in terms of skin colour, country of origin or economic status, were shown sometimes to be instinctively hostile.  It is a year in which the Department of Justice showed corporate contempt for asylum seekers to the extent that they were allowed to queue in the rain outside the Department for hours on end.  It was also a year in which a Government TD, Deputy Callely, used inflammatory language about asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>Some of our most distinguished citizens are the descendants of refugees who were once asylum seekers.  We do not have an equivalent study but a British study of refugees shows that the skill level of current refugees in Britain well exceeds that of the average of the British population. Some 77 per cent of Sudanese refugees and 54 per cent of Ugandan refugees in Britain have degrees or professional qualifications.  Although no refugees had English as a native tongue, more than 90 per cent could speak one other language in addition to their mother tongue and 65 per cent could speak at least two other languages.</P>
      <P>Taking all these features into account one can see that, on average, asylum seekers will be a substantial asset to this country as it seeks to globalise its economic reach.  Given a chance, asylum seekers will work as hard, or harder, than native Irish people.  They will want to succeed and to show they are contributing positively to the country which has provided them with a home.  For this to happen, they must be given a chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is not how the situation is seen by many Irish people.  In self serving images many Irish people like to imagine we are an especially benign, tolerant and easy going race.  This is easy to sustain in a society which is largely homogenous, where all speak the same language, worship in similar churches and share a common skin colour.  However, when our successful economy becomes a refuge for those who are different from us the myth is challenged and shown up for what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> When it comes to sharing our space with those less fortunate than ourselves we are not, perhaps, as generous a people as we would like to portray ourselves to the world as being.  As the author John Ardagh noted in his excellent work, <i>On Ireland and the Irish</i>, &ldquo;the Irish are keen to be part of Europe but their gaze is mainly at themselves&rdquo;. This self regarding attitude contributes in no small way to our closed minds and attitudes to those who are different from us.</P>
    <P>Racism is a daily reality for thousands of people living in Ireland, whether they are travellers, asylum seekers, refugees, foreign workers or Irish citizens whose skin colour or native tongue is different from that of the majority.  This racism manifests itself in hundreds of different ways, ranging from a basic lack of courtesy in shops to racist graffiti on walls and arson attacks on caravans and homes.</P>
    <P>For many years we have been rightly proud of the contribution Irish people have made to the development of other countries.  In parts of Africa, for example, our aid workers have made an immense contribution to economic and social development.  We are proud to see television pictures of white Irish aid workers teaching or feeding young black children, provided this activity is taking place thousands of miles away.  However, if black children are put onto an Irish street or into an Irish school the attitude may be different, marked in some cases by either overt antagonism or sullen hostility.</P>
    <P>We should examine the assumptions which underlie that hostility.  Is it our underlying but unstated belief that this piece of God's earth is for only one race of people, the native Irish? From where did that assumption come?  Is that what comes out if, to use the well known phrase, one scratches an Irish person hard enough?</P>
    <P>Louis Lentin's recent excellent television programme examined Ireland's attitude to Jewish people escaping from Nazi Germany before the last war and found it wanting.  It showed clearly that the closed door facing Jews here had little to do with neutrality, as claimed at the time, and much more to do with the anti Semitic tone of this country, which was contributed to by all sides of the political divide during the 1930s.  Many European countries have openly addressed and then come to terms with how they behaved earlier this century towards members of the Jewish community.  Sadly, Ireland has not really been one of them.  As I said at the commemoration of the end of the Second World War at Islandbridge, the State owes an apology to the descendants of all those Jewish people who sought a safe haven from terror in Ireland but never got near our ports because they knew they would not be admitted.</P>
    <P>We are not being asked today to accommodate an exceptional number of asylum seekers.  In the four years up to December 1997 we have had 5,400 asylum seekers.  In the same period, the Netherlands, a physically much smaller country which is about the size of Munster, has had <Col N="266" /> 120,000 asylum seekers and Switzerland has had 70,000.</P>
    <P>We should look at it from another perspective. The achievement of Irish emigrants abroad has been remarkable.  In the United States and Britain in the last century, and for much of this one, the Irish built the physical infrastructure which allowed those two great countries to grow. While I deeply regret the Taoiseach is not here to lead his party, Fianna Fáil, in this debate as I am leading mine, there is no other country in which it would be more appropriate for him to be today than the United States, a country which received one million economic refugees from Ireland in the space of ten years.  They were not asylum seekers but economic refugees, people who would not qualify under the Dublin Convention to stay here but would be turned away at our borders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is able to exercise great influence today for good through the political establishments on both sides of Congress and the executive branch of government in the US, it is because the US received those one million Irish economic refugees.</P>
      <P>Let no one think that was an easy or uncontroversial action at that time.  Members may have heard of the Know Nothings, who were a group of people in the US in the 1840s who demonstrated violently against Irish and German Catholics coming into the United States.  For the US Governments of the time to continue to allow Irish emigrants into the US required no less courage than is required today to allow asylum seekers into this jurisdiction.  The US had the generosity and vision to allow in those seeking economic refuge from Ireland and the US has profited from their presence.</P>
      <P>However, one cannot ignore the evidence that, having landed in the US, the Irish were engaged in some of the crueller and more objectionable racist movements in both countries.  Scarcely 20 years after the Know Nothing riots against the Irish in the US, the Irish were involved in the famous New York riots of July 1863 against black people taking jobs in New York during the height of the civil war.  The streets of New York were taken over and law and order broke down for four days because of substantial riots against black people led, unfortunately, by Irish people who had only landed on the shores of the US within the previous ten to 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the ambiguities of history with which we must come to terms.  It is very important if we look back with pride to also look back with honesty. We should learn from history not to react too readily to what is said to us by our constituents. We should not be led by our constituents but should seek to lead them.  That is where I find myself in disagreement with the tone and content of Deputy Callely's remarks.  He is a good public <Col N="267" /> representative.  The feelings he articulated are genuine, but by giving voice to them without challenging them, Deputy Callely did not do a service to his constituents or to community relations.</P>
    <P>The motion we are discussing refers to legislation being promoted in this area, the Equal Status Bill and the Employment Equality Bill. For both Bills, Members on all sides of the House owe a debt of thanks to our distinguished former colleague, Mervyn Taylor.  Legislation in these areas will make a difference that is vitally important, but legislation cannot change hearts and minds, and it is in that area much more work needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Our attitudes to travellers in particular need to change dramatically.  Many people would not recognise that within society there is a minority ethnic group that suffers substantial discrimination and racism.  The 21,000 travellers in Ireland each have stories to tell of discrimination and abuse.  Travellers are not newcomers to the country, we cannot pretend they are recent arrivals to our shores.  Yet the cultural and institutional prejudice against them in recent years has worsened rather than improved.</P>
    <P>The campaign waged last year against the Equal Status Bill by some publicans was one example of underlying assumptions and stereotypical reactions that do not say much for our attitude towards members of the travelling community. The continuing lack of progress in identifying suitable sites for travellers' homes reflects no credit on central or local government. The tendency of certain sections of the media to present traveller-related stories in lurid and confrontational terms further contributes to hostility, but as always the media only reacts to the market that buys their papers.</P>
    <P>Any society that in times of plenty cannot look after weak and marginalised minorities is fundamentally flawed.  I have already criticised the recent budget for its regressive and divisive effects in widening income gaps between rich and poor.  Minorities that suffer racism and discrimination are almost always poor.  The &ldquo;help the rich&rdquo; budget which the Government introduced will worsen the position of all those groups in society who most need help.</P>
    <P>Ireland is successfully integrated into the global economy.  Fewer major decisions that affect our economic well-being are made exclusively here. Yet while our world view may be global, some of our less appealing attitudes such as racism are insular and increasing.  The casual, often conversational and would-be humorous racism that is a feature of Irish life must be tackled and eliminated. That can best be done through school education programmes that teach children to recognise, tolerate and enjoy the diversity that is a feature of Irish and global life.</P>
    <P>We must be able to discuss the fears and concerns of local people in a rational way.  Anti-racism must not become a form of linguistic tyranny or political correctness that prevents people <Col N="268" /> articulating their concerns.  Even if the concerns are misplaced, they must first be expressed in order that they may be addressed.  There is a risk that in our anxiety to cleanse public discourse of offensive language we will deny all except a few highly sophisticated and educated people the opportunity to say things that are on their minds in language that is deemed to be acceptable.  That form of repression could lead to more unhealthy forms of expression.  There is a modern superficial media obsession with language rather than meaning, with words rather than content, what I call the gaffe syndrome that is nothing more than elitism by those who have a better command of language than others.  Unspoken fears fester. Linguistic correctness must not prevent people voicing fears in a respectful and bona fide way.</P>
    <P>The Government must seriously examine the bureaucratic and administrative chaos that is likely to flow from its so-called solution to the number of asylum seekers awaiting action from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  At this stage 4,000 cases await processing, with the likelihood of immensely expensive court actions ahead if, as will happen, expulsions are contested.  Would a more humane and less costly approach be to declare an amnesty towards asylum seekers in Ireland who have not been convicted of an offence since arriving here? There are precedents for such an approach, for instance, in the Department of the Environment and Local Government in regard to earlier administrative build-ups in the processing of applications.</P>
    <P>If such an approach were adopted it might create an acceptable basis for dealing more rigorously and in an objective way with further applications apart from those already lodged.  Otherwise there could be a long saga of delay, controversy, anxiety and difficulty.  My suggestion might enable us to start afresh on this issue in a way that would be seen across the board as humane and would allow us to deal with the problem on a better basis.</P>
    <P>There are no grounds for being smug about Ireland's reaction during European Year Against Racism.  We must recognise that the number of people in poorer countries is increasing much more quickly than the number in richer countries and the number of local wars in poorer countries is much greater than the number of those in richer countries.  The phenomenon of refugees will increase rather than decrease in the next 20 to 25 years.  The concept that the prosperous countries of Europe and North America can create a wall around themselves and prevent poorer people from coming in, allowing them only to look in through electronic media, is unreal.  That will not be sustained.  We must come to terms with the fact that we will have a multi-cultural society and we must make a choice on how we will deal with it, whether by assimilation, integration or toleration, or a combination of all three.  As a society we must face up to this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> One of the reasons I was anxious we would have this debate at the highest political level is that before this becomes a big problem a united political approach should be adopted to the issue of racism so that we can deal with it as a society and allow people to speak in respectful tones about the difficulties that exist &mdash; I do not deny difficulties exist &mdash; in such a way that it is not seen as political exploitation and that in all cases respect is shown for the human dignity of all the people involved.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton on, among other matters, the meaning of language and political correctness.  I hope those words are echoed beyond the confines of this Chamber.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to allow time for this House to send out an important signal that racism will not be tolerated and is unacceptable.  It is proof of change that debate is necessary.  Five years ago such a debate would not have been considered necessary.  Today's debate commemorates European Year Against Racism. The motion gives the House an opportunity to take a lead on racism.  Everybody has a right to live a life free from discrimination, harassment and violence. Everyone, irrespective of race, colour or creed, is entitled to dignity and respect, and it is our duty as public representatives to distinctly articulate this position.  We are speaking today for the rights and dignity of people, Irish, Europeans, Americans and other citizens, of all races as well as those seeking asylum here.</P>
      <P>I take great pleasure from the contribution the Labour Party made in drafting this motion. Racism and ethnic hatred are not quaint historical footnotes.  As we continue to see in the Great Lakes region of Africa and in the former Yugoslavia, they are very much alive.  Yugoslavia provides a clear example of the destructive consequences of an atmosphere that encourages racism.  In that state, a relatively small number of politicians used the ethnic card and fostered racial intolerance.  In a few brief years a previously stable country had collapsed into civil war and ethnic hatred.  While the differences between Ireland and Yugoslavia are great, we can draw some parallels between the consequences of an atmosphere that accepts and encourages prejudice, stereotypes and intolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As public representatives, we have a duty to ensure that such an atmosphere cannot develop here.  This means articulating clearly that discrimination and racism are unacceptable, but we must also prevent cases of perceived injustice that can be manipulated by those using the &ldquo;race&rdquo; card.  In 1965 Ireland was a signatory to the UN <Col N="270" /> Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  As the Minister stated, we remain the only EU member state not to have ratified that convention.  To emphasise our commitment to oppose all forms of racism, this Convention must be ratified as soon as possible.  I welcome the Minister's remarks on that matter. Much good work has been done on racism in Europe.  This is an important resource for Ireland to learn from the experiences of other countries and it allows us to contribute to the European debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the excellent work done under the auspices of the European Year Against Racism, as well as by such groups as the Development Education Council.  I am, however, disappointed that only £5,000 was allocated in the 1998 Estimates to continue the good work of the European Year Against Racism.  However, I was encouraged by the Minister's openness to considering expanding the money that has been provided.</P>
    <P>I applaud the inclusion of article 6A in the EU Amsterdam Treaty.  This has allowed the European Union to act in the fight against racism and was an important policy aim of the Irish EU Presidency under the last Government.  It has enabled the establishment of the European Observatory against Racism in Vienna.  I understand this will be fully operational in the New Year and I am particularly pleased that Mervyn Taylor has been appointed as Ireland's representative. There is no better candidate for the position. I also acknowledge the important work done by the EU Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia and, in particular, the contribution made by the Irish member, Professor William Duncan of Trinity College.</P>
    <P>This debate is welcome in as much as it provides a badly needed opportunity to consider the questions that arise as a result of the increased number of asylum seekers that have arrived in Ireland in recent years.  It also provides an opportunity for politicians to seek answers to the issues that have arisen and to confront some of the nonsense that has been uttered in some quarters on the matter.  We need to get this question into some reasoned perspective in the context of the numbers seeking asylum and of the overall international experience.  I reiterate the figures that have already been quoted during the debate.  If I recall correctly, the number of refugees in Sweden or Switzerland is one in 56 of the population.</P>
    <P>The debate is an occasion for the House to abandon the shrill language of extremes.  The anxiety to grab headlines should be passed over in the interest of creating a civilised atmosphere in which the relevant challenges and questions can be discussed.  However, it would be foolish not to recognise that the present problem has undesirable undertones that need to be addressed.  The problem cannot be allowed to fester further.  The <i>status quo</i> is not an option.  It is a disgrace that the problem has been allowed to <Col N="271" /> develop to such a degree.  It is not good enough that those seeking asylum are being strung along with no decisions being made on their applications for refugee status for inordinate long periods of time.  It is intolerable that the Department of Justice seems unable to address the questions that need to be confronted.  The scenes earlier this year, where those seeking refugee status had to queue in the rain for hours, should not have happened.</P>
    <P>The inability to introduce those sections of the Refugees Act 1996 that are most relevant to the resolution of the problems now festering and causing the development of a very unhealthy politics is the key factor that needs to be addressed as a route to a solution to the problem.  While there is no useful purpose pretending that legal difficulties do not exist as a result of the court action now being taken on the appointment of the refugee commissioner, it is imperative that we seek solutions to the impasse rather than retreat into defensive positions that simply facilitate a continuation of the current stalemate.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister for Justice undertook a short, realistic and focused view of the present circumstances.  If a solution is possible within the present legal framework he should act decisively to implement it.  His recent letter to the UNHCR is welcome, but not enough.  The key matter he has to address is the appointment of a commissioner for refugees and an appeals board or framework.  As it appears the Minister is unable to do that within the present legal framework, he must amend the Act to circumvent the legal impasse that exists.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that guarantees are given on translation supports for refugees so they can state their cases and be understood by those who make decisions on their future in this country.  Confusion arising from language difficulties must be eliminated as part of the concept of a fair hearing for those who wish to state their cases to be granted asylum here.  The Minister should also properly address the question of legal representation for those who wish to seek political asylum here.  The letter to Hope Hanlon makes no commitment in this regard.  Fair and open procedures which involve due process mean that those who have a case to state are provided with adequate legal support to do so.  The Minister must go further.  In the public interest and in pursuit of the common good, he must ensure that those who seek asylum have their cases heard in a cost efficient and speedy manner.  The longer the delay in processing cases, the greater will be the cost of maintaining applicants by the social services. The longer the delay, the greater the opportunity for the development of political discord, the enhancement of prejudice and the development of unfounded fears about asylum seekers.  Good intentions and well meaning aspirations in this area are not enough for a fair and lasting resolution to the problem.  Doing what seems good and well intentioned in the short-term <Col N="272" /> may lead to worse problems.  We must consider the consequences of the actions and ensure our good intentions are sustained and supported by putting in place the necessary means for the desired effect.</P>
    <P>It is time people in politics and in the services took cognisance of the fact that good and noble intentions and policies do not guarantee good results.  People who do not consider the consequences of their actions, however well intentioned, are not behaving responsibly.  With this in mind, there is no purpose in pretending that everyone who applies for refugee status is bona fide.  Those who support the case for a civilised attitude to refugees must have the courage to accept this; otherwise progress will be hindered. There is a need for transparency and honesty on all sides if the problem is to be resolved.</P>
    <P>It would also be a great mistake if our anxiety to find solutions to the problems we face in relation to asylum seekers led us to rush to simplistic conclusions that large numbers of Irish people are racist.  I do not believe that is the case. Many asylum seekers are located in the inner city area, which has a long history of accepting people of different ethnic origins.  It was the home of the Jewish community for many years.  I am delighted Deputy Briscoe, who is a member of that community, is a Member of the House and people do not pay a great deal of attention to the origins of his family.  The inner city has also been home to many members of the Muslim community, and there has not been any serious intolerance.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann</P>
      <P>(a) condemns the action of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with special responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, in his unprecedented decision to overturn on 2nd December, 1997, a decision made by Carlow Urban Council and approved by the Department of the Environment in June, 1997, to build 26 houses</P>
      <P>(b) requests the Minister of State to make a comprehensive statement on his contacts in the matter with Senator Jim Gibbons, Chairman of the Progressive Democrats Parliamentary Party;</P>
      <P>(c) questions the undermining by the Minister of State of decisions properly and democratically taken by Carlow Urban District Council and approved by his Department;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) calls on the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Leader <Col N="273" /> of Progressive Democrats, and on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make statements on the issue;</P>
    <P>(e) calls on the Minister of State to account for his actions in the matter; and</P>
    <P>(f) calls on the Government to overturn his rescinding decision and to make funds available for the completion of the project.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the House, I wish to share time with Deputies Hayes and Creed.</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, gave an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; during which he was asked by Mr. David Hanly why he had changed a decision which had already been made.  He said a final decision had not been made.  That is in sharp contrast to a reply I received on 4 December to an Adjournment debate matter when he told me the plans for the local authority housing were discussed and agreed at local level between the local authority and the Department's technical inspectorate and design approval had issued in June 1997.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  On 9 June 1997 Ms Patricia Ballantine from the housing construction section of the Department of the Environment and Local Government wrote to the town clerk.  The letter stated:</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to your letter and submission of 19 February 1997 concerning the above [housing scheme at Shaw Park, Athy Road, Carlow] and to say there are no objections to the proposals submitted.  The Council are reminded that if the current estimated all-in cost (based on the tender amount) is within the unit cost ceiling the Council are free to accept the lowest valid tender without seeking the Department's approval as outlined in the Department's circular N1/97 paragraph 6(i). However if this is not the case, all tender details and tender analysis are to be submitted for approval.  The Council are asked to submit details of site costs on the enclosed form.</P>
    <P>That letter gave the council permission to continue with the housing scheme.  The Minister's statement on the radio this morning contradicts what he told me in the House and the contents of the letter from the Department.</P>
    <P>This motion was tabled because of the Minister's unprecedented decision to overrule a democratic decision made by Carlow Urban District Council and approved by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  This was gross interference in something which did not concern him.  This is not a debate about open spaces, about which the Minister professed his love during the Adjournment debate on this issue.  Carlow Urban District Council advertised in the usual way, received objections from people and then decided to build the houses following the manager's recommendation.  It was advised to <Col N="274" /> build a mixed scheme of ten co-op and 16 local authority houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons objected to this development on the grounds of invasion of privacy, trespass and damage to property.  He was entitled to do that in a democratic society.  However, we are now getting information about open spaces, although Senator Gibbons did not mention them in his objection.  Senator Gibbons is chairman of the Progressive Democrats' parliamentary party and he had a word in the Minister's ear.  Democratic decisions are being turned on their head to keep the boys in jobs.  The Minister and the Senator agreed they discussed this matter but neither seems to have asked the other about stopping this development.  Senator Gibbons said he did not have to power to ask the Minister to stop it.  I am sure he had the power to ask him but whether the Minister had the power to do so is another matter.</P>
    <P>I refute the Minister's statement that my allegations and insinuations were contemptuous.  I have defended the democratic system which elects us.  In 1975 the Minister made contemptuous allegations and insinuations about Mr. Jim Tully.  The then Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, said it should be made clear that there was not a scintilla of evidence to justify such unscrupulous allegations against him.  The Minister wants to put my defence of democracy on the same level as his actions then.  Justice was done in that case.  A rocket was fired and the Minister was sent from the Front Bench to outer space.  I hope the Tánaiste will fire another rocket in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste was strong in her defence of democracy during a debate on a confidence motion on 16 November 1994.  In the Official Report, 16 November 1994, volume 447 at column 365, she stated:</P>
    <P>One person's standards are perhaps different from other people's standards but there are basic community standards, basic values by which ordinary people expect us to live.  Those of us who represent the people in this House are honoured and we have a duty to live and work by normal decent values.  People do not want saints in the Dáil .. ; they want ordinary people who are prepared to adhere to ordinary standards and they want people to take the rap and the responsibility when they get it wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not claim to be a saint but he is not an ordinary person prepared to adhere to ordinary standards.  He wants extraordinary standards which is why he interfered in decisions already made and tried to stand democracy on its head.  Is he prepared to take the rap and responsibility now that he is wrong?  He backed down once this motion was tabled because wiser heads prevailed in Government who would not tolerate what he was trying to do.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste also said during the debate on the confidence motion that &ldquo;democracy is a very fragile thing and sometimes many people take it <Col N="275" /> for granted.  They do not do that in other countries&rdquo;. She explained that the Premier of Denmark was suspended and the Premier of Western Australia jailed.  She asked what would have happened in Ireland.  What will happen now that the Minister has behaved badly and shown low standards in high places?  I do not take democracy for granted; it should defended.  The Tánaiste also said during that debate that other democracies &ldquo;know that democracy is a fragile thing and that we need eternal vigilance to ensure it is preserved&rdquo;.  We must have &ldquo;eternal vigilance&rdquo; to ensure that undemocratic decisions do not go unchallenged.</P>
    <P>It was decided to build on Shaw Park in Carlow, which is 5.27 acres.  The Minister said he was in Carlow in 1971 to open the outdoor swimming pool.  Much water has gone in and out of that swimming pool since then.  It has been closed for the past three years.  A new indoor swimming pool was built in Graiguecullen at a fraction of the normal cost due to the wonderful work of two priests, Fr. Fingleton and Fr. O'Connell.  It is open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and is making money. The outdoor pool might have been all right 26 years ago or if we had six months of good weather.  Shaw Park contains only 5.27 acres, Graiguecullen park has 12 acres across the river from it and Hanover park contains 13 acres.  I agree with Senator Gibbons and the Minister of State on the need for parks in towns and Carlow badly needs to develop a park.  The land at Hanover and Graiguecullen parks is being developed under the urban renewal scheme and we cannot advance fast enough.  Carlow people are going to Kilkenny to enable their children to amuse themselves in parks.</P>
    <P>It is vital we have a park, but we are arguing about 5.27 acres, half of which will be developed for housing.  The site is regarded as derelict and is located behind a row of houses, one of which is owned by Senator Gibbons.  It is secluded and considered unsafe for young people.  The idea is that with half of the land developed as a playground under the supervision of those in the houses, it will be a much safer place.  Half a loaf is better than no bread and I support calls for a park in Carlow.</P>
    <P>After all submissions were made, the county manager encouraged the council to proceed with the scheme.  In a letter to the council he stated:</P>
    <P>1.  Construction of a new swimming pool in Graiguecullen, to which the council is an annual contributor for operating costs, made the former swimming pool in Shaw Park obsolete and necessitated its closure.  There is little prospect for any future use of the pool, in my view, because it is unlikely that Carlow could sustain two swimming pools.  Since closure, the pool site in Shaw Park has become an area of hazard and would have to be dealt with by the Council for safety reasons, either by way of demolition or filling in the swimming pool area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> 2.  Because of its backland location Shaw Park has not functioned properly as a park for a considerable time and has been a cause for concern because of vandalism and other undesirable activities continually taking place in the area.</P>
    <P>3.  The construction of houses is a practical and beneficial use for the area and is very much in conformity with the Government's current policy on Social Housing and housing location.</P>
    <P>This is a reference to the fact that ten co-operative houses were being built by people who had permission and were brave enough to get loans and build their houses amid urban council houses.</P>
    <P>The fourth argument was that &ldquo;a considerable area of land will still remain for amenity use and it is intended to arrange for an upgrading of this remaining space to make it pleasant and provide an attractive connection between the Athy Road and the Barrow River.  &rdquo;</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>In the overall thinking in relation to the provision of parks in Carlow it is unlikely that the Urban District Council will have sufficient financial resources to maintain three park areas in a town the size of Carlow.  The second phase of Hanover Park is now about to commence and it is intended to complete this work as soon as possible which will provide the town with a highly attractive park in a very central area. Following on from that it would be the intention to upgrade the Graiguecullen Park which is pleasantly located beside the Barrow River. Provided they are maintained properly, Carlow as a town would then be very well served by park provision.  Because it will not be possible to maintain more park area than the Hanover and Graiguecullen Parks, it is important that a suitable alternative land use be made of the former Shaw Park.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it is recommended to Council that the development proposals for Shaw Park be allowed to proceed.</P>
    <P>The county engineer then gave his views on why it should go ahead.  He referred to a summary of the submissions, some of which justifiably argued against the idea of building houses in Shaw Park. This is democracy at work as people are entitled to argue against it.  He stated:</P>
    <P>A number of those who wrote on this matter complained at the loss of the park and, in particular, the swimming pool.  As previously outlined, the park has not functioned properly in its original state.  This proposal still retains portion of the area as a park.  It will be possible to maintain this to a higher standard because of the reduced area involved.  The presence of houses in the areas as previously mentioned will also ensure that the occurrence of vandalism in the area in the hours of darkness will be minimised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> He goes on to explain that the privacy of houses, etc., will be protected by building a two metre wall.  One submission complained about the lack of water which occurred when the swimming pool was in use.  It was not a serious problem.  He also referred to another submission that more houses be built and he did not want that either.  He concluded:</P>
    <P>I feel this is a worthy proposal in conformity with the zoning guidelines of the present UDC plan and draft plan.  It acknowledges the failure of the park in its current form and while still retaining portion of the site as a park also provides a well designed in-fill housing scheme. The privacy considerations of the residents on the Athy Road can also be met successfully with a two metre boundary wall.</P>
    <P>The council made its decision and received approval on June 9 and was told not to come back unless the cost per unit was over the limit.  The ten couples involved in the co-operative bought their sites.  They even drew lots for them and knew exactly who their neighbours would be. They hired a contractor and waited for the project to begin.</P>
    <P>The UDC would build were it not for the Minister of State's letter in August.  He focused his periscope on Carlow for some strange reason and decided to take a special interest in it.  I do not believe his interest was in open spaces because he would not have known about them had he not been contacted by his colleague, Senator Jim Gibbons. What took place between them and what did they discuss?  Both say they did not ask each other about the housing scheme.  Senator Gibbons in an interview with Michael Godfrey in <i>The Nationalist</i> said he did not ask the Minister to stop it as it was not in his power to do that.  This is strange language, but perhaps he meant something else.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gibbons said in Carlow people asked him on becoming a Senator to make representations to stop the housing development or to have it reviewed.  This is where democracy goes out the window.  If he thinks a democratic decision made by the urban council and approved by the Department can be rescinded just because he becomes a Senator and his colleague becomes Minister with responsibility for housing, there is something awfully wrong with the attitude of the Progressive Democrats Party and it appalls me.</P>
    <P>Those involved could have appealed to An Bord Pleanála, which is democracy at work.  They did not do so when the decision to build the houses was made.  It is backdoor politics if one can skip over the democratic system and go directly to a Minister.  The Minister of State's talk about open spaces is a fig leaf, an attempt to cover his shame.  He is still stark naked because he has no defence for what he did.</P>
    <P>He wrote to the county manager in August expressing regret.  The county manager replied and explained the position in detail, which is why it is unforgivable for the Minister of State to have <Col N="278" /> done what he did.  The Minister of State could have at least read the county manager's letter, dated October 28, and which was addressed to one of his officials, Ms McGuinness.  It stated:</P>
    <P>I write in connection with your letter, received on the 18th August last..</P>
    <P>The options available, which are very limited in Carlow at present, are still under consideration to see how quickly a viable alternative scheme could be put in place if necessary.</P>
    <P>While the concern raised by the Minister is valid and was considered locally it may be helpful in his fuller consideration of the situation to be appraised of the context in which the proposals evolved for the two schemes at Shaw Park.</P>
    <P>Apart from other open spaces which are shown coloured green.  .there are three parks in public ownership.  These are, Hanover Park, Graiguecullen Park and Shaw Park, which are outlined in red and blue on the map.</P>
    <P>Shaw Park contains 5.27 acres, Graiguecullen Park 12.50 acres and Hanover Park 13.15 acres.</P>
    <P>Shaw Park is located in a backland situation and also contains the formerly used outdoor Swimming Pool which was closed three years ago when a new indoor pool was opened in Graiguecullen.  The pool in Shaw Park had become derelict, is in a generally dangerous condition and subject to continued vandalism which is common in this park area because it is banklands and without any visual social control.</P>
    <P>A strategic review of policy for parks in Carlow Town took the view that with a relatively weak financial base, the UDC would not be able to sustain adequate maintenance for three public parks of the size indicated above.  The agreed policy which emerged from this review was that the Hanover Park and the Graiguecullen Park would be up-graded to a very high standard by the use of Urban and Village Renewal Schemes and that these Parks will subsequently be maintained to a very high standard and become important amenities for the citizens of Carlow.  The review also resulted in the inclusion of relevant statements relating to Shaw Park in the Carlow Urban District Development Plan, extracts of which are enclosed for information.</P>
    <P>It was within this background that a housing design emerged for Shaw Park.  It is also important to note that the process has been in train for a considerable time and was brought to approval stage with the Department in June last.  (See letter .). A résumé of the steps taken in relation to the scheme is shown on the enclosed Housing Officer's note to the Town Clerk ..</P>
    <P>Apart from the provision of 16 local authority houses, a proposal was also developed to <Col N="279" /> allocate sites for 10 houses at Shaw Park to the Carlow Friendly Society Co-Op.  This had support of Councillors and the enclosed letter dated 24th July 1996 from Councillor Walter Lacey [the only Progressive Democrat councillor in the town] the then Chairman of Carlow UDC is apposite.  Following negotiations for disposal of the 10 sites, the Society completed its registration of a Co-Op and proceeded to have plans drawn up to obtain planning permission for the development of the 10 houses. The formal procedure for the disposal of the sites was also undertaken and disposal was approved by UDC by Resolution on the 27th May 1997.  Planning Permission for the Co-Op houses was issued on the 25th July last and a copy of this. is enclosed ..</P>
    <P>Given the circumstances which now exist, there would be considerable legal difficulties and other serious considerations including financial costs, if the Carlow UDC were to attempt to withdraw from the contractual obligations already entered into with the Co-Op given the stage to which matters have already advanced.</P>
    <P>If the Minister read that and did not act I do not know what he was thinking about.</P>
    <P>In a situation where the 10 Co-Op houses have to proceed because of the legal realities which exist, the exclusion of the local authority element will leave a very unsatisfactory development situation prevailing in Shaw Park. The Council would then have to address this problem having regard to policy already determined and included in the Development Plan as adopted.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might further consider the matter in the wider view of the content of this letter and my own recommendation is that the local authority scheme should, in all the circumstances, be allowed to proceed.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that considerable adjustments were already made to the housing design to accommodate adjoining existing residences and the Council will provide adequate boundaries etc., to ensure that the development does not impinge on the existing amenity levels of adjoining properties. Out of the total area 5.27 acres in Shaw Park, an area of 2.35 acres will remain and will not be built up.  It is intended that this area will be properly landscaped and used for local amenity purposes.</P>
    <P>As the implications which may arise from non-completion of the local authority element of the development in Shaw Park are likely to give rise to considerable difficulties at a number of levels, I will be glad to supply any additional clarification required or to attend any meeting considered necessary regarding the proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> Had the Minister read that letter he would have realised he was going astray.  Last week he asked two of his officials to meet local authority officials in Carlow &mdash; another fig leaf to cover his nakedness &mdash; who decided there was nothing wrong with what was proposed.  The Minister magnanimously said, in the exceptional circumstances, he would give the go ahead now.  There are no exceptional circumstances except the Minister's decision to overrule the original decision.  If the Fine Gael motion had not been submitted to the Minister of State last Thursday no decision would have been made and he would have insulted democracy.  I regret having to say this today but as a democratically elected Member, it is important that like the Minister's leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, we honour and respect democracy.  What the Minister of State did was an insult to democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This entire episode is a sorry one. It involves a Minister of State who has poked his nose into the legitimate decision making process of a local authority and who has flagrantly abused his position by sorting out the interests of his friend and party Member.  Despite the spin the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is trying to put on recent events, the public and the people of Carlow will not buy his story.  This affair which undermines the essence of local government smacks of the worst possible practice in politics &mdash; looking after a friend or a relative.</P>
      <P>Just three weeks ago the Progressive Democrats influence in Government paid back its wellto-do and elitist electorate.  We are now seeing the same principle of pay-back time copied by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in his dealings with a member of his party.  The budget and the controversy we are discussing could well signal the final re-entry of the Progressive Democrats to Fianna Fáil.  This would be a logical progression given that the practices of Fianna Fáil in Government have now been copied by its PD partners. There is one law for ordinary members of the public and another for party colleagues and hacks.</P>
      <P>This controversy undermines the process of decision making.  It makes redundant the notion that local government will decide local matters. Given the interference in this matter, there is a complete betrayal of the principle of local autonomy by the Minister of State.  The Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium states that key priorities will include a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups.  This priority puts emphasis on local authorities to make decisions.  The actions of the Minister of State have not only undermined this priority but have shown a complete disregard for the Government programme and the primacy of the local authority housing department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have expected more from the Minister of State given his preaching about high standards in office in recent years.  After only six months in <Col N="281" /> the job all those principles which he previously espoused are in the skip.</P>
    <P>The Shaw Park affair needs to be examined by this House.  Fundamental questions must be answered by the Minister of State about his involvement in this entire fiasco.  A decision of Carlow UDC and Carlow Friendly Co-Operative Society has been turned on its head by the actions of the Minister of State.  Why should the Minister who so vehemently opposed the construction of 26 dwellings in Shaw Park now inform the House that he is in favour of the development going ahead?  What has changed the Minister's view which was so implacably opposed to building on public amenity space?  The Minister of State informed the House on 4 December 1997 as reported in the Official Report at column 368:</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary to sacrifice a public park or other designated recreational areas to housing.</P>
    <P>Why has he performed a somersault on this issue given that last Friday the entire project was given the go-ahead?  The Minister explains there were exceptional circumstances.  Following the meeting with his officials and local authority officials from Carlow, will the Minister explain what precisely are the exceptional circumstances which have led him to do a U-turn on this matter?</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister of State change his mind?  What forces were at work?  On 4 December he said &ldquo;I am not convinced there are other suitable sites in the Carlow area&rdquo;.  Eight days later he had to swallow his words.  It is obvious from the swift reaction of his party leader and the way his colleagues in Government have distanced themselves from him that he has been allowed to walk the plank alone.  He has, effectively, been dumped.</P>
      <P>Despite this we still have to get to the heart of the discussion which took place between the Minister of State and his colleague, Senator Gibbons. What power of persuasion does Senator Gibbons have over his power-wielding colleague? No member of the public would accept the version of events submitted by the Minister of State. Senator Gibbons had a direct interest in the decision-making process.  We need to know the extent of his intervention.  It is not good enough that a politician can be placed in a powerful position where he can interfere with the legitimate decision of local government.  It shows a callous disregard for the balance between local and central Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne stated during the Adjournment debate on 4 December that the matter had been resolved successfully by Carlow Urban District Council.  The housing mix proposed &mdash; 10 co-op and 16 local authority &mdash; would have been a much needed addition to the council's housing stock.  I understand there are more than 500 people on the local housing list.  I am a firm <Col N="282" /> believer in the concept of infill development, particularly in urban areas where we should seek to establish a better social housing mix.  Too often there is a Berlin Wall divide between public and private housing.  In my constituency we have to live with the problems associated with sprawling local authority housing estates where there are few examples of infrastructural projects.  There can be a huge public reaction to the provision of local authority housing beside private residential areas but this equation offers much more stable local authority housing in the long run.</P>
    <P>I hope the days of segregating local authority tenants from private home owners are well and truly gone.  We are living with the disastrous consequences of that snob attitude.  When one looks coolly at this affair one will see that a small number of private residents attempted to block the excellent social housing plan devised by the local authority.  They were backed to the hilt by the actions of the Minister of State.  He bowed to the snob attitude instead of performing his statutory function in helping the local authority to provide housing.  Should we be surprised by this given that there is a Progressive Democrats' Minister of State in charge of housing policy?  The reintegration of the Minister of State and his Progressive Democrats' colleagues into Fianna Fail is complete.  Low standards in high office are the order of the day for this rag-bag minority coalition.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time with me and compliment him for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  It smacks of extraordinary interference in the affairs of local government by the Minister of State with responsibility for local authority housing. Local authorities are continually undermined by their dependence on central Government.  In this instance the level of interference is unprecedented.</P>
      <P>One should begin with an analysis of the founding principles of the Progressive Democrats, the political party involved.  Their foundation stone was high standards in public office and openness and transparency in decision-making. They were launched following the expulsion of Deputy O'Malley from Fianna Fáil for conduct unbecoming.  That is what we are witnessing in this instance.  In one fell swoop the Minister of State with responsibility for local authority housing has attempted to cut the legs from under the local authority concerned in coming to a democratic decision.</P>
      <P>This has been <i>annus horribilis</i> for the Progressive Democrats.  They were decimated when the public spoke their mind in the general election in June when their number was reduced to four. There have been recent setbacks, including the Seagate debacle, although the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was not directly at fault, which was handled in a shoddy manner as well as the controversy surrounding the publication of donations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> What the Minister of State has been engaged in strikes at the heart of the founding principles of the Progressive Democrats.  We will wait with bated breath to see how he will extricate himself from this problem.  What is at stake is his suitability for office.  Can the local authorities with which he has to deal on a daily basis retain confidence in him given that with one stroke of a pen he has attempted to deny local representatives who had followed due process in planning procedure their democratic rights?  This calls into question the Government's commitment to increase their powers.  It beggars belief that the Minister of State who has long experience as a member of a local authority and of the Oireachtas and who is a former Minister for the Environment should act in such a cavalier and undemocratic fashion to pursue the selfish interests of a party colleague.  I do not wish to overstate the matter but I will wait with considerable interest to see how he will extricate himself from this problem.  His suitability and credibility are at stake.</P>

    <P>This matter was raised on the Adjournment on 4 December when I explained in full my thinking on the use of public parks for development of any <Col N="284" /> kind.  I announced that the housing scheme proposed for Shaw Park in Carlow was to be the subject of further discussions to see if an alternative solution could be found to preserve and develop Shaw Park for the enjoyment of the citizens of Carlow.  As Deputies know, following discussions at local level I made my final decision on the matter on that day when I gave the scheme the go-ahead.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I am surprised the Opposition is continuing to pursue the issue in the House and the media.  It is a pointless exercise. It shows the opportunism of the Opposition and its inability to focus on serious political issues.  It should have been obvious from my contribution to the Adjournment debate that I was still considering the matter.  I could reasonably have expected the Opposition to wait until I had received a report from my officials and made my decision before raising the matter in this way.  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal I have two distinct duties in this matter.  The first is to ensure that the range of social housing measures is developed to its full potential to ensure that housing is available to those who require it and cannot afford to provide it themselves.  The second is to ensure that our towns and urban areas retain an environment centred on their indigenous communities who need both living and recreational space as important components of their lives.</P>
    <P>People who live in towns and urban areas generally live in areas of higher density development than their rural counterparts and are very dependent on the provision of different types of open space &mdash; public, semi-public and private &mdash; each of which complements the different aspects and needs of urban living.  The first type is the small neighbourhood square or park, not unlike Shaw Park in Carlow.  Traditionally, small public squares with local shops and services or, alternatively, small parks for recreational purposes are found at the heart of such neighbourhoods.  This type of space is a resource which can help nurture the creation of specific, identifiable neighbourhoods within the greater urban area.  I hope Members will agree that such a resource should be protected and not sacrificed to development.</P>
    <P>The housing development at Shaw Park, Carlow, the subject of this motion consists of two separate proposals: one for the construction of ten houses by the Carlow Friendly Housing Co-operative Society on sites being made available to its members by Carlow Urban District Council and, second, the construction of 16 local authority houses on another part of the same site.</P>
    <P>The development of the housing by the co-operative society was to be facilitated by the disposal of sites at a subsidised cost to members of the society by the urban district council under the sale of housing sites scheme.  The plans for the local authority housing were agreed at local level between the local authority and the Department's technical inspectorate, design approval having been issued in June, l997.  This was a purely routine <Col N="285" /> approval of the type issued regularly by the Department without reference to the Minister of State and did not require, nor did it receive formal endorsement by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>Members will recall that I explained to the House on the Adjournment Debate on 4 December that I had concerns about the choice of an existing public park as a site for housing. Last August I conveyed to the local authority my reluctance to make public funds available for the provision of housing at this location which was a public park.  I should make it clear that I had no objection to the design of the schemes and was impressed at the manner in which the two forms of housing were combined in an imaginative layout. Schemes of this nature are worthwhile.  I had no hesitation in commending Carlow Urban District Council on promoting the development of voluntary and local authority housing in close proximity on the same site.  My only reservation related to the choice of an existing public park as a site for the housing schemes.</P>
    <P>I take particular exception to claims that I took a decision in this case on the basis of personal political considerations, which is simply not true.</P>

      <P>Approval of the layout and scheme design had already been issued.  However, because of my concern at the use of a public park as a site for these houses I was anxious to have alternative possibilities examined.  In the course of that Adjournment Debate I stated that, arguably, selection of site was the most important consideration in the provision of new housing.  I suggested that the local authority should be able to find an alternative location to enable the housing schemes go ahead.  I was anxious that efforts be made by Carlow Urban District Council to ensure that the housing got under way as early as possible but that the amenity of Shaw Park be retained if at all possible.</P>

      <P>Immediately following the meeting it was reported to me that members of the co-operative society had made a very convincing presentation of their case to have the new housing proceed at Shaw Park, having already spent a considerable amount of time developing their proposal and maintained that some degree of personal hardship would be involved if the scheme was delayed further.  The co-operative society had seen how successful other earlier co-operative housing ventures had been in Carlow and wished to follow that success with their scheme.  My officials also confirmed to me, following consultation with the manager, that it would be some time before a suitable alternative site for the housing scheme could be identified and developed.  In fact the only two sites the manager offered as alternatives was one which he said was flooded &mdash; whose level would need to be raised, rendering it unsuitable &mdash; and another located two and a half miles outside the town which would not have been suitable either.</P>

      <P>In those circumstances I decided to give the go-ahead to the two housing schemes at Shaw Park.  Only on receipt of the report from my officials on Friday last did I make the final decision in this case.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what Members may think, I know Shaw Park.  I have good memories of a day in l971 when I opened a swimming pool there already referred to.  As we know, the park was officially named George Bernard Shaw Park in l991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I was surprised and horrified to learn it had fallen into virtual disuse and lay derelict.  I felt it should have been possible to have had it maintained as a valuable local resource.  I regard it as an exceptional measure that housing be developed there.  Indeed, it is some comfort to me to know that the plans for the site include the retention of a portion of the park as open space for future residents.</P>
      <P>I understand there is considerable relief in Carlow that the problem has now been resolved and that good social housing schemes can now proceed. I wish the members of the co-operative society good luck in the future and hope that other groups in Carlow and elsewhere will follow their example and become involved in developing their housing proposals in association with their relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>I should now like to make some general comments on the broader issues raised by this case. As I said, selection of site is probably the single most important consideration in the process of providing housing since any new housing development always will have a significant contribution to make to its locality/neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> Substantial public funds are invested in the provision of social housing and the range of options now open to housing authorities affords them a measure of flexibility not available heretofore. Therefore, it is essential that authorities avail of those opportunities provided by the social housing programme to ensure that their housing schemes provide not only good living standards but contribute to the integrated development of the areas in which they are located.</P>
    <P>Decisions on social housing at local level must be taken with a view to the overall urban fabric, not least their impact on the availability of public amenities in the area.  Normally it should not be necessary to sacrifice a public park or other designated recreational area to housing or other forms of development.  I appreciate it is imperative for housing authorities to meet their housing needs within the framework of their programmes and capital allocations.  However, they must also weigh carefully the balance of advantage and disadvantage in losing a public recreational resource.  It has been suggested that parks and other similar recreational areas often become the focus of anti-social behaviour and, consequently, become unusable.  In my view this is a reflection on the management by local authorities of such important local resources.  But denying the public as a whole the use of an amenity is not the answer.</P>
    <P>I reject utterly the allegations and insinuations made about my motivation in the stance I have taken on this important issue.  I expect Members will see the good sense of the position I have outlined and will agree with my desire to maintain a balance between developing good social housing and preserving existing public amenities.</P>

      <P>Urban renewal policies have been instrumental in transforming many of our towns and urban areas.  The maintenance of existing recreational and open space and the designation of new suitable and sufficient areas of open space is an important objective in urban renewal.  The implementation of social housing policy can influence the shape of urban areas and promote the <Col N="288" /> growth of local communities.  In many ways social housing and urban renewal policies complement each other; they should not conflict with each other.</P>
      <P>Mitigation of the ill effects of social segregation associated with the traditional approach to housing provision has been central to social housing policy in recent years.  There has been a growing emphasis on the role of social housing policy in counteracting social exclusion, in promoting the development of viable communities and in renewing urban areas.  The significance of location, size of development and good design both at the level of the overall scheme and the individual dwelling unit, and associated amenities for the community has been increasingly recognised. Deputies will be aware there has been an upsurge in infill housing in urban areas.  Local authorities are increasingly recognising the value of providing small well designed housing schemes in the heart of urban areas where communities are already settled, where services and amenities, including parks, are readily available and where the development creates a new energy in what may be a run down area.</P>
      <P>The provision of appropriate open spaces alongside housing fulfils many community functions in providing meeting places, recreational areas, sports and entertainment facilities and general amenity and well being.  Open spaces also provide an important environmental function. We have all learnt that trees are the earth's lungs.</P>

      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to local authorities on selecting sites for housing.  These guidelines include specific advice on the importance of providing open space in association with housing.  It is worth noting some of the points made.  In deciding on the extent and nature of provision for open space within a housing scheme, local authorities are advised to have regard to the size of the scheme, the nature of accommodation being provided, existing needs and provision in the area and the requirements of the development plan for the area.  Open space generally should be laid out so that it is attractive and will be used by the residents.  Play spaces for small children should be provided close to the <Col N="289" /> dwellings and be overlooked from the dwellings where possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are advised that where playgrounds are not already available in reasonable proximity to the scheme, consideration should be given to providing such facilities.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned that more and more local authorities are turning to infill development in urban areas to provide housing.  This is sound urban renewal practice but it also reflects the need for local authorities to avail of all possible sources of land for housing in the current competitive climate in the land market.  Deputies will appreciate that where such infill housing development takes place it will not be possible to develop new open recreational areas alongside the houses. Reliance will have to be placed on existing parks, playgrounds and open space.</P>
      <P>Significant thought has gone into the guidelines to local authorities on the provision of landscaping, open space and amenities in conjunction with new housing schemes.  It is all the more important that where these facilities already exist, every effort must be made to retain and maintain them.</P>
      <P>The growing importance of not relying on local authority housing to meet social housing need is shown in the continuing participation of the voluntary and co-operative sector in housing provision. The sector also encourages people to have a greater sense of responsibility for their housing and their estates and helps to develop a sense of co-operation and partnership among local communities.</P>
      <P>With my background as a public representative, I support measures to promote social housing schemes and reduce the pressure on the local authority housing lists.  There are many people on the local authority housing list who, with the proper support, could use the social housing schemes to provide houses for themselves.  I am especially impressed by the efforts of co-operative groups to supply their own housing.  The Carlow Friendly Housing Co-operative Society provides a good example of the dedication and commitment which groups of mainly young people are prepared to invest in a co-operative effort.  It is not an easy process; it requires staying power and the focus to see a project through from the initial idea through design and planning to construction. There are many complex features attached to a project of this nature which may often be difficult to bring to fruition.  However, as the Carlow housing development shows, there is scope for creating good working partnerships between local authorities and co-operative groups to provide housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes the case that a single successful co-operative venture can spark off subsequent ventures, establishing a strong local tradition of co-operative effort.  There are a number of social housing measures available to assist co-operative <Col N="290" /> ventures.  The sale of housing sites scheme, used to facilitate the Carlow co-operative scheme, is one such mechanism.  It enables housing sites to be sold at a subsidised cost to individuals or groups who propose to build houses on them.  I would encourage local authorities to give greater prominence to these and the other social housing measures which support the voluntary and co-operative effort which is an essential part of social housing provision.</P>
    <P>In our headlong rush to develop and grow, it is too easy to underrate basic amenities, such as parks, play areas and recreational facilities.  These have long been a feature of the urban landscape but may now sometimes appear to be valuable urban development sites.</P>

      <P>In view of the special circumstances, I have agreed to this development. However, I consider these locations to be of absolute value and it is a retrograde step to seek to convert them into building sites.  They are valuable spaces which future generations will thank <Col N="291" /> us for preserving.  As a general rule, they should not be used as building sites but retained and, where possible, improved and developed so that people can enjoy them.</P>
      <P>There will be continued acceleration in urban dwelling.  The move from the land to the cities is constant.  We do not want to end up with housing areas which do not have recreational spaces.  The spaces in this area are valuable and deserve to be preserved.

      <P>The motion may appear to refer to a local matter and be of no great national significance. However, on closer inspection it goes to the root of our democratic systems and the requirement for openness in public administration.  In recent years virtually all parties represented in the House have tried to restore to public office public confidence and understanding that things were done by the book in an open way without fear or favouritism.  We enacted legislation, including the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Act. I negotiated with the parties opposite and those in Opposition on those matters.  There is a shared view across the parties that there is a requirement on us to act in a very open and transparent way in how we administer the business charged to us by the public.  It has been said by some of the Fine Gael Deputies in speaking to this motion that of all the parties in this House the Progressive Democrats set themselves up as being the particular guardians of righteousness in relation to public administration.  They were so correct and right and that was a founding principle of their party.  They could not be associated with Fianna Fáil because of the disrepute it had brought to the public administration system.</P>

      <P>They split from Fianna Fáil and established their own party.  We remember temporary little arrangements.  The essence of the PD credo was to be unlike that of any other political party.  They were going to do things in a righteous way, and what has happened here.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing took a decision that begs questioning in this House. Housing is one of the most important functions of the Department with responsibility for local government and the environment of which I was privileged to be Minister for a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that since 1993 the attitude to housing has changed.  Ask any local authority member what was the position on public housing the last <Col N="292" /> time the Progressive Democrats were in Government and he or she will reply that virtually no local authority housing was built at that time. Every Government since 1993 has reversed that position and has worked to provide, to the best of the Exchequer's ability, for those in need of shelter.  I am glad to say that two of those Administrations involved the Labour Party, initially with Fianna Fáil, in reversing the trend of the early 1990s&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>And the late 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and more recently with Fine Gael and Democratic Left.  Fianna Fáil was in Government in the late 1980s.  That policy has been reconfirmed by the Government.  That is an acknowledgement of the need and the right of individuals to have decent shelter in the form of proper social housing.</P>
      <P>All that was copperfastened by the publication of two programmes for social housing, the first was announced by my predecessor, the then Minister, Deputy Smith, who outlined a range of social housing options which were more extensive than the traditional local authority housing and included issues such as co-operative housing.  The second is a more recent updated social housing policy published by the former Minister of State, Deputy McManus and me in our time in office. All of that led to a new focus on housing, the nature of Government and public support for social housing and an understanding of moving away from building masses of houses on a greenfield site to the notion of infill housing.  That was laid out in black and white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons the proposal from Carlow UDC was particularly suitable.  It fits perfectly into the policy enunciated initially by the then Minister, Deputy Smith, and reconfirmed by the policy of the former Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and me during our time in office.  Infill housing is a mix of local authority housing and co-operative housing that meets a variety of housing needs.  It is supported by the democratically elected local council.  It is also supported in writing by the Department of the Environment.  On 9 June a letter from the housing construction section of the Department of the Environment to the Carlow town clerk, reference N42/2/43, states there is no objection to the proposal submitted. It also states that the council is reminded that if the current estimated all in cost is within the unit cost ceiling the council is free to accept the lowest available tender without seeking the Department's further approval.  The message was to go ahead and to build as outlined, but what happened? There was an unprecedented move.  I have no recollection of any incoming Minister upturning the decision of a previous Government in a matter such as this.  Often an incoming Minister does not agree with the priority set, and sometimes not even the principles underpinning it, by his or her predecessor.  However, the principle of continuity is understood.  While we may <Col N="293" /> say we will do something differently in the future I know of no instance where a Minister upturned the validly made decision of his or her predecessor in a matter such as this.</P>
    <P>The sequence of events has been ably given by Deputy Browne to the House.  A clearly presented, valid and good proposal was put forward by Carlow Urban District Council and Carlow Friendly Housing Co-operative Society to meet the needs of their respective clients in an organised and clear way.  Why then did the Minister of State decide in this instance to interfere and stop the development?  The Minister's response is that he has a passion, and a long held one as we heard during his long speech, for open spaces.  I can only assume that every application submitted to his Department was vetted with the same thoroughness and that every application for funding to his Department that impinged on an open space was subject to the same questioning. Did the Minister consider visiting any of those sites to see the open spaces that might be trespassed upon?  I was going to pose a question to him about whether he had visited the proposed site at Shaw Park, but he answered that question in his contribution.  He said he did not need to because he was there in 1971 and he has a good memory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State had read the file he would have seen the letters on it.  A letter on file dated 22 May 1996 from the county engineer about Shaw Park and that precious open space states:</P>
      <P>Shaw Park has not operated successfully as a town park for some time, with the removal of play equipment, on the advice of our insurers, and the closure of the swimming pool.  Nonmaintenance of these areas subsequently has resulted in the degradation of the amenities of the park, and it no longer functions as a town park and amenity area as originally laid out in design.</P>
      <P>The swimming pool area has become a potential hazard, as manhole covers have been removed, the dressing room and service buildings have been vandalised, and the pool itself has become a hazard area and an area which attracts anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>The development of a new town park at Hanover will provide an alternative larger and more central town park, which will be more accessible for residents and visitors alike and together with the park at Graiguecullen should cater for the needs of the town for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>The letter goes on to recommend the use of this part for a new development, including social housing.</P>
      <P>If the Minister read the file, he would also have seen the remarks of the county manager in a letter of 28 October 1997 to an official in the housing construction section of the Minister's Department, which states:</P>
      <P>Apart from open spaces which are shown coloured green on the enclosed ordnance map of Carlow Town, there are three parks in public ownership.  These are, Hanover Park, Graiguecullen Park and Shaw Park, . Shaw Park contains 5.27 acres, Graiguecullen Park 12.5 acres and Hanover Park 13.15 acres.</P>
      <P>The letter demonstrates that there are adequate open spaces, amenities and parks and strongly recommends the building of the social housing mix which was advocated.</P>
      <P>Although Deputy Browne referred to this earlier, I re-emphasise one important component of the county manager's letter to the Minister's Department.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>Given the circumstances which now exist, there would be considerable legal difficulties and other serious considerations, including financial costs, if the Carlow U.D.C were to attempt to withdraw from the contractual obligations already entered into with the Co-Op given the stage to which matters have already advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Families had taken out mortgages and prepared to build homes.  The sites had been drawn.  The families knew where they and their neighbours <Col N="295" /> were going to live.  They were on the verge of getting on with an important development in their lives before it was interfered with by the actions of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Besides the Minister of State's long apology and support for open spaces, he was in high dudgeon at the notion that anybody would suggest that he would do anything untoward.  It is acknowledged that Senator Gibbons was an objector to these plans.  It is reasonable that suspicion would be aroused that this, unique among the developments which came before the Minister, would be subject to the type of scrutiny and rejection which is evidenced in this case.  That suspicion is clearly justified in my view.</P>
    <P>A more fulsome, credible explanation is warranted from the Minister of State and from the Tánaiste on this matter and the views which the Progressive Democrats have expressed on the issues of openness and accountability must be taken with a grain of salt from now on.</P>
    <P>The long and the short of it is that last Friday a motion was submitted by the Fine Gael Party and the Minister of State was caught out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste said &ldquo;back down&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Belatedly, the Minister reversed his position and made the right decision because even he could not come into this House and defend his original decision.</P>
      <P>I wondered how he would respond.  If he had come in here and made a clean breast of it and said &ldquo;At the request of a colleague, I reviewed the file.  I delayed the development.  I was wrong. I have reversed my view and I put things right last Friday&rdquo;, it would have been accepted on this side of the House.  What did we get in the Minister's long rambling speech?  Brass neck.  He came in and told us that he has a love affair with open spaces which motivated him to pick out this particular file and decide he wanted to visit this proposal again.  It had nothing to do with the fact that one of the original objectors was the Chairman of the Progressive Democrats Parliamentary Party and a colleague.  That strains credibility.</P>
      <P>We have a responsibility to restore public confidence in administration.  It has been dented enough by the actions of one or two individuals over the past few years.  The vast bulk of people elected to this House who serve on local authorities do not always make the right decisions but they do their best.  They are not the recipients of envelopes of money and they are not subject to croonyism.  Controversies such as this do nothing to restore confidence in public administration; rather they serve to further erode public confidence and foster cynicism about public office. The response we received from the Minister of State only adds to that sense of despair and cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reflect on this debate and, before a vote is called tomorrow night, to come <Col N="296" /> into the House and say &ldquo;I had a chat with a colleague who said he had a concern about the matter. I made some inquiries, I delayed the development and I was caught out.  It was a mistake.  It should not have happened.  It will not happen again&rdquo;.  We could accept that, but we will not accept being treated like imbeciles and the public will not accept it.  What the Minister of State said is simply unacceptable and incredible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes said that this issue could be logically linked to the Progressive Democrats inspired rich man's budget.  The more logical link is with the files in the skip affair.  The common thread is the exposure of blatant hypocrisy.  Those who lectured others on political donations or righteousness in administrative decisions have been caught out twice in a week.  It is time all of us who are committed to the advancement of public administration ceased that hypocrisy, recognised the flaws and mistakes of the past, and tried to be honest and clear with this House and the electorate.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Browne for consistently and regularly bringing this matter to attention until he forced the Minister to reverse his decision.  He should get the full credit for that. Deputy Browne has done a good job for his area and for democracy.</P>
      <P>This is a naked case of NIMBY &mdash; not in my back yard.  There is a proposal from a local co-operative housing association for ten houses and from the local authority for ten houses.  A suitable site is identified by the local authority and the design, site, etc., is approved by the Department. The proposal is proceeding but objections have been made by a local member of the Progressive Democrats and others living adjacent to the site. The objectors do not want council tenants or members of housing co-operatives living near them.  They do not want council or co-operative housing built near their better class homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State uttered a great amount of waffle about desegregated and integrated housing.  However, he took this action, deliberately and knowingly, to support people who did not want council houses built near their homes.</P>

On the last occasion on which the Minister of State held responsibility for housing he left a trail of destruction behind him.</P>

      <P>Let me reiterate that, because his colleague, who is the chairperson of the Progressive Democrats and a Member of the Seanad, asked him to block this housing development, the Minister of State pulled the relevant file.  As a former Minister of State, I know that there was no reason for that file to be sent to the Minister of State.  The housing costs for the co-operative were under the set limits and the only reason the file would be sent to the Minister of State would be if an application was made to exceed those limits.  Therefore, he deliberately pulled the file. The Minister of State asked for the file because, having failed at local level, Senator Gibbons asked him to block the housing development.  The Minister of State decided to co-operate.</P>
      <P>Thankfully, Deputy Browne was alert to that situation and pursued it relentlessly to the point where the Minister of State reversed his decision on Friday last.  I believe the Tánaiste, with her good arm, twisted the Minister of State's arm and made him change his decision.  The Minister of State's contribution contained no reason for that change.  All of the reasons for blocking the development are in his speech.  The person who drafted it must not have been informed that the Minister of State had changed his mind because the speech is intended to justify the blocking of these two small housing schemes.</P>
      <P>As a former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I was very nervous when the Government was formed and Deputy Molloy was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government with responsibility in that area.  I had a simple and good reason for my concerns.  On the last occasion he held responsibility for housing, the Minister of State decided that people living in council houses did not require decent standards and their homes should be made from material called &ldquo;marine ply &ldquo; which resembles pressed cardboard.  This material did not require foundations, back or front, and there were no parting walls between the attics of adjoining houses, some of which had flat roofs.  During the Minister of State's previous reign of terror, 10,000 families were placed in a situation where they suffered greatly because of his decision.</P>

      <P>During my period as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I had the ongoing job of redressing the damage done by Deputy Molloy.  Is he aware that, to date, £18 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on rectifying the damage done to just over half of the so-called houses in question?  Approximately 4,200 of these houses remain in the same condition as when they were built and people are living in dire circumstances as a result.  These houses had no rear entrances or sheds, they had small gardens, small rooms and their front and back gardens were ringed with wire fencing.  That is the type of low standard the Minister of State decided at that time was good enough for working class people.  Taxpayers' money has been spent since then in an attempt to rectify the problem.  Now, the Minister of State has once again been given responsibility for housing.</P>

      <P>I tabled a question to the Minister of State shortly after he assumed office asking if it was his intention to revert to these low standards.  I was glad he replied that the standards I introduced as Minister of State to ensure that each house was built with proper, sustainable materials, weatherproof windows and doors and central heating would be maintained.  I warn him that we will keep a sharp eye on him because if those standards are interfered with he will be back before the House to answer further motions of censure.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's actions were despicable. He was dealing with poor people who were hoping and planning to obtain houses, who had attended meetings and collected money as a form of deposit within the co-operative system.  The Minister of State pulled the rug from under those people and did not give a tinker's curse about the effect this would have on them.  He did not care, once the NIMBY ambitions of the chairman of his parliamentary party were satisfied.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="300" />Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  affirms, in accordance with the principles of international human rights law, the right of everyone to live free of violence, discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, colour, national or ethnic origin or membership of the traveller community;</P>
    <P>2.  condemns sentiments and manifestations of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism as inimical to respect for the dignity of all human beings and particularly deplores hostile statements or acts directed against those from other countries seeking refuge in the State;</P>
    <P>3.  supports all appropriate efforts to promote harmonious relations between different groups characterised by reference to race and related factors;</P>
    <P>4.  notes</P>
    <P>(i) that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, building on the work of his predecessors, has initiated the Employment Equality Bill which would, <i>inter alia</i>, make provision for the promotion of equality and the prohibition of discrimination and harassment in employment and related areas on the basis of factors including race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin or membership of the traveller community, and</P>
    <P>(ii) the Government's stated commitment to bring forward an Equal Status Bill which would have a similar effect in relation to non-employment areas;</P>
    <P>5.  requests the Government, following enactment of the legislation referred to in paragraph 4, to take steps for the ratification of the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 21st day of December, 1965;</P>
    <P>6.  notes the measures taken in Ireland resulting from the Resolution of the European Union Council of Ministers designating 1997 as European Year against Racism;</P>
    <P>7.  commends the efforts of voluntary groups who have taken initiatives to combat racism and xenophobia;</P>
    <P>8.  urges the earliest possible implementation of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support this important motion in the names of Members of all parties, including myself.  I hope it will be regarded as something more than a ritual repetition of nice-sounding words.  Racism in Ireland deserves closer attention than we have given it up to now because it is more serious than we realise. <Col N="301" /> One weakness of this country is its homogeneity, the fact that so many of us are similar in background and historical and ethnic approach.  The lack of diversity has weakened our society and given rise to some easily identifiable problems.</P>
      <P>It is opportune that today sees the publication of <i>A Part of Ireland Now: Ten Refugee Stories</i>, which features interviews conducted by Mr. Andy Pollak.  It appears to be an official publication because it has a foreword by the Taoiseach.  The booklet gives details of ten refugees, some of whom have lived here for a long time and others who have arrived more recently.  Unlike most official publications it is not exclusively laudatory. The earlier arrivees appear to have got on well in Ireland but some of the more recent arrivees have not.  If I may I will quote briefly from the experiences in Ireland of two of these refugees.</P>
      <P>One story concerns Mr. Luyindula and his wife, Mrs. Bikembo, who are described as the first Zairean political refugees to arrive in Ireland.  The booklet states:</P>
      <P>their experience of Ireland has not been a happy one.  Two years ago he was beaten up by a group of youths in broad daylight in a street in Temple Bar, with passers-by failing to intervene to help him.</P>
      <P>They received an anonymous racist hate letter sent to &lsquo;The African&rsquo; at their new flat.  Both Catholics, they attend the local church every Sunday.  Recently a man started insulting Mrs. Bikembo in the middle of Mass, and she had to be rescued by concerned parishioners.  They have lost count of the times people in the street have told them to go back to Africa.</P>
      <P>These people are recent refugees, unlike many of the others in the book who have been here for a long time.  The husband is quoted as saying:</P>
      <P>Since the attack I have started to see Irish people in a new light.  Many of them think it's all right to have one or two black people living in Ireland.  However, more than that irritates them.  Older people are usually nice, but younger people are often nasty, and become particularly aggressive when they are drunk.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Bikembo says:</P>
      <P>I don't feel comfortable here . Although we are free, we feel like prisoners.  I am afraid to walk in the street by myself now and my husband doesn't go out at night.  The kind of racism we have experienced here does not exist in Zaire.  There all foreigners, European and African, are made to feel welcome and are offered hospitality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another refugee featured in the booklet is Mr. Abdullah Hersi, a 40 year old Somali living in Dublin with his wife and six children.  He has been here for six and a half years and has received a masters degree in financial services from UCD.  The booklet states: <Col N="302" /> He has sent out about 200 CVs to banks, financial services and insurance companies.  Only two even bothered to reply.  An Irish friend got him two months work as a security guard, the only job he has had in six and a half years in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This makes sorry reading.  I invite Members to look through this booklet, which they will have received today.  Of these ten refugees, eight seem to have done well, to varying degrees, but the two who have done badly are the only two who are black.  The others gained acceptance, the two who are black did not.  The others came from diverse countries and backgrounds but what they have in common is that they are white.  This says a lot about attitudes to race in Ireland.  I congratulate the Refugee Agency for producing this worthwhile publication, from which people can learn a great deal.  I hope we do, because the booklet is not the typical Bord Fáilte gush about Ireland and the Irish.  It is closer to reality, and the reality is sometimes painful.</P>
    <P>In terms of welcoming people from other countries and admitting refugees, no country in the world has a greater obligation than this one.  Over two and a half centuries we sent our people to an enormous number of countries, particularly the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand. They were rarely turned away and were able to make a considerable contribution to those countries as a result of their admission either as refugees or as economic emigrants which, technically, is what most emigrants are nowadays.</P>
    <P>The earliest of our emigrants of this kind were Protestant dissenters leaving Ulster because of religious persecution and going to North America, principally to what is now the United States. They were accepted and thrived there.  There has been a succession of others since, particularly the Southern Catholic Gaelic emigration in the 19th century.  Compare the facility with which so many people who were born on this island were admitted elsewhere with how selective we are today.</P>
    <P>The Irish Refugee Council today sent me statistics which I do not need to read out because the Minister is probably aware of them.  We think we are overwhelmed with refugees and asylum seekers. Even with the big increase in numbers in the past few years, the numbers are minute, and we have not been able to evolve a system that can deal with them.</P>
    <P>We always welcomed rich foreigners to this country, but for a long time there seems to have been an unspoken assumption that we did not welcome poor foreigners.  In the early 1980s I received anecdotal evidence of happenings at Shannon Airport that disturbed me greatly.  I was told of Cuban refugees trying to escape when a Cuban or Russian plane was refuelling at Shannon on a flight between Moscow and Havana, of which there were a great many every day at that time.  They tried to hide in toilets at Shannon Airport, climb out through toilet windows, hide in cupboards and behind panels in rooms, and were hauled out of their hiding places and dragged <Col N="303" /> kicking and screaming back onto the plane.  When I inquired about this at the Department of Justice I was told that they were trying to come in here in breach of the law and therefore it was right to put them out.  I was told they were not being deported, that they were being refused entry, and there was a great distinction between the two. Some of those people unquestionably went to their deaths after they were put back on the plane at Shannon.  That is something of which this country should be ashamed.  It is something that we should remember now when we look at the increased but still tiny number of people who want to come to this country and who are not welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to agree to an all-party motion on racism and to allocate Government time to allow a debate on it.  I also thank the Government and the other parties for agreeing to a number of amendments Democratic Left proposed.  This has considerably strengthened the motion.</P>
      <P>However, I am deeply disappointed with the speech made by the Minister on this issue.  It has no sense of purpose other than a mechanistic one which seeks to impose law virtually to the exclusion of everything else.  It seeks to identify what it claims to be illegal immigrants versus refugees.  There is no such thing as an illegal immigrant until the procedures of this State establish that fact.  To create in the mind of the public the idea that there are two separate kinds of people walking our streets, legal and illegal, is wrong and leads to the attitudes expressed by Deputy Callely.  The Minister said that one of the factors which could contribute towards the emergence of racist attitudes here was the confusion which currently exists on the subject of illegal immigration, in particular confusion concerning the distinction between an illegal immigrant and a refugee.  I am not aware of any illegal immigrants in this State.  An illegal immigrant is a person who has been defined by the Department of Justice as somebody who is not entitled to be here but finds some way of remaining here. There is no such thing otherwise.  I have yet to hear any figure put on any such category of person. It is wrong and damaging to the cohesion of Irish society to make this distinction which is grossly improper, particularly coming from a Minister of this State.</P>
      <P>This debate takes place against the background of an unexpected increase in the number of people from abroad seeking refuge in the country and a significant, and worrying, increase in racial tension in parts of Dublin.  It is important therefore that the Dáil should speak with one voice in asserting the right of everyone to live free from the threat of racial discrimination, deploring manifestations of racism and xenophobia, and committing the State to deal in a fair and humane way with those seeking refuge in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years Irish society has tended to collectively <Col N="304" /> pat itself on the back and reassure itself that there was little if any racism in Ireland and that the ugly manifestations of racism which we have seen in other countries could not occur here. It was relatively easy to assert our freedom from the evils of racism because, up to recently, we had not been confronted by any significant degree of immigration.</P>
    <P>A more dispassionate look at our record shows that we are probably no better and no worse than most other European states when it came to racism.  The Louis Lentin documentary shown on RTÉ last week shone a light on a dark passage in our history and showed that there were very few of the traditional hundred thousand welcomes for Jews seeking refuge from the Nazi holocaust.  In addition, the evidence suggests that when Irish people go abroad, especially to countries with significant racial minorities, we are not free from the taint of racism.</P>
    <P>The nearest thing we have had to a racial minority within this State is the traveller community, and again we can draw no comfort from our treatment of travellers who, despite significant efforts in terms of housing and facilities and their inclusion as a specific category in the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial Hatred Act, 1989, are still on the margins of society and subject to prejudice, hostility and abuse.  We have had our own local variation on xenophobia &mdash; religious sectarianism which has wrought bitterness, division, death and destruction on the people of this island. We still see it manifested in its most ugly form in Northern Ireland through, for example, the sectarian murder of Gerry Devlin in North Belfast ten days ago and clashes over marches and demonstrations. However, it also continues to exist in this State, albeit in a more subtle form.</P>
    <P>One person who has probably done more than anyone else to try to measure the level of racist attitudes among people has been Fr. Micheál MacGreil.  He published a major study in 1977 entitled &ldquo;Prejudice and Tolerance in Ireland&rdquo; which confirmed there was no room for complacency and found that racial intolerance was not very far beneath the surface.  The survey was updated in 1996 and we can perhaps draw some encouragement from the significant and substantial reduction in racist attitudes since the early 1970s.</P>
    <P>We are becoming a multi-cultural and to some extent a multi-racial society.  This trend is likely to continue.  I hope it continues as it can only do good in terms of the general well-being of society. The time when one could assume that a black person walking along a street in Dublin was foreign is long gone.  People like Paul McGrath and Phil Lynott whose achievements in different fields inspired so many people are as Irish as am I, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, Deputy John Bruton or even Gerry Adams.</P>
    <P>We have all had to face up to the spectre of racism because of the increase in the number of refugees from an annual average of approximately 60 a few years ago to more than 2,000 per <Col N="305" /> year.  Unlike most European countries which had problems of immigration arising from their colonial histories, Ireland never had to face anything other than a trickle of refugees.  There has been a very significant increase in the numbers seeking refugee status in recent years, but despite what some people have tried to suggest the trickle has not turned into a flood of immigrants.  The numbers coming to Ireland have been relatively small compared to the scale of the problem faced by many other countries, for example, Germany which, according to the newsletter published by the national co-ordination committee for the European Year Against Racism, had 129,000 applications for refugee status last year.  To say the paltry few hundred people who seek refugee status here is a major threat to society is nonsensical. The evidence in recent weeks suggests the numbers are declining.</P>
    <P>While the absence of facilities to deal with applications for refugee status on this scale has created problems, it should not put an undue strain on our financial or social resources to deal in a fair and humane way with those seeking refuge here.  The vast majority of citizens and Members of this House agree with this principle. Unfortunately a tiny minority of people have used the refugee problem to give vent to racist attitudes and they have been aided and abetted in this by a small number of public representatives seeking electoral advantage.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on Members of this House and public representatives in general to ensure that nothing they say or do could in any way encourage racism or hostility to refugees.  I have already deplored in the House and elsewhere the inflammatory and intolerant comments made recently by Deputy Ivor Callely.  However, there was an even worse example during the general election when a Fianna Fáil candidate in Dublin South-West, Colm McGrath, circulated a leaflet which must have come close to breaching the terms of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act.  Under the masthead &ldquo;McGrath demands action on illegal immigrants&rdquo; Councillor McGrath demanded an urgent review of the allocation of houses to illegal immigrants &mdash; one must bear in mind my earlier comments about what is illegal and what is not &mdash; and claimed that many refugees were here to milk our social welfare system, before going on to peddle urban myths about a slaughtered lamb being hung on a clothes line to drip dry after having its throat cut and up to 30 refugees sleeping in one house.  Not only was Councillor McGrath not prosecuted but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not just the crude attitudes expressed by Deputy Callely or Councillor McGrath that can fuel hostile attitudes towards refugees.  How the institutions of the State deal with them can also be a major influence on public opinion.  If the State is seen to treat those seeking refuge in a fair, humane, sympathetic and understanding way then there is every chance the community in general will take its lead from this example.</P>

      <P>However, if the State is seen to be uncaring, unsympathetic, bureaucratic and inflexible then this will also encourage a more hostile approach by the community in general.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Minister for Justice to effectively scrap the Refugee Act is particularly deplorable and sends out all the wrong messages. The legislative anti-racism package stands on four pillars: the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, the Employment and Equal Status Acts and the Refugee Act.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act has been a paper tiger, with not even a single prosecution arising, the Employment and Equal Status Acts have been delayed interminably and the Refugee Act has been effectively torn up by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> It is difficult to believe the Minister is the same person who in Opposition was a fearless champion of the rights of refugees, who lavished praise on Amnesty International and who in October 1995 &mdash; this is an important point in view of the guidelines introduced by the Minister during the past week &mdash; said: &ldquo;The status of refugees is an issue which should strike a chord with every man, woman and child here who has any grasp of Irish history, our history books being littered with the names and deeds of those driven from our country out of fear of persecution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is no secret the Department of Justice establishment was, to put it mildly, lukewarm about the Refugee Act and that Ministers in the last Government had to fight a major battle to have it enacted.  A few weeks ago the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, boasted that he was very much in charge of his Department.  The evidence in regard to the Refugee Act, and, in particular, the Minister's speech point very much to the contrary and suggest the Minister is a prisoner of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act provided certain basic legal protections and guarantees of fair procedures for applicants for asylum.  Yet it now seems we are to revert to a series of secret hearings by faceless officials, when the freedom and, in some cases, the lives and safety of refugees is at stake.  The reality of the new so-called fast-track procedures introduced by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is that life and death decisions will be made by bureaucrats behind closed doors.</P>

      <P>Contrary to what the Minister sought to imply, this is not an attack on the integrity of the officials: it is a criticism of the secret, private procedures the Minister has put in place.</P>
      <P>The concept of a fair, independent and transparent procedure which was at the heart of the Refugee Act has been discarded in favour of yellow-pack justice.  Rather than having their claims submitted to an independent body, the fate of asylum seekers will now be decided by &ldquo;a person appointed by the Minister&rdquo; according to guidelines which may be issued from time to time by the Department.  According to the Department's letter of 10 December, current as well as future applications will be dealt with under this abbreviated procedure &mdash; a clear case of retroactive justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion, at the request of Democratic Left, includes a clause urging &ldquo;the earliest possible implementation of the Refugee Act, 1996&rdquo;.  When this motion is passed it will reflect the solemn view of the House that the Act should be implemented at the earliest possible time.  The Government cannot ignore the views of the House expressed in this way. It cannot, on the one hand, agree that the earliest possible implementation of the Act is desirable <Col N="308" /> while, at the same time, introducing procedures which negate the whole ethos and approach of the Refugee Act.  This will be a real test of the Government's bona fides and will determine how seriously it takes the fine sentiments expressed in this motion.</P>
    <P>This matter will not be dealt with effectively by law alone.  There are other areas we must look at.  We must look again at the school curriculum to see what changes need to be made to prepare our children for the increasingly multicultural and multiracial nature of our society.  We must look again at the provision of adequate finance for the many voluntary organisations which help to combat racism through sporting, cultural or other activities.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he is agreeable to providing money to voluntary organisations dealing with this issue.  I ask him to look again at the application from the Soccer Against Racism in Ireland group which has applied to his Department, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach for a small amount of money to run a major event next year on this issue.  They have big names for this event but have failed to get money from any Department for it.</P>

In 1994, when I was Lord Mayor of this great city, one of my ambitions was to give the freedom of the city to the Dalai Lama, who I thought was very deserving of that great honour.  He is an international figure who has received the Nobel Peace Prize among many awards.  Above all, he symbolises the ongoing plight of asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
      <P>In order to confer the freedom of the city one traditionally needs consensus on the city council. I was glad to get the support of all parties, except for Fianna Fáil.  One of the people most implacably opposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The second point of the motion states that the House &ldquo;condemns sentiments and manifestations of racism&rdquo;.  There is no point in having a resolution <Col N="309" /> on paper or a Refugee Act if we do not act, which is what I am asking the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to do by condemning racist remarks and giving the House a commitment that the Act will be fully implemented.  Deputy Callely has said his remarks were not racist but I do not see how they could have been interpreted otherwise.  At best, they were small minded and a cheap shot.</P>

Any of us who operate advice centres in this city are well aware of the prejudice which exists. People say to us all the time that refugees are taking our houses and availing of social welfare. However, a responsible Deputy should counter those arguments and outline the real situation.</P>
      <P>I believe this Government has decided to pander to these prejudices.  We are tired of raising the question of the Refugee Act on the Order of Business.  It is now clear, from the letter from the assistant secretary in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the UNHCR, that they have decided to cherrypick sections of the Refugee Act, to accept the sections they like and abandon the rest, probably in a skip along with the rest of the PD files.</P>

      <P>I have a number of questions for the Minister which I hope he will be able to answer.  Are these new fast track procedures agreed with the UNHCR?  For how long will these procedures operate?  Is this an administrative attempt to undermine the legislation?  Why did this House pass an Act if we were going to simply abandon it?  That Act has been cited as one of the most progressive models of refugee legislation in Europe but the Government has dumped it.</P>
      <P>The emphasis, under these new procedures, is on the Dublin Convention.  It is regrettable that such discriminatory legislation is named after our great city from whence many Irishmen and Irishwomen went abroad.  I asked the Taoiseach about the Dublin Convention last week but he was unable to answer my questions. It is clearly in contravention of much international refugee law where a refugee is not required to seek asylum in the country to which they first come.  If the Dublin Convention had been in place, how many of the 1,500 people who have been processed would have been refused as a result?  How many people will be refused on that basis in future?</P>
      <P>The new fast track procedures state that &ldquo;where necessary and possible&rdquo; an interpreter shall be provided.  It further states that in considering whether an applicant is to be deported &ldquo; the applicant will be informed of the procedure to be followed and of these rights, where possible in a language which he or she understands&rdquo;.  That is wonderful.  It is very broad minded and civil of the Minister to inform someone who is going to be deported to a country where they will be possibly persecuted and killed of that fact in a language which they understand.</P>
      <P>It seems key decisions will be placed in the hands of individuals appointed by the Minister. For example, the appeals authority is supposed to be independent of the Minister and his Department but will be appointed by the Minister.  That is not independence.  The Minister must address this issue.  Amnesty, which the Minister supported, has asked for this time after time but apparently that request has also been put in the skip.</P>
      <P>It is good that more money is being given to legal aid.  However, until now we have been giving £120 to solicitors and barristers for appeals. We must act.  It is not enough to produce documents, resolutions and Acts which are not acted upon.  I call on the Minister to act on the clear will of this House.</P>

      <P>I find it astounding the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in addressing the Dáil, allegedly in support of a motion against racism, began his speech with a tirade against so-called illegal immigrants. The Minister referred to refugees and, in the same breath, to criminal elements, illegal trafficking and so on.  That is a shameful approach by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who represents a Kerry constituency.  It is only ten years since Kerry politicians criss-crossed the Atlantic virtually on a monthly basis &mdash; perhaps the Minister was among them &mdash; begging the United States administration to give legal status to tens of thousands of Irish youth, including many from Kerry, who were forced out of the country by the failure of the same system and political structures that have allowed the entry of a few thousand refugees to be considered as a crisis.</P>
      <P>I contrast the Minister's attitude with the recent actions of his party in handing out passports to millionaires in the infamous passports for sale scheme simply because they could purchase them.  The Minister's attitude is no better than that of sections of the media which carry responsibility for irresponsible and hate-inducing headlines and articles designed to create false impressions and hysteria.  Most revolting was the mass circulation of a paper last June with the banner headline &ldquo;Refugee Rapist on the Rampage&rdquo;. The article stated that the Garda warned women to stay away from refugees after a spree of sex assaults.  It alleged that Garda sources stated that prostitutes and minors were the main targets of rapacious Romanians and Somalians.  The Garda later denied that there was any foundation to that scandalous report.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> It is pathetic that two Governments in a row have presided over a position where a few thousand refugees are blamed for causing a crisis.  Failure of the system to guarantee basics such as housing, decent health care and so on allows that perception.  There are 30,000 people on the housing waiting list, but refugees are not the cause of that crisis because they are not entitled to local authority housing. Refugees are sometimes blamed because people are poor, but refugees are not responsible for poverty.  That results from the failure of the political establishment.  The Government has given more in the budget per annum to big corporations <Col N="312" /> and the super rich than it would cost to maintain the refugees who are here at present &mdash; it would cost far less if they were allowed to work, which they should be, as the youth from Kerry and other counties were allowed to work when they went to the United States and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>What hope of justice have a few thousand applicants when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State said on public record that 90 per cent of applicants are illegal immigrants?  That is a disgraceful prejudging of the position.  According to the Minister, those so-called illegal immigrants should be deported.  The new process will not provide justice. It will be a sham because there is no independent procedure or right of appeal.  That process will be carried out by the Department that believes that 90 per cent of applicants are illegal immigrants.  I ask the Minister even at this late hour to put in place just procedures.  There should be legal representation for all applicants and an independent procedure so that we will appear to be just in dealing with those people.</P>

      <P>We are witnessing an increase in racism and bigotry which is repugnant to the best democratic traditions of the people. We have suffered racist abuse in our country from colonial occupiers.  We have been subjected to racial discrimination in other lands.  It is not long ago that signs stating &ldquo;No Irish, No blacks&rdquo; were displayed on boarding house windows in England.  That experience does not make Irish people immune from the virus of racism.  That virus does not grow of its own accord.  It has taken hold because unscrupulous people in politics and other spheres have nurtured it for their own cynical, short-term interests.</P>
      <P>Disgracefully, there are politicians in this State who are guilty of condoning racism.  That is not only manifest in public statements, it is present when politicians pander to the bigotry which places the blame for unemployment and lack of housing on immigrants and refugees or which scapegoats travellers and denies them their rights as Irish citizens.  Responsibility for unemployment and poor housing lies with successive Governments which have failed to provide adequately for all our people.  Let us make it clear we will not tolerate racism, that the Government will treat the poor of other ethnic origin who seek shelter here as warmly as it has treated those who availed of the passports for sale scheme.  We live in a multicultural country that enriches us all.  It is no threat to our native culture and heritage.  On the contrary, it strengthens it, just as Irish people who moved to other countries have enriched and strengthened those cultures by their presence and contribution.</P>

    <P>This motion will have little meaning if it is not immediately followed by measures to alleviate the plight of those at the receiving end of racism. It is urgent the Refugee Act is implemented in full.  It is inexcusable that has not been done. Amnesty International stated that the Department <Col N="313" /> of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to have selected from an Act passed by the Oireachtas, the Refugee Act, those parts which suit departmental procedures and abandoned the rest.  While this motion is welcome, until the Refugee Act is implemented in full the Government's commitment to anti-racism remains open to challenge.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;2.  &mdash; Section 13 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, is hereby amended by the deletion of the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; wherever it occurs and the substitution therefor of the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, and references elsewhere in that Act to the chairman of the Board shall be construed as references to the chairperson of the Board.  &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to amend the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, to replace the sexist word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, the term we have become used to in the past decade or so.  The Irish terminology &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo;, used at local government level, avoids the sexist bias of the words in the vernacular.

      <P>This amendment was tabled on Committee Stage and was not accepted. I understand the general philosophy behind the amendment tabled by Deputies Higgins and Broughan and supported by Deputy Kenny.  We do not want our legislation to be sexist.  The Government is committed to the principle of enshrining gender neutral language in all new principal legislation.  I am happy to give a commitment tonight that all new principal legislation introduced by me will be gender neutral.  The Deputies will also be aware from Committee Stage that the Government decision of 27 October l993 stated that all future legislation will, <Col N="314" /> as far as possible, be gender neutral.  That covers legislation from l993 onwards.  Section 11(b) of the Interpretation Act, l937 provides that &ldquo;every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it has also imported the feminine&rdquo;.  I am well aware that section 13 of the Irish Film Board Act, l980, which deals with the appointment of the chairman of the board, uses the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. The Interpretation Act, l937, makes it clear that the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; could mean male or female.  I am sure Deputies realise it would be difficult to change all legislation up to l993.  A large body of legislation was enacted by the Oireachtas prior to the Government decision of l993 and the burden of updating it would deflect from existing resources dealing with substantive legislation on an ongoing basis.  I hope Deputies accept that practical difficulty.  The spirit of their amendment is covered in the Interpretation Act, l937 and a commitment has been given regarding new legislation.  We will also honour the l993 commitment.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that, in effect, we would have to amend all legislation up to l993.  It is extraordinary that in l980, not too long ago, Mr. Haughey did not regard a sexist approach to legislation as unacceptable.

      <P>This debate began when chairpersons of committees were principally of the male gender and women rightly got involved in organisations and politics and took up chairmanships. People began to object vociferously to the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; being applied to a woman who chaired a meeting or an organisation.  It is a pity section 11(b) of the l937 Act was not bandied around more often at that time because I am not sure if the people who started this argument accepted that the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; in that Act was gender neutral.  People do not believe the Interpretation Act, 1937 equates man with woman in a chairing capacity.  The spirit of this amendment arises because when women rightly began to take up office and chair important meetings in business, social services, politics and so on they did not want to be referred to as &ldquo;Mr. Chairman&rdquo; or &ldquo;Madam Chairman&rdquo;.  I am not sure the people making those arguments accept that the l937 Act interprets man as woman in a gender neutral sense.</P>

      <P>Having spent seventeen and a half years in what I am sure Members will accept is still a male dominated profession, I understand the sentiments expressed by the Deputies. However, there was an enlightened approach to making legislation more gender neutral as far back as l937.  The 1937 Act states the position clearly.  I accept what Deputy Broughan said regarding the Irish Film Board Act, l980 being far <Col N="315" /> reaching.  I would be concerned that that, or any other Act, might be misconstrued when referring to terms such as &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; if the Interpretation Act did not exist.  That Act protects the principle that should be enshrined in legislation and I support the commitment regarding all new legislation.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  &rdquo; Is mór an onóir dom an mBille seo a chur faoi bráid an Dhála.  We live in the age of technology. Advances in science and technology since the 1960s and particularly over the past ten years have taken place with bewildering speed.  Technology has impacted on all our lives.  We see the benefits of technological change in the home, the workplace and in every aspect of life.</P>
      <P>The rapidity of that change poses significant challenges to our society.  In an era when information and skills are of paramount importance to individuals' life chances, we must guard against the risk of creating a two tier society.  It is essential that we ensure that no sector of our society is left behind.  The opportunity to learn and benefit from new technology must be available to all, irrespective of factors such as age, socio-economic status or educational background.  By ensuring that no inequality results, we not only achieve a more equitable and just society, we also contribute to economic progress, adding to the stock of human capital and increasing the availability of skilled labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sheer speed of technological change also poses great challenges to our economy.  In the open markets, most Irish firms are compelled to <Col N="316" /> develop and enhance continuously new and existing products to maintain competitiveness. Increasingly, firms are recognising the importance of investing in staff training and research and development to secure their continued economic viability.  At the same time, industry requires a steady supply of well educated workers who will possess not only the latest skills, but who will have the capacity to learn and acquire new skills and to adapt to an ever changing environment.</P>
    <P>Education's role is central to meeting these challenges.  In terms of inclusiveness, it is necessary to extend educational provision to all groups in our society, while simultaneously developing new approaches to education.  A number of initiatives have already been announced in this area and work will continue on the development of further initiatives in areas such as second chance education and the elimination of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The education system plays a central role in economic development.  The performance of the economy in recent years has been outstanding and the phenomenal rate of economic growth and job creation, allied to low inflation and interest rates, has made us the envy of Europe.  Increasingly, it is recognised that recent successes are due principally to the availability of a highly skilled and adaptable labour force.  However, continued economic success will be contingent on ensuring that our education system retains the capacity to keep pace with and adapt to the changing needs of industry.</P>
    <P>The Tierney report on science, technology and innovation lent its weight to the many voices highlighting the need for greater investment in university equipment, for more money to be spent on research, for producing more graduates in science, technology and engineering and for creating a better awareness of our national system of innovation and the key players in it.  The Government accepted the thrust of these arguments in the White Paper and is delivering on them.  The new investment fund is a powerful example of this.</P>
    <P>The information society report is another of the drivers in this process.  Earlier this year, the Government appointed an Information Society Commission to oversee developments relating to the implementation of the report.  To highlight its critical importance, responsibility for the initiative has been transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach and a national director has been appointed.  Action is happening on a broad front in relation to the thematic areas identified in the report.  Specifically in relation to learning, the provision in the new fund for computers in schools is a major boost to the various learning initiatives already under way.</P>
    <P>Just as on the learning front, we must address curricula, teacher training and technology deployment. Enterprise must also adapt and use the new technologies and participate fully in key growth markets of the information society.  Strategically <Col N="317" /> this means the adoption and use of information communication technologies by enterprise, getting a leadership position in certain sectors of the industry, developing a strong, indigenous software industry and maximising the job creation potential of the information society.  The bottom line is that we cannot move fast enough in bringing all facets of our society up to speed where they can participate fully in, and enjoy the benefits of, the information society.</P>
    <P>We are experiencing a rapid and dramatic transformation in the shape of our society and of its underlying economic base.  The nature of production, trade, employment and work in the coming years will be profoundly different from those that exist today.  Similarly, the determinants of economic success will be different from those that prevailed in the past.  However, the basic economic objectives remain the same &mdash; the achievement of enhanced living standards and the opportunity to participate fully in the economic life of our country.  The effects on economic change are already spilling over into our daily lives, whether it is in relation to smart cards and ATM machines or telecommuting, where people can now work from the comfort of their homes.  As Mark Twain would have said: &ldquo;the fiction is fast being driven out of science fiction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This debate affords me the opportunity to address some of the issues relevant to the role of science, technology and innovation in the continuing development of Ireland's national economy. Whereas in the past there was criticism that the importance of science, technology and innovation to Ireland's future development was not fully appreciated at the highest levels of policy making, we can now say with confidence that the scales are clearly shifting.  This change is being driven by a number of factors from the awareness which the White Papers on science, technology and innovation and on education created, to the huge rise in the level of research and development being carried out by Irish companies over the past seven years, to our success in attracting inward investment in the electronics and software areas, with the skill demands which that unleashes, through to the fact that this Government is prepared to acknowledge all these trends and to act accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Government's response is a comprehensive one focusing on particular challenges or targeting other areas for broader treatment.  This is all in the context of a confident business environment, which is good for sustained economic progress and for the social partners, employers, workers and farmers.</P>
    <P>Specifically, we have seen the first ever science week, the launch of the £250 million science and technology capital investment fund, the relaunch of the Measure 1 in-company research and development scheme, the launch of a number of technology centres in Regional Technical Colleges, the launch of the Institute of Technology Management at the National University of Ireland in Dublin and the upcoming arrangements <Col N="318" /> for the reorganisation of the programmes in advanced technology.  Only two weeks ago we had an Israeli delegation here in Dublin for discussions on a bilateral research and development understanding to promote co-operative projects in market driven areas, which will lead to solid commercial results.  As the Israelis made clear, they are not interested in agreements for the sake of agreements, but for the results that will flow from their successful working.</P>
    <P>The science week may seem trivial in the context of the other science and technology developments of the past few months.  Yet, in its own way, it is contributing to getting the broad message across to the widest possible audience &mdash; school children, parents, teachers, the public, civil and public servants, researchers, industrialists and politicians.  It was heartening to see the overflow queues at the special fun day events, not to mention the other range of specialist events that filled the calendar for that week.  Next year we hope to go one better and all sides have a part to play in this.  I hope that universities and industrial representative associations will consciously schedule events to coincide with next year's science week.</P>
    <P>The major development of this past year was the Government's announcement of the £250 million science and technology capital investment fund.  There were a number of drivers in this process from the information society report, to the STIAC report and the development skills shortages in certain key inward investment areas.  The skills shortage in certain areas, which is a reflection of our success in attracting inward investment and promoting indigenous company development, is a major driver in focusing all our attentions.  This demonstrates the huge interdependence and interplay between science, technology and innovation, or between the creation of knowledge and the fruitful application and exploitation of knowledge.</P>
    <P>One of the first acts of this Government was to make a £5 million capital investment for the creation of additional places this autumn in software courses at degree and technician level. We recognised that a more substantive response was necessary and that a comprehensive and co-ordinated plan was required to meet the full range of emerging skill needs.  These needs are clear in certain areas and less clear in others.  We need better arrangements to anticipate and respond to emerging demands and skills shortages at technician, graduate and higher levels.</P>
    <P>As our economy continues to grow and strengthen and unemployment levels continue to fall, there will be a propensity for skills shortages to develop in any sector and all concerned must plan for this.  It is not just a high-tech phenomenon; shortages can manifest themselves anywhere. We see them in the leisure and tourism sector already.  There must be a partnership approach in addressing these.  The best foundation is a good solid basic education for all with a curriculum which is geared to the needs of a modern economy and which provides a basis for <Col N="319" /> all school leavers to diversify into areas for which they are best suited.  The Government must also help with the retraining of workers and with particular emphasis on the unemployed who want to improve their skills.  Life-long learning is not just for the out of work.</P>
    <P>The Government must also help with the retraining of workers, with particular emphasis on the unemployed who want to improve their skills. Life long learning is not just for the out of work, it must become a way of life for everyone.  The pace of technology advance requires that all of us, whether doctors, teachers, car mechanics, civil or public servants or politicians must continue to invest in personnel and personal development. Employers have a huge role to play in ensuring we have a world class technology literate workforce.</P>
    <P>As the pace of technology steps up, so will the pace of change.  Consequently, the orderly ways of supply and demand in the workplace will change and, therefore, we will have to be flexible and alert in anticipating and detecting change in demand for skills in the future whether for graduates or technicians.</P>
    <P>Will the output in future years be determined by 17 year olds filling in their CAO forms in expectation of what they would like to do or by public policy makers who, looking to the implications for the public purse, fail to make adequate distinctions between the cost of one course over another or fail to make adequate provision for the types of skills outputs from our third level system, or will these matters be weighted to take account of changing production methods in industry or foresight studies of emerging technologies, which will be the key to our future industrial competitiveness?</P>
    <P>We must take account of these factors and others in trying to get the best fix between supply and demand in meeting the needs of a buoyant economy over the next decades.  There are many who will have important contributions to make and many important factors in this equation.  All must be able to make an input and must be involved.  It is wrong to think that shortages will appear in entirely predictable areas.  Already we see shortages in critical software areas, but where are the next shortages developing?  There are signs of an impending &ldquo;tightness&rdquo; arising in various areas of hardware and it makes little sense to move resources around to address a shortage in one area only by contributing to one in another.  A comprehensive approach is called for.</P>
    <P>While the new £250 million fund represents a dramatic initiative to address present and future needs, it is important to stress that the fund does not represent a roll up of existing activities, but it will be additional to annual capital allocations and will not replace ongoing investments.  We must manage the interface with existing schemes in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill concerns this Government's strategy for ensuring the education system is capable of <Col N="320" /> meeting these challenges.  It provides the formal legal basis for the establishment of the scientific and technological education investment fund announced last month.  This dedicated fund, which will comprise £250 million over three years, represents a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to the various problems which need to be tackled in the education system.  It makes available the necessary capital resources to deal with issues such as overcrowding in third level institutions, the emergence of skills shortages, upgrading of equipment and research and development and increased availability of computers in schools.  The Bill has already been considered carefully in the Seanad, where it was warmly received by all sides, and I am pleased to have this opportunity to present it to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  I have specifically referred in its Title to the scientific and technological aspects of education.  This serves to emphasise that the new fund will be specifically directed at areas which are critical to economic growth and employment creation.  The fund does not purport to concern all aspects of education but is designed to deal with specific issues in the areas of science and technology and a more generic title would involve a loss of focus.</P>
    <P>It is also important to stress that this is an investment fund &mdash; the funding allocations to be made will represent more than a form of social spending.  They will facilitate the modernisation of the education system, prepare it for the challenges posed by technological change and safeguard future economic growth.  In this sense, the fund clearly represents an investment in our future.</P>
    <P>Section 2 establishes the new fund and sets out two accounts through which it will be operated, an account with the Office of the Paymaster General and a private donations investment account. Private sector business and industry is set to benefit greatly from the existence of the fund. Not alone will it assist in terms of continued supply of skilled labour, it will also concern the upgrading of research and development in educational institutions.  As I remarked earlier, research is increasingly being recognised as crucial to economic viability and the support provided in the fund for such activities will ensure industry can continue to develop and enhance products and production methods.</P>
    <P>As beneficiaries, industry and the private sector have a responsibility to contribute to the development costs.  Over the years, this obligation has not been shirked and I wish to put on record our appreciation of the generosity of private sector donors, particularly in respect of contributions towards the cost of third level buildings.  Most of the developments, supported by my Department in the university sector, now involve a substantial private sector input and without such contributions the development of the third level system would be hampered significantly.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the fund dovetails with the terms of sections 16 and 25 of the Finance Act, 1997. <Col N="321" /> Section 16 provides for relief on private or corporate donations to certain third level institutions for the purposes of research, acquisition of equipment, infrastructural development and facilities in areas concerning skills shortages, all of which the fund is designed to support.  Section 25 provides for tax relief in certain defined circumstances for investment in the provision of new accommodation in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>The designation of a separate account for private donors' contributions will reassure contributors that their investments are separate from, and additional to, the State's investment.  Furthermore, the Bill provides in section 7 a mechanism for private sector donors who may wish to do so to specify how their contributions to the fund should be spent.  Although section 2 states that the Minister for Finance will manage the fund, it is intended that these responsibilities will be delegated by him to the National Treasury Management Agency and the Bill provides for this.  The NTMA will ensure funds which have been allocated from the private sector but not yet spent will be invested and that the interest accruing on such investments will be added to the funds available.</P>
    <P>At the official launch of the fund on 6 November, the Government gave a commitment that £100 million would be made available in 1998 while the balance of £150 million will be allocated to the fund over the following two years.  The revised text of section 3, which will enshrine this commitment into law, incorporates an amendment raised in the Seanad which should remove any lingering doubts concerning the strength of the Government's commitment on this issue.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the purposes for which payments may be made from the fund.  These are defined as capital expenditure in connection with education and training programmes in areas of skills shortages, scientific or technological research and development including the use of the results of such research for commercial purposes, computers and information technology in schools and other education and training programmes considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>The education and training programmes, under the terms of section 4 must be scientific, technological or vocational in orientation.  The terminology of the section is necessarily rather broad and is designed to encompass a number of specific objectives which were announced at the launch.  It would be helpful to review these objectives in some detail.</P>
    <P>First, approximately £60 million will be set aside to combat emerging skills shortages.  Much of our economic growth in recent years has been achieved by virtue of the availability of a highly skilled and adaptable labour force.  In particular, this fact has enabled us to attract substantial investment from multinational companies and Ireland is now home to many leading hi-tech industry names.  However, recent indications have suggested that, to some extent, we risk becoming the victims of our phenomenal success.  The threat <Col N="322" /> of potential skills shortages in certain areas has been well documented and the allocation of £60 million will facilitate the necessary provision of additional student places in courses relevant to industry's needs.</P>
    <P>Second, similar problems have emerged in the hotel and tourism industry.  This sector's importance to the economy has grown substantially in recent years.  However, it has not been possible to cope with the rapidly increasing demand for skilled workers, mainly because the principal source of labour, regional technical colleges, were established at a time when tourism played a minor role in the economy.  The allocation of £20 million for capital developments in the colleges represents a major boost to an area which in the past received only modest levels of investment.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I referred to the importance of promoting inclusiveness in education.  Sometimes when the spotlight falls on traditional high profile areas, such as higher education, other sectors may be forgotten.  The further education sector, notwithstanding its importance in education into industry, may tend to suffer in this regard.  Similarly, the established system of training for apprentices may be neglected despite its well deserved reputation for excellence internationally. A sum of £20 million will be allocated to these headings.  This will be used to support the provision of additional apprentice places, many in trades where the boom in the construction industry has resulted in skilled labour shortages.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House in his ministerial capacity.  This is the first occasion on which he has presented a Bill and I wish him well in his task.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a scientific and technological education fund contains the germ of a great idea.  However, given the straitjacket put on this Bill, that great idea will wither and die.  That is the sad tale we have to tell.  A golden opportunity to inject dynamism into our scientific and technological sector will have been lost.  The test of this Minister of State, who will take Committee Stage tomorrow, is whether he is willing to break out of the narrow confines of present thinking in the Department and allow the potential of technology to be realised.  I will table a series of constructive amendments designed to do that and hope the Minister of State will be willing to take them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several ingredients are necessary if we are to create a really dynamic technological education fund.  The fund must be managed by a strong independent board, bringing together the best minds in business and in education to focus on the task; it should as a key role take a long-term <Col N="323" /> perspective identifying priorities and building strategic strengths for Ireland well into the new millennium and allocations from the fund should be transparent with the best proposals selected in open competition on the basis of objective evaluation. This fund should be available to the best projects, people should be free to apply for it and there would be a fair and equitable test of the quality of the proposal before money is disbursed in that way.  The ideas for funding should be welcomed from wherever they come, be it from publicly funded colleges or private colleges.</P>
    <P>All moneys in the fund should be invested, pending their allocation to individual projects, and the investment income should build up within the fund.  That is a basic ingredient of any fund. There should be an active matching mechanism to leverage private contributions and make it worthwhile for people to come forward so that for every extra pound in private money, there is a mechanism to release additional Exchequer money.  That would give real meaning to the invitation to the private sector to contribute.  A fund with those ingredients could make a real mark.  It would bring forward a coherent planning framework within which the vital need to invest in technology in our education system could be delivered.</P>
    <P>Innovation could be supported, strong business education links could be developed and we could look to a future in which our long-term competitive advantage would be built upon the skills and creativity of our people.  It would be the key to providing high income jobs for a workforce that aspires to those high income levels and rightly deserves to have them.  Has the Minister delivered that framework?  Sadly, the answer is a definitive &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Given the obvious need to address the agenda of investment in technology, it is disappointing the Minister's proposals fall short of what was hoped for.  There is to be no board to manage the fund, all decisions are to remain in the hands of the Minister.  Therefore, we will not bring together the best minds in business and in education to help us identify the projects, the key priorities, the strategic areas where Ireland must invest in research to forge the partnerships with the big multi-national computer companies so that our educational institutions can be relevant to their work and their research.  That will not happen.  It will be run by the Minister in the same way as the Department always ran its capital spending.</P>
    <P>There is to be no competition inviting alternative proposals for selection.  Nowhere in the Bill is there provision for a competition where people would be invited to put forward their best ideas. No criteria have been published for the selection of projects to be funded and the destination of all the money has already been announced by the Minister of State before any evaluation of the relative merits or proposals are in place.  Every single area has had an amount of money allocated. <Col N="324" /> These allocations are firmly fixed in stone or else the Minister will have to apologise, following his promise of £80 million, given that he has discovered those priorities were wrong.  There will be no independent evaluation of where priorities lie and there will be no matching mechanism. The Minister adverted to section 16 of the Finance Act, 1997, as a vehicle for matching finance, in that contributions to the fund would be tax allowable.  My reading of section 16 is different from that of the Minister.  It deals with individual projects and not contributions to a general fund.  It has to be an individual project, individually sanctioned by a Minister and only then will it qualify for tax relief.  The idea that a donor would contribute £10 million which would be tax allowable is not provided for in the Bill or in section 16 of the Finance Act, 1997.  In his reply perhaps the Minister of State will correct me.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the investment income on the £250 million of taxpayers' contributions will not accrue to the fund.  That is one of the hidden provisions in the Bill.  However, there is provision to ensure the investment earned by that money will go back into the Exchequer.  It is not a fund from the point of view of the public contribution in any meaningful sense.  Any interest earned on that money, pending allocation, will go back into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Ideas from outside publicly funded colleges will not be welcome.  It is ironic that while the Government asks the private sector to contribute, it does not provide a list of private sector colleges which would be potential beneficiaries of the fund.  No long-term perspective is encompassed by the Bill which provides by law that all Exchequer contributions must terminate within three years.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this fund in this form cannot be seen as a serious attempt to introduce a strategic planning framework for investment in this vital area.  It will not reach out for innovative thinking but will bankroll the existing pet projects, already lined up by the Minister and his Department.  A golden opportunity to develop a dynamic education partnership is being lost.  The Minister of State is out of touch if he thinks a single big push to investment in technology education in the next three years will put Ireland on the high road to competitive success.  What is needed is sustained strategic planning and investment in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has an opportunity to look afresh at this Bill.  We have a really great opportunity to start to bring strategic thinking into how we invest in education and research. This type of thinking has been lacking in the past. The potential is enormous.  Many overseas foreign companies invest large sums in research.  If we want to be in the next generation of growth we need to invest in research and conduct it in Ireland.  The key to that is through our higher education sectors, through the Regional Technical Colleges, the colleges and the universities and the NMRC.  That is the key through which we can <Col N="325" /> begin to draw down more of that valuable research investment which gives strength to our industrial sector.  This vehicle, if transformed, could be a dynamic fund.  It could start to prioritise the areas of research, to dynamically draw in the participation of business in identifying those priorities.  The Minister must consider taking on a more radical approach.  There is nothing new in this Bill.  The higher education authority already has the right to receive gifts.  There is nothing new in saying we will receive gifts from the private sector.  Under the provisions of the Finance Act not only can third level institutions receive gifts but can have a tax allowance on those gifts.  There is no need for a centralised fund to allow colleges to draw down private money.  The only source of dynamism that can come from this idea is if the fund becomes the pump primer of new ideas, that is if one invites people to tender and there is a competition to chase the money and generate a knock-on effect.</P>
    <P>That will not happen under the procedure envisaged by the Minister of State and his senior colleague.  The decisions have been made.  A sum of £25 million is to be invested in computers, £60 million in the universities, £80 million in the regional technical colleges and £15 million in research.  There is no dynamism.  An opportunity is being missed. The Minister of State should think again.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at the reports in the Department of Education and Science to appreciate the scale of what is needed in the economy. The steering committee on the information society identified a need for investment of £150 million in computers and £35 million in teacher training.  The Government has made a valuable start in investing £25 million in computers and £15 million in training but this falls dramatically short of even half the amount needed.</P>
    <P>There is a need for investment in third level places.  We know from research that 20,000 extra places will be needed over the next three to four years in the university and Regional Technical College sectors at a cost close to £250 million. There is a need for investment of £50 million in up-to-date technical equipment in the university sector.  A similar amount needs to be invested in the Regional Technical College sector.  The CIRCA report identified a need for investment of £60 million over the next three years in university research.  These objective assessments have identified the need for investment of at least £750 million over the next three to four years.  That gives some idea of the scale of the investment needed in this area if we are to play a leading part.</P>
    <P>The need for investment will not fall away after three or four years, rather the amount required to be invested will continue to mount.  As the Minister of State knows, Ireland will come under increasing pressure from the European Union on the question of direct aid to industry which will have to stand or fall on its competitive ingenuity. That brings us back to the quality and creativity <Col N="326" /> of the people involved.  As the pressure mounts rapidly, there will be a need for quality investments in the education system.  If the Minister of State and his colleagues think that £250 million is a marvellous sum and will solve our problems, they are sadly mistaken.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to do what could be done with this fund.  This will require fresh thinking and a much more radical approach.  The Minister of State may have to go back to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, before bringing forward the kind of Bill that would make a real contribution. If necessary, he should withdraw the Bill and take the time over Christmas to bring forward a proper Bill to take advantage of a huge potential opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for sharing his time with me.  The sum of £250 million will bring us to a level that we should have reached many years ago.  If Ireland is to surpass other EU countries in terms of IT skills, infrastructure and innovation there is a need to invest more money to produce long-term dividends.  Investment in infrastructure is of particular importance to peripheral areas such as the north-west.  With the benefit of technology, it is possible for small indigenous companies in rural areas to process information transmitted from places as far away as the United States.  New technology can reduce the negative impact of peripherality but only if there is the required investment in infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The rate of expansion of the software industry has been significant in recent years.  This year approximately 16,000 jobs were created in such firms and up to 2,000 jobs in the previous year. Almost half those employed are based in Irish owned companies.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann's commitment to provide Internet access and PCs in primary and secondary schools is welcome.  It will, however, require significant investment in the medium term to provide adequate IT equipment to the 4,000 secondary schools in the country.  It is vital that Telecom Éireann ensures ISDN lines are provided in rural areas to prevent them being left behind in the slow lane of the information superhighway.</P>
      <P>There are three third level colleges and two FÁS training centres in the north-west.  Historically, the regional technical colleges within the region have been under-utilised.  Under the 1993 Act they have more independence.  A tool making centre of excellence has been developed successfully in Sligo and a set of material test centres in Letterkenny, among other developments. There is, however, a need for improved links between third level colleges and the business community.  The Minister of State should identify practical measures by which third level colleges can assist in the development of the regions.  This could include the development of further centres of excellence around which industrial clusters can grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that Sligo Regional Technical College is granted institute of technology status <Col N="327" /> which it has been seeking for some time.  The factors which apply in Waterford are replicated in the north-west which has been suffering from the effects of years of neglect.</P>
    <P>While this fund will be of benefit, as Deputy Bruton indicated, many key areas have been missed. A large proportion of the fund should be targeted at peripheral areas as opposed to densely populated areas.  The figures show that the north-west has not received its fair proportion of the jobs created in IDA assisted companies in recent years and that, in the main, inward investment has been concentrated in certain areas.  It is critical that the pool of skilled graduates in the north-west is widened.  This will require major investment in the regional technical colleges in the region to correct the imbalance.  A proportion of the fund has been reserved for investment in apprenticeship courses.  In this context, greater emphasis should be placed on tourism development. The number of places available on catering and management courses should be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>Significant investment is required in technology and computing equipment in third level colleges. To allow the north-west to benefit from industrial growth the number of places available in these fields should be increased.  Funding should be made available to small companies to conduct inhouse research.  In this context, the barriers between third level colleges and companies should be broken down and companies encouraged to commission regional technical colleges to conduct research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the fact that Deputy Treacy is back in office and wish him every success in his new position.</P>
      <P>This Bill is welcome.  The payment into the fund of moneys voted by the Houses, totalling £250 million in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 to be used for capital expenditure, including equipment, over a range of areas in technological, scientific and vocational education and research, on the face of it, is a means by which capital planning and its implementation can be embarked on with confidence.  It also means that funds will not have to be extracted from the annual Estimates campaign as they would appear to be already spoken for.</P>
      <P>The provision for payment into the fund of additional resources from private donations is also welcome but it remains to be seen whether it will result in any substantial donations.  Perhaps a tax incentive could be introduced for this purpose in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I seek quite an amount of clarification from the Minister when replying.  First, I note a reduction of 12 per cent in the Estimate for third level and further education for 1998 as against the forecasted 1997 outcome, entailing a reduction from £601.801 million to £531.072 million, a net decrease of £70.729 million for the entire sector in 1997.  Such a reduction in excess <Col N="328" /> of £70 million begs the question: where is this money going?</P>
    <P>For instance, building grants and capital costs of regional technical colleges, institutes of technology and certain vocational colleges have been reduced by 20 per cent from the forecasted outcome for 1997 of £31.3 million to £25.07 million in the 1998 Estimates, representing a reduction of £6.23 million.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the grant to An tÚdarás um Árdoideachas for building grants and capital costs for universities and colleges and designated institutions of higher education &mdash; grant-in-aid &mdash; has been reduced by 16 per cent from the forecasted outcome for 1997 of £19.35 million to £16.315 million in the 1998 Estimates, representing a reduction of £3.035 million.  This means that a total of £9.265 million has been deducted from those two subheads.</P>
    <P>In his remarks in the Seanad the Minister alluded to need for crafts in the hotel and tourism industry.  He went on to state that he proposed an additional £20 million be set aside from the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund to support capital investment in the various regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the tourism college in Killybegs but did not include the Waterford Institute of Technology.  I want him to reassure the House that this omission implies no sinister message for Waterford.</P>
    <P>I also want the Minister to confirm whether the £20 million being provided under this Bill represents the recycling of Structural Funds previously allocated for other purposes.  For example, there is a £70.729 million shortfall in the general Estimate for third level and further education. If it is the case that the £20 million consists of recycled Structural Funds, then where is the additional funding for that sector?</P>
    <P>The capital programme is impressive and worthwhile.  However, one must ask from where will the attendant revenue emanate?  That leads me to repeat my previous question whether this is, in fact, additional capital funding.  Will the Minister assure the House that the additional requisite funding will be provided?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has tabled various amendments to the Bill for consideration by the Select Committee, the first being to its long title, seeking to clarify whether the moneys allocated to the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund represents an additional financial resource.  My party has tabled a drafting amendment seeking to establish the reason for the word &ldquo;Investment&rdquo; needing to appear in brackets in the title of the fund since they appear superfluous.  Another Labour Party drafting amendment seeks to remove any possible ambiguity in the use of the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In addition, my party seeks a more prominent role for the Higher Education Authority in relation to the funding of institutions falling within its remit.  Bearing in mind its functions under the terms of the Higher Education Authority <Col N="329" /> Act, 1971, it appears that its role under this Bill will be reduced to one of consultation with the Minister rather than the development of third level education to meet community needs and an advisory role in relation to all third level education.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not seek to undermine in any way the Higher Education Authority in the discharge of its responsibilities.  I want him to explain in detail how the selection of specific projects under the provisions of this Bill will take place and how he will ensure equity and balance as between institutions and regions.  For example, does he intend applying any specific yardstick for this purpose?</P>
    <P>I contend that section 6(b)(i) to (vi) are superfluous as the necessary provision is contained in section 6(b)(vii).  Therefore, my party seeks to have section 6(b)(i) to (vi) deleted to tidy up its drafting.  I might remind the House that section 6 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall, before he or she exercises his or her powers under section 4 in any particular case&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) consult with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and</P>
    <P>(b) if he or she considers it appropriate to do so, also consult with&mdash;</P>
    <P>followed by a list of Ministers.  Subparagraph (viii) states:</P>
    <P>such other Ministers of the Government or other persons as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>I believe the final subparagraph is appropriate and that the total list of Ministers is not of any real benefit to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another Labour Party amendment seeks to ensure that all forms of property are included in regard to the acceptance of gifts.  Our reading of the Bill, as currently drafted, is that gifts other than cash must be sold and their proceeds invested in the fund and that there is no provision for the use of a gift of land or other property for the purposes specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We also seek that, in the 1998 report, the Minister identify funding allocated for corresponding purposes in 1997 and shall indicate how much of that funding represents a continuation of the existing allocation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for generously sharing his time with me and the Minister of State for agreeing to shorten his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an enormously important Bill, not least because of the very welcome allocation of £250 million toward scientific and technological education, providing a mechanism whereby private funding can be made available for investment in scientific and technological education but also because it deals with a subject so crucial to the development of our people's education, our economy <Col N="330" /> and society in general as we approach the new century.</P>
    <P>I wonder why such an important Bill on such a critically important topic is introduced in this House at a late hour, in the last sitting week before Christmas, for a hurried Second Stage consideration, with less than 24 hours before its consideration in Committee and a short interval thereafter before being considered on Report Stage.  The urgency to get the 1998 allocation of moneys into the 1997 accounts &mdash; which is what appears to be behind the rush to have this Bill passed before Christmas &mdash; is not acceptable and should not take precedence over a more considered approach.</P>
    <P>I happen to agree with many of the comments of Deputies Richard Bruton and O'Shea that many clauses in the Bill need time to be ironed out.  For example, the Bill purports to make a contribution to tackling a significant current problem, that of skilled shortages in the information technology sector, broadly defined. However, as it stands, it will regrettably make very little contribution to this problem or to the equalisation of opportunity in respect of the available jobs and career opportunities that now exist in the IT sector; the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment admitted as much during Question Time on 9 December 1997.  My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, asked her if she agreed that the welcome moneys provided by the Government through the establishment of the funds under discussion here to address the question of skills shortages were targeted almost exclusively towards young educated people and enhancing the number of places for young educated people.  She replied:</P>
    <P>There is some merit in what Deputy Rabbitte said about the fund, that essentially it will go to people who are better educated.  It would be invested at an early stage in first and second level schools to ensure our young people are equipped for skills for the emerging jobs.</P>
    <P>However much we need to invest in third level, as the Minister acknowledged, that is not the full picture.  More is needed.  The Bill should be amended to reflect the wider need for investment in information technology and scientific and technological education.</P>
    <P>The short and long titles should be amended to reflect a reference to training, to give an explicit commitment to training and to establish some degree of parity of esteem between training and education.  The core provision of the Bill, the substantive measure provided for, is set out in section 4 which deals with disbursement &mdash; to whom moneys may be disbursed, the basis for the decision and the purposes of spending to be supported out of the fund.  That should be amended to reflect a parity of esteem to training and to the wider education sector outside the third level area.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 4(1)(c)(i) and (ii) should not be included.  They allow for disbursement <Col N="331" /> of moneys from the fund for capital expenditures connected with pure research, but also for capital spending related to spending for commercial purposes by colleges.  This opens the fund to the role of venture capital and applying it to a purpose that more properly belongs to IDA Ireland type grant aid and assessment.  It stretches the phrase &ldquo;related matters&rdquo; in the long title beyond its absolute limits.</P>
    <P>Section 4(3) deals with the practical business of disbursement.  This role is to be vested in the Higher Education Authority.  There is some danger in this provision.  The main third level colleges will see this fund as their own.  The Higher Education Authority is also a third level body largely controlled and directed by the third level interest.  The danger is that the colleges individually, wearing one hat, will be applying to the colleges collectively wearing another hat.  This is too cosy an arrangement with all the inherent dangers contained in it.  Ideally, the question of disbursement and the use of the fund should be vested in an independent body that embraces the colleges but also has a place for the second level area, especially its plc sector, the training sector, industry and the development agencies, particularly Forfás, which has overall responsibility for the working of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Bill to the issue of its use is misguided.  It is to establish an enormous fund of taxpayers' money and then leave it to the education sector to freely determine its own approach to seeking payments from the fund. However, this is a fund the purpose of which is purportedly, unashamedly and explicitly pragmatic, problem solving, practical and, above all, utilitarian.  It is supposed to be about dealing with the specific problem and doing so effectively and expeditiously within a framework that ensures parity of esteem between training and education and equality of opportunity for all young people, regardless of what channel they come through to the world of work.</P>
    <P>From this view it would be far more effective to see a framework that puts an explicit duty on the disbursing authorities to establish broad parameters, priorities and a focus for spending from the fund and then inviting education and training providers to bid for the moneys through a market bidding mechanism from the fund.  This approach was envisaged by the previous Government but it was thwarted by the colleges.  It would appear that they have finally triumphed in respect of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be amended on the two remaining Stages to reflect a greater degree of parity of esteem than at present between training and education.  It should also be amended to ensure that the access to this fund will not be confined to the third level sector and that it reflects the wide range of activity which is taking place, especially in the area of research, technology and information development, much of which is happening outside the pure education sector.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy O'Shea that the Waterford Institute of Technology is included.  With regard to Deputy Gilmore's point on the accounts, the £100 million will not be in the 1997 accounts; they will be provided for in the 1998 Estimates.  The reason for introducing the framework legislation now is to have it in place for 1998 so that we can have the money voted as early as possible in 1998 and commence to expend money from the fund as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Gilmore's other point about not confining this to the third level sector.  It will not be.  The Deputy may be familiar with the Information Technology 2000 programme, the funds for which will be provided from this fund.  Under that programme we aim to have 60,000 multi-media computers in first level schools within the next three years.  We also aim to have trained or provided the appropriate training for up to 20,000 teachers.  We realise that life does not begin at third level.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that Deputy Richard Bruton rubbished the provision of £250 million for the specific purposes set out in the legislation.  On taking office the Government identified certain needs and this money is being provided for those needs.  Deputy Bruton's interpretation of section 16 of the Finance Act, 1997, is at variance with mine.  I have no doubt that will be dealt with adequately on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned a number of amendments he proposes to introduce on Committee Stage to remove the straitjacket which he considers to be on the fund.  I do not wish to preempt debate on the proposed amendments, but if they were to be accepted they would put a straitjacket on the fund where none exists.  The legislation has been deliberately framed to give the maximum flexibility.  Deputy Bruton's amendments would change the tenor of the legislation and introduce bureaucracy and decisions by quangos, etc.</P>
      <P>It may be said that the allocation of £250 million to specific areas such as this is a lot of money when there are so many needs in other sectors of education.  The money is being provided in a way which will be over and above the normal provision in the Department's annual Estimates.  The money in the fund will not be provided at the expense of other sectors of education.</P>
      <P>It is a continual source of amazement that the numbers in the regional technical colleges and the institutes of technology have more than doubled in recent years despite a total lack of commensurate funding.  It is a great tribute to the students and the educators in those institutes.  It would be an Irish joke to say that funding has kept pace. Despite the needs in the economy over the past several years, an unplanned, unco-ordinated and haphazard approach has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educators in those institutes know the needs of the economy.  They were loath to turn away bright students who wanted to participate <Col N="333" /> in courses where jobs were becoming available, often in the appropriate region.  The attitude adopted was that some funding might be provided this year or the next &mdash; it amounted to a latter day Micawberism.  That will change as a result of this fund which should be warmly welcomed by Members on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The aims of the fund are clear.  They are to ensure that Ireland can hold its place with the best in the high technology world, that its young population is hi-tech computer literate and that we can provide a workforce with a high level of skills and knowledge to service and develop an industry vital for our economic future.  This Bill provides the framework for the expenditure of that fund and I wholeheartedly commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for the Adjournment and the Minister of State for coming in to respond.  It is a direct and straightforward issue and I hope the Minister can give clear and precise answers to the points I want to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that under Article 198 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, subsumed into the Treaty on the European Union, the Committee of the Regions was formally created.  It is an important body representing elected members on a regional basis across the European Union and adds to the dimensions of representation and inclusion within the democratic system of the European Union.  It was always envisaged that the members to represent Ireland in 1998 would be selected in accordance with legislative measures enacted by the Oireachtas in the first instance and secondary legislation signed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in 1993.  Under Statutory Instrument No. 394 of 1993, the Local <Col N="334" /> Government Act, 1991, Regional Authorities Establishment Order 93, section H, the statutory provision is that members will be selected by the regional authorities.  Section H states that one of the functions of the regional authorities would be to select, when requested to do so by the Minister, a person being a member of a local authority in the region to be proposed as a member of the Committee of the Regions or a person to be proposed as an alternative member of such a committee using, in relation to each section, the methods set out in the Fourth Schedule for the election of the cathaoirleach of a regional authority. Two clear points for the future arise from statute law: first, the obligation on the Government to use the legally established regional authorities as the mechanism to select next year's members of the Committee of the Regions for formal appointment by the Council of Ministers and second, to have that election in accordance with the schedule to which I referred to ensure proportionality.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because rumours are abounding in local government circles that the Minister does not propose to follow the statute route laid down and understood to be the accepted mechanism by all political parties represented in this House.  I seek the assurance of the Minister tonight that he will state clearly and without equivocation that the method set out in statute law and in the statutory instrument to which I referred will be the method employed.  I want him to assure us that it will be a regional decision by the democratically constituted regional authorities and not rubber stamped by the Minister.  That will ensure that democracy, as provided for in law, agreed by this House and signed in 1993 by the then Minister for the Environment, will be the methodology that will be employed in this important work.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this matter on the Adjournment which has given me the opportunity to respond to it.  The EU Committee of the Regions &mdash; COR &mdash; was established by the Treaty of the European Union and held its first meeting in March 1994.  It is composed of 222 representatives of local and regional authorities, with an equal number of alternates.  There are nine Irish members and nine alternates.</P>
      <P>Under the Treaty the COR must be consulted by the European Commission or the Council in five policy areas that directly affect the responsibilities of local and regional authorities.  Those areas are: economic and social cohesion, including Structural Funds; trans-European transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure networks; public health; education and youth and culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members are nominated by the member states and appointed by the EU Council of Ministers for a four year term.  The current term of membership expires on 25 January 1998.  Precise arrangements <Col N="335" /> with regard to nominations for new members have yet to be made.  There is provision for proposed nominations to be sought from the regional authorities.  A range of factors will have to be taken into account in the making of any nominations, including geographic balance.</P>
    <P>One of the major challenges to be faced in the coming years is to strengthen the links between the citizen and the Union.  The citizen is the cornerstone of the Union.  In the Committee of the Regions members are in the unique position of being in touch with the local concerns of the Union's citizens in their home constituencies and at the same time familiar with the differing needs of the Union's citizens from region to region. Through co-operation with their committee colleagues, members have a key role in linking local, regional and European politics.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for his attendance tonight.  Every Member of the House is aware of the difficulties confronting the agricultural sector at present.  Statistics for 1997 show that farm incomes have fallen by approximately 7 per cent.  Such national statistics can mask more significant falls of income in certain sectors of the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because one of the problems manifesting itself more and more frequently in my constituency is that farmers, through no fault of their own, are not able to generate sufficient income from their holdings to sustain themselves, their partners and their children. Officials in the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs, initially and on appeal, have made decisions to disqualify applicants who are full-time farmers from entitlement to social welfare benefit by quoting the regulation that they are not available for work or genuinely seeking it.  Will the Minister outline where in the social welfare code it is set out that small holders can be denied social welfare payments by virtue of the reasons I mentioned?  All of us know there are many farmers who work full-time but, through no fault of their own, are unable to generate an adequate income.  This problem was not apparent in recent years when the agriculture sector was doing reasonably well, but an increasing number of farmers will be forced into making applications for social welfare due to their declining income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking in particular about farmers who, because they have small milk quotas, may have had alternative enterprises, particularly in the beef sector.  Their income from that sector has been decimated over the past two years because of the BSE crisis, the reduced live exports trade, etc.  I need not elaborate on the reasons for falling farm incomes; they are well documented in every <Col N="336" /> other debate on agriculture.  However, it is a reality of which the social welfare code should take note.</P>
    <P>The social welfare code should facilitate as far as possible the maintenance of the maximum number of farming families on the land.  The present attrition rate among farmers is 5,000 per annum.  If they are not in a position to secure social welfare payments to supplement the meagre incomes which they can generate from the family farm, that number is likely to increase significantly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to instruct social welfare officers and the appeals office to look sympathetically at applications by this sector for assistance at a difficult time for farming families.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for raising this important matter.  As I represent a rural constituency, I empathise with the sentiments which he has expressed.</P>
      <P>In addition to satisfying a means test, the conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance require that an applicant must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  As the Deputy will appreciate, these are statutory conditions which cannot be changed without the relevant legislation being amended.</P>
      <P>There are currently about 8,000 farmers in receipt of smallholder's unemployment assistance and it is considered that they should have no difficulty in meeting the conditions referred to above.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> Income from farming is assessed as the gross yearly income from the holding, such as the sale of livestock, milk, crops or other produce less expenses necessarily incurred, such as rent, rates and annuities, cost of seeds, fertilisers and feeding stuffs, veterinary expenses, interest paid on borrowings and necessary labour costs.  It is a factual assessment and is designed to reflect the actual net income to the smallholder from working on the farm.</P>
    <P>If there were exceptional circumstances associated with the particular year in question, allowances would be made for this.  It is, therefore, open to smallholders who experience a reduction in farming income to have their means assessment reviewed in the light of their changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Creed has a particular case in mind, the Department of Community, Family and Social Affairs, under the political stewardship of Minister Dermot Ahern, will be only too delighted to have the case fully investigated hopefully to the mutual satisfaction of both Deputy Creed and the applicant.</P>

      <P>While I am around, the birds and the bees need not feel unprotected.  I am sorry to say there are not many others like me in this House.  I often wonder what the Green Party stands for.</P>
      <P>I am amazed to read in the newspapers that Ireland is being sued by the European Union for not protecting wildlife habitats.  I want the Minister to respond to the European Union's case. Apparently we are allowing the habitats of not just rare species but a whole series of wildlife species to be destroyed and the Government does not seem to be taking any corrective action.  Will the Minister outline the action she intends to take?</P>
      <P>Other western European countries which have adequate resources available to them &mdash; as Ireland should, particularly in these years &mdash; conduct a wildlife census.  They know exactly the number of each species &mdash; blackbird, goldfinch, plover or whatever &mdash; in existence and how many are in danger.  Ireland has no such system to identify which species is extinct, which is almost extinct and which needs protection.  I am asking the Minister to set up a network to evaluate the species which are endangered and in need of protection. Armed with this information, she should protect those species.  The British carry out an annual census of endangered species.  They know the situation but here it is a case of hit and miss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The classic example is the corncrake which is an endangered species.  The number of corncrakes has been dropping year after year.  I know that sanctuaries are being set up in the River Shannon basin and that it still exists in north County Donegal.  I have heard it.  However, the other day I heard a famous student of wildlife, who was being interviewed on radio, say that the <Col N="338" /> number of corncrakes in north County Donegal has seriously declined in the past few years.  That type of news is alarming.</P>
    <P>The report in <i>The Sunday Times</i> which refers to the European Union's action against the Government states that species, such as the red grouse which we would have thought were common are endangered at present primarily due to over grazing by sheep.  Heather is their natural food and it is the habitat which protects them from detection.  It is being eaten away.  Overgrazing is a serious problem.  I have stated before that sheep farmers, particularly hill farmers, should be compensated for leaving a certain proportion of mountain and bogland areas on which wildlife could thrive.  I know it will cost money but it is what the European Union and everyone who is interested in wildlife want.</P>
    <P>It is not just the red grouse which is endangered.  The merlin, the golden plover, and the hen harrier, all of which are beautiful species, are seriously endangered as, I am sure, are a series of others.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister specifically because I have raised the matter with previous Ministers.  The current Minister was here at the time and heard me.  There has been no action.</P>
    <P>There is an insufficient number of wildlife rangers. There is one in my county, which has two very large mountain ranges, moorland, hills and river basins.  That is totally inadequate.  I appeal to the Minister to be the first to do something definite about the matter to ensure our wildlife is not allowed become extinct, that we are not left with predators and scavengers, and that all the song birds and the lovelier parts of our heritage are retained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy will be aware that the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill has been promised for some time but, unfortunately, it did not materialise during the term of office of the previous Government. <Col N="339" /> However, I have had a number of meetings with those interested in this Bill not least the NGOs who raised a number of issues with me last week.  The plight of the corncrake was one of the issues raised and the representatives of the NGOs involved stated that it was the first opportunity they had to talk directly to the Minister responsible for introducing the legislation.  I informed them that I intend to publish the Bill in March.</P>
    <P>The country's most important wildlife areas are required to be designated either as special protection areas &mdash; SPAs &mdash; under the 1979 EU Birds Directive or as special areas of conservation &mdash; SACs &mdash; under the 1992 EU Habitats Directive. Over 100 SPAs have already been designated in Ireland and the process of designating SACs is under way in that the main part of what will be Ireland's SAC network &mdash; over 200 sites amounting to 550,000 hectares &mdash; has already been publicly proposed for designation and is accordingly protected.</P>
    <P>With regard to SPAs, designation does not normally imply a restriction on existing activities. Landowners are asked to consult with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department before undertaking any new projects or activities in or near designated SPA sites which may adversely affect them.  Each planning authority is sent details of SPAs within its functional area and is asked to take account of the designation when examining development proposals.</P>
    <P>Land in SACs is required to be farmed in accordance with an approved agri-environmental plan which will specify, <i>inter alia</i>, the stocking restrictions, if any, required to conserve the land in question.  Those participating in the REPS schemes, administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, will have a farm plan prepared as part of that scheme.  Those who do not wish to join REPS may operate in accordance with a plan prepared by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  Each individual farm plan impinging on commonage land will have to be compatible with an overall plan for the commonage prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  This plan will specify the maximum overall stocking density that the area can carry on a sustainable basis.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora &mdash; the Habitats Directive &mdash; was transposed into Irish law on 26 February 1997 by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. These regulations fully transpose the Habitats Directive into Irish law and they contain significant additional provisions relating, <i>inter alia</i>, to compensation, notification of proposed candidate sites to landowners and objections to proposed designations &mdash; on scientific grounds only &mdash; and appeals against restriction.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Deputy in a reply to a Parliamentary Question on 27 November last, the EU <Col N="340" /> has been notified of our proposals in respect of SAC designations subject to the outcome of the requisite consultation process.  A number of sites proposed as part of that consultation process are the subject of appeals and I will not formally notify the EU Commission of those sites until appeals have been resolved.  I hope this can be achieved by next April.  The possibility of whether sites on which there have been appeals can be notified at an earlier date is under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to publish proposals relating to non-priority habitats by mid-1998 and these will be notified to the Commission when any objections or appeals have been resolved.  I hope the final element of Ireland's SAC network, comprising marine and coastal sites, will be publicly advertised before the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the habitats regulations go further than required by the Habitats Directive in the immediate imposition of controls on sites from the time for their identification as provisional candidate SACs.  Since taking office I have had meetings with the IFA and the ICMSA in respect of SACs and other natural heritage issues.  Last week I met six other conservation bodies to further progress the level of partnership on this issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with the fundamental objectives of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and I believe our most important natural areas and species should be protected.  In that context, I am committed to implementing the directives' provisions. I also believe that those who suffer loss because of conservation restrictions are entitled to fair compensation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that to date a large number of meetings have been held with relevant groups, representing landowners, land users and other interests, to explain the SAC/SPA process. These have proved to be beneficial and similar meetings continue to be held.  However, while in Opposition, I was conscious that, notwithstanding the meetings and briefings taking place, the message was still not getting through and that events which would profoundly influence the lives of many people were felt to be taking place in a world removed from theirs.</P>
    <P>I am currently assessing all aspects of the implementation process in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;An Action Plan for the Millennium&rdquo;, in order to ensure the full involvement of all participants in a spirit of real partnership.  I would welcome any specific proposals Deputy Deasy would like to put forward in respect of the SACs or the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.  I look forward to hearing from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.  I also thank the Minister of State for coming before the House to deal with it and I hope he will give me a constructive reply.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science could not be present but I am sure he is extremely busy.</P>
      <P>I note that on a previous Adjournment debate, the Minister for Education and Science stated that he valued the contribution made by the gaelscoileanna. He also indicated it was Government and Department policy to support the establishment of gaelscoileanna in areas where a demand for such schools exists and where there is no alternative school within a reasonable distance. The viability of any proposed school is also important.</P>
      <P>Everyone is aware of the conditions which obtain in many of the buildings that house a number of gaelscoileanna throughout the country.  I know the Minister is aware of the specific problems faced by the pupils and teachers of Gaelscoil Sheáin Uí Eígeartaigh in Cobh.  The Minister has acknowledged that the accommodation is unsuitable for &ldquo;long-term use or development&rdquo; and that &ldquo;alternative permanent accommodation is required&rdquo;.  I visited the school and I can attest to the fact that it is damp, overcrowded and the toilet facilities are completely unsatisfactory.  A further problem exists because the building in which the school is housed is required by the Cork Harbour 2000 project for an exciting expansion of the Queenstown story.</P>
      <P>The Minister put forward two solutions to this problem in reply to a question I tabled on 4 November last.  The first was to secure existing school accommodation which has become surplus to requirements due to falling enrolments.  Will the Minister of State inform me about the results of the examination carried out by the Department in this regard?  My investigations show that no such falloff is foreseen.  On the contrary, due to unprecedented building work in Cobh it is most likely that pupil numbers in the town will rise. The only alternative is to sanction the building of a new school on the most suitable site but there is concern that this will be available only for a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clear that demand exists.  Even in the present cramped and unsuitable accommodation the school is a success, with 142 pupils enrolled last year.  The school would really take off if it were in a proper building.  I am sure the <Col N="342" /> Minister will agree that if Gaelscoileanna had existed in the past we would probably be a bilingual country now, such has been their success.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science met the parents support committee recently.  Parents are worried because they have campaigned since 1992 and the Minister gave a commitment to reply before Christmas.  I appeal to him to make this a happy Christmas for the Cobh children.  He should delay no longer and sanction the funding to build a new school, which is the greatest present possible.  He should enter the spirit of the season by being Santa Claus, not Scrooge.  Some 2,000 years ago a young family was told there was no room at the inn; the Minister should give these young children a new school with adequate room.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for sharing his time and support his request that the Minister decide in favour of new facilities for the pupils of Gaelscoil Sheáin Uí Éigeartaigh.  The present accommodation is completely unsuited to the educational needs of children.  The school has operated for 12 years and occupied a number of locations before its present site &mdash; effectively it has gone from the frying pan into the fire.  The Minister has had the matter examined over the past few weeks.  At a meeting with the parents some time ago he said it would be over six weeks before he would have a decision and that time is almost up.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has an answer tonight but I hope there will be one by next week for the pupils and parents of the school.</P>

Tréaslaím leis an mbeirt Teachta Dála as spéis atá acu sa teanga agus, go háirithe, an spéis phearsanta pholaitiúil atá acu i Gaelscoil Sheáin Uí Éigeartaigh.  Tá spéis mhór agam sa teanga agus aontaím leis an chaoi ina chuir siad an scéal faoin nGaelscoil faoi bhráid na Dála.</P>
      <P>I accept fully that the school's current accommodation is inadequate and that a replacement permanent building is needed as a matter of priority.  Towards that end a number of possible strategies are being examined urgently by our Department.  It is general policy to ensure that the implications of all developments on education provision in an area are fully assessed when supporting projects.  A particular issue arises in terms of ensuring that existing accommodation is utilised to the best effect and that the best use is made of public investments.  An example of this procedure leading to an agreed rationalisation process was seen recently in Youghal, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, it is clear that the Gaelscoil cannot be looked at in isolation.  The most effective use of other surplus accommodation in the town must be established.  along with the effect on existing <Col N="343" /> schools.  As part of this process, officials from our Department visited all the schools concerned recently to acquire an appreciation of the position at first hand.  They are fully aware of the importance of speedily addressing this matter.</P>
    <P>I assure all associated with Gaelscoil Sheáin Uí Éigeartaigh that we share their concern to resolve the school's accommodation problem by providing satisfactory permanent accommodation at the earliest possible date.  Dá bhrí sin, níl Gaillimheach <Col N="344" /> mar mise in ann freagra cruinn beacht a thabhairt in ionad Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta ó Chorcaigh.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 34 of 12 November 1997.</P>
      <P>The oldest type of reactors in the UK are magnox reactors and are located mainly on the west coast of Britain.  Of the 11 magnox power stations throughout the UK three have now been closed. Calder Hall, now nearly 40 years old, houses the four ageing magnox reactors on the Sellafield site. Originally built in 1956, these reactors have exceeded their expected design life by 20 years.</P>
      <P>I recently met with the UK Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, where I raised the Government's long-standing concerns about magnox reactors and stressed the Government's desire for the closure and early decommissioning of these facilities in the interest of nuclear safety and radiation protection.</P>
      <P>As Minister responsible for nuclear safety policy, Mr. John Battle, MP, Minister of State for Science, Energy and Industry, recently responded to the points I raised with Minister Meacher.  In summary, he maintains that the UK system of nuclear regulation is internationally recognised as a rigorous system for ensuring a high level of safety.  In addition, magnox stations are subject to periodic long-term safety reviews by the UK's Health and Safety Executive, HSE, which is satisfied that UK's eight operating magnox stations can continue to operate safely.  While the response of the UK Government could perhaps be anticipated given previous UK policies in this area, I am considering with the advice of the RPII what action I should take to reinforce our concerns about the delay in decommissioning these reactors.</P>

      <P>I first outlined my position in regard to the campaign for retention of duty free to the House on 30 September last and have done so on many subsequent occasions.  I promised to raise the issue at every possible opportunity and I will continue to do this.  Most recently, I raised the matter at the Council of Transport Ministers in Brussels last week.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Quinn's particular query regarding duty free discussions in the last week of November, the House will recall from the Taoiseach's recent report on the Employment Summit that he availed of the opportunity to raise the issue there.  In his intervention, the Taoiseach pointed out the inconsistency between the abolition of duty free and the fact that the conclusions proposed to be adopted by the Council required that all Community policies should be harnessed in support of European employment.  The Taoiseach laid down a marker as to the importance of the issue for Ireland and made it clear that the Irish Government will continue to press the case on this issue.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my response to earlier parliamentary questions, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is currently awaiting the report of a study, commissioned by his Department, to establish the impact of the loss of duty free on Irish employment, transport and Government revenues. This independent study is expected to be completed in early January and will provide a clearer picture of the likely effect on employment and other important areas such as transport and tourism.</P>

      <P>At my recent meeting with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the construction of a light rail system for Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to proceed with the independent consultancy study was designed to ensure that the facts were established in relation to the option of putting the city centre section of the light rail project underground. Nothing has changed in the intervening period which would lead to a reconsideration of that decision.  The Government's key concern is to ensure that the right project for Dublin is constructed and any decision on this cannot be based solely on the availability of EU funding.</P>

      <P>The charges made by Telecom Éireann for access to the Internet are a matter for the company to determine and one in which I have no function.  The level of such charges is one to be determined by the company within the parameters of the Telecommunications Tariff Regulation Order, which was made on 16 December 1996, in accordance with section 7 of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, I recognise fully the importance of competitive communications charges for the <Col N="350" /> development of advanced technologies like the Internet.  The Deputy will no doubt be aware that as part of a recent price reduction package worth £43 million, Telecom Éireann reduced its charges for ISDN data calls.  I was glad to see that Telecom Éireann identified this area as a priority.  At present 90-95 per cent of businesses in Ireland can gain access to the ISDN service and this recent reduction should facilitate and encourage the take-up and further use of advanced technologies, including access to the Internet.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that Telecom Éireann will look at providing specific arrangements for Internet access that will provide reduced rates which will, in turn, encourage far greater use of the Internet. I am strongly of the view that widespread usage of the Internet will become an absolute necessity for business to succeed in the future and I hope to see Telecom Éireann reducing its charges in this area to facilitate business.</P>

      <P>Since 1 July 1997 the construction of telecommunications infrastructure for the purpose of the provision of services, other than voice telephony, has been liberalised under EU rules. This has meant that companies which propose to provide such services as an alternative to Telecom Éireann do not have to rely on leased lines from that State body, but can provide these services over their own independently constructed infrastructure or over existing private networks.</P>
      <P>The ESB has one of the most extensive telecommunications infrastructures in the State and its corporate strategy for future growth involves the full exploitation of existing assets.  The board has therefore been studying the possibility of involvement in the emerging liberalised market for telecommunications in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The company has had discussions with a number of major telecommunications companies. These discussions culminated in the agreement announced by the ESB on 9 December to enter the market with British Telecom.  BT was chosen as a partner on the basis that it offered the best commercial deal to the ESB.  The deal involves the creation of a 50-50 venture between ESBI Telecoms and BT.  Investment by the two partners will be approximately £75 million in the first five years, growing to £130 million over ten years. The new company, to be headquartered in Dublin, is expected to create up to 300 jobs.</P>
      <P>The joint venture company will compete in the market by offering a range of communications products and services, initially to Ireland's business community, in preparation for targeting other customers after full liberalisation of the Irish market post-2000.</P>
      <P>The joint venture will have immediate access to the ESB's digital microwave network and will also be able to use the company's extensive overhead electricity cable network and ducts to expand the network.  The ESB network, one of the most extensive in the country, will be linked to the BT system.  The formal launch of the joint venture is subject to the finalisation of all necessary legal agreements.</P>

      <P>EU Directive, 97/33/EC, which deals, among other things, with interconnection of telecommunications networks, requires member states to put in place before 31 December 1997 measures to ensure facility and property sharing by organisations providing telecommunications networks and publicly available telecommunications services.  Regulations to implement the directive in Ireland will be signed before that date.</P>
      <P>The directive provides that arrangements for co-location or facility sharing shall normally be a matter for commercial and technical agreement. It requires, however, that national regulatory authorities, that is, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in Ireland, must have powers to intervene to resolve disputes.  Facility or property sharing arrangements may only be imposed after an appropriate period of public consultation during which all interested parties must be given an opportunity to express their views.  These requirements will be reflected in the regulations to implement the directive.</P>
      <P>I fully support the principle of sharing of masts and other telecommunications infrastructure on the basis of commercial agreements in order to promote economic efficiency and mimimise the adverse environmental impact of telecommunications infrastructure.  I am also considering bringing proposals to Government for a Bill dealing with this and related regulatory issues in the telecommunications sector.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy that Cablelink be developed and upgraded to a state of the art multi-media platform and that the network be subject to open and non-discriminatory third party access obligations.  This policy is in line with commitments given to the EU Commission last year during the discussions on Ireland's liberalisation timetable and the strategic alliance involving Telecom Éireann and KPN-Telia.</P>
      <P>In my reply on 12 November 1997 to Question No. 111 on this subject, I indicated I had asked Telecom Éireann to present to me options for the future development of Cablelink.  As the Deputy is aware, Telecom Éireann has a majority shareholding, 75 per cent, in Cablelink; RTÉ has a 25 per cent shareholding.</P>
      <P>Last week, I received from Telecom Éireann its proposals in regard to the future of Cablelink and these are now under consideration by my Department.  Any decision on the future of Cablelink will be taken in the context of the Government's overall policy in relation to the information society and the enhanced capability of cable networks to deliver interactive multi-media services, voice telephony and digital TV. The regulatory environment as regards the ownership, access to and delivery of such services will also be taken into consideration.  Such decision will be taken in consultation with the strategic partners, RTE and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The task of making transport services accessible to the widest possible range of customers is essentially a matter for transport operators themselves.  Successive Ministers with responsibility for public transport have pursued a policy which emphasises the need for transport providers to maximise the accessibility and userfriendliness of their facilities and services to customers with disabilities, having regard to the resources at their disposal.  I fully endorse that <Col N="358" /> policy and I am committed to ensuring that transport operators should continue to accord a high priority to meeting the requirements of people with mobility impairments as part of their overall efforts to improve service quality standards.</P>
      <P>There has been a very positive response to this policy by the CIE companies in recent years.  On the railways, it has been possible to achieve a high degree of accessibility of trains and stations to customers with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs.  It is now a firmly established policy of Iarnród Éireann that all new trains and stations, together with major refurbishment projects at existing stations, should take account of the needs of mobility impaired customers.  Recent practical examples of this policy include the new enterprise service on the Dublin-Belfast line and the upgraded station in Kilkenny, which I officially opened earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The buses acquired by the two CIE bus companies in recent years have many features which make them more responsive to the requirements of people with disabilities.  Both Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath are committed to operational trials involving large capacity low floor buses which are accessible to wheelchair users.  Bus Éireann already has one such vehicle in operation in Cork city.</P>
      <P>Bus Átha Cliath has now begun to take delivery of the six vehicle fleet of accessible large capacity buses which the company intends to assign on a trial basis to its existing service on route three with effect from February next.  The company already has a wheelchair accessible minibus service in operation on the city's northside.</P>
      <P>I am particularly encouraged that the three CIE companies have either established, or are in the course of establishing, user groups representative of people with disabilities.  The input from these groups should give the companies very valuable assistance in their ongoing programmes of improving the suitability of their services for mobility impaired customers.</P>
      <P>At present, an interdepartmental task force, under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is drawing up an action plan for consideration by the Government, based on the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. I expect that the outcome of that process will provide a basis for determining the extent to which additional transport accessibility initiatives can be undertaken in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The matter referred to in the <Col N="359" /> Deputy's question is a day to day matter for Telecom Éireann and, as such, one in which I have no function.</P>
      <P>Charges for calls, including any possible changes in local call charging, are to be determined by Telecom Éireann within the parameters of the Telecommunications Tariff Regulation Order which was made on 16 December 1996, in accordance with section 7 of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I continue to interest myself in the issue of telephone charges and I am anxious to see continued reductions in such charges.  The extent of existing competition in the market is already leading to reductions in prices for some telecommunications services.  Continued movement towards full liberalisation will result in more choice for users of telecommunications services and will mean further decreases in prices.  This is good news for all telecommunications customers. I am anxious to see price reductions continue and I will continue to encourage Telecom Éireann in this regard.</P>

      <P>The operation of the Dounreay nuclear power plant, in particular the nuclear waste in a disposal shaft on the site, is of concern.  These concerns relate to the continued <Col N="360" /> accumulation of radioactive wastes at the site, radioactive discharges into the environment, the continuation of reprocessing activities and the number of radioactive &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; which have been detected near to the site.  The Government's views on these matters have been raised with the UK authorities and will be discussed further at a meeting between officials in January.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, in the context of the consultation process on an application by the Dounreay operators for revised discharge authorisations, my Department wrote to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, SEPA, expressing the Government's concerns about the Dounreay plant, including the condition of the intermediate level waste disposal shaft.</P>
      <P>The Scottish Secretary recently invited SEPA to undertake a second round of consultation on the application.  My Department in conjunction with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will participate in this consultation process.</P>
      <P>In relation to the waste disposal shaft on the site, I understand from the British authorities that a formal recommendation has been made by the plant operators to the UK Department of Trade and Industry, proposing that the waste in the shaft be retrieved, packaged and stored above ground.  A decision on the matter has not yet been made but I welcome any efforts which will lead to a safe resolution of this serious problem.</P>
      <P>While I am concerned about the operations at Dounreay, I am advised by the RPII that our marine environment is not immediately threatened. While steps are being taken by the UK regulatory authorities to protect the environment, I am monitoring developments.</P>

      <P>The current investment programme, which is partly co-funded by the EU and partly financed from the company's own resources, will result in improvements to track, signalling, rolling stock and stations over the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the time this programme is completed in 1999, total investment in the mainline rail network over six years will have amounted to over £275 million.  The work includes extensive replacement of jointed track on timber sleepers with continuous welded rails on concrete sleepers. All of the principal lines radiating out of Dublin benefit from this renewal expenditure, <Col N="361" /> including Dublin to Cork, Belfast and Limerick; Portarlington to Galway; Dublin to Sligo; Kildare to Waterford; Athlone to Westport and Ballina; Mallow to Tralee, and Dublin to Rosslare.</P>
    <P>Work is also ongoing to replace the outdated mechanical signalling system on mainline rail routes with a modern, cost-effective and centralised control system.  Significant work will be done on the Galway, Sligo, Tralee and Waterford routes.  As a result, these lines, as well as those to Cork, Limerick, Wicklow and Dundalk, will be equipped with modern signalling by 1999.</P>
    <P>The need to purchase additional rolling stock to meet existing demands and to meet future needs is also being addressed.  In the period from 1994-99, 32 locomotives and 14 carriages will have been purchased for use on the main lines to the cities.  A further 44 diesel railcars will have been acquired, mainly for suburban use.  The locomotives, the carriages and 17 of the diesel railcars are already in service and the remaining 27 railcars are due to be delivered next year.  This new rolling stock enhances the overall quality of the rail service by removing old and outdated rolling stock from the entire network.</P>
    <P>DART and the other four distinct suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area serving Dundalk, Arklow, Maynooth and Kildare are also benefiting from investment under the current programme.  By 1999 stations will have been opened or upgraded; new rolling stock will be in service, and the DART will be extended to Greystones and Malahide.  A total investment of almost £40 million is involved.</P>
    <P>Further investment will be needed and a post-1999 programme is being considered which will maximise the use of scarce resources.  All aspects of the rail system &mdash; track renewal, signalling and rolling stock &mdash; will be examined.  I have asked CIE to prepare detailed investment plans for both the mainline and suburban rail networks in the context of securing EU or other funding in the post-1999 period.  That work is already well in hand.  I expect to receive the relevant reports early in the new year and these will provide the basis for determining the future rail investment programme.</P>
    <P>In addition, the successful conclusion of the necessary change and restructuring negotiations, currently under way between unions and management, will contribute towards improving Iarnród Éireann's efficiency, reducing its costs and generating the internal resources necesssary for the renewal of its assets.</P>
    <P>The introduction next year of public service contracts will give the company a much more stable medium-term financial framework, while at the same time placing an emphasis on payment for performance.</P>

      <P>Speaking in response to a Private Members' motion on 9 December last, I announced that I proposed to appoint independent consultants to carry out a strategic review of rail safety, covering all relevant aspects, including infrastructure, policy and practice.

      <P>Questions relating specifically to the Community Support Framework are matters in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In the case of the State airports, arising from the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework, the monitoring committee decided to withdraw the remaining 11 MECU under the allocation for State airports and to divert this saving to the roads measure.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to reassure the Deputy that no projects will be abandoned as a result of this decision as the entire programme will be undertaken by Aer Rianta from its own resources.  The amount of aid in this case was comparatively small in the context of the overall capital investment programme totalling more than £200 million.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the international mox assessment report to which the Deputy refers.  I share the concerns raised in the report, in particular the increased risks which mox production poses for proliferation of nuclear weapons, concerns about the safe transport of spent fuel for the production of mox fuel and the subsequent transport of mox fuel containing plutonium and the unnecessary expansion of the nuclear fuel reprocessing industry.</P>
      <P>BNFL has applied to the UK Environment Agency to commission the mox plant at Sellafield. As part of the process to decide whether the new mox plant is &ldquo;justified&rdquo;, the Environment Agency undertook a consultation process earlier this year.  My Department, as an interested party, forwarded a submission in April detailing the Government's concerns about BNFL's proposal. The Government is totally opposed to any expansion of Sellafield's operations, including the proposed mixed oxide plant.  The Government believes BNFL has not demonstrated the &ldquo;justification&rdquo; of mox production at Sellafield, that is, that the benefits of the proposal outweigh its disadvantages. I understand the agency is expected to reach its decision on the plant's commissioning early next year.</P>
      <P>I also add that the Government's concerns about the proposed mox plant were raised when I recently met with the UK Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Meacher, MP.</P>

      <P>The Dublin-Waterford line is included in an EU co-financed investment programme in mainline and suburban rail over the period 1996-99.  This programme will cost £73.3 million and the European Commission has allocated £62.3 million in grant aid at a rate of 85 per cent from the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the £73.3 million package, £6.5 million was allocated to upgrading track on the Dublin-Waterford <Col N="366" /> line.  The work involves the replacement of life expired jointed track on timber sleepers with continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers. It is being undertaken on the Cherryville Junction-Kilkenny section of the route.  Up to the beginning of September 1997 spending on this project amounted to £1.2 million.</P>
    <P>A further £14 million was allocated for the replacement of an outdated mechanical signalling system on four routes, including Waterford, with a new, modern, cost-effective and centralised control system.  The work on the Waterford line will be undertaken on the Athy-Waterford section of the route.  The total package of investment is scheduled for completion by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>This investment will build on the progress achieved under the 1989-93 Operational Programme on Peripherality during which £3.5 million was invested in upgrading 11 miles of track on the Dublin-Waterford line.  In addition, a further £1.5 million was invested at Lavistown Junction, Kilkenny.  This work involved the construction of a one kilometre circular single track section to directly link the existing two lines.  The work also included signalling work and the installation of a passing loop.  It will also complement the investment already approved and implemented under the Cohesion Fund covering the period 1993-95 where five miles of track on the line was upgraded.  The non co-financed programme, and its implementation, is a matter solely for CIE and Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>I understand that the derailment to which the Deputy refers involved an unladen engineer's train travelling from Portlaoise to Waterford and occurred between Athy and Carlow at about 8.20 p.m. on 7 December 1997.  The six flat wagons were derailed together with three wheels of the rear bogie of the locomotive.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has established a joint inquiry board to investigate the circumstances of the accident. Until the board's report is available, it will not be possible to state definitively why the derailment occurred.  However, I understand that preliminary indications are that the accident was a random occurrence rather than the result of track conditions on the line.  Meanwhile, the line will be subject to inspection by Iarnród Éireann in the normal way and I have been assured by the company that there would be no question of allowing trains to operate if track conditions were considered to be unsafe.</P>

      <P>The provision of passenger road transport services, aside from services provided <Col N="367" /> by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, is governed by the Road Transport Act, 1932.  There is widespread acceptance that there are a number of difficulties associated with the implementation of this legislation and there is a general consensus that it is in need of updating to meet the requirements of the travelling public.</P>
      <P>Extensive consultations have already taken place between my Department and a range of organisations with an interest in this policy area. Those consulted included PAMBO, Private Association of Motor Bus Owners, FOTO, Federation of Transport Operators, CIE and IBEC and they outlined their views on how bus transport in Ireland should develop.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this is a very complex matter and that there are no simple solutions.  It is important that the proposals which emerge establish a fair balance between the legitimate interests of the users and providers of road passenger services. At this stage I cannot say precisely when I will be in a position to bring forward legislation.  My overriding concern is to develop an effective solution which offers the best response to the real challenges facing the public transport industry.</P>

      <P>I am always very conscious of the infractructural needs of the regions in terms of promoting balanced economic development for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> The development of facilities at Cork and Shannon airports has been facilitated by the provision of capital investment programmes of £18 million and £28.5 million respectively.  These programmes are now under way and are expected to be completed by 2001.  The programme at Cork consists principally of upgrading runway and passenger terminal facilities while the main element of the programme at Shannon relates to a major refurbishment and expansion of the passenger terminal.</P>
    <P>The regional airports are perceived as an important part of the local economic infractructure and facilitate quick access to the regions for tourist and commercial/business traffic.  On this basis, these airports received Exchequer aid for basic priming infrastructure in the early 1980s and also European Regional Development Fund aid of £10.43 million under the Operational Programme for Peripherality 1989-93.</P>
    <P>Currently, in order to assist in the marketing and promotion of services to the regional airports, the Exchequer has put in place funding amounting to £2.35 million over the years 1996-99. The Department has also introduced a scheme of Exchequer subvented air services in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin.  The Government recently decided to extend the scheme in relation to Kerry, Galway and Sligo for a further three years.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's commitment in the programme for Government to support the network of regional airports, I recently secured the Government's approval to make a total of £5 million of Exchequer funding available for residual infrastructural improvements at the regional airports in Donegal, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Waterford in 1998.  This funding will facilitate the completion in 1998 of essential upgrading of the infrastructure and facilities at these airports, thereby enhancing the prospects of attracting additional air services and tourism to these regions.</P>
    <P>The enhanced record of support for both the further development of the airports and the extension of subvented air services demonstrate the Government's determination that both air access outside Dublin and its subvented cost will play an important part in the drive to attract and sustain balanced regional economic development and the essential jobs that come with such development.</P>

      <P>On 14 November 1997, I met Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, the UK Minister for the Environment.  At that meeting, I drew his attention to the Irish Government's serious concerns relating to the UK nuclear industry, including its concerns about the significant increases in concentrations of technetium 99 in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Mr. Meacher, informed me the UK intends to implement a programme of reduction of these discharges.  Notwithstanding this, I emphasised to him the Government's desire for a cessation of such discharges into the Irish Sea and pointed out that Ireland would pursue this matter vigorously, as it has done in the past, under the auspices of the Oslo/Paris Convention. I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No. 20 on 12 November 1997, regarding technetium 99.  The measurements taken by the RPII of technetium 99 in a range of fish and shellfish samples between 1996 and 1997 show that the dose to seafood consumers does not give rise to concern.</P>

      <P>The current position is that the company has sought and I have agreed to an extension of the original mandate deadline of the end of this year.

      <P>The light rail project is only one element of the public transport strategy recommended by the DTI.  The proposed light rail system will only account for three of the 17 public transport corridors in the city, the others being 11 quality bus corridors and three DART-suburban rail corridors.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable amount of other important work currently in progress to improve Dublin's existing public transport network, thereby contributing towards easing chronic traffic congestion.  Bus services are the backbone of the existing public transport network and will remain so notwithstanding the development of light rail.  Implementation of quality bus corridors, which is the responsibility of Bus Átha Cliath and the local authorities, is being pursued by them with the active support of the Dublin Transportation Office.  Bus Átha Cliath is continuing to upgrade its bus fleet and to review its network to meet changing passenger demand.</P>
      <P>A suburban rail development programme is also under way which is compatible with the DTI strategy and which will ensure the best use of existing rail assets.  A major DART investment programme is now under way, including extensions to Greystones and Malahide, the acquisition of new rolling stock, the improvement of existing stations and development of new stations.  New stations are planned on the Maynooth line and additional railcars are on order for the suburban rail network.

      <Quest>where the four territorial employment pacts are operating in Ireland; and the success, if any, in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22689/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The four areas in Ireland nominated to participate in a network of over 80 territorial employment pacts being set up across the member states of the European Union are: Dublin, all 11 partnership areas; Limerick city, PAUL partnership area; Westmeath, Westmeath Community Development area; and Drogheda-Dun-dalk, Dundalk employment partnership and Drogheda partnership areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic objective of territorial employment pacts is to encourage regional or local partnership in order to: mobilise available resources to develop an integrated strategy which is accepted by all parties, based on their needs and expressed in a formal commitment &mdash;&ldquo;Territorial Employment Pact&rdquo;, identify the difficulties, concerns and <Col N="373" /> future prospects facing each of the players with responsibility in the employment field, and put into effect employment schemes and measures which could serve as a model.</P>
    <P>The Irish pacts are being organised initially through the area partnership companies in the selected areas whose board structures comprise the social partners, the statutory agencies and local community groups.  While the Dublin pact has been specifically supported by the social partners in the context of Partnership 2000 as a measure to enhance employment opportunities for disadvantaged urban communities, all the pacts are heavily dependent on social partner involvement.  This support is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Following Commission approval of interim technical assistance funding, each group is completing a preparatory phase of drawing up an action plan for the area.  Applications have been sought for pacts co-ordinators to oversee the implementation of the definitive action plans for each area.</P>
    <P>No additional funding, over and above existing CSF funding, will be available from the Commission to implement the plans, other than technical assistance for items such as networking and co-ordination requirements.  There may, however, be scope to finance projects through existing operational programmes or initiatives, using financial margins for manoeuvre.  The principal benefit of the pacts is to reinforce the already strong commitment to strategic actions involving the social partners to maximise local job potential. Networking with groups in other member states is particularly useful in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the communications unit which is part of the Government Information Service in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The role of the Government Information Service has been expanded to enable it to improve its service to the public by providing additional services and backup facilities to Departments.  To this end a communications unit has been established which enables the Government Information Service to provide a comprehensive information service to Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments, and alerts them to any problems which may arise in relation to their implementation.  In this way Departments will be able to provide a better service to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are six civil servants on secondment from Departments and one non-established person employed in the unit.  Three of the staff are <Col N="374" /> employed at executive officer grade and three of the staff are employed at clerical grade.  As the staff are on secondment their salaries are met by their parent Departments.  Any overtime/shift allowances, etc, are met by the Department of the Taoiseach and included in the estimated running costs for 1997.  The manager's salary is £30,400 and is paid by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The estimated initial set up cost is £26,055, with running costs to the end of 1997 of approximately £8,000.  The work of the communications unit ensures that Departments are eliminating the use of external companies and no longer duplicate work such as transcripts, tapes etc, thereby saving Departments considerable costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the following previous parliamentary questions which address the functions and remuneration of non-established staff appointed to my Department since I took office: Question No. 99 of 30 September 1997; Questions Nos. 94 and 100 of 30 September 1997, and Question No. 3 of 1 October 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition, the following appointments have been made.  Six clerical assistants were taken on to fill sanctioned posts and vacancies in the Department.  Each of these officers is earning £10,443.41 per annum and the matter of expenses does not arise.</P>
      <P>A civil servant has been seconded to fill the post of Government press secretary.  A further seven civil servants, including an usher from the Houses of the Oireachtas, have been seconded to my personal staff.  In addition to the manager of the new communications unit in my Department, details of which are contained in my response to Question No. 3 of 1 October 1997, six posts were sanctioned to staff the unit.  Five posts have now been filled by staff on secondment from other Departments.  The five new staff comprise three executive officers and two clerical assistants. Their salaries are paid by their parent Departments and, apart from a limited amount of overtime, the only additional cost to my Department is the payment of a shift allowance, equivalent to one-sixth of each officer's salary, which arises as these officers operate a flexible rota of three different work shifts.  The matter of expenses does not generally arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This communications unit is a new initiative designed to service all Ministers and to improve and expand the services provided by the Government Information Service.  It lowers costs across <Col N="375" /> all Departments by reducing duplication of work and expenses.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for individual businesses and other users of computer systems to assess the implications of the year 2000 for their particular systems and to determine the solution.  Where the Government can help is in raising awareness of the issue.</P>
      <P>Early in 1997, Forfás prepared a report, on behalf of my Department, which indicated that the level of awareness among technical management was high, although many were not aware of the full scale of the issue, but there was a need to convince senior management of the scale of the problem.</P>
      <P>My Department launched an awareness campaign in June which involved the distribution of over 92,000 leaflets to every business address in the country and a further 34,000 leaflets via the trade associations and the chambers of commerce and the county enterprise boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is shown by the <i>November 1997 Price Waterhouse 2000 Aware Study</i> of 231 finance directors in Ireland awareness appears to have increased significantly; 71 per cent of respondents said that the year 2000 problem was either serious or fundamental to their organisation, 94 per cent have already started planning, 59 per cent have a <Col N="376" /> formal writtten plan and 69 per cent were very confident about their organisation's ability to comply with the year 2000.</P>
    <P>However, that confidence is belied by other disturbing findings that over half of repondents were unable to estimate the total resources required to address the issue and 40 per cent had not considered requesting confirmation of year 2000 compliance from their business partners.  My Department is currently examining how it might follow-up on the above-mentioned awareness campaign.</P>

      <P>My Department receives significant moneys under the Community Support Framework 1994-99 both in the context of its role as the national authority for the European Social Fund, in which capacity it transfers ESF receipts largely to other Departments and agencies, and in the context of support for its implementation responsibilities under the industry and human resources development operational programmes of the CSF and associated Community initiatives.</P>
      <P>While temporary underspending can arise from time to time for a variety of technical and operational reasons, there is no significant or persistent underspending of Structural Funds arising in Community Support Framework operational programme measures in my area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>Progress reports, including expenditure profiles, on the implementation of the operational programmes are prepared for the bi-annual meetings of the relevant monitoring committees. These reports are internal to the monitoring committees and no decisions have been taken by them at this time to publish these reports.  An overall evaluation of the operation of the Community Support Framework was however undertaken by the ESRI in the context of the CSF mid-term review and has been published as ESRI Paper No. 31 of July 1997.</P>

      <P>In its mid-term review decision on EU Structural Funding support, the Community Support Framework monitoring committee called for examination by my Department of the scope for implementing change in pursuit of greater cost recovery, reduced aid rates, increased tendering for services and for more competition in the delivery of services. This and related qualitative issues were brought to the particular attention of the human resources development operational programme monitoring committee, which includes representatives of the operational agencies concerned, the European Commission, relevant Departments and the social partners, at its October meeting in the context of making its decision on a mid-term review package.  Given that the priority at that meeting and subsequently was to finalise the decision-making, and follow-up consequences, on concrete expenditure adjustments agreed under the mid-term review process, it was agreed that the qualitative issues, including the elements referred to in the Deputy's question, would be followed up at future monitoring committee and co-ordinating committee meetings.  This is also the situation in relation to the industry operational programme.</P>
      <P>That remains the position.  Delivery agencies, primarily FÁS and the Department of Education and Science in the case of the human resources development operational programme and the industrial development agencies in the case of the industry operational programme, are aware, through their participation in the relevant monitoring committees, of the requirement to respond on these issues and I expect that there will be appropriate consideration given to the matter in the period ahead, including discussions with my Department.  As of now, however, I am not in a position to indicate any specific new steps which may be put forward for consideration by the monitoring committees in that context.  The next meetings of both the human resources development monitoring committee and of the industry monitoring committee are scheduled for April 1998.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the funds, if any, her Department, or agencies under its aegis, are receiving from the Community Support Framework of the EU; and, if so, the steps, if any, she is taking to ensure that the private sector is allowed to participate in tendering for grants under the operational programme on the basis of criteria set down in advance as agreed as part of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework.</Quest>

      <P>My Department is in receipt of significant EU Structural Funds under the Community Support Framework 1994-99 both in the context of its role as the national authority for the European Social Fund, in which capacity it transfers ESF receipts largely to other Departments and agencies, and in the context of support for its implementation responsibilities under the industry and human resources development operational programmes of the CSF and associated Community initiatives.</P>
      <P>In the case of the human resources development operational programme, as negotiated with the European Commission in 1993, the funding for substantive implementation of measures is transferred to the Department of Education and Science, FÁS, the NRB and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A residual amount for technical assistance, including evaluation, is retained by my Department.  In so far as my Department is concerned, all normal tendering requirements are met wherever necessary for any private sector purchases required.  In the case of FÁS, the CSF mid-term review decision acknowledges that, for example, FÁS training for industry is put to tender in many cases under existing arrangements.  Likewise, it operates on a similar basis in relation to the use of external trainers.  The issue of widening the scope for further competitive delivery in the training domain is to be revisited at future monitoring and co-ordinating committee meetings, as indicated in response to a related question today from the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The industrial development agencies under my Department are actively pursuing replacement industries for the Athy area.  As part of the expansion of its overall Irish activities, Sherwood Medical relocated its production activity from Athy to its headquarters in Tullamore.  This involved the relocation of approximately 60 employees who were offered employment at the plant in Tullamore.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of site visits by overseas investors to the Athy facility to date. Sherwood Medical has made the facility, 48,000 square feet, available at favourable terms to potential clients.  Negotiations are ongoing between the property division of IDA, Ireland and interested parties to examine the provision of an advance factory in Athy.  Planning permission is currently being sought for a new privately funded advance factory in Newbridge which, when occupied, will have a positive impact on employment opportunities for the southern region of the county.</P>
      <P>The continued expansion of major companies located in County Kildare, such as Hewlett Packard, Intel, Wyeth Medica, Modus Media (Stream), Oral B and Donnelly Mirrors, as maintained during 1997, indicates a strong growth expectation for 1998.  Although some of the traditional large employers in the food sector in County Kildare have reduced their employment levels, new companies have been established and have created new employment.  Examples of such companies are Poldy's Fresh Foods Limited, Naas and the Queally Group, also in Naas.  This sector of prepared consumer foods will continue to expand.</P>

      <P>The industrial development agencies of my Department are making a substantial contribution to job creation in the midlands.  The recent announcement that Oxford Health Plans Inc.  will establish a claims processing centre in Mullingar, with the support of IDA Ireland, marks a move to regional locations of international services businesses.  It is also the first major project of its type to locate in the midlands.  Oxford Health Plans, at full capacity, will employ 500 people in Mullingar and will locate in a 25,000 square feet IDA advance factory at Clonmore, Mullingar.  The availability of this factory was one of the key factors in attracting the company to the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The companies supported by IDA Ireland are <Col N="380" /> encouraged to look at many locations across the country during the process of their decision-making. To date in 1997, there have been eight site visits by overseas mobile investors to Longford. While for some time a potential client held a reservation on the 20,000 square feet advance factory there, due to the changing needs of the investors, the project located elsewhere.  IDA Ireland is currently in discussion with a US company which has shown an interest in locating in this building.</P>
    <P>In 1997 Forbairt also approved funding assistance in excess of £1.3 million towards new and expanding industries in the midlands.  The four companies &mdash; Longford Brassware Limited, Keytech Precision Engineering, Glennon Bros., Timber Ltd. and Swanpool Ltd. &mdash; have the potential to create nearly 150 jobs.  Indigenous natural resource activities are the major contributor of industrial jobs in Longford.  The sector represents 65 per cent of the 1,372 indigenous jobs in the county.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is working with a group of companies in the midlands on the supplier development programme. This will help them to develop the capability and scale to supply multinational companies in Ireland.  C.L. Precision Engineering Limited, Roscommon, is one of the companies that has participated in this programme.</P>

Buildings are now under construction for the first three of these locations, while negotiations are still ongoing for the construction of a facility in Portlaoise. Two further approved certificates were issued by SFADCo in respect of Ennis and Castleisland.  Construction is now under way in both locations.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has entered negotiations for the 1997-8 tax year scheme with various groups regarding possible support for applications for BES funding for the provision of factories at a number of locations.  As the changes in the business expansion scheme have just been announced any impact on the 1997-8 proposals and implications for the operation of the scheme in future years have yet to be determined.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department has received money under the Community Support Framework; the underspendings of allocated funds, if any, there have been under the Community Support Framework in the areas for which his Department is responsible; if a report giving details of the reasons for underspending has been prepared for the monitoring committee; and, if so, if he will publish this report.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is the national implementing authority for the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99.  In addition, the Department is responsible for the following measures: commercial seaports and regional ports measures of the Operational Programme for Transport; tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism, and coast protection measure of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Operational Programme for Fisheries is concerned, a report on performance <Col N="387" /> against programme provision was produced for the last meeting of the operational programme and CSF monitoring committees.  In summary, the report showed a projected shortfall on forecasts to the end of 1997 in the order of 26 per cent.  The operational programme monitoring committee agreed with the corrective action proposed, including revision of 1997 forecasts and the proposal that intermediary agencies would write to those beneficiaries where preparation of payment claims is lagging behind completion of works.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the commercial seaports and regional ports measures of the Operational Programme for Transport is in line with revised forecasts.</P>
    <P>There has been an underspend on the tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism.  The underspend is due to difficulties with the start-up of the programme, difficulties in co-ordination between the central and regional fisheries boards, poor quality applications, project management and submission of claims in some cases and bad weather conditions which delayed works in 1997.  Following the mid-term review of the tourism operational programme, the Department and the Central Fisheries Board took a number of measures to improve the process, including the allocation of additional staff to the tourism angling measure and the restructuring of grant committees.  The benefits of these recent measures should be apparent in 1998.</P>
    <P>There has also been an underspend on the coast protection measure of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services due primarily to difficulties encountered in commencing the sub-programme in 1994.  However, expenditure is now broadly in line with revised forecasts.</P>
    <P>The mid-term review envisaged that reports on performance against operational programme provisions, in respect of all programmes, would be prepared for all operational programme monitoring committees and the CSF monitoring committee to assist them in carrying out their functions. Such reports have been or are in the course of being prepared in respect of the programmes and measures for which the Department is responsible. The question of making available any such reports would be a matter for the relevant monitoring committee to decide.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, in his reply to a similar question from the Deputy, is dealing with expenditure on the forestry sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry. Responsibility for the forestry sub-programme was transferred to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in July 1997.</P>

      <P>The provisions in the mid-term review referred to by the Deputy are intended to cover mainstream services and activities such as the provision of training, marketing, certain infrastructure, etc., and are only relevant, to any significant extent, in so far as the Operational Programme for Fisheries is concerned.</P>
      <P>The CSF mid-term review package agreed that implementing Departments would examine the scope for implementing changes in pursuit of achieving the CSF evaluators' recommendations in regard to cost recovery and the need for more competition in the delivery of services.  The terms of the package were presented to the members of the fisheries operational programme monitoring committee at its last meeting on 22 October 1997. The Department is reviewing the delivery mechanisms within the operational programme and will take the matter forward at the next meeting of the monitoring committee which is scheduled for April 1998.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a development plan for Baltimore Harbour has been submitted to my Department by Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board with a proposed total project cost of £3,324,000.</P>
      <P>All investments in marine infrastructure at seaports must be capable of generating a sufficient rate of return to remunerate the overall cost of the development and ongoing operational costs. Before undertaking any development appropriate sources of funding should be identified.  In addition, it is longstanding policy that ports are required to be self-financing.</P>
      <P>The 1997-99 strategy statement for my Department includes provision for a review of the strategic options for the future development and management of the commercial regional ports, including Baltimore, where traditional activities may be diminishing and to facilitate adjustment strategies and alternative business opportunities. Arrangements are in hand to initiate this review.</P>
      <P>In addition to the strategic review of regional ports, I recently announced a new review by independent consultants of seaport capacity at all seaports operating under the Harbours Acts, 1946 and 1996, including Baltimore.  Funded under the EU operational programme for transport, this capacity study will provide a definitive measurement and authoritative independent examination of the adequacy of seaport traffic handling capacity to cope with current and future demand. The study findings will inform future investment decisions and underpin policy on future marine infrastructural development.</P>
      <P>The development plan for Baltimore Harbour will be assessed by my Department in the context of these comprehensive review processes and full exploration of the economic viability of all sustainable development options.</P>

      <P>My Department deals with many hundreds of separate transactions and contracts relating to marine, forestry, mining and petroleum affairs.  Contracts are awarded by public tender or otherwise in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines.</P>
      <P>It would not be practicable, having regard to the time available and the inordinate commitment of staff time and resources that would be involved, to give details of all contracts awarded by my Department.  I am reviewing the information which could be made available to the Deputy without placing any undue burden on resources and I shall communicate further with the Deputy in that regard.</P>
      <P>In the case of bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, the awarding of contracts would normally be a day to day matter for the body concerned and would be outside the direct responsibilities of my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The harbour at Ballycotton is owned by Cork County Council, who are responsible for its repair and maintenance.  Accordingly, it is primarily a matter for the local authority to determine what remedial works may be required at the harbour.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Cork County Council was notified of a grant of £52,500 from my Department towards a silt dredging scheme at Ballycotton which will cost £70,000.  This project is being managed by the county council.  I understand that the necessary tendering procedures have been initiated and that the local authority will be proceeding with the dredging works as early as possible in 1998.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the grave famine situation which currently exists in New Guinea; and the action, if any, being taken at EU level to alleviate the situation in Papua New Guinea.</Quest>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the current situation in New Guinea, and in this context the Government has recently made an allocation of £50,000 for humanitarian relief to the island.  The grant will be channelled through the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, which is providing relief supplies, medical assistance and transport to the worst affected areas. The grant will be divided equally between the DHA appeals for Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea respectively.</P>
      <P>The El Nino phenomenon has badly affected the entire island of New Guinea, which is shared by Indonesia &mdash; Irian Jaya/West Papua &mdash; and Papua New Guinea.  No significant rainfall has occurred in some areas since April 1997 and even if rains were to start immediately food stocks will be depleted before the next harvest.  The current drought has been exacerbated by the lack of cloud cover which has caused frost and destroyed many crops.  In addition, fires have destroyed large areas of forest and agricultural land with implications for food security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> UN and International Committee of the Red Cross assessments indicate that at least 500,000 people in Papua New Guinea are currently suffering from food shortages and deteriorating health conditions.  Attempts to provide assistance are being hindered by the lack of roads to the interior and smoke from fires is restricting access to many areas which can only be reached by air.</P>
    <P>At EU level, the European Community Humanitarian Office has provided 250,000 ECU to Papua New Guinea.  ECHO's funding has been channelled through the NGO Cafod, for water sanitation products, and the ICRC, for food aid. In addition, the Australian Government is committed to providing substantial assistance.  Other donors have also responded to the appeal for international assistance.  The situation is being monitored by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the possibility of providing further humanitarian aid will be considered in the coming months.</P>

The only expenses payable to these staff, who work in my private office, are travel and subsistence expenditure which have been properly vouched and sanctioned.</P>
      <P>In the same period two internal auditors were appointed to the evaluation and audit unit of the development co-operation division on a two year contract basis at an annual salary of £30,000 each and one temporary secretarial assistant was appointed to the Irish Aid Advisory Committee while one service officer, four clerical assistants, one executive officer, systems analyst, three third secretaries and one assistant principal officer were recruited through the Civil Service Commission to fill vacancies arising in these grades in the Department.  In addition, two clerical assistants and one staff officer took up duty in the Department on redeployment from the Central Statistics Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 100, 101 and 102 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is involved with two operational programmes under the current Community Support Framework.  The two programmes in question are the economic <Col N="402" /> infrastructure operational programme, 1994-9, and the operational programme for transport, 1994-9.</P>
    <P>The economic infrastructure operational programme is concerned with a selective investment programme in the postal, energy and telecommunications sectors.  While there has been underspending in some of the energy measures of the operational programme, the bulk of the expenditure under the operational programme will occur in 1998 and 1999, which reflects the long leadin time for some of the larger investments to be implemented under the operational programme. The background to underspending, under some measures of the operational programme, is contained in the annual reports for the operational programme which are in the Dáil Library, as well as in the ongoing work of the monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for transport provides for an EU backed investment programme in national and secondary roads, non-national roads, mainline rail, State airports, Dublin Transportation Initiative, DTI, including light rail, commercial seaports and regional ports.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government is the lead Department for this operational programme.  My Department has made returns to that Department in relation to underspending under the DTI public transport measure.  The background to underspending under this measure is contained in the annual reports for the operational programme for transport which are in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The CSF monitoring committee did not make any specific recommendations concerning the recovery of costs for the delivery of services or the need for more competition in the delivery of services in relation to any of the sectors for which my Department has responsibility.  The main focus of Government policy in relation to State companies is that where necessary to respond better to the needs of customers, liberalisation of sectors, and growing competition, or the need to enhance the competitiveness of the country, they should become more efficient and effective.  In some cases this requires major transformation and sometimes restructuring.</P>
    <P>The application of best practice in relation to the completion of socio-economic cost benefit analyses, arising from the CSF mid-term review is a matter which will be addressed by the Department in consultation with the CSF evaluation unit as well as the external evaluators for the relevant operational programmes, The information requested by the Deputy concerning the individual allocations of EU funds between different measures to be implemented, by agencies under the aegis of my Department, and by the private sector is set out in the individual operational programmes which are in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The allocation of EU aid for a new measure in the economic infrastructure operational progamme, concerned with the development of <Col N="403" /> broadband technology is conditional on all of the players in the telecommunications sector, including the private sector, being allowed to participate in tendering for the grant on the basis of criteria set down in advance.  My Department is in the process of engaging consultants to develop these criteria for the assessment of the most suitable broadband project or projects.</P>
    <P>The mid-term review of the CSF provides for an evaluation of the potential for generating funding, including private finance, from an operating concession for light rail, possibly including associated park and ride facilities.  The drafting of terms of reference for this evaluation is currently under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 11 July 1997, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, wrote to me in relation to the provision of grant aid towards the new peat fired power station.  The Commissioner confirmed that all expenditure incurred up to the end of 2001 will be eligible for co-financing under the Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>I have agreed with the Commissioner on the need to ensure that there is close monitoring of the project with a full review at the end of 1998. By then, we will be in a far better position to gauge the situation with regard to the planning and environmental process which provide the greatest uncertainty with regard to the time scale. If at that stage it is clear that the station will not be completed by the end of 2001, the Commissioner and I are agreed that only expenditure certain to be spent by that date should be co-financed and that any residual element of the grant anticipated to be unspent by then should be reallocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As recently as 28 November last, I met with the Commissioner to discuss a number of projects, including the peat station, and welcomed her continuing support for the project.  I remain confident that the time frame set down for the completion of the peat station during the latter half <Col N="404" /> of 2001 is achievable and will enable the full £21 million to be drawn down.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to speculate now as to whether or not the Luas funding will be reallocated, or on the impact of decisions which might or might not be made next year.</P>
      <P>The question of reallocating Structural Funds will be a matter for the Community Support Framework monitoring committee which includes representatives of the national authorities and the EU Commission, I understand that a CSF monitoring committee meeting has been scheduled for June 1998.  However, the review will commence in the spring as agreed by the CSF monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>Among the issues likely to be taken into account in the review will be the recommendations of the underground study, the likely implementation timetable for the light rail system, and the optimal use of the EU funding in the period to 2001.</P>
      <P>While the Commission has been kept informed of developments at various meetings with my officials and I have recently discussed the issue with Commissioner Wufl-Mathies, I have not had correspondence with the Commission on the matter.</P>

      <P>The EU Directive on Common Rules for the Development of the Internal Market of Community Postal Services and the improvement of Quality of Service was adopted at the Council <Col N="405" /> of Telecommunications Ministers meeting on 1 December, 1997.  The Directive was based on a draft agreed at the Telecommunications Council of 18 December, 1996.</P>
      <P>The directive requires member states to establish a national regulatory authority for the postal sector.  The framework within which the national regulatory authority will operate is set out in the directive.</P>
      <P>The directive will be published in the European Commission Official Journal in early 1998 and member states will have one year from the date of publication to transpose the directive into national law.  I am confident that the directive will be transposed into Irish law within that period.</P>

      <P>On 8 December, 1997 the EU Council of Ministers (Energy) reached agreement on a directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas.  The main thrust of the directive is to introduce competition into the natural gas industry in the form of third party access to gas networks in the European Union.  Consumers of large volumes of gas will have the choice of buying their gas supplies direct from gas undertakings as at present or of buying their gas from other suppliers and having the gas transmitted through the gas network for a fee.</P>
      <P>Provision for this form of competition has already been made in the Energy (Miscelleaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, and the necessary detailed operating and pricing rules are being developed.  The Act is broadly in line with the EU directive.</P>
      <P>At the insistence of Ireland and a number of other member states, provision has been made in the directive enabling member states to apply to the European Commission for temporary derogations to encourage investment in the development and extension of the gas network to areas in which no gas infrastructure has been established or has been established for less than ten years.  This provision is of relevance to areas, such as the midlands and west of Ireland, which have as yet no natural gas service.</P>

      <P>EU Directive (96/92/EC) concerning <Col N="411" /> the internal market in electricity came into force on 19 February 1997.  Ireland has to implement the directive by February 2000.  It requires that approximately 28 per cent of the Irish electricity market be opened to competition at that time, increasing to about 32 per cent by 2003.  This will allow independent electricity generators to contract directly with designated eligible customers (i.e. customers consuming above a specified threshold) for the supply of electricity.</P>
      <P>Article 14 of the directive provides, <i>inter alia</i>, the electricity undertakings, whatever their ownership and legal form, shall draw up, submit to audit and publish their annual accounts in accordance with the rules of national law concerning the accounts of limited liability companies. Undertakings which are not legally obliged to publish their annual accounts must keep a copy of these at the disposal of the public in their head office.  The directive also provides that integrated electricity undertakings shall, in their internal accounting, keep separate accounts for their generation, transmission and distribution activities, as they would be required to do if the activities in question were carried out by separate undertakings, with a view to avoiding discrimination, cross-subsidisation and distortion of competition. They are obliged to include a balance sheet and a profit and loss account of each activity in the notes to their accounts.</P>

      <Quest>if her Department will stand by its estimate that 93 per cent of total energy supply in this country will come from imported energy in view of the exceptional growth in demand; and her views on whether this poses a potential risk to the security of supply which can only be offset by investing in renewables.</Quest>

      <P>It is estimated that approx.  93 per cent of Ireland's primary energy requirements will be met from imported sources by 2010.  This will be due to declining indigenous sources of peat and natural gas which will be offset to some extent by increased penetration of renewable sources.  The development of nuclear energy, which would provide increased supply security, is not an option which the Government is prepared to consider.</P>
      <P>I am aware that an increased reliance on imported sources of energy has implications for security of supply.  However, in Ireland's case I do not consider that this is something to be unduly concerned about.  Security of supply is a central plank of our energy policy and I will continue to ensure that we have a prudent and diverse mix of energy sources, including renewable energy, and appropriate emergency measures.</P>

      <P>I have received no proposals for the amendment of the Act.  I should point out, however, that most of the functions in relation to the implementation of the Act are vested in the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The requirement in the legislation as far as health matters are concerned is that general information in this regard should be included in holiday brochures.  The Director's office has indicated that no representations have been received indicating that the information supplied to customers by travel firms on health matters is inadequate or incorrect.  However, should the Deputy have a particular concern about a specific tour operator, he should contact the Director's office who will investigate the matter.</P>

In view of the extent and nature of contracts awarded by the Geological Survey of Ireland, I have asked them to reply separately to the Deputy on the matter.</P>
      <P>Contracts awarded by bodies under the aegis of my Department are day-to-day matters for the bodies concerned and I have no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>In so far as future contracts are concerned, it may be necessary within the next twelve months to engage consultants to oversee a competition for new electricity generating capacity.  It is likely that such a contract would have a value in excess of £500,000 and it would be awarded by means of public tender.</P>

      <P>In the interests of transparency, all aspects of the competition for the new peat fired power station are being handled by independent consultants.  I am fully committed to this project and the process is being closely monitored, with direct reports to me on a weekly basis, to ensure that the timescale for the new station is adhered to.</P>
      <P>I understand that all five bidders have now submitted their bids to the independent consultants. I expect that the independent consultants' evaluation of those bids will be completed, and the winner identified by the independent consultants, early in the new year.  The next steps will be finalisation of the contract details.</P>
      <P>Once the contracts are finalised, the developer will have to obtain the planning permission and environmental consents necessary for the project. I understand from the independent consultants that the current schedule anticipates that the engineering and construction implementation of the project will commence early in 1999 and that the project will be completed by the end of 2001. The detailed schedule for project implementation will be a matter for the successful developer.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> The location of the station is also a matter for the successful bidder.  All bidders were made aware that Bord na Móna has a potential site at Clonbulloge.</P>

      <P>Environmental improvement works to enhance the appearance of the Curragh lands are in the process of completion.  Building and engineering projects for the Curragh Camp to the value of about £2 million commenced this year and will be completed in 1998.  These include upgrading of accommodation, boiler replacements, improvement to operational areas, painting, tarmacadam and an on-going energy-management programme. Tenders have been received in relation to a further project which will provide special storage facilities for equipment at the camp and it is hoped to place a contract shortly.  Further building projects at the camp are likely to be included in the 1998 programme which has yet to be finalised.</P>

      <Quest>if an overpayment for a person (details supplied) in County Wexford will be set aside in view of the fact that the beef premium, while being paid on females, was not actually paid in the form of suckler cow for the same animals; and if this will be equalised in order that no further deductions would be made from him.</Quest>

      <P>The person named applied for suckler cow premium on 16 cows in May 1996.  Following computer cross-checking of tagnumbers it was discovered that 11 of these animals were included in the special beef premium application of the person named submitted in November 1993.  A further three animals from the same herd were also applied on for special beef premium and these subsequently appeared in other herds and were confirmed as being suckler cows.  Therefore as the 14 animals in question are females and the special beef premium is confined to male animals only, the overpayments made under the special beef premium scheme will have to be recouped. This will be done directly from the person named or from other payments which fall to be made to him under Department livestock schemes.</P>

    <P>Expenditure under the OPARDF as a whole is ahead of target and £831 million, over 68 per cent of its allocation, had been expended by 30 November 1997.  In fact, a number of capital investment schemes have been closed for some time as all available funding has been fully committed. Following the recent mid-term review of the CSF, additional funding of 18 MECU from the food sub-programme was allocated to the OPARDF to cater for excess demand.  Extra Exchequer funding under the Supplementary Estimate for 1997 and again in the 1998 Estimates is being provided to meet matured liabilities.</P>
    <P>The reallocation of funds for the food sub-programme was due to the fact that the expenditure <Col N="422" /> under the capital investment element had been behind expectations.  This was attributable to the BSE-related difficulties in 1996 and the reticence of some project promoters to draw down funds on a phased basis.  Recently, expenditure under the capital investment measure has increased significantly. There is intense competition for the remaining funds under the measure.</P>

      <P>The CSF mid-term review package formally approved at the July 1997 meeting of the CSF monitoring committee includes provision for all lead Departments, implementing the CSF to examine the feasibility of greater private sector participation across all operational programmes and also a reduction in aid rates.  The agreement recognises, however, that there are inherent risks as well as practical difficulties in attempting to introduce fundamental changes over a relatively short period.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, an evaluation of training in the forestry area has recently been undertaken and the terms of reference included an examination of the possibility of involvement of the private sector in this area.

      <P>The area aid application of the person named is being processed and payments in respect of the 1997 cattle headage application of the person named will be made before Christmas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 1997 deseasonalisation slaughter premium application, the position is that the person named qualified for a payment of £180.27 in respect of the three animals applied for.  However, this sum was offset against an overpayment of £228.96 incurred under the 1996 BSE compensation top-up measure.  The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named had a lesser number of animals qualifying for special beef premium in 1996 than in 1995.  It was therefore necessary to recoup an overall amount of £228.96 of which the £180.27 recovered under the 1997 deseasonalisation slaughter premium formed a part.</P>

      <P>Under the current arrangements applicable under the disease eradication schemes, compensation rates for reactor cows and in calf heifers are calculated by reference, <i>inter alia</i>, to the notional average milk yield having regard to the number of cows in the herd and the certified milk gallonage supplied in the previous calendar year plus 5 per cent, to take account of milk used on the holding.  The number of cows at the reactor disclosure test or the number of cows at the most recent clear herd test in the previous calendar year is used, whichever is more advantageous to the herdowner.</P>
      <P>The grant arrangements are subject to ongoing review in consultation with the farming bodies.</P>
      <P>The herdowner in question had six reactors disclosed in a six month herd test on 28 October 1997.  Reactor grants were calculated using the milk yield for the previous calendar year 1996 which was 73,832 gallons plus 5 per cent, 3,691.60 gallons, giving a total of 77,523.60 gallons, which divided by the number of cows &mdash; 99 &mdash; on test resulted in a notional milk yield of 783.06 gallons. This places the herdowner in the &ldquo;Under 850 gallons&rdquo; category.  The appropriate grants have been paid to the herdowner.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for Public Services for 1997 provide for a contribution of £3 million from the banks towards the costs of providing secure escorts for cash transports.  The Department of Defence will receive £2.25 million of this to meet the additional costs of security escorts provided by the Army.  The balance of £750,000 is in respect of services provided by An Garda Síochána.  The current level of contribution was settled in 1995. Costs are monitored on an ongoing basis and the current level is deemed adequate, hence the provision in the 1998 Estimates of a similar contribution to that provided in 1997.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the programme is to support the monitoring, assessment and evaluation of the CSF, information and publicity in relation to the CSF and the EU activities of regional authorities. There have been underspends on all of the measures to date due to a combination of factors, including the late approval of the programme (July 1996) resulting in, among other things, the delayed establishment of the Structural Funds information office and the CSF evaluation unit. Reprogramming between measures will be necessary to take this into account and anticipated expenditure from 1998 onwards to provide for the engagement of consultants in the preparation of a plan for the next round of Structural Funds and to address new requirements in relation to financial control and monitoring of the CSF.</P>
      <P>The provision for monitoring progress on expenditure in the mid-term review will apply to the technical assistance OP.  A report will be prepared for the technical assistance OP monitoring committee in line with this requirement.  The mid-term review envisages that such reports would be produced for the OP and CSF monitoring committees to assist them to carry out their functions. Accordingly, it was not envisaged that such reports would be published.  The question of the making available of any such reports would be a matter for the relevant monitoring committee to decide.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information regarding the numbers and levels of <Col N="439" /> special savings accounts (SSAs) held by both persons under and over 66 years of age is not available to them.  However, data on SSA deposits, published in the Central Bank of Ireland Monthly Statistics, indicates that as of 30 September 1997 IR£4,400 million was on deposit in SSAs held by Irish residents.  Given the maximum amount that can be held is £50,000 per person, then at least 88,000 people hold accounts.</P>
      <P>SSAs were introduced in 1993 with a low rate of deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) to help prevent outflows of funds from the State following the liberalisation of exchange controls.  The rate of DIRT applying to SSAs will increase from 15 to 20 from 6 April next to strike a more appropriate balance between the tax treatment of deposit income and income from other sources.</P>
      <P>People aged 65 years or over (or people whose spouses qualify), and individuals who are unable to look after themselves due to permanent ill health are entitled to a refund of DIRT.  Refunds apply to the extent that the individuals would not otherwise be liable to tax on interest income.</P>

      <P>A personal assistance service, funded by an independent living fund or otherwise, is one of a range of support services for people with physical <Col N="446" /> and sensory disabilities which are designed to enable people with disabilities to live independently in the community.  Such services were reviewed by the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities which issued its report, Towards an Independent Future, in December 1996.  The report made recommendations for the development of the full range of these services, including personal assistance services.</P>
      <P>In addition to £3.688 million provided earlier this year for these services, this Government has, since taking office, provided £10 million for the purchase of aids and appliances for individuals with disabilities, the purchase of essential equipment and to help eliminate deficits accumulated by agencies providing services in the sector.</P>
      <P>A total of £8.4 million is being provided in 1998 for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Of this, £2.4 million in ongoing funding is being provided to help eliminate underfunding of existing services, £3 million for the development of services and £3 million for capital developments.  The priorities for the allocation of the £3 million development funding will be decided by each health board in consultation with the co-ordinating committee for physical/sensory disability services.  The amount to be allocated to personal assistance services will be decided as part of this process.</P>

Meetings are also being convened with other relevant groups, including <Col N="447" /> the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with a Mental Handicap, the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the 1998 competition for places on the nursing registration-diploma programmes, and for an associated recruitment drive, will be finalised following the completion of this consultative process.  A management consultants' report on the operations of the nursing application centres, which is expected shortly, will also be taken into account in this context.</P>
    <P>I will be making a full announcement regarding student nurse recruitment early in the new year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200, 201 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>My Department receives funds under the Community Support Framework for the training of people with disabilities, under the human resources operational programme (HROP), and for the Tallaght Hospital building project.</P>
      <P>1.  Training of People with Disabilities</P>
      <P>These funds are targeted at the training of people with disabilities and are allocated over the six years of the programme (1994 to 1999).  As with any complex programme from time to time various alterations in planned expenditure are introduced to ensure efficacy.  Any deferrals concerning the scheduling of expenditures are reported to the monitoring committee of the HROP (on which my Department is represented) for its consideration and approval.</P>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board monitors, co-ordinates and disburses European Social Funds allocated under the HROP to my Department. These funds are channelled through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Health boards co-ordinate and disburse the European Regional Development Funds allocated under the HROP to my Department; these are channelled through the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The delivery of training for people with disabilities under the HROP is provided by specialised agencies.  Both the NRB and the health boards have procedures in place to co-ordinate the expenditure of funds in an efficient and effective manner.  The analysis of the benefit or outcome of expenditure under the OP is ongoing and forms part of the co-ordination of activities funded under the programme.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment intend to report to the monitoring committee as soon as possible, the scope for implementing changes in pursuit of greater cost recovery and for more competition in the delivery of services in the HROP.</P>
      <P>2.  Tallaght Hospital</P>
      <P>The Tallaght Hospital building project is supported by CSF funding, via the Department of Finance.  Tenders were sought using single stage restricted tender procedures.  The process was subject to, and complied with, the relevant European Union Directives.</P>
      <P>Effective and efficient procedures are employed to control the costs of the project through to final completion.</P>

      <P>National programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer are currently being developed as part of the initiatives taken under the national cancer strategy.  A vital requirement of screening programmes is that they be effective in identifying accurately the existence of the relevant disease.  The expert advice available to me is that, while screening programmes for breast cancer and cervical cancer in targeted age groups have been proven to be medically effective, no such screening programme has yet been developed in the case of prostate cancer.</P>
      <P>I will keep the scope for introducing a screening programme for prostate cancer under review in the light of the expert advice available and international developments in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses.  The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change it or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  This scheme was introduced subsequent to the publication of the report of the Commission on Health Funding. Under the drugs refund scheme which covers <Col N="451" /> expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions such as asthma.</P>

      <P>The main day services available to persons with a mild mental handicap include generic and special vocational training, sheltered work centre (including long-term training schemes), sheltered employment, supported employment and open employment.  Where people with a mild mental handicap have special needs, are elderly or have physical and sensory disabilities, they may also avail of other services such as activation or adult day centres, programmes for the elderly, high support day service or intensive day services. Many people with a mild mental handicap do not wish to avail of training or employment services provided by the health services, and instead prefer to avail of the generic training services and mainstream employment opportunities which are <Col N="452" /> available to the public.  Increasingly, the provision of training and employment for persons with a mild mental handicap is being seen as a function of the services provided by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Adults with a mild mental handicap do not usually avail of residential services, except where they have special needs, such as physical or sensory disabilities.  Where applicable, the type of services available include five day or seven day community group homes and five day or seven day residential centres.  A small number of people are in intensive placements, psychiatric hospitals or nursing homes.  The Needs and Abilities Report (1990) recommended that adults with a mild mental handicap who have psychiatric conditions should avail of the generic services and consequently persons in this category avail of the same psychiatric services as other members of the public.</P>
      <P>Services available to adults with a mild mental handicap cover a wide range of headings, depending on the specific needs of the individual. As such, they are not costed separately.  However, revenue funding of £150.245 million overall was allocated directly by my Department in 1997 for services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>

      <P>In total there are 40 boards under my Department's aegis involving 752 positions.  The members currently serving on these boards, with their term of office, are as set out below. Arrangements for selection of board members vary considerably.  In the case of some boards (e.g. health boards, An Bord Altranais) the majority of members are elected representatives. In other cases the nominating bodies for certain members are laid down by statute (e.g. Tallaght Hospital Board, St. James's Hospital Board).  In further cases it has been the practice to consult appropriate organisations and following such consultations draw up a list of persons suitable for appointment (e.g. Comhairle na nOspidéal, Beaumont Hospital Board, Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board).</P>
      <P>The Deputy should understand that in nominating any board under the aegis of my Department the needs of the board itself are taken into account and I have consulted widely before making nominations even where no procedure is laid down.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he/she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board concerning the person mentioned and have been informed that the health board has no record of having received a medical card application in this case.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to above the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and my Department is currently making the necessary arrangements to advance this review with the health boards.</P>

      <P>I have allocated £1.5 million in 1998 to enable Longford/Westmeath General Hospital to be commissioned.  The exact details of the grades of staff involved will be a matter for discussion between the Midland Health Board and my Department, but I anticipate that in wholetime equivalent terms, approximately 80 staff will be required when the new facilities are fully operational. The Midland Health Board has commenced the process of selecting and recruiting staff for the facilities.  I am anxious that the development be commissioned as early as possible in 1998 and the Midland Health Board is taking all possible steps to achieve this.</P>
      <P>The new x-ray and accident and emergency departments will be a critical element of the new facilities and the Midland Health Board will move to commission them as soon as the necessary staff are in place.</P>

      <P>The Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with A Mental Handicap 1997-2001 was published earlier this year and is based on information from the National Intellectual Disability Database.  The assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places over the next five years.  As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Plan for the Millenium the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in that assessment.</P>
      <P>To this end, additional funding of £16 million is being provided in 1998 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  This includes additional revenue funding of £7 million which I announced in the budget for the provision of new residential-respite and day places and £3.75 million which was provided in the Estimates for 1998 to strengthen the existing services.</P>
      <P>Sustained capital investment is needed to support these developments.  I recently announced the establishment of a £30 million capital programme to develop mental handicap services including day, residential and respite places for persons who have been assessed as in need of such places.  As part of this programme £5.25 million capital funding is being provided in 1998.</P>
      <P>Total additional spending on services for persons with physical and sensory disabilities in 1998 is £8.40 million.  This will enable much needed development of these services to proceed in line with the recommendations of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, £3 million was announced in the budget for development of new services.  This will facilitate priority developments such as the creation of additional respite care and day care places, additional home supports, including personal assistance services and the appointment of additional therapists, such as occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists.  A sum of £2.4 million has been allocated in the 1998 Estimates and this is expected to eliminate ongoing deficits in the bigger agencies.  Putting the funding of existing services on a firm footing is essential to providing a sound foundation for the development of new services.  A capital programme of £3 million is also being put in place.</P>
      <P>Taken together, total Government additional funding on disability services in 1998 will be £24.45 million.  This represents a major commitment to developing services to people with disabilities.</P>

However, I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities regarding this matter and I have been advised that the average waiting time on the waiting list for prostrate operations at the hospital is up to one year.  I understand that a total of 168 prostrate operations were carried out at the hospital during the first six months of 1997.</P>
      <P>With regard to the patient referred to by the Deputy, I understand that his next appointment is scheduled for 21 January 1998, subject to bed availability at that time I should stress that the scheduling of admission of individual patients to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and is determined solely on the basis of medical priority.  Should this patient feel that his condition has deteriorated, he should return to his general practitioner, who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case to the consultant directly.</P>

      <P>The following is the text of paragraph 13.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health board may pay a subvention in respect of a person whom it has determined as qualifying for a subvention in a nursing home in Northern Ireland which is a nursing home registered by a health and social services board.  &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this, in effect, means is that if an elderly person living in, say County Leitrim, is approved for a subvention by the North-Western Health Board, he-she may use that subvention for care in a nursing home situated in Northern Ireland, provided that the home is registered with the Northern Ireland authorities.  The converse of this is that a person normally resident in Northern Ireland who needs nursing home care, should <Col N="474" /> apply to the Northern Ireland authorities for assistance.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of psychological services for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science.  I understand that the Deputy has recently received information from my colleague the Minister for Education and Science on the <Col N="475" /> question of criteria for referrals and the procedures for initiating referrals.</P>
      <P>As the psychological services provided by the Department of Education and Science to primary schools is at present limited to a small number of schools, the health boards currently provide a service for many of the school children in this age group, including those in County Westmeath on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Midland Health Board that psychological services are provided by either the board or the Sisters of Charity Services in the following cases:</P>
      <P>a service is provided to children with moderate and severe mental handicap who are in special schools or special classes;</P>
      <P>a psychological assessment service is provided to identify children with mental handicap;</P>
      <P>psychological services to secondary schools are provided on an informal and <i>ad-hoc</i> basis;</P>
      <P>psycho-educational assessment services are provided in conjunction with the Child Guidance Clinic;</P>
      <P>psychological assessment of children is carried out as part of the assessment for suitability for language classes;</P>

      <P>liaison with schools on specific issues regarding individual children who are involved in treatment programmes.</P>
      <P>initiation of all appropriate emergency assessments within the foregoing parameters.</P>
      <P>Difficulties in the recruitment of appropriate staff to provide these services have contributed to delays in the services in County Westmeath, but the board anticipates that in the near future with the appointment of additional staff, these delays will be considerably reduced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out the number of attendances at casualty (accident and emergency) Departments in public hospitals in the period 1992 to 1997.</P>
      <P>A charge for out-patient services was introduced in 1987 under powers conferred on the Minister by section 5 of the Health Act, 1947, and section 56 of the Health Act, 1970, as substituted by section 1 of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1987.  From 1987 to 1993 the charge for attendance at casualty (accident and emergency) departments was set at £10 per episode of care. In March 1993 the charge was levied at £6 per visit subject to a maximum charge of £42 in any period of 12 consecutive months.  The charge was changed again in March 1994 to £12 for the first consultation in any episode of care for persons attending the accident and emergency department directly, without having a referral note from their general practitioner.  This charge has now been increased to £20 effective from 1 January 1998 on the same basis.</P>
      <P>The charge applies only to those attending the accident and emergency department without referral from their general practitioner and only to the first consultation in any episode of care. There are a number of exemptions from the charge including medical card holders and their dependants, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks, children suffering from prescribed diseases and children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that income from the accident and emergency charge in 1997 was of the order of £1.7 million.  On the basis that attendance at accident and emergency departments remains the same as 1997 the estimated increase in income for 1998 is expected to be in the region of £1.15 million.</P>
      <P>In relation to the matters of the accident and emergency treatment fees paid, numbers who did not pay and the amount collected in each year, I am not in a position to supply the Deputy with details as the audited financial statements, as submitted to my Department, do not provide this type of analysis.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services at Mallow General Hospital and the determination of priorities for the development of the hospital are matters for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>In this context, in response to the board's priorities, my Department has in recent years provided significant additional capital funding for the development of out-patient, laboratory and physiotherapy facilities as well as the upgrading of the in-patient accommodation and lift in the hospital.  My Department is liaising with the Southern Health Board to ensure that the hospital continues to play a full and effective role in the provision of healthcare to the population of its catchment area.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the notifications of the numbers of infectious diseases received by my Department it is not possible to indicate with certainty in respect of any particular disease how or where a patient has contracted it.</P>
      <P>However, in respect of cases of malaria notified (nine cases in 1995 and 14 cases in 1996) it is probable that all the cases were contracted abroad.</P>
      <P>In relation to hepatitis B and HIV infection, these conditions can be contracted in any country in the world, including Ireland, and it is not possible to identify separately what, if any, proportion of cases have been contracted abroad.  Eleven cases of viral hepatitis type B were notified in 1995 and ten cases in 1996.  The number of new AIDS cases reported in 1995 was 55 and in 1996 the total reported was 79.</P>

      <P>The identification of geographic areas where uptake of immunisation may be low is a matter for individual health boards.  The reference in my reply of 4 November was to the existence of the provision whereby health boards have the option of making special arrangements for such areas if they deem this appropriate.  I am not aware that any health board has established special clinics on the lines referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will be able to have urgent open heart surgery; the steps, if any, he is taking to deal with the lack of adequate facilities in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin 12 for heart surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, which serves as the national referral centre for paediatric heart disease, has experienced an increase in the numbers of children awaiting cardio-thoracic surgery within the last year.  This additional demand has resulted in extra pressure on the service and an increased waiting time for some patients.</P>
      <P>The increased pressure in cardiac services has been the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and the hospital for some time.  The reasons for this increased pressure were identified as the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and the advances in surgical and interventional techniques which have resulted in increased demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> In April 1997 my Department invited proposals from the hospital for the spending of £500,000 to be made available from the 1997 waiting list initiative to alleviate the pressures on this specialty.  Proposals submitted by the hospital were accepted by my Department and funding was provided to support them.  The hospital recently forwarded a progress report on the initiative which stated that:</P>
    <P>&mdash; since the appointment of a locum consultant paediatrician the hospital has experienced an increase in its cardiology out-patient's activity and in the number of echocardiograms performed, the combination of both these factors will result in an additional 545 procedures being carried out in 1997;</P>
    <P>&mdash; building works on four additional ICU beds commenced in July and that it is expected that these works will be completed shortly, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; an additional training programme for ICU nurses commenced in September and six candidates have been selected for participation.</P>
    <P>A project team (consisting of officials from my Department and hospital representatives) is currently working on a development plan for the provision of additional theatres at the hospital.  I have asked that this work be concluded as a matter of urgency so that the hospital can proceed to the next stage of this very important development.</P>
    <P>The question of additional consultant manpower is being considered in the context of the current review of the further development of cardiac services generally.</P>
    <P>I am confident that all these initiatives will have a positive impact on the service levels of this speciality in the near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular case raised by the Deputy, I understand from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, that the person in question is on the waiting list for cardiac surgery. The hospital is not in a position at present to give a date of admission and the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority. The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>

Since a full range of public maternity services are available entirely free of charge to all women, the medical card status of the mother is not directly relevant in the context of service provision.

      <P>I am aware that the maternity hospitals are experiencing an increase in obstetric activity in the current year.  The increase in the birth rate is at variance with earlier predictions which forecast a levelling out in the number of births in the years from 1996 onwards.  This increase in the number of births together with an increase in the requirements for related services, for example, post operative complications, epidurals, paediatric follow up, has placed additional pressure on maternity hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I recently allocated an additional £1 million to maternity hospitals to enable them to cope with <Col N="484" /> this year's increased obstetric activity.  Health boards and voluntary hospitals have recently been notified of their financial determination for 1998 and are now in the course of preparing service plans for the coming year.  The level of service to be provided within the financial determination will be the subject of early discussion with health agencies on submission of these service plans.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that I am committed to the provision of a quality maternity service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233, 234 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>Smoking prevalence in Ireland has fallen substantially over the past 20 years and my Department is committed to continuing this trend.  This will be effected primarily by way of a combination of health promotion and regulatory measures to advertising, sponsorship and restrictions on smoking in certain public places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department continues to target young people in particular as is evident from the Health Promotion Unit's most recent multi-media antismoking campaign, &ldquo;Say what you like &mdash; smoking kills&rdquo;.  This campaign used a degree of dark humour to encourage smokers to question their reasons for smoking, encouraging them to quit the habit and used television, radio, outdoor and print advertising.  Results of an evaluation of the campaign suggest an encouragingly high level of awareness of the message.  However, it is important to recognise that even the most creative multi-media campaign cannot, by itself, dissuade people from smoking or encourage smokers to quit.  It is only through a concerted effort involving both statutory and non-statutory groups with an interest in this area that a reduction in the incidence of smoking can be achieved. Accordingly initiatives such as this form part of an ongoing, wider programme to reduce smoking prevalence.  These efforts include joint initiatives with the health boards and voluntary organisations <Col N="485" /> such as the Irish Cancer Society which seeks to prevent people from taking up smoking in the first place.</P>
    <P>Examples of this process as it applies to young people can be seen in my Department's two schools programmes.  The smoking reduction action programme (SCRAP) is a peer-led antismoking programme for schools which was developed by the Department of Health in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, the National Youth Federation and with support from the Department of Education.  Materials were distributed on a widespread basis in 1995 for use as support resources in the junior classes in secondary schools.  The &ldquo;Smoke-busters&rdquo; project was developed by the Irish Cancer Society, the Departments of Health and Education and the Eastern Health Board.  It is aimed at primary school children (11 years) in an urban environment.</P>
    <P>Stopping smoking is one of the most immediate and worthwhile contributions anyone can make to the improvement of health, both on an individual and on a collective level.  Obviously, preventing young people from taking up smoking is preferable and my Department will continue its work in this area.  It is essential that the downward trend in the incidence of smoking continues and my Department is working to ensure this decline persists through a combination of health education, health promotion and legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The diagnosis, assessment and treatment of attention deficit disorder normally falls within the area of responsibility of the child and adolescent psychiatric services in each health board.  The relevant clinical staff attached to these services would have access to the information available on the disorder.  It is a matter for each health board in association with the senior clinical staff to <Col N="487" /> decide what information programmes are required in their respective health board areas.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any health board referring any child abroad for the diagnosis or treatment of attention deficit disorder in the last five years. However, it is understood that one child may have travelled overseas for treatment in a private capacity.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of persons under and over 18 years of age who have been diagnosed for the first time as suffering from attention deficit disorder is not readily available and is currently being collated.

      <P>Information on numbers waiting to attend the breast clinic is not routinely collected by my Department.  I have asked the hospital to respond directly to the Deputy regarding waiting times.  I understand that the procedure for women wishing to make an appointment for a mammogram at St. Vincent's is to first send in their GP's referral letter to the X-ray department of the hospital where it is assessed by a consultant radiologist who decides on the urgency of the case. When this assessment is complete, appointments are then posted out to patients.  The waiting time for appointments for urgent cases is January 1998 and September 1998 for non-urgent cases.  I would advise that if a patient is concerned at the length of time which she has to wait, then she should return to her GP who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case with the consultant radiologist concerned.</P>

      <P>In a letter dated 18 June, 1996 from this Department to the Southern Health Board it was stated that a total capital sum of £94,000 was available in 1996 for day care centres about to be built at Bandon and Midleton, i.e. £94,000 between the two.</P>
      <P>This arrangement was superseded by a departmental letter dated 27 June 1997 which stated that a total of £160,000 capital funding was available in 1997 for the two above-mentioned projects, with £100,000 being specified for Midleton and £60,000 for Bandon.  It was given to understand that the funding would be released to the voluntary group in Midleton, via the Southern Health Board, as soon as receipts/invoices for work done had been submitted.  To date none of this funding has been drawn down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 245 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's climate change policy, with the aim of meeting its commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), operates within the framework of overall EU policy to stabilise CO 2 emissions in the EU as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000.  In this context, the national CO 2 abatement strategy is based on the objective of limiting CO 2 emissions to 20 per cent above 1990 levels by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Nineteen-ninety baseline data for greenhouse gas emissions (excluding HFCs, PFCs and SF 6 for which data are not yet available) are contained in Ireland's Second National Communication under the UN FCCC, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  In order to limit the increase in emissions, a range of policies and measures have been put in place to improve general levels of efficiency in energy production and consumption. These include energy efficiency and conservation measures in the industrial, residential, commercial and institutional sectors as well as improving the efficiency of, and reducing the level of carbon intensity in, electricity production and managing growth in electricity demand.  The range of policies and measures is discussed in Ireland's Second National Communication.  A consultancy study to identify and evaluate the scope for intensifying existing, and developing additional policies and measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> As far as the transport sector is concerned, the communication refers to measures being taken to improve the efficiency of the road and rail networks, to promote public transport and other alternatives to the private car in major urban areas (including Dublin), and to reduce the age profile and increase the fuel efficiency of private cars.  It describes the DTI Strategy for Dublin which, when fully implemented, will secure a significant shift towards the use of public transport in the area.</P>
    <P>As part of the preparation of the EU's negotiating position, in advance of the Third Conference of the Parties to the UN FCCC, which proposed that developed countries should, individually or jointly, reduce emissions of CO 2, CH 4 and N2O together by 15 per cent by 2010 compared to 1990 levels, the Government adopted an indicative national target of limiting the increase in the emissions of these three gases together to 15 per cent above the 1990 level by the year 2010. The internal EU burden sharing arrangement, to which the indicative national target relates, will require review in the light of the terms of the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>Future policy development in relation to climate change, including aspects relating to transport, will take into account, <i>inter alia,</i> the Kyoto Protocol, developments at EU level and the conclusions of the consultancy study to which I have already referred.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246, 247, 248 and 249 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is the lead Department for the Transport and Environmental Services Operational Programmes, although other Departments are responsible for certain measures assisted under these OPs.  The urban and village renewal sub-programme of the Local Urban and Rural Development OP also comes within the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>Details of the different measures to be assisted, including the financing arrangements and implementing agencies, are set out in the various OPs, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  In so far as measures for which my Department is responsible are concerned, EU aid receipts are remitted directly to the Exchequer, with the exception of small amounts of FEOGA aid which are brought to account as appropriations-in-aid under my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>In general, progress on the measures for which my Department is responsible is satisfactory. With the exception of the waste management sub-programme under the Environmental Services OP, any underspend which has occurred has been minor in the context of overall OP spending, and should be made good over the remainder of the CSF period.  The Mid-Term Review of the Community Support Framework 1994-99 (CSF) recommended the re-allocation of 8 mecu of aid from the waste management sub-programme of the environmental services OP and the addition of aid of 26 mecu to the national roads programme, and this has been taken into account in formulating my Department's Estimates for 1998 and the relevant &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; projection for 1999.  Funding for the waste management sub-programme was reduced due to the fact that arrangements to mobilise this sub-programme took longer than originally anticipated.  The sub-programme focused on new actions, for which national legislation and policy were being developed when the OP was approved, and which required consultation with or approval from the EU Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Regular progress reports on all measures are provided to the relevant monitoring committees and annual reports are prepared in respect of OPs.  The question of publication of reports prepared for and by the individual OP monitoring committees is a matter for decision by those committees.</P>
    <P>While the specific criticisms advanced by the CSF evaluator in relation to cost benefit analyses were not directed at measures for which my Department is responsible, I accept fully that we should aspire to secure the best possible value for money from all public and EU assisted spending. The Mid-Term Review of the CSF notes that the CSF evaluation unit will finalise its draft paper on cost benefit analysis to address certain concerns of the CSF evaluator regarding the quality of such analyses.  I understand that the unit will be issuing guidelines in the matter for the benefit of Departments and implementing agencies; these will be taken into account, as appropriate, in relation to EU co-financed programmes for which my Department is responsible.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Term Review of the CSF acknowledges the CSF evaluator's recommendations in regard to greater recourse to cost recovery and competition in the delivery of services.  It goes on to recognise that there are inherent risks, as well as practical difficulties, in attempting to introduce fundamental changes over a short period of time.</P>
    <P>It seems clear that both the CSF Mid-Term Review itself and the CSF evaluator's report do not focus on measures under my Department's remit in the context of encouraging greater competition in service provision.  Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the private sector, through the competitive tendering process, already undertakes construction of the roads and water-waste water services infrastructure which accounts for by far the greatest part of my Department's structural fund spending.  The concept of procuring projects on a design-build-operate basis has been introduced into the waste water services programme already, and this option will be kept under review in relation to other programmes also.</P>
    <P>As far as cost recovery is concerned, the Mid-Term Review highlights the importance of carrying out a study on road pricing.  I refer to the answer to Question No. 250 on today's Order Paper in this regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to Question No. 246, I am unclear as to what grants and what operational programme the Deputy is referring to.  If clarification can be provided on this, I will be pleased to provide the information required.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the position adopted by the European Commission concerning the grant of assistance under the Cohesion Fund in respect of the waste baling facility at Ballymount, County Dublin.  It is a matter for the local authorities concerned in the first instance to address the issue raised by the Commission.  Having regard to the polluter pays principle and the principle of producer responsibility, Exchequer funding is not available in respect of waste disposal infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The interpretation of the law in relation to the application of the principle of subsidiarity is a matter for the courts.</P>

      <P>Under new arrangements introduced with effect from 1 January 1996 the costs incurred by licensing authorities in the administration of the motor taxation system, including driver licensing etc., are met by the authorities by deduction from the gross proceeds of the tax.  A total of £17.48 million was retained by licensing authorities towards these costs in 1996 of which £3.48 million was in respect of sums owed to authorities under the previous recoupment system (which consisted of payments by my Department quarterly in arrears).  The expected outturn for operating costs in 1997 is £16 million.</P>
      <P>The gross amount collected by licensing authorities in respect of motor tax (and including driver licence duties etc.) to the end of November 1997 was £276.6 million.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, prohibit cycling either wholly or partly along a footway except for the purpose of access to or egress from a place adjacent to the footway.  An exception to this requirement is made where a cycle track is provided on part of a footway, in which case cyclists must only use the cycle track.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to promote cycling as a sustainable form of transport and to create safer conditions for cycling having regard to all necessary uses of the public road system.  With this in view, my Department is circulating to all local authorities a national manual on the provision of cycling facilities which has been prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office.  My Department is also reviewing those elements of road traffic regulations which relate to the provision of cycle facilities.</P>

    <P>*The Local Government (An Comhairle Leabharlanna) Regulations, 1997, which were made on 15 December 1997 have made a number of changes to the nominating bodies to An Comhairle Leabharlanna.  The Higher Education Authority will now nominate the three members heretofore nominated by Dublin, Cork and Galway Universities.  Trinity College will now nominate one member only while the Library Association of Ireland's representation has been increased from one member to two.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the inadequacy and over bureaucratic nature of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 drawn up by his Department in relation to Article 38 of these regulations which forbids parking of heavy goods vehicles in residential areas; the current situation in relation to the level and extent of signage required in this regard; if he will change the regulations to that originally requested by Dublin Corporation where the problem most manifests itself to allow for a blanket ban on the parking of large vehicles in the city apart from areas designated for such purpose and indicated by signage.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 38 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, empowers road authorities to prohibit the parking of large vehicles in specified areas, following an approach applied to selective parking restrictions and prohibitions generally.  The article provides that where a no parking sign, accompanied by an information plate containing the symbol of a large vehicle and indicating a specified unladen weight, is in place, a vehicle which exceeds that unladen weight cannot be parked; this prohibition continues until a traffic sign is encountered indicating that the prohibition has ended.</P>
      <P>It is not yet possible to assess the effectiveness of particular provisions of the new regulations, which came into operation on 1 October 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> My Department will however keep the operation of traffic regulations under ongoing review.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Act, 1994, provides for the repeal of the nineteenth century legislation governing the establishment of urban district councils.  It is the aim to bring forward legislation next year for the modernisation of local government law generally. This will include a modern statutory framework for local authority structures with provision for the creation of new local authorities.  Any proposals for change in the status of current authorities will have to be considered within the framework of proposed legislation.</P>

    <P>In addition, there are other specific provisions relating to the board.  Under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1997, the board is obliged to keep itself informed of the policies and objectives of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, of planning authorities and of any other public authority whose functions have, or may have, a bearing on planning and development. Under section 7 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982, the board must have regard to any general directives as to policy in relation to planning and development issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under that section.  Under section 7(3) of the 1982 Act and section 23 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1983, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is prohibited from exercising any power or control in relation to particular cases with which the board may be concerned.

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 19 October 1996.  He was on a community employment scheme from 1 November 1996 to 17 October 1997 and commenced his course of study on 22 September 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the work of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion relating to the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS).  The committee held its first meeting in October but the Deputy will be aware that matters pertaining to the Cabinet Committee itself are confidential.</P>
      <P>However, in so far as the NAPS is concerned, there has been significant progress in relation to this strategy.  The priority for this year has been to establish the institutional structures required to implement the strategy.  A NAPS unit was established in my Department to co-ordinate its implementation.</P>
      <P>The NAPS Inter-Departmental Policy Committee (IDPC), which was set up to oversee the formulation of the strategy, has met three times since April.  This committee is comprised of senior officers who have responsibility for ensuring that the NAPS provisions relevant to their Departments are implemented.  The issues which have been considered to date by the committee include the need for social auditing of policies and the future role of the social partners in the NAPS.</P>
      <P>Liaison officers have been appointed in key Departments to fill a communication and co-ordination role.  The unit has met with liaison officers on an individual basis to discuss the preparation of Departmental &lsquo;baseline documents&rsquo; based on social inclusion commitments set out in the NAPS, An Action Programme for the Millennium, and Partnership 2000.  In addition, Departments are in the process of drawing up workplans for 1998, setting down objectives and targets in relation to the NAPS for the year.</P>
      <P>Initial meetings have taken place with representatives of the seven core-funded anti-poverty networks to commence a round of consultation about the future role the voluntary and community sector will play in the NAPS.  Preliminary discussions with the Department of the Environment and Local Government have also taken place to discuss the important role of local authorities in the NAPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> An information and public education strategy is being drawn up with the aim of promoting public discussion and understanding of the value of a national anti-poverty strategy and highlighting the contribution that anti-poverty initiatives can make to improving the social, economic, political and cultural life of society.  The Combat Poverty Agency (CPA) plays a key role in the NAPS and is represented on the NAPS Inter-Departmental Policy Committee.  The agency is responsible for overseeing an evaluation of the process on behalf of the IDPC.</P>
    <P>In addition, the CPA will provide support, in an advisory capacity, to individual Departments and local and/or regional structures on the development of anti-poverty strategies.  The CPA will be particularly called upon to advise on anti-poverty strategies in the context of the local government reform process.</P>

      <P>Voluntary and community groups play an important role in improving the quality of the lives of people by helping them to develop the capacity to change their situation for the better.  My Department, recognising the importance of this role, supports local self-help and community development initiatives. The programmes operated by my Department to assist local community development include the Community Development Programme (CDP), family resource centres, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) the core-funded programme for women's groups and networks, and the once-off schemes of grants to voluntary organisations, locally-based women's groups, locally based men's groups, lone parent groups, and more recently the community development education and training grant scheme and scheme of community support for older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the need to ensure the effectiveness of these initiatives and their ability to reach those most in need of the Department's support under these schemes.  The Department has, on a number of occasions, engaged independent consultants to undertake reviews of the various schemes and programmes.  A review of the pilot <Col N="516" /> scheme of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service took place in 1993 and in 1997 reviews of the family resource centres, the scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups, and the scheme of grants to locally-based men's groups were carried out.  Reports on each of these reviews have been published.</P>
    <P>The findings and recommendations of these reviews serve to inform policy in relation to the management and targeting of these schemes. There are also plans to review this scheme of community support for older people, the community development programme and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service over the next year or so as resources allow.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the community development initiatives supported by my Department is to help people develop the confidence and the capacity to participate as partners alongside statutory agencies and others in local development initiatives. To be eligible for funding under the various programmes, groups must subscribe to self-help, community development ethos and must involve the intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project.  I do not accept that the operation of these schemes by my Department runs the risk of perpetuating an attitude of dependence as suggested by the Deputy.  There are clear and objective criteria in place for each category of funding and an open and transparent application process for the grants schemes.  The manner in which the CDP and MABS Programmes are managed allows for consultation with a diverse range of groups and real participation by funded projects in policy-making.</P>
    <P>Under the community development programme and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, national advisory committees have been established to advise on the development of these programmes.  The membership of these committees is drawn from a range of interests, among which are the support agencies, the Combat Poverty Agency, Area Development Management (ADM) and local projects in the case of the Community Development Programme Committee and the Combat Poverty Agency, health boards, workers of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the NSSB, in the case of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  These committees give an opportunity for people working at local level to have an input into these programmes. The current arrangements facilitate a high degree of coherence that results from being part of a national programme and the networking and transfer of lessons and experience across all projects in the programme.  Applications under the once-off grant schemes are made initially to the Department's regional offices.  This approach ensures that applications are assessed by officers at regional level with local knowledge who can make direct contact with local and voluntary community groups.</P>

      <P>The 1997 budget, which was announced on 22 January 1997, provided for <Col N="518" /> a £3 increase in the maximum weekly personal rates of all social welfare payments, with proportionate increases in reduced rate contributory payments.</P>
      <P>The 1998 budget, which was announced on 3 December 1997, provided for an increase of £5 in the maxium weekly personal rates for all old age and related pensions, with proportionate increases for reduced rate contributory pensions. The 1998 budget also provides for an increase of £3 in the maximum weekly personal rates of all other social welfare payments, with proportionate increases for reduced rate contributory payments. The qualified audit allowance will be increased by 3 per cent in general.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a non-contributory social assistance payment a person must satisfy a means test. Where a person does not have any means, the maximum rate of payment is paid.  However, where there are means, the amount payable is the difference between the maximum rate of payment and the level of the person's weekly means. Accordingly, where the maximum weekly rate of a social assistance payment is increased by, say, £5, then all recipients of that payment will receive the £5 increase.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is over the age of 66 and in receipt of a widow's (non-contributory) pension at a reduced rate because of means.  Her pension will, therefore, be increased by £5 from the beginning of June 1998.</P>
      <P>The increases provided for in the 1998 budget will benefit 890,000 social welfare recipients. Approximately 270,000 pensioners aged 66 and over will have their payments increased by £5 a week, with some 54,000 people on reduced rate contributory pensions receiving proportionate increases.

      <P>The funding allocated to my Department from the national lottery is used to fund the community development programme, rather than the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, which is funded from ordinary Exchequer sources.  The allocation for the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations for 1998 is £1.07 million.  As already announced, this scheme, along some of the other schemes operated by my Department, will form part of an integrated fund of once-off grants for pro-active support of community development and family support groups. These once-off grants will complement the programme funding available from my Department for the community development programme, for family and community services resource centres and for marriage and family counselling services.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that applications for once-off grants under this heading will be invited in the national press in January 1998, with a closing date in March 1998.  Applications will be processed as soon as possible after the closing date.</P>

      <P>The Men's Networking Resource Centre applied earlier this year to my Department for inclusion in the community development programme.  This application was unsuccessful as the focus of the CDP is on the funding of local resource centres and not on national networks of groups.</P>
      <P>The organisation was informed of the position by letter from my Department.  However, the letter also indicated that the group could apply for funding under the Department's schemes of grants to locally-based men's groups and to voluntary organisations and they have done so on a number of occasions.  The group was allocated grants of £5,000 in 1996 and £4,250 in 1997 under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and a further £4,500 in 1997 under the scheme of grants to locally-based men's groups.</P>

      <P>To qualify for payment under the various benefit, pension and allowance schemes administered by my Department, applicants must satisfy a number of statutory conditions which include the need to claim in time. In the case of old age contributory pension, a claim must be made in the period commencing three months before and ending three months after the person's 66th birthday.  Where a claim is not made within this period, the person is disqualified for receipt of payment in respect of any period more than 12 months before the date on which the claim is made.  Prior to 1 January 1997, the disqualification applied in respect of any period more than six months before the date of claim.  Section 32 of the Social Welfare Act, 1997, provided for 12 months back-dating in respect of claims made after that date.  This section also provides <Col N="523" /> power to make regulations which will extend the periods for which claims to which the section applies may be back-dated in certain circumstances. The drafting of these regulations is at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly.  The regulations will be laid before or each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made in accordance with the relevant legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years different methods of assessing the value of capital, including savings, have been applied to the various social assistance schemes.  However, more recently the process of standardising the assessment of capital across the different social assistance schemes has been initiated, so as to improve the equity of the system.  The introduction of the disability allowance scheme in October 1996 and the one-parent family payment scheme in January 1997 presented the opportunity to commence this process.  Under the new assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1997 provided for a further extension of the revised capital assessment provisions to the old age (non-contributory) pension and pre-retirement allowance schemes, as well as to the widow's and widow's (non-contributory) pension, orphan's (non-contributory) pension and carer's allowance schemes, with effect from 17 October, 1997.</P>
      <P>This means, for instance, that recipients of pre-retirement allowance can now have capital of up to £3,386 and still qualify for the maximum rate of the allowance, while they can have up to £35,575 and still qualify for a minimum payment.</P>
      <P>The process of standardising the assessment of capital across all of the social assistance schemes has been continued with the extension, in the 1998 budget, of the revised arrangements to recipients of the rent allowance for tenants affected by the decontrol of rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The differences in the methods of calculating means are not confined to the assessment of capital alone.  There are also different disregards which apply to the various social assistance schemes.  For example, the first £6 of means is <Col N="524" /> disregarded for the purposes of the old age (non-contributory) pension, while the first £2 of means is disregarded in the case of the pre-retirement allowance.  The further extension of the revised method of assessing capital, together with the standardisation of the various disregards which apply would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The wetlands at Corbally, Limerick, have not yet been proposed for designation either as a Natural Heritage Area (NHA), or a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), under the EU Habitats Directive. However, the area has now been examined by my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and it has been decided to propose this area for designation as an NHA.  The possibility of designating the site as an SAC is also being considered.</P>

      <P>It has also been agreed as a result of the mid-term review that an appraisal of spending progress on projects approved under subprogramme 1 of the tourism OP will be completed by spring 1998 to enable the monitoring committee for the OP to review the necessity, if any, for reallocation of resources at that time.  Arrangements are at present in train to engage external consultants to prepare a report to assist the monitoring committee in this regard.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the requirement under the regulations governing the CSF that major projects undergo a cost benefit analysis.</P>
      <P>Article 16 (2) of the relevant EU Council Regulation defines major projects for infrastructure investments as &ldquo;those the total cost of which taken into account in determining the amount of Community assistance is, as a general rule, greater than ECU 25 million&rdquo;.  The National Museum of Ireland Collins Barracks project was the only project in sub programme one of the tourism operational programme 1994-99 where a cost benefit analysis was required to be submitted to the European Commission in accordance with that Article.  There are a number of technical difficulties with cost benefit analyses, particularly where projects are non-commercial in nature and where many of the benefits are difficult to quantify in financial or economic terms.  While I understand that the approach taken in the Collins Barracks project was generally satisfactory, there were concerns expressed about the treatment of the shadow labour pricing element in this cost benefit analysis and in the analyses of other projects not falling within my area of responsibility. The cost benefit analysis has been completed and the results were regarded as satisfactory in that the project has been accepted by the European Commission and the relevant funding has been approved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, while vacancies arise in Wheatfield place of detention on a regular basis, it has been necessary, in recent times, to use these vacancies to alleviate overcrowding in other prisons.  There are a number of offenders throughout the prison system, including the offender to whom the Deputy refers, who have been approved for transfer to Wheatfield.  The position in relation to these offenders remains that their transfers will take effect as soon as suitable vacancies arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299-301, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department is in receipt of EU Structural Funding to benefit the training of offenders for the period 1994-99.  To date, all funds that have been allocated to this project have been drawn down on the due dates.  Following the mid-term review of the EU Structural Funding programme, with which my Department co-operated fully, an initiative has been undertaken to address the issue of linkages between the activity of training for offenders and education and labour market participation after their release from prison.  I am very pleased to say that this initiative has itself been funded by an additional allocation of EU Structural Funding during the course of the mid-term review.  It has also been accepted as an innovative project within the EU INTEGRA programme for the period 1998-99.  The question of cost benefit analysis will arise as a matter of course in carrying out this initiative.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department also receives funding for the NOW (New Opportunities for Women) Initiative.  The funds for the NOW Initiative are disbursed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  As the Deputy's question relate to aspects of the Community Support Framework and resonses to the substantive issues raised therein, in so far as the matters concern the NOW Initiative, information will be furnished by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in her answer to identical questions put down to her Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 to 305, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Many of the buildings in which Garda stations are, or have been, housed around the country are old and unsuitable.  For some years now there has been a major building programme in train to replace or upgrade these buildings.  Because of the total amount of investment needed to fully upgrade or replace all unsuitable Garda buildings this work has had to be scheduled on a priority programme basis.  The relative priority of projects is determined in consultation with Garda management and with the Garda and Garda Sergeants and Inspectors Representative Associations.</P>
      <P>The replacement of the Garda station at Ballina is on the building programme priority list. However, there are a number of projects on that list ahead of Ballina and it would not be feasible to seek to place Ballina ahead of one of those other stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that I am fully committed to obtaining the maximum level of resources I can for the Garda building programme. I will ensure that a new station is provided <Col N="553" /> in Ballina as soon as possible in the context of what I have said.  In the meantime, I have asked my officials to examine, in consultation with the Office of Public Works and the gardaíin Ballina, whether any immediate action can be taken to improve conditions.</P>

      <P>While I am reluctant to publicise meetings relating to sensitive personal matters such as this, I can confirm that I have met with the family of the person referred to by the Deputy on two occasions since taking office.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that effective arrangements are in place to trace missing persons. In this regard, the question of the value of a centralised Garda missing persons unit is kept under continuous review.  Present arrangements are that the Garda divisional officer-district officer takes direct responsibility for investigating missing person cases.  The Garda Commissioner considers that investigations of missing persons are more effective when they have the kind of local focus which is achieved under the present arrangements.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department together with gardaí will be travelling to the UK in the New Year to assess the potential value of a new initiative there, involving analysis of data using sophisticated computer software as an aid to investigation. If the initiative shows sufficient promise, I will consider its adoption in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309 and 314 together.</P>
      <P>The law already provides for offences in relation to drinking alcohol in public places. Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, it is an offence for any person under the age of 18 years to consume alcohol in any place other than a private residence in which that person is present either as of right or by permission and a person found guilty of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to £50.  The Garda have power to confiscate drink they find in the possession of any such young person.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, deals with situations where public drinking leads to disorderly behaviour.  Under that Act, it is an offence for any person (regardless of age) to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might be a danger either to himself or herself or to any other person in the vicinity.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable to be fined up to £100.  In addition, the Act gives power to a garda to confiscate alcohol where he or she suspects with reasonable cause that a disorderly conduct offence is being committed and also empowers a garda to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons who are intoxicated in a public place.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is also open to local authorities to use their by-law making powers under the Local Government Act, 1994, to control the consumption of alcohol in public places.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans at present to amend the liquor licensing or public order laws in relation to drnking in public places, I will keep the matter under regular review.  Local authority by-laws are of course a matter for the local authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>Cycling on footpaths is an offence under article 13, Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, S.I. 182 of 1997. Where breaches of these regulations come to the attention of the Garda the matter is dealt with by way of prosecution or caution.  However, it is not possible to say, on the information available, whether incidences of cycling on the footpath are on the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cyclists stopped by the Garda for cycling on <Col N="556" /> footpaths are warned of the danger they pose to pedestrians, in particular to young children, people with impaired vision and the elderly. Where members of the public bring a complaint about the prevalence of cycling on footpaths in a particular area to the attention of the Garda the area is monitored by Garda patrols.  In particular, local gardaí, and juvenile liaison officers, avail of opportunities such as visits to schools, youth clubs and community centres to promote greater consciousness amongst young people of the dangers of cycling on footpaths.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that all members of the Garda Síochána are exhorted to pay particular attention to the offence of cycling on the footpath and to enforce the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 and 318 together.</P>
      <P>The Law Society of Ireland has made the Solicitors (Adjudicator) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 406 of 1997) in exercise of the powers conferred on it by section 71 (as amended by section 69 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994) of the Solicitors Act, 1954.  Under these regulations, the Incorporated Law Society has established a scheme for the examination or investigation by an adjudicator of written complaints concerning the handling by the society of complaints about solicitors.</P>
      <P>The Incorporated Law Society has appointed an adjudicator on a part-time basis pursuant to the above regulations.  The regulations make specific provision for the independence of the adjudicator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the procedures which have been put in place by the Incorporated Law Society achieve the overall objectives of section <Col N="558" /> 15 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, which made provision for the establishment of an adjudicator scheme.  In the circumstances I have no proposals, at this stage, to exercise the powers conferred on me to make regulations under that section but I will, of course, keep the matter under review in the light of experience of the operation of the adjudicator arrangements adopted by the Incorporated Law Society.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be interested to know, however, that the report of the Disciplinary Tribunal for 1996-97 has been published in the current issue (December 1997) of the GAZETTE of the Law Society of Ireland.</P>

      <P>In concluding their overall mid-term review of CSF funded programmes earlier this year, the CSF monitoring committee decided that the operation of the local urban and rural development programme (OPLURD) would be reviewed by its national monitoring committee, and particularly by relevant Departments represented on the committee, to see what scope there was to make use of existing funds to introduce, <i>inter alia</i>, a pilot scheme for rural resettlement. To the extent that requirements were identified and that future resources became available within the programme, the CSF monitoring committee decided that such a scheme would be regarded as a priority for the use of such resources.</P>
      <P>The national monitoring committee for OPLURD has already given some preliminary consideration to this issue and has requested my Department to explore the matter further, with all the Departments concerned, both in terms of requirements for such a scheme and availability of funding.</P>
      <P>The matter is now under investigation with these Departments and other parties, with a view to presenting findings to the national monitoring committee for consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department receives funding under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9, the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development and the URBAN Initiative.  Expenditure under some of the constituent <Col N="572" /> sub-programmes has fallen behind the initial financial profile, largely deriving from the nature of some of the sub-programmes themselves and as a result of the time-lag that normally occurs as between when commitments are made and actual up-take of expenditure commences. Following the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework, each monitoring committee will review significant underspends at each of their meetings in 1998 and 1999 and will report to the CSF national monitoring committee in the matter.  Consistent with its overall management role for their programmes, my Department will prepare draft reports in advance of those meetings but the question of publication, which is a matter in the first instance for that committee, does not arise until the reports have been considered, decisions taken and finalised.</P>
      <P>Generally, however, I am confident that all programmes under my Department's auspices will fully meet their spend targets by programme end.</P>

In two of these cases, the <Col N="573" /> cost benefit analysis was commissioned in accordance with agreed procedures by Bord Fáilte as implementing agency for sub-programme two (product development) while, in the third case, the analysis was commissioned by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, as implementing Department for Sub-Programme one (natural and cultural tourism).  In each case the cost benefit analysis was carried out in accordance with Commission guidelines to the satisfaction of the commissioning body.</P>

      <P>The new tender procedure for a national conference centre is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development, and is being conducted in full compliance with the EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997.  The notice was also published in the Irish daily newspapers on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by 5 p.m. on Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within the deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997, Invitation to Tender documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intentions to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 November, for so doing.  These six applicants, who will be responsible for providing a site for the proposed development, have three months to submit their tenders, that is by the end of January next year, following which the tenders will be assessed.  The management board has estimated that it will be late March before they have completed their deliberations.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the tourism operational programme, the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law will then be required in respect of any final selection made.</P>
    <P>The project will be funded by the applicant with assistance to a maximum of 33 million ECU at an aid rate of up to 50 per cent, which may be made available to the private sector under the operational programme.  The European Commission has, however, agreed that, in the event of a public or similar body being successful in the tender procedure, this aid rate could be reviewed by the national monitoring committee for the programme, subject again to a maximum of 33 million ECU.  The maximum aid rate which could be made available to an applicant in this category is 75 per cent.</P>

      <P>Assistance from the EU Structural Funds for the period 1994-99 is provided to my Department in respect of specific measures in support of the human resources development priorities identified in the Community Support Framework 1994-99.  Aid due in respect of the final claims 1994, 1995 and 1996 has been received together with almost all of the 1997 advances.</P>
      <P>In each of the years 1994-96 underspends which had arisen on a number of measures were re-profiled to the later years of the CSF.  Any underspends which may arise during 1997 will not be finalised until the completion of the final claims process in 1998.  A number of different factors were responsible for the underspends which occurred on various measures during the period 1994-96.</P>
      <P>The late approval of the Human Resources Operational Programme in 1994 delayed the incareer development unit in my Department in the organisation of the various training programmes for the first and second level education sectors while a teachers' dispute in 1995 had a substantial adverse effect on the delivery of training in that year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the certification measure underspends to end of 1996 were due to lower expenditure incurred by the NCVA than anticipated.  The establishment and expansion of the work of TEASTAS together with the introduction of certification at foundation level and level one by the NCVA will increase expenditure during the final years of the CSF 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> Underspends under the graduate training measure of the industry operational programme were caused by the delay in establishing the measure in the regional technical college sector until late 1995.</P>
    <P>In 1995 an underspend occurred on the vocational preparation and training (VPT) measure due to a temporary decrease in the number of trainees entering VPT arising from the expansion of the transition year option in second level schools.  This underspend has been allocated to the early school leavers following the mid-term review of the CSF earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Progress in developing actions under the equal opportunities measure was slower than anticipated in 1995 and 1996 while the measure was not included in the operational programme for 1994. Under the vocational training infrastructure <Col N="582" /> measure the late approval of the human resources operational programme did not allow capital commitments to be entered into at a sufficient level in 1994, to prevent an underspending occurring. In 1995 while total expenditure was on target, underspends on European Regional Development Fund supported projects were matched by corresponding overspending on EFTA supported projects.  Any underspends in 1996 were caused by planning, design and site acquisition difficulties.  The measure also includes a capital investment programme at third level and expenditure is generally on target.</P>
    <P>Reports are prepared twice yearly for the operational programme monitoring committees together with applications for financial transfers of underspends as required.  It is a matter for the relevant monitoring committees to consider making available reports as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The mid-term evaluation of the Structural Funds pointed to the need for alternative sources of funding for courses supported through the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development, under the Advanced Technical Skills measure.  In the context of the consideration of the mid-term review, it was decided that funding of the Advanced Technical Skills measure along with others, should be reduced to facilitate increased spending on other measures, notably early school leavers.  The implications of the reduced funds for a restructuring of the Advanced Technical Skills programme is under active consideration by my Department in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> It is noted that the mid-term evaluation of the Community Support Framework 1994-99 proposed that the issue of cost recovery in general should be explored at operational programme level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the mid-term review of Structural Funds 1994-99, new initiatives have been agreed for implementation in 1998 and 1999 under which £19.733 million will be provided for a minimum of 1,000 additional places for early school leavers in the Youthreach and Traveller training programmes.  Arrangements are under way to establish 750 Youthreach places and 250 traveller places in 1998 by FÁS and the vocational education committees; £0.987 million will be provided for the strengthening of counselling, guidance and psychological services for participants on these programmes; £1.97 million will be provided for bridging and progression options for early school leavers through the FÁS training system, and 725 places within the FÁS system will be redeployed to progression options for Youthreach and Traveller trainees in 1998. This investment will increase the number of early school leavers undergoing training in FÁS and the vocational education committees under Youthreach and the Traveller Training Centres from 4,525 to 6,250 to 6,250 in 1998, with provision also for some 440 trainees on the FÁS bridging measures.  The programmes are designed to provide integrated education, training and work experience, with a strong focus on the core skills of literacy, numeracy, communications and personal development, and exposure to a range of vocational options.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify in advance the distribution of trainees across specific vocational disciplines. As motivation is regarded as the key to successful learning for the target group, centres are encouraged to provide a flexible range of vocational options which best meets the interests of trainees and the needs of the local labour market. In general, the vocational options embrace computer literacy and office procedures, art and craft, catering and tourism, video, photography, drama, childcare, hairdressing, a range of construction options, horticulture and sport and recreation.</P>
      <P>The investment will not involve a reduction in skills training under the Vocational Preparation and Training programme, although the expansion is part-funded by a saving on the VPT measure in 1995 which was carried forward on an interim basis into 1997 pending the outcome of the mid-term review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the national response to emerging skill needs in the international teleservices area, I have approved the provision of 690 places in 20 selected centres of a two year PLC course, accompanied by an extra investment of £1.5 million <Col N="585" /> in equipment, and the introduction of a special student support scheme towards the cost of overseas placement during the course.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new Education Technology Investment Fund, will provide £250 million in the next three years for technology investment at all levels of education in partnership with industry. Twenty million of this will be available for PLC courses and apprenticeships.  The Government has also announced its intention to introduce maintenance grants for students who are registered on PLC courses as of September 1998.</P>

      <P>The previous Government, in approving the recommendations in the second report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, approved the establishment of a youth services development fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, my Department actively participated in the work of the National Drugs Strategy Team <Col N="586" /> which supports the development of plans by 13 local drugs task forces and significant funding has already been allocated for these task forces. Many of the proposals contained in the plans relate to youth services.  To date, over £1 million has been allocated to youth-education related projects and further proposals are being finalised. It is expected that the bulk of these moneys will be drawn down by the project promoters in 1998.</P>
    <P>As these initiatives are subject to evaluation, my Department considers that any further major investment in new or existing initiatives should await the outcome of this evaluation process.  In the meantime, a programme will be formulated to expend the £1.25 million announced in the budget on youth development services.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy applied for early retirement under strand 3 of the early retirement scheme for teachers which was notified to schools in June 1997.  The scheme specifies that strand 3 may be availed of by teachers in posts which are surplus to requirements, from which they may not be redeployed readily and which will not be filled should they leave the posts.  Following an examination of the application it was concluded that the teacher was not eligible for early retirement under strand 3 as the vocational education committee by which he was employed indicated that a replacement teacher would be required in the event of his retirement.</P>
      <P>The teacher than applied for early retirement under strand 2 of the scheme.  Early retirement under this strand is available to teachers who are 55 years of age or more, have a minimum of 20 years pensionable service and whose school managerial authorities verify that the teacher's retirement will provide an opportunity to enhance the education service provided by the school by facilitating change such as the introduction of new skills and curriculum review.</P>
      <P>The teacher's application under strand 2 was accepted.  The teacher retired on this basis on 30 November 1997.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  Over 28,000 students benefited under the initiative in 1995/96 at a cost to the Exchequer of £54.5 million in 1996.  In the same academic year, almost 26,000 students received grants under the Higher Education Grants Scheme at a cost in 1996 of over £51 million. The free fees initiative and the Higher Education Grant Scheme do not extend to students pursuing part-time or evening courses.</P>
      <P>The latest available figures in relation to part-time students are those in respect of the 1995-96 academic year when there were some 22,000 part-time students at third-level.  In this regard, the profile of part-time students considered by the steering committee on the future development of higher education, indicated that almost 90 per cent of part-time students were in employment.</P>
      <P>In this context, I would point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996 for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>
      <P>I am looking at the overall position in relation to eligibility for free fees and higher education grants.  However, any decision in this regard would have to have regard to the availability of resources and other competing needs in the education sector.</P>

      <P>The number of participant contact hours for 1995 and 1996 are given in the following table broken down by major subject-programme area. Similar information for 1997 is not yet available but will be in due course.</P>
      <P>As I indicated recently in a reply which I gave to a question in the same area, lists of rolls &mdash; and individual hours of attendance &mdash; from inservice courses are not stored on a Department database; information which might be extracted or compiled from such data, as requested by the Deputy, is regrettably not available.</P>

      <P>The financial provision for the vocational training opportunities scheme for 1997 was £25,021,000.  The allocation for 1998 has not yet been finalised.  The vocational training opportunities scheme is an EU supported intervention which enables long-term unemployed people to return to education and training with a view to progression to employment.  The scheme is operated through the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs also provides educational opportunities for long-term social welfare recipients through their second and third level allowance schemes.  The various vocational education committees and other education institutions provide a wide range of courses for adults.  In the area of student support, students who attended but did not successfully complete courses, and who return to courses at the same level following a break of at least five years, are eligible for funding under the student support schemes and the free fees initiative.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to this area.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.  Three special classes have also been established in ordinary primary schools to cater for the needs of children with specific learning disability.  The establishment of such classes depends on the level of assessed need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations they may receive <Col N="600" /> additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on the severity of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>Funding is not generally made available for the provision of additional private tuition for pupils with specific learning disability.  However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I recently approved a special allocation of almost £25,000 to assist work carried on in this area by the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disability.</P>
    <P>The needs of children with specific learning disability and consideration of how best to address these needs within available resources will continue to be kept under review in my Department.</P>

Maintenance grants have been increased in recent years in line with changes in the consumer price index.  Similarly, the reckonable income limits for grant eligibility have been increased in line with movements in the average industrial wage.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Sligo Education Centre is currently funded by my Department on the basis of having a part-time director.  The appointment of a full-time director is a matter for the management committee of the centre in the first instance.  Officers of my Department are in contact with the centre on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers in Sligo can avail of the services provided by the Sligo centre.  There are also three <Col N="607" /> other full-time centres in the general area &mdash; at Donegal (town), Carrick-on-Shannon and Castlebar &mdash; which can provide assistance and service.</P>

      <P>It is the practice of my Department, and bodies under the aegis of the Department, to follow Government contracts procedures, including the requirement for competitive tendering.  If a departure from the procedures is considered necessary in a particular case, the prior approval of the Government Contracts Committee (GCC) is sought.  My Department has not found it necessary to approach the GCC on this issue since 30 June of this year.  I should point out also that my Department's contracts procedures are subject to internal and external audit.</P>
      <P>Compilation of the information sought in respect of individual contracts cannot be compiled in the time available for reply and will be forwarded to the Deputy as quickly as possible.</P>
