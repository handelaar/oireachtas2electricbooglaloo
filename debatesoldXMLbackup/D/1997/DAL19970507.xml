      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>As I said in my statement of Monday last, I am visiting Britain this week to meet the new British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair M.P.; to meet with representatives of the Irish community in Britain; to promote trade; and to address the Oxford Union.</P>
      <P>I will avail of the opportunity of my meeting with Mr. Blair to convey personally my congratulations on his resounding election victory and to wish his new Government well.  As I indicated in my statement on Monday, I believe that, working together, we can develop many new possibilities for co-operation in regard to Northern Ireland, bilaterally and within Europe.  In my recent statement I touched on a number of possibilities for structured co-operation between the Irish and British Governments, including education, anti-crime measures, homelessness, the food industry and the environment.  I will be taking these issues up with Mr. Blair at our meeting.  I hope we will be able to avail of the meeting to further prepare together for the EU Summit in Amsterdam next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intergovernmental co-operation is essential to securing the progress on Northern Ireland which we all want.  Prime Minister Blair and the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mowlam, have already made clear their recognition of this point.  In addition, the Prime Minister and Dr. Mowlam have made it clear that future <Col N="1374" /> arrangements for the governance of Northern Ireland should address all the relevant relationships and be capable of attracting the support of all parts of the community, thereby recognising the need for Nationalist as well as Unionist consent.These positions reflect the commitments in the manifesto on which the British Labour Party sought office, which also recalled their support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Joint Declaration and the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I intend to explore with Prime Minister Blair how best the two Governments can inject the necessary momentum into the peace process.  The Prime Minister is now in a strong position to take decisive action.  I have no doubt that he will do so in a fair and balanced way.  I hope and expect that our meeting will be the beginning of a long, cordial and productive working relationship between both our Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I also record my congratulations to Mr. Blair and his colleagues on their tremendous victory.  I wish his Government well in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>With regard to Northern Ireland, will the Taoiseach revert to his position before last Christmas when he endeavoured but failed to convince the British Government to agree to a fixed date for talks in the event of an unequivocal ceasefire? May I take it that the Taoiseach will restate that it is the position of the Government that if there is an unequivocal cessation of violence inclusive talks could commence without further preconditions on a fixed date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the position I took in respect of the Christmas break in the talks.  I said to the British Prime Minister at the time that it was an opportunity to indicate that if there was an unequivocal and genuine ceasefire that complied with the ground rules, it would be possible for Sinn Féin to take part in the talks once they resumed.  I have continued to hold that general view.  The question of timing arises but it is important that there should be a clear target date towards which people can work in terms of ensuring that the basic conditions set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules paper are complied with and that everybody takes part in the talks on the basis of a durable ceasefire from which there is no going back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explore with the new British Prime Minister confidence building measures such as those about which we spoke in the past?  The prisoners' issue is one which affects both sides.  Will the Taoiseach continue to explore it as a confidence building measure?  Will he agree that it would be a good confidence building gesture to ask the new British Prime Minister to release Róisín McAliskey on bail to have her baby on humanitarian grounds and because of the flimsy nature of the German evidence <Col N="1375" /> against her which they have failed to substantiate during the past six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been of the view that it is valuable and useful to have interim confidence building measures directed at both communities to reassure them of the goodwill of both Governments, their anxiety to deal with all issues in a humanitarian way and the respect they have for the concerns of both traditions and their allegiances.  In that regard it is important that we should continue to make progress on the prisoners' issue.  It is important, in terms of early release, that that approach be adopted.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for confidence building measures to be adopted in regard to the handling of the parades issue which, in terms of mutual confidence between both communities, is an issue which will either be a very positive or very negative one.  It is important to look on it not purely as a problem.  If local accommodations can be reached between communities on local parades, the confidence enhancement involved can have much wider political effects, in terms of improvements in the atmosphere.  We should look on the problem as an opportunity for forging genuine cross-community agreements on specific matters at local level.  If that can be done at local level, it indicates the possibility of doing so at wider levels also on the basis of mutual respect.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point in regard to the case of Róisín McAliskey.  I will be happy to raise the issue, and prisoners' issues generally, with the British Prime Minister.  It is important that we should look at these issues in a humanitarian way and to recognise that such an approach without any concession in regard to the application of the due process of law can have disproportionate beneficial effects across the communities so long as it is approached in an even-handed way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In joining in the congratulations and good wishes to Mr. Blair and his new Government many of us feel a debt of gratitude to Mr. Major which should be recorded for his efforts in very difficult circumstances <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland, particularly in recent years. The peace process, such as it is, is likely to be most detrimentally affected in the months to come by the advent of the 1997 marching season. Will the Taoiseach impress on Mr. Blair and Dr. Mowlam the need to deal firmly and clearly with that prospect to try to ensure we do not have a repetition of what happened in Northern Ireland last summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Malley for referring to the role played by the former Prime Minister, John Major, as it gives me an opportunity to refer to it in the House.  It is fair to say that despite immense difficulties in the House of Commons John Major persisted throughout his term as Prime Minister in seeking a creative solution to the problems which arose in regard to <Col N="1376" /> Northern Ireland.  I know from first hand experience &mdash; I spoke to him recently &mdash; that at no time did he let up in his determination to find a way through the difficulties.</P>
      <P>John Major worked with less freedom than the new Prime Minister is working with in terms of the length of his electoral mandate and parliamentary majority.  However, it is fair to say that his depth of knowledge of the Irish problem, the Northern Ireland problem and of the relationship between Ireland and Britain was truly prodigious. He had a capacity to apply himself to the most minute detail in a creative way.  He has a politician's sense of what is possible and of approaching issues which seem to be ones where one side or the other has to lose on a zero sum basis from a different angle so that there are no losers, only winners.  For example, in the negotiation of the Downing Street Declaration with my predecessor and in the negotiation of the Frame work Document with me and my predecessor he showed tremendous creativity and an ability to apply new concepts in terms of constitutional practice which were not being applied elsewhere but which he, in recognition of the importance of the Irish problem and of Northern Ireland, was willing to apply.  This is worthy of note.  I have conveyed these views privately to John Major and I welcome the opportunity to convey them publicly.</P>
      <P>On the parades issue, I dealt with this to some degree in response to Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I welcome, in particular, the statement by the new Secretary of State, Dr. Mowlam, that she will ensure the rule of law is upheld.  The principle concerned, which derived from the position at Drumcree recently in terms of the concerns of the Nationalist community, was that the rule of law did not seem to be upheld once the numbers were greater than those which appeared to be conveniently capable of being dealt with.  It is important that the rule of law is seen to be applied regardless of numbers, minorities, majorities or situations.  There must be a standard of protection and of maintenance of order which is applied in all circumstances.  The statement by the Secretary of State is particularly significant and welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In a significant statement the Secretary of State said she was very anxious to reform the RUC because it is not acceptable in Nationalist areas and never will be.  Will the Taoiseach outline his views on this issue to the new Prime Minister?  Will he take into account the views in what is probably the best position paper ever prepared on this issue, the paper on the reform of the RUC published by Seamus Mallon of the SDLP?  Parties in this House have supported this blueprint for many years.  Will the Taoiseach strongly urge the Government and the House to support the Secretary of State's vision given that reform of the RUC is one of the crucial issues in getting Nationalists to accept policing arrangements, which are directly linked to the <Col N="1377" /> marching season and the ongoing difficulties in this regard over the past 50 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of policing is crucial to the building of cross-community confidence on a range of issues.  The police force is the ultimate expression of the power of the political system in any community.</P>
      <P>If the political system is not one which commands the allegiance of both communities, the instrument through which the political system has its will done, namely, the police force, will be contested.It is important to recognise that while reforms can be instituted separately in the police system, and these should be pursued in every way in terms of matters such as flags, emblems, the way in which the police force describes itself and so forth, there are also wider political questions and a wider political context that must be settled for the ultimate level of satisfaction that is desirable in both communities, with their shared police force, to be reached.  It is important to work in parallel on a complementary basis on political questions, the purpose of the talks that resume on 3 June, and on policing questions, to reach a comprehensive accommodation on both issues. As the Deputy infers policing is at the centre of a large part of the division and the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's comments on prisoners.  Will he raise in his discussions the case of Danny McNamee, who has been in prison for 11 years?  As the Taoiseach is aware, serious questions arise about this man's conviction.  The election of a new British Government gives us an opportunity to ensure this case is reopened as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has already taken up this matter with the British authorities. Last March, for instance, we asked that Mr. McNamee might be removed from the special secure unit because of his deteriorating health. We are also anxious that the urgency of examining his case should be impressed upon the Criminal Cases Review Commission.  This matter is being pursued through diplomatic channels and by the Tánaiste through discussions with his counterpart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party I ask the Taoiseach to extend best wishes to the new British Prime Minister in his discussions.  In those discussions with Prime Minister Blair, will the Taoiseach explore means of building consensus, an issue which would not have been to the fore in the British general election which is based on a first past the post system?  In his discussions on Northern Ireland, will he raise the possibility of &ldquo;preferenda&rdquo; with the British Prime Minister, an issue I have raised previously with the Taoiseach.I agree with Deputy Kitt that the case of Danny McNamee should be on the agenda also because of the doubt it casts on the British justice system which is not in the interests of building <Col N="1378" /> good relations between the peoples of these islands or within Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent has raised this matter before, namely, methods of consensusbuilding, including &ldquo;preferenda&rdquo;, as a way of identifying the common ground between parties. The ground rules we have agreed for the talks, while not explicitly providing for this, provide in effect for something of the same consequence. The ground rules provide that agreements cannot be reached by majority, there must be a majority in both communities for any decision to be taken. That ground rule requires, whether formally or informally, that a method of identifying shared preferences, but not necessarily first preferences, has to be part of any active negotiating process if that process is to have a prospect of success.  The tragedy so far is that the talks have not got to the point where this would be useful because they have not reached the point of discussing the real issues that divide the communities, such as the system of governance, the relationship between North and South, the relationship with Britain, consequential policing issues and so on.  The discussions so far have been concerned with issues where it is not so easy to see how the methodology the Deputy is advocating can be used, for example, the decommissioning question.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion, made here on a number of occasions, is a useful one, and is consistent with what the Government has already put in place in the talks launched on 10 June last year which will resume on 3 June this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach a number of questions about European matters. The Taoiseach raised his entire agenda, particularly the sudden strengthening of the British currency against the Irish currency and how that will affect us.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us what he has to say about that issue because it is important that the Irish Government set down its views so that the new British Government will know precisely how these matters affect us and our position on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach consider raising with the British Prime Minister the question of having the same standards of respect for the Mitchell principles by both Governments in future?  The Taoiseach will have noted how two hoax bomb threats in recent times were treated by the authorities. One was a hoax bomb threat by the IRA at an important sporting event at Aintree, the other in Dublin.  Except for the handling by our Garda Síochána of the latter, an international event at the Point Theatre would have been ruined. Rather than what has happened during the past year, both Governments should have a clear understanding that the Mitchell principles apply equally to loyalists and republicans and that the authorities do not issue one set of crazy statements about one particular group but say nothing when there is a threat from the loyalist side. There should be balance in all statements.  We <Col N="1379" /> should reject violence or threats of violence from whatever source.  The authorities should not be so unbalanced in how they present such matters in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is trying to draw me into a discussion of the assessment the security forces make of the seriousness of particular bomb threats.  I do not know that this is an appropriate matter for political commentary, but I would make the point that the Canary Wharf bomb was not a hoax and that obviously has some effect on the way in which other warnings containing the same code are assessed by people in the same jurisdiction.  That has to be taken into account in assessing people's reaction.  It is also important that we should recognise the very heavy weight of responsibility on the shoulders of any people who are assessing bomb threats, whether hoax bomb threats or real bomb threats. They have a very heavy responsibility, and if they made the wrong call politicians would be the first to criticise them.  We should, therefore, be respectful of the difficulty of the choice they make, particularly against the background of the fact that the IRA has a record of real bombing as well as hoaxes.</P>
      <P>Our currency policy is set by our membership of the exchange rate mechanism, of which Britain is not a member.  We are pursuing our own economic policy and the purpose of that policy is that Ireland should qualify for membership of the single currency from the start.  That is the target towards which we are working.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that today the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has allowed the Bank of England to make its own decision in regard to interest rates.  That indicates an approximation of British practice to Irish practice where decisions of this nature are made at arm's length from the political process by people who are concerned with the long-term interests of the currency.  The decision by the British Chancellor in this matter is welcome and allows us to apply similar criteria to our approach to these issues, bearing in mind, however, that we are pursuing a policy which is bounded by the European monetary system whereas, as of now, Britain is not doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach either purposely misheard what I said or was talking to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  I was referring to the reaction to events and respect for the Mitchell principles, not the lead-in to events or what happens in the case of police forces.  I was talking about the different reaction over the past 12 months of the former Secretary of State to actions on the loyalist and republican sides. Under the Mitchell principles, both Governments should respond in the same way to violence from any side and not in the biased manner in which the former Secretary of State continually responded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy is inviting me to do.  It is my understanding that compliance with the Mitchell principles is one of the qualifications for a party to be part of the talks.  If the Deputy is suggesting that certain parties should be excluded from the talks, there is a procedure open to anyone participating in them to make a complaint.  It is important to make the point that the IRA has ended its ceasefire and not restored it whereas the loyalist combined military command has not formally ended its ceasefire. Complaints made on a factual basis will be assessed.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>whether the Attorney General instructs counsel representing the public interest at tribunals of inquiry; and the steps, if any, which are taken to guard against any possible conflict of interest.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12037/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The public interest has been separately represented by counsel at two tribunals of inquiry.  The principal role of such counsel is to ensure that any constitutional or other legal issue which arises before a tribunal is addressed from the point of view of the public interest.  The Attorney General first instructed counsel representing the public interest at the hepatitis C tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of the Attorney General, through the Chief State Solicitor's office, instructs one senior counsel and one junior counsel at the Dunnes Payments Tribunal of Inquiry.  Because the Attorney General himself has a conflict of interest &mdash; which I reported to the House on 3 December 1996 &mdash; in relation to certain matters that arise before that tribunal, procedures have been put in place in the Office of the Attorney General to deal with such a situation.  These procedures, where a conflict of interest arises for the Attorney, have been in place since the present Attorney General took over in the Office of the Attorney General and I outlined them to the House on 25 January 1995.  In relation to the Dunnes payments tribunal the senior legal assistant and a third legal assistant have been delegated the function of instructing counsel for the <Col N="1381" /> public interest at the tribunal.  Those officials deal with issues arising out of the tribunal in consultation with the appointed counsel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the public interest is adequately represented at the tribunal, particularly given the recent comments to the contrary by people reporting on it, who have attended it and by observers who have a good knowledge of the courts and tribunal system?The Taoiseach said in the past that if we make mistakes we must apologise and face the matter honestly.  Will he admit there is a blatant contradiction between what he stated at the beef tribunal and what he said at the Dunnes-Lowry tribunal, both of which were set up by the Oireachtas?  He owes it to the House to clear up the matter rather than try to explain it away.  I invite him to clear up the matter in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Representation of the public interest at the tribunal comes into play where the tribunal believes it is a party in terms of an issue in dispute and there is a need for someone else, apart from the tribunal, to state the case for the wider public interest.  For instance, if the tribunal felt it had to take a certain course because of its terms of reference and there was a question as to whether that was in the wider public interest as distinct from being in the interests of the tribunal's terms of reference as more narrowly defined by the Dáil, then there would be a case for the counsel for the public interest to set the wider considerations before the tribunal or to argue them in whatever forum it was necessary that they should be argued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that the concept of a counsel for the public interest is not one where that counsel is expected on a daily basis to replicate or repeat the questioning or the argumentation that the tribunal, through its counsel, is advancing.It is important to make the point that in 99.9 per cent of the situations that arise there is no question but that the tribunal is acting in accordance with the public interest and it represents the public interest in terms of its work and the terms of reference that have been set.  It is only in situations where it could be argued there is a wider public interest beyond that which the tribunal is pursuing that the issue arises of the counsel for the public interest having to come into the picture.That is my understanding of the basis upon which the counsel operates.  However, I make the point that the counsel for the public interest does not act on the instructions of the Government, therefore, it is not appropriate for me to say what the counsel for the public interest should or should not do.  It acts on its account with the aid of people in the Attorney General's office who act in the context of that office's independent constitutional function which is independent of the Government.  It makes its own decisions. Therefore, it is not appropriate for me to be drawn into a discussion as to whether a decision in the tribunal is right.  That would involve effectively <Col N="1382" /> asking me, as a representative of the Executive, to interfere with the work of the independent counsel's assessment of what is the public interest.</P>
    <P>On the second part of the Deputy's question. my party and I have co-operated fully with both tribunals.  We provided details of every donation relevant to both tribunals as to amount and circumstances, donations to our party and to any individuals who may have received money.  We were open to be asked questions from anybody at the tribunal about any of those donations &mdash; all that information was disclosed.  There was nothing hidden in terms of the donations received.  If there was a question about any circumstances, any donation or who knew about such a donation, it was open to anybody at either tribunal, and is open to anybody at the current tribunal, to ask questions about any donation in terms of any suggestion that anything was not proper in respect of a donation being sought or received.</P>
    <P>As to the evidence I gave at the beef tribunal, I am glad the Deputy's party is interested in having a discussion about the beef tribunal.  That was not always the case.  In terms of my approach there, I answered, as I indicated, in respect of practices that occurred prior to my becoming leader of my party.  I answered about a different period from the one about which I answered at the more recent tribunal.  At that one I answered questions about the practices that occurred after I became leader of the party and I answered fully on both occasions.  In my understanding, there were differences in terms of the situations that applied at particular times in the two periods, but in both cases my answers were full and frank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In describing what is clearly the same period 1987-89 will the Taoiseach explain why he gave two quite distinct and different accounts of it, first in June 1992 and second, in the last week or so at the current tribunal, in view of the fact that correspondence published recently makes it clear he was involved in fundraising at a period when he said he was not?  Does the Taoiseach not consider it desirable that the counsel for the public interest at the present tribunal should be instructed by a private solicitor who is independent of everyone rather than by civil servants who are the legal advisers to the Government, beholden to it and must uphold its point of view at all times?  How does he expect a counsel instructed in that way to act independently in the public interest?  Is that not borne out by the fact that the counsel concerned has only intervened in the tribunal in a minimal way, when there are clearly matters where the public interest is involved and where it is different from the Government's interest?</P>

      <P>The Office of the Attorney General has two functions.  One is as adviser to the Government.  The other is a residual function in which the Attorney General and those working for him are independent of the Government, that is, in his representation of the public interest in a number of cases.  This arises all the time in different areas and does not have anything to do with tribunals of inquiry.</P>
      <P>As I explained, the Attorney General acted in a previous case for one of the parties currently being inquired into by the tribunal, before he became Attorney General.  He is not in a position to give instructions to the counsel acting for the public interest in this tribunal because of his previous work.  Therefore, as with all cases where the Attorney General had previously worked for clients affected by anything the State is now doing, he has made arrangements for others in his office to deal, in his place, with any issues which arise, although not at his direction.</P>
      <P>The senior legal assistant in the Attorney General's office, Mr. James Hamilton, has the knowledge, capacity, integrity and independence of judgment to act entirely free of all influence from all quarters in the instructions he gives to counsel acting for the public interest before any tribunal.

      <P>I made it clear in my evidence to the beef tribunal that Front Bench Fine Gael politicians were not systematically informed of contributions made to the party during my predecessor's period of office as Leader.  That is true. The context in which those questions were asked was that of suggestions that the party might not have pursued certain issues affecting the beef industry because of this.  As the record shows, as far the Goodman package &mdash; which was a central portion of the concern of the beef tribunal &mdash; is concerned, I was the only Member of the House who condemned the sweetheart deal which was put in place by my predecessor, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  I was attacked by Mr. Goodman for the stance I took on that matter. Any suggestion, therefore, that I could have been influenced in any way is without foundation and has shown to be so on the basis of the record. However, in my evidence to the beef tribunal I indicated that, while there was no systematic informing, one might know of particular contributions on a random basis.  That is a satisfactory situation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the interest of the Deputies opposite in the beef tribunal.  When the report of the tribunal was presented to the House, Deputy Bertie Ahern voted against allowing any questions to be asked about it.

      <QRef>[12307/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have already informed the House that, following the introduction of HIV donor screening tests by the Blood Transfusion Service Board in October 1985, no lookback was undertaken between 1985 and 1989 in respect of earlier donations made by donors who were now screening positive for HIV.  A lookback procedure was in place from 1989 onwards for newly presenting donors.  As the House will be aware, the BTSB has intensified its HIV lookback to trace all recipients of potentially HIV infected blood issues.</P>
      <P>Given that there can be no guarantee that all, or indeed any, of the untraced issues will ever be traced, and also because of the possibility that some donors who were HIV positive prior to the introduction of HIV donor screening in October 1985 did not donate after October 1985 and cannot, therefore, be identified, I decided to introduce an optional HIV testing programme to offer screening of blood transfusion and blood product recipients who may be at risk, however small that risk may be.</P>
      <P>Before commencing such a programme it is essential that the risk, if any, involved for recipients must be determined, as far as possible, to enable each recipient to make a fully informed decision, in consultation with his or her general practitioner, in relation to availing of screening. The element of risk for recipients will vary according to the year in which they received the transfusion or blood product and according to the specific product they received.  I am confident that the preparations for the HIV testing programme, which are well advanced, will be completed before the end of this month.</P>
      <P>A draft booklet notifying general practitioners about the relevant risks to recipients in relation to the different blood and blood products which they might have received and in relation to the year in which they received them is almost completed.This booklet will enable GPs to assist their patients in reaching a fully informed decision as to whether to undergo HIV testing under the screening programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> In the meantime, the BTSB target lookback is continuing and the following is the up to date position.  A total of 25 blood donors have tested positive for HIV since screening was introduced in 1985.  Eight of those were first time donors and accordingly no risk of HIV transmission to recipients was involved.  In the case of ten of the remaining 17 donors, recipients of potentially infected issues were traced and none of the recipients tested positive.</P>
    <P>The tracing of recipients of the issues from the remaining seven donors has been rendered very difficult by the absence of the BTSB dispatch records for the period prior to 1986.  Of the 33 issues from those seven donors, 15 were donated prior to 1981 and are not regarded as a potential source of infection.  The residual problem relates to tracing the recipients of the balance of the 18 issues derived from the potentially infected blood donations made prior 1985.  Seven of the issues have been traced leaving 11 issues of concern remaining.</P>
    <P>In relation to the HIV tribunal, it is the Government's intention to establish a tribunal of inquiry to examine the HIV infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB, and such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in the light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal.</P>
    <P>The report of the hepatitis C tribunal was submitted to me on 6 March 1997 and published on 11 March 1997.  I have already met the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to the terms of reference of the proposed tribunal of inquiry.  I will have further consultations with the society on the detailed drafting of the terms of reference and it is my intention to proceed with the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry at the earliest possible date.  My first priority, however, at this time is to ensure the enactment of the legislation on the compensation tribunal which will be published later this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the House that the optional HIV testing programme, which he promised on 17 December 1996 would commence in January 1997, will commence before June this year?  The Minister promised to have the other tribunals in place immediately after the publication of the report of the Finlay tribunal. Does he expect those tribunals to start around June also?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am confident that the preparations for the HIV testing programme, which are well advanced, will be completed before the end of this month.  The programme will then be advertised and testing will commence as quickly as possible.  However, two matters must be addressed in terms of informing people who might be at risk, irrespective of how small that risk might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, advertisements must be placed in the national media newspapers.  Second, a booklet is <Col N="1389" /> being prepared for general practitioners, who will carry out the testing in the first instance, to ensure they are aware of the various considerations which must be taken into account in advising their patients.  This booklet is in the final stages of preparation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the tribunal, we are in consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society which was disappointed that some of the issues which affected its members in respect of hepatitis C were not dealt with by the Finlay tribunal.  I have already met the society on a number of occasions but progress in that regard was overtaken by the priority given to putting the compensation scheme on a statutory basis.  The priority over the past four to five weeks of the small section of my Department which has the expertise to deal with these issues has been the legislation to put the compensation scheme on a statutory basis.  This legislation has been cleared by the Cabinet and it should be published on Friday.  I hope the Opposition will co-operate with the Government to ensure that all Stages are taken in both Houses next week.  This is most important.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to my officials who not only worked the last bank holiday weekend but also the two previous weekends.  Although there is a huge number of employees in the general health services, there are only 300 people in the Department of Health.  It is difficult to put new personnel resources into this area because it takes time to build up expertise to deal with the issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Bill this week, although it remains to be seen whether it will be taken next week.  Regarding my supplementary questions, the Minister reiterated the points he made in his first reply.  What is the Minister's best estimate regarding the timing of the optional HIV programme?  It was promised for last January but will it start in June, July or August?  While I accept the Minister has been subjected to a great deal of pressure and his Department had a big workload, he gave no indication there would be this delay on 17 December last when he announced the optional HIV testing programme would commence in the following month.  Since the objective of Question Time is to elicit information, can the Minister give the House his best guess in what month this programme will begin and the starting dates of the two tribunals awaited in respect of HIV-infected persons and haemophiliacs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There has been no undue delay in this matter.  When we received the legal advice on how to organise the optional HIV screening programme, it was pointed out that persons who might be at risk would have to be made aware of what level of risk would be involved so that they could make a valid decision on whether they would avail of the testing programme.That involved a great deal of work within the BTSB and much preparatory work. Within that period the only time the relevant <Col N="1390" /> section of my Department concentrated totally on putting the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis was over the past four or five weeks, of which Deputy Cowen is well aware because he had been pushing me fairly hard to get that work done.  I am simply pointing out that my departmental officials worked throughout the weekends to achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked when the screening programme will begin.  Preparations will be completed by the end of the month and I expect testing to take place in the course of the month of June.</P>
      <P>As soon as I agree terms of reference with the Irish Haemophilia Society, that tribunal will begin its hearings.  I could agree terms of reference tomorrow which I considered satisfactory but there are outstanding issues of concern to that society.  As in all these issues, I want to engage, in advance, in the fullest possible consultation with representatives of those affected.  There is not much point in establishing a tribunal unless those persons affected are satisfied with its terms of reference and have confidence in the manner in which it will proceed.</P>
      <P>I also want it to be like the Finlay tribunal, thus ensuring that its hearings will not wander all over the area and come to no precise conclusions.  I want its hearings to be focused and directed at answering precise questions prompted by its terms of reference.  This will be done as quickly as possible but I do not want to tie myself to a precise date at present.  The date is dependent on a satisfactory outcome of consultations, in particular with The Irish Haemophilia Society.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> While many things are possible in theory, in practice we must remember there are other cases before the courts. This takes us back to an issue on which I have answered questions time out of number here. There were three organisations, if that is the correct description, being sued by plaintiffs, including <Col N="1391" /> the late Mrs. McCole, one, the State, another the National Drugs Advisory Board and the third the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Each of those entities had separate boards, separate legal teams, solicitors and barristers and, in the case of the BTSB and the National Drugs Advisory Board, separate insurance.  They conducted their defence cases separately.  The State conducted the defence case on behalf of the State but did not have any policy directive, control or management of the defence cases being pursued by the Blood Transfusion Service Board or the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the problem of children begging is mainly concentrated in the Eastern Health Board region, primarily in Dublin.The majority of the children begging in Dublin city centre are members of the travelling community who reside at halting sites located around the city.  The number of children involved is relatively small and they come from a small number of families who are well known to the authorities.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation, parents who allow their children to beg can be fined or imprisoned. In practice, the Garda has experienced difficulty in trying to enforce the current law, particularly because of the need to prove that the parent sent the child out to beg.  Following an examination of the current legislation, the Government decided to update and strengthen the law in this regard, and the Children Bill, 1996, includes updated provisions which will give greater protection to children from being sent out to beg by their parents. The main change is to place the evidential burden on the appropriate adult, usually a parent, to show that he or she did not send the child out to beg.</P>
      <P>In the Department of Education work is ongoing on the preparation of legislation to update the provisions relating to school attendance at first and second level.  Monitoring of school attendance will form part of the proposed legislation and will be applicable to all children, including children of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>As far as the statutory agencies under the aegis of the Department of Health are concerned, the Deputy will be aware that the Child Care Act, 1991, enables health boards to take action through the courts where there is evidence that children are being abused or neglected.  However, these provisions must be read in conjunction with section 3 of the Act which obliges health boards to have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family.</P>
      <P>In general, the response of the Eastern Health Board has been to work with the travelling community and relevant voluntary groups rather than adopting a confrontational approach.  The board, in conjunction with the Department of Education, supports a pre-school and school for approximately 65 traveller children in the city centre.  Children are collected each day and brought to the school where meals, health care and other back-up services are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> The board also supports a family support service for the travelling community at Exchange House in Meath Street.  The service includes a drop-in facility and an outreach service is provided by a social worker who works with the most vulnerable families and their children.  In addition, the board provides financial assistance to the Travelling Family Care voluntary agency towards the operating costs of two residential centres for children from the travelling community.The agency has also established a shared rearing project whereby traveller families can foster traveller children requiring care.</P>
    <P>A review of the existing services for travellers was recently commissioned by the Eastern Health Board and this report will be available shortly.  This is a further example of the necessity of adopting a focused, co-ordinated approach and I stress that all three Departments in which I have responsibility are involved in addressing this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that many of our citizens are scandalised by the regular sight of children begging on our streets. This form of exploitation of children should not be tolerated, simply by reference to their ethnic origin.  What particular steps have been taken by the health authorities in this matter?  I am not talking about the justice authorities which is a separate matter.  I am aware the Minister has moved in relation to changing and improving the law, as far as the criminal justice aspect is concerned, in other words that it is an offence to allow a child to beg.  In terms of wearing his health hat, what action have the Minister and the Eastern Health Board taken in response to the 271 referrals made by the ISPCC to the Eastern Health Board in 1996 alone, in relation to children begging on our streets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy recognises the complexity of the problem.  It is not as simple as many people seem to believe.  That I have responsibility in the three Departments of Health, Justice and Education, has been extremely useful to deal with this matter on a multifaceted level.  Wearing my health hat the Deputy asked specifically what the position is in that area and referred to the ISPCC.  The Eastern Health Board has been very concerned about this problem.  I said in my reply that the Eastern Health Board is looking into some of the allegations made.  I also referred to some of what is being done by the health board but I will add to it.  The Eastern Health Board provides traveller pre-school, summer school, school class, day-care services through Exchange House &mdash; a day care and drop-in service &mdash; and St. Columbus school, a school with day care provision.  The board provides residential units at Ballyowen Meadows &mdash; short-term accommodation and assessment facilities &mdash; and Derrylossary House, a residential unit with eight places.  It provides public health nurse services, grant aids childcare assistants, supports <Col N="1394" /> home-maker services and traveller support groups which provide an after care service and a shared rearing scheme.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has been approaching the matter on a number of levels but this should not be seen in isolation.  We have to take into consideration the provisions of the Children Bill and what is being done in the Department of Education and, particularly, the School Attendance Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation.The efforts made by the three Departments for which I have responsibility will make a major contribution to the resolution of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying that the Eastern Health Board and the other statutory authorities are concerned.  I am concerned there seems to be an absence of focus and that the statutory authorities are not protecting this group of children.  The Minister said that a small group of families is concerned.  This is all the more reason it should be possible for the State to make a critical intervention to protect these children. Surely the Minister is aware these children have individual constitutional rights which are not being protected by the State which turns a blind eye to the sight of children begging on our streets on a regular basis.  I am not satisfied that sufficient focus, energy and commitment is going into tackling this problem.  Will he inquire from the Eastern Health Board what specific action it has taken in response to the 271 cases reported by the ISPCC volunteers to the Eastern Health Board in 1996?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned there is a way to approach this which is not zero tolerance one but a multifaceted approach because this is a complex issue.  The Eastern Health Board has established a working group with Barnardos to consider the implications of the report.  The Children Bill, which I introduced some time ago and which had its Second Reading in this House and which I managed to get through after more than 20 years of successive Governments not being able to produce it, could now be an Act if the Deputy and the other Opposition spokesman had co-operated.  They prefer to preach about these matters and to make allegations but are not prepared to co-operate when co-operation would be in the public good.</P>

      <P>In response to the Minister's intolerant response to my questions, I am raising this matter as I have done on six occasions, since I became a Member, at Priority Question Time, to ask the Minister to respond to his own responsibilities in the health area.  It is a racist policy by the State to turn a blind eye to the exploitation of children on the basis of their ethnic origin.  If any member of the settled community left their child out to beg on the streets the health board would intervene.  I have zero tolerance for the State turning a blind eye to the welfare of those children.  The Minister is trying to twist the argument around to the justice area, an area on which I have also tackled him.  My question relates to what he is doing as Minister with responsibility for children's welfare to protect the individual constitutional rights of children who are begging on our streets.</P>

I am approaching this in the only way in which it can be approached, utilising the three Departments in which I have responsibility to deal with the problem.The Eastern Health Board has set up a working party.  It would have helped considerably &mdash; the Deputy did not refer to this &mdash; if the provisions of the Children Bill had been brought into force which could have been done with the co-operation of members of the Opposition.  They prefer to point the finger, make allegations and to call for a zero tolerance attitude in respect of one section of our community.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I understand from the health boards that the needs of applicants for incontinence wear are assessed on an individual basis, taking account of each person's particular medical requirements.  Supplies are provided according to need and individual needs are reviewed on a regular basis.  With regard to the case to which I understand the Deputy refers I have asked my Department to seek an immediate report from the chief executive officer of the relevant health board on this matter.  I will communicate further with the Deputy on receipt of the report.</P>
      <P>With reference to the Deputy's query regarding the development of services to persons with a mental handicap, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, recently published a report, Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap, 1997-2001, based on information from the national intellectual disability database.  The assessment provides a comprehensive picture of the requirements for additional residential and day services for persons with a mental handicap over the period concerned.  The Government is committed, under Partnership 2000, to the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> It has been the policy of successive Governments to restructure the mental health services through the development of services located in the community as an alternative to institutionally based care.  This policy is based on the recommendations of the report on the development of the mental health services, Planning for the Future, which was published in 1984.</P>
    <P>Acute psychiatric units at general hospitals, day hospitals, day centres and community residential accommodation are now being provided to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.  This shift in the provision of services from the traditional institutionally-based model of care to a community-based care setting has been extremely successful and is widely accepted as providing a more comprehensive service for patients and a much improved quality of life for persons who were former patients of psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is outrageous to talk about assessments of needs or five year plans when a mother has been told to store up used nappies of her eight year old incontinent son so that the health board can check them.  There is an assessment of needs database and there is supposed to be a five year plan, although it has not been published yet.  Is that because we are not prepared to make the resources available to deal with the problem based on the assessment of needs database to which the Minister referred?</P>
      <P>What does the Partnership 2000 commitment mean to parents of mentally handicapped children and young adults?  Does it mean there will be increased funding within the overall parameters?Will it be sufficient and over what timescale to deal with the need for more funds based on the assessment which is available for 1997-2001?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil went into Government in 1992 there was a heavy investment in this sector, but it was investment against a generally perceived need without that need being quantified. However, significant progress was made.  A database is now available which identifies the actual need and which, with the help of the voluntary groups and the health boards, has come up with figures necessary to meet outstanding need.  The figures are precise &mdash; 1,439 residential and respite places and 1,036 day care places.  For the first time the problem has been quantified.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, has published the database and the information has been made public.  In this year's budget the Government decided to invest to meet these needs through a multi-annual programme and allocated £12 million.</P>
      <P>The social commitments in Partnership 2000 include a commitment to meet the unmet needs of the handicapped during the period of the programme which is 39 months from July.  That is to say, there is a commitment from the Government to meet the unmet needs as identified in the database during the period of Programme 2000, which comprises five financial years, with £12 million being invested.  The overall cost of providing these places is about £50 million and there is probably an extra capital investment necessary. That is the commitment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the commitment is made on the understanding that the resources will be available.  The Deputy will also be aware that the commitments in Partnership 2000 are subject to the general condition of the availability of resources.  The database has been published and it is the intention to provide the places over four to five years.  The first instalment of £12 million was provided in the budget this year and is in the 1997 post-budget estimate.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that the commitments are subject to overall resource constraints.  Whatever the improvements made, it is clear that much more needs to be done for the mentally handicapped.Is the Minister prepared to give more priority and funds to this sector in the coming years, if he remains as Minister, than has been the case during his tenure to date?  In the absence of such a commitment the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland does not believe that the results the Minister predicts will be achieved.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My predecessor, Deputy Howlin, and I have committed more funds annually and on an ongoing basis to this <Col N="1399" /> area than any other Minister for Health, by a factor of hundreds of percent.  This year we have provided an additional £12 million and that will be repeated next year.  Our commitment is to meet the unmet needs over the period of Partnership 2000.  The commitment is tied into Partnership 2000 to make it stronger than a political commitment given in the House.  This view is shared by the social partners and the parents of the handicapped.</P>
      <P>Regardless of who will be in Government after the general election, if it is a commitment to deal with it in accordance with what is laid down in Partnership 2000 it will bind our successors, through the social partnerships.

There are 40 unoccupied beds in Aras Attracta in Swinford, County Mayo.  I ask the Minister to <Col N="1400" /> prioritise mental handicap, mental disability, learning disorders or whatever terminology one wishes to use, given that there are still over 1,000 people inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The establishment of a successful transplant programme for any specialty is an extremely complex and difficult task.  It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes.The Department's experience with the successful liver transplant programmes bear this out.  The question of establishing a heart-lung transplant programme is being considered in this context.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by patients requiring lung or heart-lung transplants.I am considering the issues involved with a view to alleviating the difficulties for these patients.  In light of the experience gained in establishing the liver transplant programme, it is likely that a phased approach will be adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and create a programme that is viable, in terms of the outcome for patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the establishment of a heart-lung transplant programme is being considered and that it is likely that a phased approach will be adopted.  Will he provide more detail and indicate a timescale and the methodologies to be applied?  Will Irish surgeons build expertise in the United Kingdom before such a facility is established here and teams are put together?  The Minister said that he is aware &mdash; I am sure he has been made so aware by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland &mdash; of the difficulties being experienced by patients requiring lung or heart-lung transplants.  Last year 47 patients were awaiting heart and lung transplants in the United Kingdom.  Six were operated on successfully and of the remaining 41, 13 have since died. There is, therefore, a clear need for the Department <Col N="1401" /> and the Minister to accelerate their consideration of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As Deputies are aware, there is no facility for lung or heart-lung transplantation in Ireland.  It has been estimated that the annual lung and heart-lung transplant caseload would be 20 transplants approximately, if a programme could be commenced.  Patients in need of these operations are referred by their consultants for assessment to any of three centres in the United Kingdom &mdash; Newcastle, Harefield and Cambridge &mdash; with a view to being put on a waiting list for a transplant.  Figures to the end of 1996 indicate that in the region of 30-35 Irish patients are awaiting transplants in the United Kingdom.  There is no formal agreement with the United Kingdom hospitals.  Public patients are approved for travel by their local health board.  I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by patients in having to travel to the United Kingdom but the caseload is small and it is difficult to build expertise.</P>
      <P>The Department requested the Mater Hospital to prepare proposals concerning the feasibility of establishing a heart-lung transplant programme. We are listening to advice but there are a number of problems, including the cost involved, the small number of patients who require transplants and the consequent problem of building expertise in this area.  Unless there is sufficient throughput, the consultants involved do not have sufficient cases to build expertise to the desired level.  Other issues also arise.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the experience gained in establishing the liver transplant programme, we should be able to make some progress along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  Many patients travel to Harefield.  I envisage Irish consultants travelling to a United Kingdom hospital on a term basis to build expertise and applying the skills learned here.  No decision has been made as to the location.  This is being explored by consultants at the Mater Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the Mater Hospital asked to prepare proposals concerning the feasibility of establishing a heart and lung transplant programme here?  If there would be insufficient throughput, one could argue against establishing such a facility.  If arrangements cannot be made with the three United Kingdom hospitals mentioned, transplants cannot be carried out.  In the meantime patients will die as a result.  To resolve the problem there is a need for a <i>modus operandi.</i> When does the Minister expect the Mater Hospital to present its submission and what formal arrangements can be made with the United Kingdom hospitals to ensure availability given the emergency nature of the operation involved?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The contacts with the United Kingdom hospitals are well developed.  Contact was made with the Mater Hospital in late 1995 and it made its proposal in <Col N="1402" /> December of that year but it was overtaken by other events.  We have asked four hospitals to tender for a major cardiac unit to cater for 500 cases.  Galway, Cork, the Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital have submitted proposals.  A recommendation has not yet been made, but a decision should be made shortly.  That is one of the factors which impinges on the other issue. Those who work in a cardiac unit who have expertise, for example, in the area of heart transplants &mdash; approximately 130 have been carried out at the Mater Hospital &mdash; would have the expertise necessary in the area of heart-lung transplants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree this unit would be cost effective as the personnel, vascular surgeons etc. are already available?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The approach I take will ensure there is an arrangement with the centres of expertise in the UK, particularly at Harefield, so that Irish cases are dealt with on referral from Irish hospitals.  However, there is also a wider issue involved.  As Deputies are aware, despite the progress made by the Government, there are still significant waiting lists for elective surgery.  Some of the waiting lists which must be attacked by way of investment are in the cardiac area, for example, the waiting lists for double by-pass, triple by-pass and heart transplant operations.  This is the priority I referred to when I said four tenders are with the Department for units which would be able to cope with 500 operations a years.  A decision on these will be made shortly and, in that context, it may be possible to put in place here the facility now available to Irish citizens in the UK.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I refer the Deputy to previous replies I have given on this matter, the most recent being on Thursday, 17 April last.  It is the Government's intention that retired nurses and other public servants will benefit from the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructuring, as provided for under <Col N="1403" /> the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement.This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers, gardaí etc. who have concluded or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the PCW.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in many cases even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this question will now have to be considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.  Consideration is being given by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to the implications of the restructuring deals for existing pensioners and pensions increase policy across the public service.  Discussions are ongoing between the Department of Finance and the Public Services Committee of ICTU about this matter.When this general policy issue has been resolved my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to pensions of retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this matter is receiving attention.  This group of retired nurses are concerned about safeguarding their pensions but I accept the Minister's statement that the restructuring deals have more widespread implications. Did this matter arise during the Partnership 2000 negotiations, was it anticipated and has the Minister met this group of retired nurses to discuss his policy in this area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the latter question, like the nurses, the retired nurses are represented by five unions.  At the SIPTU conference in Westport I met a delegation of retired nurses represented by SIPTU.  I met a similar delegation at the Psychiatric Nurses' Association conference in Ennis.  The INO conference will be held in Athlone tomorrow and while I have not arranged to meet a delegation I would be surprised if they were not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if the matter was discussed in the context of Partnership 2000 as there are ongoing arrangements between the Department of Finance, other Departments and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this issue.  The difficulty is not a reluctance by the Departments of Health or Finance to agree in principle that an increase in pensions should ensue from the increased pay given to nurses following the Labour Court negotiations.The difficulty arises because under phase three of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> people can get a flat rate increase of 3 per cent, which can be negotiated upwards in exchange for productivity.  Different grades and people got different increases.  What is being worked out between the Department of Finance and the Public Services Committee of ICTU is the detail of how it will be applied.  There is no question but that there will be an increase in pensions; <Col N="1404" /> the matter at issue is the amount for the relevant level of service.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Labour Court recommendations on nurses' pay did not include a specific recommendation which was applicable to the pensions of retired nurses. However, nothing would hinge on this as there are general agreements of an historic nature under which general pay round increases are passed on to pensions.  The difficulty here arises from the fact that this was negotiated under phase three of the PCW.  The details of what will be added on are being worked out by the Department of Finance and the Public Services Committee of ICTU.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Deputy Deasy, it is not the case that retired nurses will not benefit, they will benefit.  The details are being worked out at present.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government included an undertaking to examine the possibility of dividing the two roles currently exercised by the Attorney General, legal adviser to the Government and the upholder of the public interest.  It also includes an undertaking to ensure that holders of high office of the State are more accountable to the Legislature.  The Government has decided, either through the Attorney General or the Chief State Solicitor, that the Chief State Solicitor will not appear before a meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs two and a half hours from now, despite the fact that the committee unanimously agreed to this last week.  I understand from newspaper reports and letters that the Attorney General, or the Chief State Solicitor who reports to the Attorney General, took this decision having regard to the principle of lawyer-client confidentiality, if such principle exists in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> In the light of this dilemma, which I am sure the Minister disapproves of based on what is contained in the programme for Government, will he, on behalf of the Government, waive the confidentiality rule?  It is the Government's privilege to waive the confidentiality rule and, if that is done in the next two and a half hours, we will be in a position to proceed with what the committee unanimously agreed to last week, namely, that the Chief State Solicitor should come before the committee to explain the legal strategy in the McCole case.  I am sure all sides of the House agree with this request because it was unanimously agreed last week in committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the matter.  The leader of the Opposition will agree that I cannot unilaterally agree to waive such a matter on behalf of the Government without Government consideration.  I understand, however, that the Attorney General is sending a comprehensive and detailed letter to the committee mentioned by the Deputy which should clarify the point.  The Deputy has raised issues with regard to the programme for Government which are in order.  My understanding is that the group of experts examining the position of legal officers has not yet recommended how to proceed in relation to that commitment in the programme for Government. On the question of confidentiality, I will talk to the Attorney General but I understand his letter is comprehensive and will answer the questions and concerns of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comment that he will consult the Attorney General after the Order of Business, but since I cannot attend that meeting I emphasise to him that the legal advice given to this side of the House &mdash; we checked this with a number of legal representatives during the day since this issue was raised on national radio and in one of the newspapers this morning &mdash; is that the principle of lawyer-client confidentiality does not exist in this case.  Even if it did exist, it would be a matter for the Government to waive that rule.  It is not a matter for the Attorney General.  I am sure the Attorney General will have advised the Government on developing this strategy.  I do not know what is in the letter from the Attorney General.  I know from my colleagues who are on the committee that the only letter they received so far was from the Chief State Solicitor setting out the case.  I am sure the Attorney General advised the Government that it has the right to waive the confidentiality rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important matter.  The Bridget McCole case was a terrible indictment of the State for what it did to the individual on her deathbed.  It needs to be addressed and all parties in this House unanimously agreed that this procedure be followed.  If we are to have any role in democracy in this House, this matter has to be addressed before 7 p.m. this evening.  I trust that <Col N="1409" /> the Government will see that this matter is rectified before then.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Ahern has said.  It is fair to say in the case of the late Mrs. Bridget McCole that no Irish citizen was ever treated so badly by the Government of her own country.  The Government has to accept political responsibility for the legal strategy because Minister Howlin made it clear that the Cabinet made a decision in relation to that matter.  Given that that is the case and that the Government can waive the confidentiality rule, I ask the Minister for Finance to agree to Deputy Ahern's request.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 35 and 36, the following inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  in relation to the appointment of a new governing authority after the suspension of a governing authority of a university under section 20 (4), the Visitor of that university,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seanad Éireann made these amendments relating to the suspension of the governing authority to address concerns expressed in Seanad Éireann. The effect of the amendments will mean the visitor <Col N="1415" /> will now consult with persons within the university, as well as the Minister, on the person or persons to act as the governing authority until the new governing authority is appointed.  The visitor will ensure that a new governing authority is put in place as soon as practicable after suspension. The period of suspension, however, cannot exceed one year.  Following the period of suspension the visitor will perform the functions of the commission in determining the composition of the new governing authority and will consult within the university while acting in this capacity. I propose that the House support these amendments.</P>

      <P>We welcome an opportunity to discuss the amendments from the Seanad which, in addition to the amendments passed in this House, represent a significant and radical overhaul of the original Bill.  I commend those who tabled amendments in the Seanad, particularly Senators Ormonde, Tom Fitzgerald, Lee, Norris and Henry.  At the end of the process we have a much improved Bill.  Regarding these amendments, we were of the view when the Bill was before us on previous occasions that the visitor's role should be strengthened and additional powers should be given.  In that context we welcome these amendments.</P>

      <Col N="1416" /> Amendment No. 1, which deals with the visitor's role, is sensible.  There was a great deal of discussion about this matter in the other House.

      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;(1)  A university, in performing its functions shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  have the right and responsibility to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of its internal and external affairs, and</P>
      <P>(b)  be entitled to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and traditions and the traditional principles of academic freedom, and in doing so it shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the promotion and preservation of equality of opportunity and access,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the effective and efficient use of resources, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  its obligations as to public accountability,</P>
      <P>and if, in the interpretation of this Act, there is a doubt regarding the meaning of any provision, a construction that would promote that ethos and those traditions and principles shall be preferred to a construction that would not so promote.</P>
      <P>(2)  A member of the academic staff of a university shall have the freedom, within the law, in his or her teaching, research and any other activities either in or outside the university, to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions and shall not be disadvantaged, or subject to less favourable treatment by the university, for the exercise of that freedom.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an interesting amendment.  Debate on this issue began in select committee and continued in the Seanad with contributions from all parties including independent Senators.  Seanad Éireann made the amendment in response to concerns <Col N="1420" /> expressed in both Houses and amendments proposed by a number of Senators to insert a separate section after section 13 dealing with academic freedom and institutional autonomy.  The amendment has particularly benefited from the freedom of expression we enjoy within the House.  The new section explicitly states that a university, in performing its functions, shall &ldquo;have the right and responsibility to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of its internal and external affairs&rdquo;.  The new section repeats what was in the original section 13 (3), which has now been deleted.  The new section 14(2) provides that:</P>
    <P>the academic staff of the university shall have the freedom, within the law, in [their] teaching research and other activities either in or outside the university, to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions and shall not be disadvantaged, or subject to less favourable treatment by the university, for the exercise of that freedom.</P>
    <P>If the universities find within themselves a forum for that, we can look forward to more academics joining this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important improvement to the Bill.  It is almost a carbon copy of amendments we tabled on Committee Stage, particularly the new subsection (2) dealing with the rights of members of academic staff to engage in research and, in the course of teaching and other activities, to be entitled to question the conventional wisdom of the day emanating from the State or the Government.  Academics should be allowed to voice their opinions on controversial issues and many do so when it is not in accordance with the wishes of their collage authorities or the Government of the day.  In the select committee I was told there was no need for such an amendment but it is necessary in the context of a Bill which endeavours to provide a modern legislative framework for our universities.  We strongly fought to have it included on Committee Stage and it was regrettable that did not happen.  It is an illustration of how numbers determine the wording of a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The current composition of the Seanad left it in a position to exercise considerable political leverage on the Minister, which resulted in considerable improvements to the Bill. Unfortunately we did not have the numbers in the select committee or in this House but at least our good friends and colleagues in the Seanad were able to force through changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may be the most important amendment in that it guarantees the academic staff of universities academic freedom, which has been the core <Col N="1421" /> characteristic of our universities since their commencement.That freedom has served the country well and has been a positive characteristic of our democracy.  We see evidence of this in those who have been nominated and elected to the Seanad from the universities.  They have an independent spirit and have expressed viewpoints which have emerged through the Seanad into the public arena.  Our national debate has been enriched by the contributions of academics throughout the land.  We may not like what they say at times and certain remarks may grate on those in authority but this is a necessary method of opinion forming and an important contribution to our democratic process.  I am delighted with the amendment and commend Seanad Éireann for giving effect to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the new section on academic freedom.  As we said many times on Committee and Report Stages, this issue is of fundamental importance and it is essential to have it contained in this Bill.  This amendment is much more comprehensive than those we put forward on Committee Stage, which shows us the benefit of the discussions in the other House.  I am glad the Minister has been persuaded to include in the Bill this fundamental right in such a comprehensive manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposes to allow governing bodies of universities to contain up to 40 members.  When the Bill was originally published it provided for 32 members, which was subsequently increased to 38.  Why was it decided to fix the figure at 40 &mdash; was it to provide additional representation for county councillors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the amendment in conjunction with amendments Nos. 16 to 18, inclusive, he will see why the figure was chosen.  The proposal concerns the representation of county councillors.  There was an interesting and passionate debate on this in the Seanad, in which support for county councillors serving in public office in this way crossed party lines.  To ensure we did not reduce the number of county councillors on the larger governing bodies, we fixed a maximum figure of 40.  The Deputy's party supported this proposal in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provided the most interesting debate on the Bill in the other House.  It stressed the relevance of those of us who stand for public office, with or without political affiliation, because county councillors are close to the daily lives of our young people and those we hope will benefit, through their aegis, from the massive investment in universities and the modern framework of legislation.  That role was well recorded <Col N="1422" /> by all parties in the Seanad and I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to say this.  The maximum figure ensures that the number of county councillors need not be reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the amendment. Senators Fitzgerald and Ormonde led our party's debate in the Seanad and this issue was close to their hearts.  I am glad they and other Senators succeeded in thwarting different viewpoints.  We should not the important role of county councillors and public representatives generally.</P>
      <P>Democracy is about the will of the people. There is a tendency to undermine the role of public representatives at local level but they are democratically accountable to the people and must fact them for election.  That introduces an important dimension to the activities of governing bodies and other institutions involved in decision making on behalf of the people.  Those who do not have to go before the electorate on a regular basis can become complacent or arrogant, although not all do &mdash; there are notable examples in the Chamber at present.  In the past the role of public representatives was gradually undermined, perhaps unwittingly.  We must reassert the importance of electing people to public bodies because they are ultimately answerable for their actions.</P>

I note, with some regret, that our views on the Irish language were not listened to in this House. However, I welcome the amendment, particularly the specific references to using the Irish language as &ldquo;a language of general communication&rdquo; and promoting &ldquo;the cultivation of the Irish language and its associated literary and cultural traditions&rdquo;.

      <P>These issues were strongly debated on Committee Stage in this House and, while they could not be resolved at that time, were subsequently resolved in the Seanad.  I realise that people can be influenced by the very stimulating and creative debate in the Seanad, where some very good contributions were made on this Bill on both sides of the House.  However, one could draw the conclusion that, in addition to the stimulating, creative and influential arguments put forward by Senators, the numbers in the Seanad concentrated the Minister's mind.</P>
      <P>Historically, there has always been a trend of Ministers opposing amendments for the sake of it.  However, many of these amendments which were accepted in the Seanad were strongly opposed by the Minister in this House.  I know it was a long debate, but the Minister got quite tetchy at times and said there was no need for several amendments which she subsequently accepted in the Seanad.  That illustrates the trend of Ministers being reluctant to accept amendments in the Dáil because of a nation that to do so would represent capitulation or a concession. However, when numbers dictate otherwise in the Seanad, Ministers can suddenly find the wherewithal and flexibility to accept amendments which could not be accepted a month earlier.  I pay tribute to the Senators for using the leverage at their disposal because it has resulted in a better Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, particularly in so far as it relates to the academic council, is very important. Considerable concerns were expressed by the academic staff of many universities about their fear of losing a degree of involvement in the academic policy of the university and the dilution <Col N="1428" /> of their role in that regard.  The amendments aim to improve their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the academic council.  The registrar is also included in the amendment.  This was proposed, but rejected, on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure there will be no restriction on a member of a governing authority representing at meetings of the governing authority the views of those by whom she or he had been elected.  This gave rise to concern in a number of institutions.  Freedom of expression of members is underpinned in the section, while <Col N="1429" /> recognising that they can represent the views of those by whom they have been elected.  It is a good amendment.</P>

      <P>The amendment owes much to the campaigning zeal of the staff members of the University of Limerick who were relentless in pursuing this issue.  At the outset of this debate we identified the democratic nature of the universities as being central to their future role.  Members of governing bodies are democratically elected and they represent specific faculties within universities and specific interests, be they of students, academic or non academic staff, etc.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was published there was a view that an attempt was being made to eradicate this democratic dimension to university life and that the new governing bodies would be similar to semi-State boards or corporate bodies, where they would not be answerable.  Members of governing bodies were told this would be their future position.  This is why the staff members of the University of Limerick were anxious to have the amendment accepted.  It accords with my view on the importance of democracy and accountability to university life, provided that those with responsibility act in the best interests of the university.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and on confirmation by the Oireachtas it shall become effective immediately.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, the Minister advised that the wording of this section, including subsections (2) and (3) has been used previously.  However, given the extraordinary nature of the wording and given that I have been advised that it is possibly unconstitutional that a Minister should, by regulation, change an Act, perhaps the Minister would consider this amendment.  It would make it incumbent upon a Minister introducing regulations under the section to lay them before the House for debate if necessary.  The amendment is proposed in a constructive spirit of co-operation in an attempt to avoid doubts that may arise in the future.  In view of this, will the Minister consider accepting the amendment?</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the manner in which section 2(3) has been drafted.  It is far too wide and vague.  On reading it I wondered what snakes were lurking in the grass?  What powers are being sought to be given to any Minister in the future?  Are we being asked to grant powers to introduce a poll tax or a community tax?  If so, we should say so and debate the matter in this House.</P>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; in page 5, line 19 terrifies me.  It may be a Freudian slip but expediency is the hallmark of the water charges issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> Water charges were introduced by the leader of Minister Howlin's party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.  However, in recent days the Minister condemned those charges at length.  He pointed out all the flaws in the old system which he proposes to abolish.  This is despite the fact that the leader of his party introduced this faulty system.  The Minister's party has failed in political terms to demonstrate a principled approach to water or service charges.  It has taken an expedient approach and the Bill is a further example of expediency.  I am not prepared to give a range of unspecified powers to any Minister and this is why I seek the deletion of section 1.  The Minister should draft a much more definite section and introduce such a provision on Report Stage.  This would ensure that Members are aware of the scope and nature of the law.</P>

      <P>The tributes were merited.  Deputy Dempsey's initial contribution to this debate heartened me greatly.  I felt we could do constructive business on this legislation as we have on many Bills in the last two and a half years.  Unfortunately, my confidence in that was quickly shattered by Deputy Quill's contribution and her reference to snakes in the grass.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is greatly concerned about this section but I remind her of the genesis of this snake in the grass.  The section is modelled word for word on section 52(3) of the Local Government Act, 1991, which was introduced by my most venerable predecessor, former Deputy Flynn, as Minister for the Environment.  He was ably assisted by the then Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Harney.  I felt it would be meritorious to repeat those phrases in this legislation.I do not ascribe to those authors the malevolence Deputy Quill attributes to the phrases.</P>
      <P>This enabling provision is replicated in a number of local government Acts.  The drafting of section 52(3) of the Local Government Act, 1991, by former Deputy Flynn and Deputy Harney was so good that it was replicated in section 3(7) of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993, section 66 of the Local Government Act, 1994, and section 3(7) of the Harbours Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is another Harneyism. This short-term enabling provision tidies up other complex legislation, if that is required.

      <P>The purpose of the provision is to ensure that any difficulties which arise can be addressed.  I gave careful consideration to Deputy Dempsey's amendment because I tabled many amendments when I was in Opposition which were affirmative resolutions rather than annulling provisions.  I am persuaded, perhaps badly, that this type of short-term measure, which will not apply after two years, is a tidying up mechanism. Issues may arise which could not be confirmed positively by resolutions of the House.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

Regardless of how venerable the Minister's predecessors, former Deputy Flynn and Deputy Harney were, the notion that we have got away with it so far is not a good reason to refuse to take the amendment on board.</P>
      <P>Legal advice is similar to two-handed economists who give different views by saying on the one hand and then on the other.  However, my advice is that if actions taken by the Minister under regulations in this section, particularly if they relate to changing an existing Act, of the Oireachtas, are challenged, they could be deemed unconstitutional.

      <P>Fianna Fáil's policy is that motor taxation revenue should not be used for the provision of local government services.  It is bad precedent and a bad principle to expect one sector of the community to pay for the provision of local government services.  The amendment provides that the motor taxation revenue which the Minister proposes to use to finance local government will be used specifically for the repair, upkeep, maintenance and provision of county roads and that the funding of local authorities should come from general taxation.  It is important that motorists see their motor tax being expended on roads, county roads in particular.Despite the efforts undertaken over the past three or four years, and acknowledging the Minister's role over the past two years, for the repair and upkeep of county roads, a lot remains to be done.  I am convinced motorists would prefer to see their motor tax being used specifically for the upkeep of our roads rather than go into the maw of central government.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment, thereby ensuring the remainder of local authorities' funding will come from general taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment reads: &ldquo;An annual percentage of the said car tax moneys shall be specifically designated for road related works...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I support the principle of motor tax collected locally being expended locally, closely aligned with which is another, that moneys contributed by motorists be spent specifically on their needs. Irish motorists are among the most highly taxed and worst served within Europe in that the condition of our roads generally, particularly county ones, remains deplorable.</P>
      <P>City roads in particular have emerging needs <i>vis-à-vis</i> upgrading traffic management, traffic lights and generally their repair and reinstatement, many of which are on the point of disintegration and must be addressed.  Among the most frequent annual complaints to Bord Fáilte by overseas tourists are those in respect of the quality of our roads, road safety, directional and traffic signs.  As I said on Second Stage, there is an unacceptably high annual level of fatal accidents on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this underlines the need for a substantial, specific investment in upgrading and reinstatement of road surfaces, particularly in cities and secondary or county roads, in upgrading traffic <Col N="1434" /> management and the promotion of greater road safety.  For those reasons I ask the Minister to take account of the spirit of my amendment &mdash; although I was sorely tempted I did not stipulate a precise percentage &mdash; and respond positively. Within the context of the present proposal &mdash; providing that moneys contributed by motorists are expended locally &mdash; the very least we can do is set aside a percentage of motor taxation to be spent specifically on projects that would yield better value and return to its contributors.</P>

      <P>As a member of two local authorities which have just concluded the business of my constituency &mdash; county council and urban council &mdash; I respectfully suggest that the Minister should not accept this amendment.  It runs counter to the whole spirit of what has been communicated by management to local authorities and the figures presented this year for the running of our constituency, roads, water schemes and other services.Ring-fencing a particular percentage of funding from road tax for a specific purpose runs counter to the principle of the Minister's proposals for refinancing local authorities, through a specific allocation of funding, with the relevant equalisation clause.</P>
      <P>It should also be remembered that the National Roads Authority allocations this year are the largest ever, to the extent of allowing some of next year's work to be undertaken this year.  The record must be set straight, emphasising that for the first time more funds are being made available for primary and county roads, agreed by local authorities at their estimates and other area roads meetings.</P>
      <P>Acceptance of these amendments would throw all local authorities into turmoil.  I hope the movers of these amendments realise that their acceptance would create an awful lot of disturbance within local authorities' financial structures.</P>
      <P>I hope it is not out of order to suggest that the Minister should not accept them for those reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support section 3 for much the same reasons just enunciated by Deputy Ferris, if only on a constituency basis.  This Bill is very welcome in the Wicklow-Kildare constituency to become the Wicklow-Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody familiar with local authority financing will be aware that a county like Wicklow has a very small commercial and industrial rate base, where there is in progress probably one of the largest local authority and private housebuilding programmes ever which, while very welcome, carries attendant problems.  It must be borne in mind that the rate support grant has been gradually dwindling while the cost of maintaining services has risen consistently because of the greater numbers of people living in the county.  Its population has grown from just under 60,000 when I first became a Member of this House in 1969, to well in excess of 100,000 and has exerted a great deal of pressure on existing commercial and industrial <Col N="1435" /> ratepayers since the introduction of water rates.  I have heard comments to the effect that I introduced water rates.  I want to set the record straight and say I did not, I merely implemented an earlier decision.  When introduced they amounted to approximately £30 and have now risen to over £180.  This means that each time Wicklow County Council wishes to provide services in the county it has two options open to it, to increase the commercial or industrial rate or increase water charges.  Indeed it is somewhat galling to live in a county that produces most of the water for the city of Dublin and discover that, particularly within the area for which Dublin Corporation has responsibility, people did not have to pay water rates simply because of the huge commercial and industrial rate base in the county. It would probably be true to say that the valuation of one hotel in this city would be commensurate with the total valuation of all hotels in County Wicklow, including urban areas.</P>
    <P>While greater numbers of people opted to live in County Wicklow, they made no direct contribution to any local or urban authority in Arklow, Bray or Wicklow, where the demand for services is constantly increasing.</P>
    <P>Since most of those who have settled in County Wicklow are motorists, the increased allocations for the maintenance of our roads, including the improvements in progress on the N11 and N81 and county ones, are indeed welcome.  It is my hope and no doubt that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; who I hope will continue to share the constituency with me for many years to come &mdash; that the problems encountered by the relevant local authorities will be alleviated, enabling them to provide the requisite services without having to impose increased water charges on house-holders in the county.  I would be the first to agree that when those charges were introduced they were regarded as supplementary income to existing rates.  It was assumed that the rate support grant would keep pace with the amount of building taking place, but that did not happen.  Much private building has been undertaken in the county and that has not been taken into account since 1985.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very welcome.  Will the Minister say how much money will be transferred to the four local authorities in the county?  In the urban council in Wicklow the £270,000 at present collected in water charges will in future be collected from elsewhere.  We will always have car tax.  I remember fighting the 1977 election &mdash; perhaps my memory of what happened under various Governments is too long &mdash; but at that time car tax was reduced to £5 per car.  It was thought that would continue, but that did not happen.  The Government of that time made a mistake.  Since then car tax has increased to such an extent that I paid £300 last week.</P>
    <P>The abolition of car tax would be very foolish. The proposed system is fair because, for example, the number of people who own cars in my constituency <Col N="1436" /> is very large whereas the number of people paying rates is very small.  The Bill will be fair to counties such as Wicklow where £1 in rates on commercial and industrial buildings brings in £35 &mdash; in Kildare the figure is about £60 and in Meath it is between those two amounts.  Each year when the Estimates are considered, cutbacks are made in services, repair of local authority houses and the provision of services, including those required for new housing estates.  I hope the Opposition does not interfere with this Bill, if the opportunity arises in the near future.  I would not like to have to explain to the people of Wicklow the damage that could do to the constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's enthusiasm to support Deputy Kavanagh's interjection.  We are talking about the meat of the Bill, section 3, which provides that car tax, instead of being remitted to the Exchequer, will henceforth be retained by local authorities.  That thoroughly progressive and good move is welcomed by most people interested in the protection and enhancement of local government, a point very ably made by Deputies Ferris and Kavanagh.Practitioners on the ground, and I am sure some Deputies opposite, know it is time to make this substantial change.  This ring-fenced pool of money, instead of being sucked into the Exchequer, should be available to local government, without central Government telling it in a patronising way that the money may be spent only at its direction.  The money should be available to local government to spend as it chooses. That is what empowering local government means, and for that reason I cannot accept the amendments which dictate to local government how the money should be spent.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of Better Local Government &mdash; Programme for Change has been the empowerment of local government, to free it from the diktat of central Government.  I have listened very carefully and I have heard no alternative proposal.  The Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy Dempsey, posited a return to the old system, calling it a designated share of central taxation.In other words, take your chances on a renamed rate support grant, with a ring-fenced percentage on income tax.  People believe that they pay enough income tax, but if we are to give new resources to local government under Deputy Dempsey's proposal, we would have to increase income tax, of which nobody is in favour.  I have heard nobody say that income tax should be increased to pay for local government, and I do not believe the Progressive Democrats, the erstwhile partners of Fianna Fáil, would support that view.  We have carefully considered a ring-fenced, buoyant system of taxation.  We know that car tax will be available and is increasing in volume terms &mdash; the volume of car ownership increases as we become more prosperous as a people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be buoyancy.  Deputy Quill lives in a city, but for most people the car is the only way to get around, and I will not ban cars, as some Deputies would favour.  Like Deputy Kavanagh, I represent a rural constituency where there are no public transport options, nor will there be for a very long time.  We have a disparate population, with the most recent census showing 3.6 million people, and long may that position remain.  We do not want everybody concentrated into a few urban areas.  We want to allow local populations and rural life to thrive, and this Government has done more than its share to encourage that &mdash; my Department supported the road restoration fund.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill made a very good point about road safety, on which she has a very strong view, which I share, and she has expressed it more than once.  I am horrified at the tragedies of last weekend when many young people in particular lost their lives.  We have tried to address many different aspects of road safety.  I commissioned a full assessment of road safety policy last year and, bringing together all the agencies involved in road safety, I launched the national road safety together campaign, which has been very successful in increasing public awareness.  By the end of last year almost £2 million was spent by the NRA on a programme of safety measures at high accident locations on the national road network and a further £1 million has been spent this year on that programme.</P>
      <P>A programme of radio and television advertising was launched by the National Safety Council, targeting particular areas of concern such as drink driving, excessive and inappropriate speeds, alerting people to the danger to elderly pedestrians and encouraging the wearing of seat belts.  I have involved local authorities in a much more proactive way in road safety and the Garda in training.A comprehensive traffic signs manual was published to ensure a single signing system throughout the country &mdash; that has issued to every local authority.  In co-operation with the Department of Justice, I introduced, by regulation, on-the-spot fines for speeding, offences which came into effect on 1 December last.  Many of us will have seen unmarked Garda cars patrolling the main national routes checking for speed &mdash; one or two of our colleagues here discovered that in recent times.  Between 1 December 1996 and 15 February 1997, the most recent figures available, 1,816 such fines were imposed under this provision, and that is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> I know from speaking to people that if stopped once, especially by an unmarked police car, it impacts on them.  We need to keep reviewing the matter.  I am extremely worried at the number of young people who are killed in the middle of the night, particularly from motorcycles.  Unfortunately I do not have an instant solution to this problem but I mention it because we will have to think out some basic way of dealing with it.  We cannot allow the death toll accident toll to increase ever more.  We have expended quite an amount of money on it but it must go beyond money.  It may be that we will have to be draconian in issuing licences, particularly to those more vulnerable.  It does not come under this Bill but it is the gist of what is encompassed in Deputy Quill's amendment, in which she has a particular interest.</P>
    <P>What I have said runs counter to the heart of the programme of funding local government, to take funding away from them.  I have no intention of doing that.  I want to give them the freedom to spend this new buoyant source of funding.  I want to have it enshrined in law and free from the control of my Department and the Department of Finance.  This is the first time a ring fenced source of funding will be available to local authorities, 80 per cent of which they will keep.  The other 20 per cent will come under the control of the equalisation council which I will establish and they will determine its expenditure.  They will be able to use it not only for funding good local government but for taking particular initiatives on quality which resonates through the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill.  For those reasons I am not prepared to accept the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is time to make a change in financing local government but I disagree fundamentally with the change the Minister is making.  I do not believe the whole system of local government should be towed behind the family car.  It is sending out all the wrong signals that local government services should be provided by the motorists.  That is the perception. The Minister said he had heard no other proposal but he proceeded to talk about the Fianna Fáil proposals in relation to local government.  It is obvious he heard of them but I am not sure he understands them fully and I will not go into any detail in explaining them to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>None.  It would not be necessary to cut services if the Government kept its expenditure within the limits and did not introduce many new expenditures.  Under the Fianna Fáil proposal, on the basis of net tax receipts, the buoyancy between 1995 and 1996 would be £50 million extra that would have been available to local authorities.  We continually hear from the Government about the good economy and how things are booming and so on but we hear less about why they are booming.  It is booming because people took decisions when they had to take them to put us in that position.  Even reducing by the miserable 1p in the pound, which the Government did this year, from 27p to 26p, the take from income tax will increase substantially. The record for every year over the past 30 years, including the years when Fianna Fáil and later with the Progressive Democrats reduced income tax from the top rate of 65 per cent to 48 per cent and at the lower rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent, shows that income from income tax increased.  That is buoyancy.  That is what I propose, a ring fenced percentage of income tax to local authorities which they would be able to spend.  This is more buoyant and allows more flexibility for local government and local government expenditure.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister has indicated there is no way he will change this, I do not propose to delay.  I know from my contacts in local authorities &mdash; there are some here who can contradict me if I am wrong &mdash; that up to the end of April most local authorities were substantially down in their income.  I do not propose to delay this Bill but I put down the marker that it will be changed when we go into Government.  I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

        <i>Absurdum</i> from the Minister.  For example, in local authority areas where there was a reluctance to pay domestic refuse charges, when the tag per bag was imposed, everybody saw what they were paying for, the reluctance began to diminish and people put a value on the service delivered to them and were prepared to pay.  That is the road down which this country will have to go.  As a consumer society we are more consumer conscious and more value conscious than ever before.  I would like our laws to respond accordingly.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to reject out of hand the principle of my amendment but to keep it in place as a worthwhile principle that should be embodied at the outset, that local authorities, at least, would be advised to spend a portion of the money from road tax on road related projects. The Minister said much today and recently about rural areas but cities have particular needs.  In my city, the road on which I live is on the point of disintegration.  The traffic lights are obsolete by about six years and there is no money to replace them, neither is there a modern traffic management system.  The Minister should accept the principle that a proportion of this money should be retained for road improvement and road safety improvement measures.  That would be a positive step in the new approach to funding local authorities.</P>
      <P>I respect what the Minister is attempting to do in promoting better road safety but it is not delivering the results.  More needs to be done and more investment must be made.  A self-respecting country would not tolerate the level of carnage which takes place on our roads with the consequent loss of life and grief caused to families.There is also a cost to motorists in terms of increasing insurance premia which arises directly from the number of accidents.  The safety issue must be tackled in a more systematic way.  There is an opportunity to take these actions in the context of my amendment.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald, is pleased with the progress in County Meath and I am pleased with the progress in County Louth.</P>
      <P>Car tax receipts should not be transferred to fund the upkeep of county roads.  If that was done there would still be potholes because the car tax receipts would not cover a quarter of the expense of the county roads structure, as Deputy Dempsey is aware.  Funds from the car tax would not cover the cost of repairing the damage to the county roads.  Members of Deputy Dempsey's party have held the post of Minister for the Environment for the most part of the last ten years.  Local authorities were starved of finance by successive Fianna Fáil Governments, in particular when in coalition with the Progressive Democrats.  Not alone were those Governments not funding roads, they were not building houses. In six years only 28 local authority houses were built in Drogheda, whereas during the period of the present Minister's tenure 300 to 400 houses have been built there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rubbish to talk about transferring car tax to the upkeep of the county roads because the receipts would not come within an ass's roar of being sufficient to repair them, never mind reinstating them.  I am glad the Deputy will withdraw <Col N="1442" /> his amendment.  I suggest Deputy Quill should do likewise with her's.</P>

For the benefit of the Deputy I would point out that the Trim-Longwood road was done in the period from 1991-94.  Somebody had better put out the message that Deputy Brian Fitzgerald had some input because the Taoiseach is claiming all the credit in County Meath.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2) (a), lines 38 to 40, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 38 down to and including &ldquo;authority,&rdquo; in line 40.</P>
      <P>This amendment goes more to the heart of the Minister's intentions than any other.  It would remove the Minister's power to change by regulation the amount of money he takes to put into the equalisation fund.  Such a power does not fit with what the Minister said about discretion in the extra powers being given to local authorities and ring-fencing the extra amounts being given to them.  It is easy to ring-fence amounts for one year if there is a possibility to change the amounts by regulation a year later.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that when Fianna Fáil removed domestic rates in 1978, the legislation guaranteed the amount that would be paid in the rate support grant to local authorities.  In 1983 the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, changed the regulations to force local authorities to provide funds from their own finances.  The Minister's sincerity about ring-fencing funds for local authorities stands or falls on whether he will accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities deserve to know for the foreseeable future how much they will get from a particular <Col N="1443" /> tax.  If the Minister retains the power to change the percentage a future Minister may decide to increase it to 30 or 40 per cent and if that were to happen the amount available directly to local authorities would be reduced.  I ask the Minister, therefore, as an earnest of his intent and good faith in providing the maximum amount of money for local authorities, to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the amendment for the reasons given by Deputy Dempsey in the first instance but also because I suspect there will be a greater than 20 per cent car tax take from Clare County Council.  The Minister has probably forgotten, but shortly after his appointment I made my final attempt during the Adjournment debate to have the rate support grant to Clare County Council substantially increased on the basis that under the system operated by him and his predecessors it was the only local authority in the country to receive less than it would have received by way of rates on Government property in the county.  The Minister's officials know the reasons for this.  If the Minister retains the right to take more than 20 per cent, it is likely that Clare County Council and at least two others that I can think of will suffer.  I, therefore, have a selfish interest in the amendment.</P>
      <P>Local authorities should know the percentage of the car tax take they may retain.  Under section 7 they will have discretion to increase the take. However, local authorities which believe that more than 20 per cent may be taken from them will have no incentive to do so.  As the Minister will be able to take what he likes off the top, there will be no advantage to the local authority in question.  I, therefore, urge him to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The first principle is that all of the money raised by way of motor taxation will be retained by local government, a percentage will be taken off the top to ensure nobody will be disadvantaged under the new regime.  No local authority, either town or county council, will be worse off.  I promise that everybody will be better off and the promise will be delivered.  There are large numbers of cars registered in the functional areas of the Dublin local authorities.  On the other hand, the motor tax base in counties such as Leitrim is small.  There is a need, therefore, for an equalisation fund.  As Minister for Health, I looked at the principle of equalisation in health insurance.  There is a good model in Australia.  It has been replicated in this proposal which is a fair one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey wants me to carve the ratio of 80:20 in stone.  There is a certain irony in this. On Second Stage he queried its basis.  No local authority will be worse off.  Everybody should be better off.  If there are anomalies, I want to have discretion, not to take money from local government &mdash; this cannot happen because the entire <Col N="1444" /> fund is being ring-fenced for local government &mdash; but to adjust the percentage to ensure there is no windfall.  It would be in no one's interests to allow one local authority to thrive at the expense of another.  I do not believe this provision will be abused by me or any of my potential successors in five, ten or 15 years time, whenever there is a change of personnel in the Custom House.  There is a need for flexibility but it would be a bad day's work to carve the ratio in stone.  I work on the basis of the socialist principles that the meek should inherit the earth and the strong should not gain everything.  We need to ensure that everybody thrives under these proposals.  The money will be distributed in such a way that everybody will get a reasonable share.  That is a principle the Deputies opposite, on reflection, could support.</P>

      <P>The pool is buoyant and they will get a fair percentage of it back this year.  There will be more focused measuring criteria based on the audit and efficiency principles in the programme for local government which has been heartily welcomed by the Deputy's party and the Progressive Democrats.  These principles will <Col N="1446" /> determine payments in the future.  This is as it should be as the one thing I discovered on taking office is that inefficient local authorities come cap in hand to the Department demanding more rate support grants to bail them out, while those who run their affairs well, effectively and efficiently do not come cap in hand seeking help.  There is an almost inbuilt incentive to help those authorities who are not good and this must be changed.  The procedures set out in the local government strategy for value, efficiency and performance audits, tables of performance and a bill of rights for individual citizens will ensure efficiency and effectiveness.I want some of the money available under the equalisation fund to go to specific quality initiatives.</P>
      <P>Nobody will be worse off under this proposal unless something dramatic happens some time in the distant future in regard to the funding which we cannot foresee.  This is why I want flexibility. The amendment will set the 80-20 per cent divide in stone.  The entire 100 per cent is available for local government and I want flexibility to ensure that anomalies which arise in the future can be addressed without us having to introduce primary legislation.</P>

      <P>Dublin is not a self-contained city and its citizens, including motorists, expect to be able to travel to the country.  Members of local authorities know there has to be an equalisation fund as otherwise counties such as Leitrim and Clare would not be able to raise the same amount of funding through car registration as larger counties.Dublin Deputies seem to think the Minister is anti the city.  However, during the debates on the water charges it was stated that he was anti the country.  We have a good Minister who is pro everything.</P>

      <P>Opposition Deputies find it difficult to accept that the Government is ensuring for the first time that local authorities have some discretion in terms of how they spend their money.

However, under this proposal they will know where the money is coming from.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that if a ministerial order has to be introduced it will be brought before the House so that it can be debated and he can set out the reasons the percentage must be altered.  Local authorities have done better so far this year under this principle.  However, if this does not continue and some changes are necessary because of a lack of equalisation in certain areas then the Minister or his successor will come into the House and debate the regulation.</P>

      <P>The equalisation fund is essential in ensuring all local authorities get a fair share of the funding. Concern has been expressed by Dublin Corporation officials that they will receive less under the equalisation fund than they have received up to now.  However, I am happy to accept the Minister's assurance that this will not be the case.  The formula used by the Minister is an excellent one and I am glad we have finally found a reliable permanent means of funding local authorities which will stand the test of time.  Many of those who are critical of the fund were afraid to grasp this nettle.  They are trying to find loopholes in this procedure.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>There will not be a variety of rates.  If there are one or two glaring anomalies where some authorities get a windfall there might be a need to vary the percentage for them without varying the percentage for all authorities.  It would make a nonsense of the fund if the percentage for all authorities had to be adjusted <i>en bloc.</i> As its title suggests, everybody will be treated equally under the equalisation fund.  Authorities will not be able by virtue of geographical or other factors to get a windfall under this mechanism to the disadvantage of others.  There has to be some sharing of the buoyancy.  There may be no change in the 80-20 per cent divide this year but funds are buoyant.  As the Deputy knows, I allocated <Col N="1448" /> £100 million to local authorities in rate support grants on a temporary basis.  One hundred million pounds has already been paid in motor tax and rebated to the State to pay for money the local authorities already received, and a pool for distribution is already gathering.  I signed an order to the Central Bank instructing it that when the £100 million already paid out was reached in motor tax revenue, we would build the pool.  That pool is already building, waiting for this legislation to be available to local authorities.  The system this year will be relatively crude, namely, a percentage increase on last year based on the total volume of money available.  Nobody will be disadvantaged.We want to fine tune that in the future and discuss it with the practitioners, the General Council of County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the county managers' association.  A number of working groups of those associations are currently working on the various components of the plan for better Government.  At the end of the day we will have a stronger, more independent and vibrant system of local government than we had heretofore.That is my ambition and that will be the result of the entire programme when it is put in place in the coming years.  The programme will require further legislation.  I promise to have that enacted next year to meet the centenary of the local government system.  I hope that will be a major advance on the establishment of a much more vigorous, independent and autonomous local government system.  We must take more steps along that path but this enactment is the first significant step in regard to funding we have taken for 20 years.  We need the flexibility this section provides and I ask Deputies to reflect on the real needs of local government, and not to introduce red herrings.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (3), line 8, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or authorities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 9 empowers local authorities who collect motor tax, county councils and county borough corporations, to increase the national rate of taxation of cars and motorcycles to a maximum of 3 per cent next year and to a maximum of 6 per cent thereafter at the discretion of local authorities, and they cannot increase it thereafter unless the base is increased.  The variation, therefore, is a maximum of 6 per cent from the base. This section also provides for consultation as regards any variation in rates between county councils and urban district councils and local authorities where one collects on behalf of another.  Amendments Nos. 10 to 14 should be examined together.  By way of simple explanation, the Bill as drafted would only allow local authorities establish themselves together as independent motor taxation authorities, whereas the import of this series of amendments is to allow individual local authorities in the Dublin region become motor taxation authorities if they so choose without having to wait for every local authority to so do.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be saying that the Minister is imposing a 3 per cent increase in motor taxation.  He is not doing that.  He is capping motor taxation at 3 per cent, but if local authorities want to put a zero rating on increases on an annual basis, they are free to do so.  There is nothing in this section which compels local authorities to apply an increase in motor taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>People are interpreting this to mean it is compulsory on local authorities to increase motor taxation.  That is not stated in the section. If local authorities do not believe there is any need to increase motor taxation, they do not have to do that.  I ask the Minister to confirm that my interpretation of this section is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm this is simply an enabling provision.  Various recommendations and studies have indicated that there should be some local <Col N="1451" /> flexibility.  That is the reason I included this in the proposition to Government and why it is now before the House.  If we are to give local authorities any flexibility, we have to enable them to vary a taxation base.  If one local authority decides to cut its cloth according to measure and not increase motor taxation, and another decides to take full advantage and increase motor taxation by 3 per cent this year and 3 per cent the following year for a specified purpose, such democratic decisions will be made locally, and there will be no imposition from the centre. Deputy Bell's interpretation of the section is quite right.  It is totally voluntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I read the debate on the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983 which contained the same argument. Deputy Bell stated on local radio on a number of occasions that he did not vote for service charges in this House.  Even with the equalisation fund, and motor taxation totalling approximately £150 million going directly to local authorities, they will still need money from central Government. There is no legal imperative on local authorities to increase motor taxation, but this Bill will allow a future Minister to put the squeeze on local authorities; the Department can simply cut local authority funding, and when local authorities need money for some reason, they will be told they have the power to increase motor taxation by 3 per cent or 6 per cent.  I am just sounding a warning note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite wrong.  This is not like the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act that gave powers without limit to set charges without ceilings.  This is a capping. The maximum variation that can be allowed next year is 3 per cent, and the maximum variation that can be allowed in total under this Act is 6 per cent.  The average motor tax is £186 a year. This means a 3 per cent increase is £6 a year and a 6 per cent increase is £12 a year.  That is not a horrendous taxation imposition.  We have abolished residential property tax this year, and we have abolished water charges for the domestic consumer, so virtually every citizen is better off and will be better off next year even if every local authority increases motor taxation.  I am heartened by Deputy Dempsey's prediction that there will be a coalition Minister here next year and the year after implementing these provisions that he has promised to repeal.  I am glad he does not envisage himself being in a position to do anything about it for the foreseeable future.  The reality is that even if every local authority increased motor taxation by 3 per cent next year everybody would still be better off than they were before these provisions were introduced, and they would be better off the year after and the year after.  That is self-evident.</P>

      <P>He has to persuade the majority to support him.  I do not know how the Deputy's party operates but our party operates on the basis of doing things that are supported by our parliamentary colleagues and not doing things that are not supported by our parliamentary colleagues. That has worked extremely well up to this.  There has been a great deal of smoke in regard to this, but it is a very simple provision.  It seeks local, modest, variable powers for local authorities which are totally discretionary, but the main thrust of this is to give them their own ring-fenced untouchable fund for the first time in history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with Deputy Dempsey's emphasis.  One of the reasons I consistently led the charge against service charges over 12 years or more in my county was because of the variation in charges between different counties. In Drogheda where charges were being opposed they amounted to £75.  When they were not opposed in Dundalk they were double that, and it was also double in the county council because Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil combined voted the charges in with no opposition except from two or three councillors, including the two Labour councillors.It was opposition that kept the increases to a minimum.  When they were not opposed they got completely out of line.  There were two different charges in Navan and Trim because they are in two different local authorities.  That was one of the reasons I was so strongly opposed to charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Deputy's point with which I have sympathy, and I have expressed it to the Minister.  If local authorities increase car tax, I would prefer if all local authorities increased it rather than having a repeat of the situation that existed heretofore whereby different charges applied in different local authority areas even within the same county.  That is a danger, and I expressed that view very strongly to the Minister.  I would prefer a system whereby the same level of increase operated in all local authorities.  As I read the Bill, it is a matter for the elected representatives to make that decision. I look forward to debating this because it is a <Col N="1453" /> question of local democracy and it is a matter for local representatives to make their own decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought this section has the opposite effect to what Deputy Dempsey said in that the Minister could not pressurise the local authorities to raise more money.  In effect what he is doing is introducing a cap to ensure they cannot raise more than a certain amount. Given that we have the equalisation fund, it seems unlikely that any local authority will be anxious to establish any great variation.  Apart from that, there is a cap on the fund.  What we are doing here is giving them the option to increase it within a certain limited variation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the opportunity to move this motion on behalf of the people of Cork and the south west region generally.  During the Cork by-elections more than two years ago the Government parties gave strong commitments to develop Cork.  The Fine Gael Party in Cork said it would have a Minister at the table in future Governments of which it was a member.  There is not a Cabinet Minister from the Cork region in this Government.  That promise was reneged on by the Taoiseach even though a key electoral commitment was given during the by-elections in Cork which impacted particularly on the Cork South Central by-election.  That was not the only promise to the people of Cork during those by-elections on which he reneged.  His promise to grant an interim licence to the south coast TV deflector company has not been honoured.  Its licence application has been rejected by the Government.  Likewise, the Government failed to act on a broad range of areas affecting the economic, social and educational development of the people of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Cork are angry at the Government's neglect of the city, particularly in regard to job creation.  Despite the booming economy of <Col N="1454" /> the past few years, Cork has not benefited in terms of net new jobs.  To illustrate this point, in 1996 total IDA job announcements amounted to approximately 17,725 of which Dublin received 12,559, or 71 per cent, and Cork received 1,246, or 7 per cent.  Redundancies in Cork totalled more than 1,000.  In effect, there has not been a net increase in jobs in the Cork area under this Government.  It has neglected Cork and south west region in terms of job creation.  In the preceding year not one additional job was created in the west Cork area.  Job creation and industrial strategy is a key issue.  People from the west have expressed concern about the imbalance in job creation in areas outside Dublin.  The people of the south west are also concerned about that.  The significant imbalance in growth and development is of fundamental importance to society.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party has betrayed the people of Cork in terms of job creation and industrial policy for the city and its surrounding areas. There has been very little progress on the industrial front.  The Government got off to a bad start when the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, intervened to stop the Horgan's Quay technology park project which would have created additional jobs in the city.  A key strategy for providing jobs in Cork must be the development of high class industrial development parks which would involve the private sector in partnership with the IDA and its State agencies.  The former Minister sent out all the wrong signals in his handling of the Horgan's Quay project.  That is a sad legacy left by the Fine Gael Party in Cork.  I am not making this point in an overt partisan way but rather to outline that initiative involved an important area of the city centre which has not received good news on the industrial or jobs front for many years.  Far from undermining such initiatives, we should encourage and promote them to ensure their success. The newly announced Model Farm Road Technology Park initiative, a joint venture between the private sector and the university, deserves the State's support.  Other areas of the south west need enthusiastic promotion from this Government if jobs are to be realised.</P>
    <P>I am surprised the Government has not joined in partnership with Cork Corporation in the development of the Mahon Industrial Estate which is adjacent to the new downstream crossing and is well placed to attract worthwhile industrial projects to the city.  We have no evidence the Government is serious about promoting this key industrial park in partnership with Cork Corporation.Additional aid or assistance has not been given to the corporation to promote the Mahon Industrial Park.  Likewise, Kilbarry and Hollyhill are also starved of increased investment.  In a recent reply from the city manager to a question I tabled regarding the number of jobs created in industrial estates within the city boundaries I was informed that during 1995 and 1996 no new industries were located in any of the industrial estates within Cork city.  It is depressing for the <Col N="1455" /> people of Cork that there has been such little progress in industrial estates under the jurisdiction of Cork Corporation in the city and its surrounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional industries have not located there.</P>
      <P>There must also be a clear change in ideas, policy and strategy.  The regions outside Dublin must be given a competitive advantage in terms of attracting jobs.  We in Cork must develop more attractive industrial locations to attract industry and develop jobs in the region.  The Government must state clearly that at the centre of its strategic policy lies the location of additional industry and jobs in the Cork region.  Those unemployed for a long time suffer extreme hardship compared to those at work.  Their quality of life has been greatly diminished and undermined because of the unavailability of jobs.  The long-term unemployed in Cork deserve a better deal from the Government.  To date they have been betrayed.</P>
      <P>When in office Fianna Fáil pumped huge resources into the Ringaskiddy landbank and made available a powerful infrastructure that succeeded in attracting major industry to the lower harbour area.  The Government did not follow up on previous Fianna Fáil initiatives.  Despite the previous investment in infrastructure, the area has not attracted any major industry since this Government came into power.  The satellite towns Carrigaline, Ballincollig, Blarney and Glanmire are starved of additional jobs.  There is a clear need for a Government commitment to promote the Cork region more actively and enthusiastically and to secure additional jobs for the area.  We condemn the Government for its failure to do so to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special measures are required for the northside of the city and for certain areas on the southside, such as Mahon and Togher, which endure high levels of unemployment.  Recent reports from Cork Corporation's planning department, contained in the most recent quarterly economic monitor, indicate that unemployment levels, particularly long-term unemployment levels, are unacceptably high in such areas.  This reduces economic and social progress and exacerbates and reinforces the degree of social, economic and educational disadvantage in those areas.  The Government has not taken special initiatives that <Col N="1456" /> have impacted in any way on the capacity of the long-term unemployed in those areas to secure worthwhile jobs.  The unemployment figures for the northside were depressingly high in the corporation's reports.  This outlines the failure of the Government to make serious inroads into the difficulties of tackling the problem of long-term unemployment on the northside of Cork, in particular, and in areas such a Mahon and Togher.</P>
    <P>In the area of urban renewal the Government has lacked imagination and creativity.  Under previous Fianna Fáil Governments significant urban renewal projects were undertaken.  Areas of the city which were previously derelict were renewed and refurbished, resulting in considerable construction work and activity.  The evidence of the success of that urban renewal programme can be seen all around the city.  We must build on that progress.  I am surprised the Government did not introduce new measures, particularly in the Finance Act, to develop new and more imaginative urban renewal programmes for the city, similar to the Temple Bar initiative in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later.  Cork requires a Temple Bar style initiative.  The historic city action plan, driven by Cork Corporation and funded by Europe, forms the basis for the development of a Temple Bar type initiative in the centre of Cork city.  Fianna Fáil, in partnership with Cork Corporation, is committed to developing such an initiative and will make provision in future Finance Acts to develop a Temple Bar style area in the city of Cork.  There may be local differences and manifestations attached to such an initiative and project, but something similar to that is needed for the city centre of Cork. Cork city has not enjoyed that type of investment or initiative.  It would be a welcome addition and could work in tandem with the historic city action plan that Cork Corporation, driven by its councillors, has so ably piloted.</P>
      <P>The Temple Bar initiative has been an outstanding success for the city of Dublin.  It has revitalised an old area of the city, brought new life back into the city and has resulted in great commercial, business and artistic activity.  It has become a major tourist attraction and celebrates great success on an ongoing basis.  We in Cork must endeavour to develop a similar initiative in our city centre area to bring people back to the city and to increase the number of visitors, thereby creating additional investment and jobs in the city centre.</P>
      <P>The expansion and development of the educational services in the city and county of Cork are critical to the region's development.  We in Cork are extremely disappointed that the Minister for Education and the Government have not shown any firm commitment to UCC, Cork Regional Technical College or post leaving certificate colleges located in the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Regarding the university, the Minister failed to follow up on a Fianna Fáil plan to acquire Our Lady's Hospital and to facilitate a major expansion on that site with the provision of funding from the Exchequer.  That commitment was given by a former Taoiseach.  Deputy Reynolds, and Deputy Ahern when he was Minister for Finance and was due to considerable lobbying by a Fianna Fáil Deputy from Cork's northside, Deputy Wallace.</P>

      <P>He put in an enormous amount of work at that time to secure that project for the university and for the people of Cork North Central who he has represented so ably and diligently down through the years.  I know from personal experience that he put his heart and soul into that project, believing it would represent a major breakthrough for the people of the north side of Cork with the location of a university campus on the Sunday's Well site.  It would have had the effect of relieving the undoubted congestion the area surrounding the existing campus suffers and would have led to a significant development on the north side in educational terms which would have made a contribution to improving and increasing access to third level education for a range of people, who traditionally have not participated to the degree we would wish.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the formation of this Government, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, jettisoned that project and killed it off.</P>

The evidence is that the Minister in the constituency is not too happy with that project and is not anxious to see it proceed.  In sharp contrast, Fianna Fáil's record on UCC has been outstanding.

      <P>That support was welcome.  It has been crucial in providing original and basic research for the electronic industries that have located in Cork.  It has emerged as a centre of excellence for micro-electronics research and has provided job opportunities for many graduates of the college.  The National Biotechnology Centre was also established at UCC under the previous Fianna Fáil Government and it has been particularly strong in the area of food research.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil sees and always saw third level education in Cork as central to the region's economic and industrial success.  Unfortunately, the Government has no such vision for the third level sector.  This was seen in the contemptuous manner in which the Minister for Education treated the Cork Regional Technical College in recent months.  We all know she unilaterally decided to award institute of technology status to Waterford a few months ago <i>via</i> a press release on a Sunday afternoon.  No one in Cork had any difficulty with the upgrading of Waterford to institute of technology status, but Cork people were aggrieved and angry about her decision to ignore Cork's compelling case for institute of technology status. She simply forgot about Cork regional technical college.  One wonders where Government Deputies from Cork were in keeping the regional technical college to the for of the Minister's mind, although knowing her as I do, I concede that would be a difficult task for them.  The Minister did not have Cork regional technical college in her overall plans.  It was the agitation and campaigning of the students, staff and management of the college that led to the formation of a higher level advisory group to advise the Minister on the entire sector.  That group's report has been published and from my first reading of it this morning. I consider it is a recipe for bureaucratic gridlock. It does not answer Cork's case initially and there is no clear light at the end of the tunnel on the status of Cork's regional technical college.  On any objective criteria Cork regional technical college should be an institute of technology.  I call on the Minister for Education to make decisions on this matter once and for all and not to engage in continual fudges.</P>
      <P>Of greater significance is that the Minister did not have Cork regional technical college in her sights in regard to this issue.  She had no vision for the institution.  It was under the last Fianna Fáil Government that funding was made available for the college's new library, further developments in the catering area and new technologies through operational funds from Europe. Fianna Fáil Governments have been very kind to Cork regional technical college in the past and have been to the forefront of its development.  It was Fianna Fáil Governments in the past that established Cork Regional Technical College along with the other regional technical colleges throughout the country.  Fianna Fáil did this out of an understanding of the need for skilled graduates necessary to attract new, modern, knowledge based industries to Cork and other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> We in Cork have been extremely proud of the role UCC and Cork regional technical college have played in the development of the educational infrastructure of the region and the economic and industrial progress resulting from the performance and success of those colleges.  Without the local initiatives and endeavour of the staff, students and management of these colleges, Cork would be very much the poorer today.</P>
    <P>The post leaving certificate colleges in Cork, The College of Commerce, Colaiste Stiofán Náofa and St. John's Central College are providing places for more than 2,000 post leaving certificate students in the city.  Those colleges have been starved of central funding for capital development.  The Government has dragged its feet in providing capital funds for their development.Structural Funds exist and were negotiated by the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour Government for the expansion and development of PLC colleges, but those funds has been very slow in coming to Leeside.</P>
    <P>Cork City vocational education committee has been to the fore in developing post leaving certificate colleges.  The management, staff and students of the colleges have been very creative and innovative in developing courses relevant to market needs in the region and have provided exciting opportunities for many young people from the region and beyond.  Yet the Government has been niggardly in its approach to these colleges.No maintenance grants are available to the students in them and not capital grants of any substances have been made available to the colleges for the purpose of extending and creating extra space for the students who are in a very overcrowded conditions at present.  In short, we in Cork must ensure that our university, our regional technical college, our institute of technology and our PLC colleges of technology form a central part of Cork's economic and social policy.These institutions will provide the skilled graduates necessary to attract the new knowledge-based industries to Cork but they require additional investment and support to do so. Fianna Fáil is committed to provide such support. Millions of pounds are being pumped into developments elsewhere &mdash; good luck to Dún Laoghaire, Castlebar and the other regions &mdash; but our central charge is that Cork has not benefited on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</P>
    <P>The Government stands indicted on the breaking the cycle initiative.  Cork was left behind in key areas.  The initiative was meant to target areas of high economic, social and educational disadvantage and when it was announced one year ago it was a cause of considerable disbelief that St. Mary's on the Hill school in Knocknaheeny and Padre Pio primary school in Churchfield were excluded from the project.  There was also much surprise that Holy Cross family school in Mahon and Togher boys' and girls' national school were also excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>All these areas have up to 80 per cent unemployment.  I have examined the socio-economic and educational data for the Knocknaheeny and Churchfield schools and no one in the INTO or otherwise involved in education in Cork can explain why they were excluded from the breaking the cycle initiative.  It smelt of political hypocrisy that some schools were given up to eight extra teachers but these schools, which were at the coalface of socio-economic and educational disadvantage, did not receive one additional teacher in last year's staffing schedules.  It is possible they may lose schools this year according to the normal pupil-teacher ratio thresholds.  No Government could stand over this.</P>
      <P>It cannot be said that St. Patrick's College drew up the criteria and the Government was not involved.  The PESP, the NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Department of Education and anyone else who collected relevant data said these areas should be targeted for economic and social development.  It is inexcusable, unacceptable and unbelievable that these schools were excluded.  I met the parents whose children attend these schools when they visited the Taoiseach to articulate their disgust at this decision.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has over the years made huge resources available to the city and county of Cork for the implementation of all aspects of the land use transportation study, or LUTS.  Having successfully negotiated large sums in Structural Funds, the Fianna Fáil Government allocated a substantial portion of that money to the Cork region.  The development of the south city link road and the northern ring road is testimony to our party's commitment to the region.  The decision to allocate more than £80 million to the Lee tunnel was a tremendous vote of confidence in the region by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Little has happened since then.  The Government's continued refusal to provide adequate funding for the Blackpool by-pass is a severe indictment of its commitment to Cork.  This by-pass is essential to relieve the congestion which is a feature of the area.  Members of Cork Corporation were shocked at the recent news that adequate funds would not be made available this year for completion of the by-pass.  Given the Government's present commitments, it may be another five years before it is completed.  This has astounded many people in the north side of the city and stands as a condemnation of the Government's commitment to the Cork area and LUTS. One wonders about the influence of the Fine Gael and Democratic Left Members from the Cork area on Government policy and fund allocation.When money is allocated to various projects and constituencies all over the country, it is surprising that a vital infrastructural project such <Col N="1461" /> as the Blackpool by-pass has not received adequate Government funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the tunnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We provided for that.  The Ballincollig by-pass is likewise an essential part of the LUTS plan.  Following the opening of the latest phase of the south city link road, huge congestion has built up in the Bishopstown area of Cork. Despite pleading with the Minister for funds to alleviate the congestion, no action has been taken.  The relief road between Ardaroistig and Curraheen will not be provided, due to lack of Government funds.  Significant progress has not been made on the Ballincollig by-pass, neither has significant grant aid been made available to Cork County Council to enable it to accelerate the project.  This by-pass is the only solution to the traffic congestion problems in the Bishopstown area.  This Government has not responded to the groundswell of emotion and anger articulated by local residents at the increase in traffic from the link road developments.  The Government has ignored this anger and decided not to allocate any additional funds to enable the by-pass to proceed and be implemented on a much quicker timescale than that originally envisaged.</P>
      <P>The Government's record on the environment has also been extremely poor.  Additional funds have not been made available to Cork Corporation for the management of the existing landfill site.  The corporation has had to borrow more than £2 million to provide for a leach treatment plant.  The Government failed to give funding from central sources to assist the corporation in dealing with a serious environmental hazard.  The corporation and Cork County Council are to be congratulated on their joint waste disposal strategy, which has been developed at local level with their own initiative and no help from central Government.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, hid behind the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle and used it to prevent additional funds being allocated to Cork to deal with its waste disposal problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the progressive and constructive approach of the local authorities, there has been no partnership approach by central Government. The Minister has not come clean on this issue. While abolishing water charges he has kept refuse charges in place in Cork and throughout the country, despite Democratic Left's promise to abolish them.  There is a good reason that such charges remain in place.  The Minister has not advised the public that refuse charges will increase significantly in the years ahead, due to the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  From my experience on the waste disposal committee of Cork Corporation, it is clear that such costs will quadruple in the coming years and refuse charges will also increase.  The Minister's policy is not to give additional funding to local authorities for modern waste disposal strategies.  The logical conclusion to be drawn from that refusal is that local charges <Col N="1462" /> for refuse collection will increase dramatically. The Minister should admit this publicly and I sound a warning that it will happen.  The recent abolition of water charges was only an election gimmick and the Minister should be questioned more carefully on his waste disposal policy, particularly the funding implications.</P>
    <P>On health matters, there has been considerable neglect of Cork, particularly of the accident and emergency and maternity services.  There are three hospital casualty departments in Cork &mdash; at Cork University Hospital, the Mercy Hospital and the South Infirmary &mdash; and the number of new patients attending each unit has increased over the past three years with no consequent increase in staffing levels.  All three A and E departments require to be extended and upgraded, particularly that at Cork University Hospital.  The resuscitation room in this hospital can only accommodate three trolleys, yet this is a designated training unit outside Dublin.  In addition, post-graduate nursing training in A and E, intensive care and coronary care is not available in Cork at present.  Nurses seeking to pursue any of these qualifications must do so in Dublin, usually at their own expense.</P>
    <P>The staffing levels in each hospital are inadequate.The steering committee for A and E services in Cork has condemned the lack of medical and nursing personnel as the major problem facing such services in the city.  There is only one A and E consultant between the three hospitals, who attends the Mercy and the South Infirmary for one three hour period each per week.  For the rest of the week these A and E departments are staffed by non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for a central, state of the art maternity unit to be located at Cork University Hospital.  We await a clear allocation of funding from the Minister for Health in this regard but so far this has not happened.  Some progress has been made but a clear commitment from the Government is required.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, to reject the licensing application from the South Coast TV deflector company illustrates the complete betrayal of the people of Cork by the Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left Government.</P>
    <P>Clear commitments were give by the Fine Gael Party on the provision of licences to South Coast. They were not honoured.  Political promises were made in a crowded hall in Carraigaline on the eve of the Cork South Central by-election.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, remembers that event very well because it played a role in his election.  Up to 1,000 people clapped the Taoiseach as he gave a solemn commitment that, on his return to power, he would immediately grant an interim licence.  He has been in power for more than two and a half years, but his Government has done a complete U-turn and rejected the application from South Coast.  The High Court placed an obligation on the Government <Col N="1463" /> to consider the licence application from South Coast.  It considered the application but rejected it, thereby making the company vulnerable to legal action from Cork Multi Channel.</P>
    <P>People are sick and tired of this cynical approach to substantive issues.  The Taoiseach should not have made that promise in Carraigaline if he was not in a position to implement it.  He clearly made it without undertaking any proper research, or he deliberately misled the people at that time.  The people of Cork will adjudicate on that in the next general election.  This issue illustrates the bankrupt approach of the Government to the Cork region and its lack of any overall vision for the people of that region.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is proud of its record in the Cork area.  The Cork-Swansea Ferry Company, which is now such a success, was restored through direct Fianna Fáil Government initiatives.  Successive Fianna Fáil Ministers gave the capital funding required for the re-establishment of that service, which was lost during the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government of the 1981-6 period.</P>
    <P>In addition, in 1987 Fianna Fáil ploughed huge additional resources into Cork Airport, resulting in extended runways, more modern radar equipment, an extension of the terminal, and an all round improvement of the airport ambience and infrastructure.  The Fianna Fáil Government succeeded in directing significant structural funds to Cork Airport.  I pay tribute to a former Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Denis Lyons, who spearheaded those initiatives and was responsible for significant funds being made available for Cork Airport and the Cork region generally.  He has a very proud record.</P>
    <P>On the infrastructural side, I have already mentioned Fianna Fáil's commitment to the implementation of the LUTS, and how it contrasts with slowing down the implementation of that strategy by the present Government.  On the environmental front, I have referred to the waste disposal issue.  In passing, I pay tribute to the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, who banned the burning of bituminous coal in the Cork city area, resulting in cleaner, healthier air for the people of Cork.  That was a very solid achievement of the former Minister, and one for which the people of Cork will remember him generously.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil intends to build on that record.  We intend to adopt a vision for the future of Cork city and the south west generally.  Central to that vision is the creation of additional jobs, the coordination of an industrial strategy involving industrial agencies and third level institutions, and the provision of additional educational services for Cork, particularly in the areas which suffer social and economic disadvantage.  We will accelerate and continue our commitment to the implementation of the LUTS strategy.  We will also join in partnership with Cork Corporation in developing a Temple Bar initiative for Cork city, <Col N="1464" /> and in further developing the urban initiative project.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt ar son na tairisceana seo anocht.  Tá dearmad déanta ag an Ríaltas ar Chorcaigh Íar-Thuaidh.This Government has failed to continue to give relevant support to industry and the necessary infrastructure in County Cork.  Fianna Fáil initiated that support by building advance factories in strategic areas and by putting the necessary infrastructure in place.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger has benefited greatly from the education system which was, in the main, put in place by Fianna Fáil Governments.  The present Government has failed to recognise the importance of our educational achievements in the greater Cork area by refusing to upgrade the Cork Regional Technical College to the Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The villages of Cork North West and the towns of Newmarket, Charleville, Millstreet and Macroom are crying out for jobs so that their well educated young people can stay in their own areas.  National schools and other relevant services have been provided but the lack of factories has decimated rural communities.  Why should the Government have to provide extra schools and facilities in Dublin when these already exist in rural areas?  Instead of forcing our young people into areas which are already overcrowded, we should provide jobs in their own areas.  Young people would bring enormous vibrancy and energy to rural areas.  They would bring security to the older generation and could bring up their children in very natural surroundings.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has done away with grants to control farm pollution.  For the first time in the history of the State, farm improvement schemes have been done away with.  This is affecting smaller farmers and pushing them off their land.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry told me last week in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that we must import cattle ear tags from France. There are many factories in Cork North West which could manufacture those tags and the people of that area would be delighted with such an industry.</P>
      <P>Lack of housing is a major problem in Charleville and, to a lesser degree, in Millstreet and Kanturk.  More extensive zoning and a wider range of house type, both private and local authority, is needed.</P>
      <P>The failure of this Left dominated Government to see the benefits of living in and supporting rural areas is alarming.  It has failed the people of my area and many other rural communities.  We must ensure that jobs are provided for people in their own areas.  If this cannot be done at a time of economic prosperity, it will never be done. Sites are available for small, medium and large industries.  Industrialists must be encouraged to avail of them.  It seems the Celtic tiger is not allowed to roam rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> When I mention rural Ireland, I think of the condition of our roads.  As Deputy Martin said, grants for main roads and by-passes of towns such as Macroom and Ballincollig have been put back. We understood a number of years ago that work on the Macroom by-pass would be well advanced by now.  However, that has been put on the back burner for another few years.  Work is being completed on the section of the N22 &mdash; the main road between Tralee, Killarney and Macroom &mdash; which goes through Ballyvourney at the moment. However, when that work commenced under a Fianna Fáil Government, the second stage was to commence at the beginning of 1997.  There has been no further mention of that &mdash; the land has not even been purchased for the road widening. That is only one of many problems with our roads under this Government.</P>
    <P>Tourism angling and other activities should be further developed.  Tourism has great employment potential, particularly in the Macroom area, which is in the centre of the Lee valley with all its natural attractions, such as mountains, rivers and lakes.  These assets are not being exploited at present.</P>
    <P>There are also cultural aspects associated with the region, including traditional music and the native language.  Fianna Fáil will continue its work to provide the infrastructure, advance factories and other facilities necessary to rejuvenate rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is depressing to hear how Deputies can be so negative about their native county and so blind to the progress that has been made in the region.  The party has repeated tired old slogans it has been turning out for as long as it has been around.  Its members do not seem to recognise that we have turned a corner with regard to enterprise.  We now have a vibrant enterprise culture, and nowhere is it more vibrant than in Cork and the surrounding regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the parties opposite should hang their heads rather than surface on the issue of employment performance.  If one examines the priorities the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government were supposed to have made for Cork it is clear that its performance with <Col N="1466" /> regard to the development of overseas industry was dismal.  In the three years it was in power it produced an average growth in employment from IDA companies of 160 jobs.  This Government has done four times better in the two years we have been in office and we are on course to do even better this year for Cork.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a strong approach to developing enterprise on the basis of simple ideas effectively delivered.  We have made it cheaper for companies to create jobs.  Two thirds of workers in employment are now on the low rate of PRSI.  That represents a cut for their employers of more than three and a half points in the PRSI burden, the tax on employment which Deputies have often talked about but about which nothing was done until the Government acted.</P>
    <P>We have also allowed companies, especially small companies, the ability to retain their profits for reinvestment and development.  There has been a tangible reduction in the corporation tax burden they must bear, from 40 per cent to 28 per cent.  Similarly, other companies have seen reductions.  This has been a very significant fillip to small companies to develop their businesses. One of the most outstanding features of Cork is the way in which indigenous industry has dramatically turned around since this Government came to power and began to implement policies that support enterprise.</P>
    <P>Equally, we have addressed one of the long running problems for small business, which is the burden of capital acquisitions tax incurred when they change hands on the death of those who established them.  We have dramatically changed business relief, up from 25 per cent to 90 per cent. A business worth £1.8 million can now transfer from father to son or daughter without incurring capital acquisitions tax at a critical time, thus ensuring that the company is not robbed of resources to overcome the challenges of change of ownership.</P>
    <P>We have delivered on our commitment to make it cheaper and easier to create a job and have also delivered in an outstanding fashion on our commitment to making it easier to take up a job.  In the couple of budgets we have implemented we have increased the personal tax free allowances by 23 per cent, increased the income tax band by 21 per cent and cut the rate of tax, combined PAYE and PRSI, by 2 per cent. That has represented a real cut of five points in the tax take for those on average industrial wages.  It is more than double the performance of the parties opposite when they were in power. We have delivered on the need to make it easier and more rewarding to take employment and to bring down the burden of tax.</P>
    <P>We have also given companies access to capital in a way that was never available before.  When the parties opposite were in power, typical interest rates were over 14 per cent for mortgages and business borrowing.  We have now brought them down to 6.8 per cent for mortgages and <Col N="1467" /> there have been similar reductions for business borrowings.  Small businesses and business generally has been able to access borrowing to fund their investment plans.</P>
    <P>Not content with that, we have also made sure that there are targeted measures to support small businesses, including the £200 million small business loan scheme and the £60 million seed and venture capital programmes.  These represent real benefits to businesses seeking to expand.</P>
    <P>Cork and the south-west region have responded magnificently to these improvements in the environment for doing business in Ireland. The impact has been spectacular.  The Government has achieved a record jobs growth in the south-west region of 7.6 per cent, an increase of 13,500 jobs in two years, which is 50 per cent better than the performance in the previous years. Unemployment rates have come down in the region by 3 per cent, from 15.6 per cent to 12.4 per cent.  It is now below the national average and progress is being made in reducing it further.</P>
    <P>When the performance of IDA Ireland, Forbairt and the county enterprise boards are examined, the strong enterprise performance in Cork and its environs is apparent.  Last year, employment in IDA sponsored projects in the region grew by more than 5.5 per cent, leading to the creation of 1,022 jobs in Cork city and county.  In addition, nine new projects were announced for the south-west region this year, including Eastman Kodak and Motorola.  These are significant enterprises, and when those companies recently announced are fully operational they will create another 1,400 jobs.  This is in sharp contrast to the dismal performance by the parties opposite when they were last in power.  Our performance has been four times better with regard to bringing overseas investment to Cork.</P>

      <P>Some of those companies are especially exciting.  The arrival of Eastman Kodak was a development that had long been pursued by Government.  We succeeded in getting Eastman Kodak and Kodak to make significant investments in the region.  These are valuable jobs in the key electronics sector.  In failing to recognise the progress that Cork is making in attracting hitech industry, Deputy Martin is again blind to the strengths of his own city and region.  We have built on those strengths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to acknowledge that the NMRC was one of the far seeing investments in UCC and its environs.  The development of those links with business has helped us to win new projects and I am pleased that we have been able to work so constructively with the NMRC to build on what is a strong and powerful support within the community for enterprise development, in sharp contrast to the bleating from the Deputy opposite.  It has also been possible to develop significant new sites with private sector support.  The sector has <Col N="1468" /> invested in many sites in the Cork region and many others are planned in Mitchelstown, Mallow and Bandon.  The sector is looking ambitiously towards the ability of local investment to develop projects through the BES which will benefit those areas.  Towns such as Fermoy have been successful as a result of their aggressive approach to developing their resources.  That spirit, not the old begging bowl approach mentioned by Deputy Martin, characterises Cork today.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be surprised at the transformation in the performance of indigenous industry since the time his party was in office.  Net job creation in the south-west region in the last two years was more than ten times the figure for the preceding two years.  This is the result of the change in attitude of indigenous companies.

      <P>Indigenous business has performed exceptionally and I pay particular tribute to the strengths of that sector.  There are the traditional strengths of the food, drink and tobacco operations, which are key industries in Cork city, but the strong development of the software industry by indigenous companies is particularly exciting.Almost 60 companies are involved in that area and some of them are doing exciting work in the high tech field.  I had the privilege recently to visit a company in Cobh which is providing sophisticated engineering designs to an elaborate manufacturing plant.  It is able to provide companies with virtual reality solutions for design and development projects.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, who has a knowledge of that sphere, is deeply impressed by that company and the manner in which its executives have developed international trading opportunities.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that Forbairt is facilitating growth in the region through many of its successful programmes, including the research and development initiatives which have been widely taken up and the link supply programmes to multinationals.It has been possible to deepen the relationship of multinationals with the Cork region through links and domestic purchases. Strong sub-supply companies in the region provide services to local and multinational companies which have developed employment and successful businesses in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been singularly successful in reducing unemployment in the south-west region.  Unemployment has reduced by 3 per cent there and the rate has dropped to below the national average.  However, the Government is not content with that and it wants considerably more progress on that front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Government's initiatives has been to develop the type of training and employment services which can respond to the needs of the unemployed.  For example, over 12,000 people in the south-west region will benefit this year from training or community employment programmes. Over 5,500 people are undergoing training and I am pleased that the placement rate from those programmes is extremely high.  Almost 75 per <Col N="1470" /> cent of those who complete training in the FÁS training centres find jobs.</P>
    <P>The FÁS initiatives in Cork have been particularly successful and I was delighted to visit Bishopstown last week where the Oil Firing Technical Association of the Petroleum Industry has developed a most interesting training initiative.It provides skilled people for the gas and oil industries.  The programme upgrades people's skills so they can meet the high standards demanded by that sector.  The rapid changes in this sector require people to have particular skills and Cork is a centre of excellence in that regard. It has developed successful programmes in co-operation with industry.  This type of spirit is prevalent in Cork.  Industries are coming together with the statutory agencies to develop training programmes that give people real opportunities in growth areas.  Cork is responding to the challenge in terms of training and this will have a lasting impact in terms of reducing unemployment in future.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that community employment and the development of employment services for the unemployed is critically important.  Cork is one of the first areas to be included in the local employment service developed by the Government.  The Cork city local employment service has been in operation since January this year and it is specifically targeted at those who face significant disadvantage in accessing the labour force.  The Government believes the partnership approach which underpins that initiative will deliver results.  The benefits of this approach in areas where the service has been in operation longer are obvious.  Clients are treated on the basis of their needs and what type of progression paths will bring long-term unemployed people back into the workplace.  I am pleased the Government has the enthusiastic support of industry, trade unions, the community and the official services in making the Cork city local employment service work.  There is already significant progress on that front.</P>
    <P>Over 5,500 people are completing community employment schemes in the south-west region.  I am glad to report that those who have completed such programmes have achieved good results. Last year 36 per cent of them obtained employment and a further 30 per cent went on to further education and training.</P>

      <P>There is a strong and buoyant economy in Cork in every area of enterprise. <Col N="1471" /> Regarding the tourism industry, there were 2.5 million visitors to the region last year.  This involved a spend of £400 million, a considerable increase on the previous year.  Cork has been singularly successful in developing a key roads infrastructure, involving an investment of over £100 million in national roads in Cork city and county in the last two years.  Almost 25 per cent of the budget available for roads was devoted to the Cork region and this is having a real impact on the type of infrastructure which is available to support enterprise.  I am proud that this Government has made Cork an enterprising city and county.  The Deputy can be assured that Cork and the region are in safe hands with this Government.I wish to share the remainder of my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Allen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a cynical, electioneering motion tabled by Members of a party that spent seven years in office from 1987 to 1994, a party which in the same period failed nationally and abandoned Cork.  In contrast, in less than two and a half years this Government created 930 new jobs each week since January 1995.  In comparison with the achievements of Deputy Mary O'Rourke, as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, when the long-term unemployment figures rose by some 18,000, the present Minister for Enterprise and Employment has reduced that figure by 25,000.</P>
      <P>On personal finances, families are being saved on average £575 through the abolition of property tax and service charges.  Tax allowances have been increased, as have social welfare benefits and there has been a crackdown on social welfare fraud.</P>
      <P>In the matter of education, families have been given a massive boost by the abolition of third level fees which, after tax, represents an average saving of £1,500 per child.</P>
      <P>In my area of responsibility, for the first time ever a national sports strategy has been prepared, published and is being implemented.  In addition, the Youth Work Bill, awaited since 1984, has been passed by the Dáil and is being considered by the Seanad.  Furthermore, this Government has taken tough action by providing unprecedented resources to intensify the battle against criminals; in other words, this Government is working very well nationally.</P>

      <P>In the south west area, the Government has delivered in a major way to Cork and the south west region.  On the jobs front more and more industrial jobs are being created.  For example, over the past two years 6,500 industrial jobs were created in Cork, unemployment is reducing and the figures are there to prove it.</P>
      <P>The intensification of the Government's battle against the criminals is reflected locally in the appointment of extra gardaí, judges and courts.  I recently signed a contract for a £3 million refurbishment of the Cork Courthouse.  The fight against the drug barons is led by a Cork man, Barry Galvin, who heads the Criminal Assets Bureau, hitting them where it hurts most by seizing their assests.  Another example of the satisfactory operations of Government is the announcement that henceforth the proceeds of criminal assets will be expended on preventive measures to reduce crime and eliminate drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Martin's party was in Government for seven years but never lifted a finger.</P>
      <P>The Government acknowledges that the greatest preventive element in the fight against crime and drugs is the provision of sport and recreational facilities.  Investment in youth services and sport reduces the need for even greater investment in security and health services.  Whenever young people are offered a choice between a positive attraction and the negative one of crime and drugs, inevitably they will make the right choice; prevention is better than cure.</P>
      <P>The Government has designated the north side of Cork city a special pilot area in the fight against crime and drugs, with emphasis on prevention programmes.  It has invested in education, youth services and sports facilities.  As soon as the recommendations of the local task force are received decisions will be taken, in addition to the major announcements already made.  With these proposals the Government announced recently a £5.4 million project under the urban initiative which I forecast will lead to a social revolution on the north side of Cork city and substantially reduce the social effects of earlier bad planning decisions and unbalanced development, mainly by Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
      <P>This will return power to local communities, allowing them to take decisions in conjunction with State agencies and Government Departments rather than have them imposed on them as in the past.</P>

    <P>Personal tax rates and PRSI have been reduced, water charges have been abolished, as <Col N="1473" /> has residential property tax and child benefit has been increased by half.</P>

Its development was thwarted by Deputies Lowry and Allen, particularly the latter who said that Northgate Investments was interested in the site and would pay the same, if not more for it.

      <P>Let us look at what happened to Cork regional technical college.  Institute of technology status has been given to Waterford regional technical college, but Cork regional technical college would more than meet the criteria for institute of technology status.  It has been lumped in with all other regional colleges, with the result that the smaller colleges hold back the development of the larger colleges that have the staff and resources to develop technology, which is so important for industrial development in the area.  The Minister, Deputy Allen, and the Minister for Education, in their approach to this whole issue, are responsible.</P>
      <P>If Cork businessmen were asked about flights out of Cork, the choice that exists and the cost of a flight from Cork Airport as against Kerry or Waterford, they would say that they could fly from Farranfore to Dublin for half the price they would pay from Cork.  Yet the Government talks about investment and making available the opportunity to reach destinations in the UK and Europe.  Our city has fared very badly under this Government.</P>

      <P>I wish to make two further points on the justice area.  I have noticed in Cork when knocking on doors that elderly people will no longer answer or open them.  The reason is that crime is rampant.  The major failure of this <Col N="1479" /> Government is the ineptitude that has characterised the Department and the Minister for Justice. At every hand's turn she has been pushed and shoved into action.  I will not speak about the Labour Party and how it brought to an end the prison building programme until eventually it took the death of a garda and a journalist to spur some type of action from the Government.  Law and order is a major issue in Cork.  Elderly people will not open their doors at night because of fear. I ask the two Ministers present from Cork to examine Garda manpower in Cork and compare it with the manpower in some counties that are mainly rural areas.</P>

      <P>From time to time the Garda Commissioner has allocated extra gardaí to Dublin but few come to Cork.  No effort has been made to redress the problem or to bring about a proper balance to ensure there are gardaí on the streets of Cork.  The Minister is well aware of Curraheen, Haldeene, The Rise and the difficulties that pertain to traffic there.  The Minister is also aware of the need for the Ballincollig bypass. When I learned of the £150,000 for the bypass earlier this year I thought it would solve our problem.  However, with the Blackpool bypass we seem to be providing a bypass to a boreen rather than a proper road structure to cater for the needs of a fast expanding town.  We must ensure that the major traffic problems and snarls up at Haldeene and The Rise, which will be exacerbated when the tunnel opens, are dealt with.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak specifically about unemployment which is the single biggest problem still outstanding in Cork, particularly in my constituency of Cork North Central.  There is no crock of gold at the end of this Rainbow Coalition for Cork as far as the unemployed are concerned.Despite the economic growth elsewhere, the level of unemployment at just under 30,000 has remained virtually unchanged in the lifetime of this Government.  In the city the number on the live register has fallen by one person per week since the rainbow Government came to power.  In some areas of my constituency the rate of unemployment is as high as 50 per cent.  One <Col N="1480" /> in every six men of working age in the city and county is on the dole and some 15 per cent, 5,000, of those under 25, in the city are on the dole.  That is the statistical extent of the problem.  I could talk about its human impact for a long time if I had more time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no improvement in unemployment in my side of the city until and unless a significant investment is made in the physical infrastructure on the one hand and in the educational infrastructure on the other, both of which have been abysmally neglected in the lifetime of this Government.  I condemn the Government for its failure to expedite the Blackpool bypass which is the economic life line to the north side of Cork City.  Until that infrastructure is put in place there will be no substantial job generating investment in the north side of the city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;either from overseas investors or domestic investors.  It is a well established fact that the passport for any young person to a job is education.  The educational infrastructure of the north side of the city has been seriously neglected in the lifetime of this Government.  The critical investment in primary education in places such as Knocknaheeny, Mayfield and Gurranebraher has not been made in the past two and a half years. The disappointment felt by teachers and parents because of the failure of this Government to extend the breaking-the-cycle scheme to Knocknaheeny and Mayfield is palpable and will have a dramatic long-term adverse effect on the prospects for young people as they set out in their quest for jobs and in their effort to compete with young people from other parts of the city and county.  It is a scandal that that simple and cost effective measure was not put in place in those areas, areas that have now been hit with third generation unemployment.  If we are to begin to redress that situation we must begin in the primary schools and that has not happened.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure and education are the key elements.  It is little wonder that 71 per cent of all IDA jobs came to the greater Dublin area last year.  When asked why they come to Dublin they say it is because of the road structure and education.If we are serious about unemployment in our city the investment ought to have been made there.  Investment will not be made in that area until there is a change of Government and the people know that.</P>

I make a plea about how the Government could and ought to strengthen Apple Computer, the flagship industry in the north side of Cork city.  The Minister for Education announced at one of the teacher conferences recently that she will invest £30 million in information technology in the next number of years for schools and education.  I hope there are enough of us in key positions who will argue for Apple Computer and Cork and ensure that Apple Computer will supply the infrastructure to Irish schools in the same way as they supply to most European and many American schools.  The least we could do for our city would be to boost Apple Computer for the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the imbalance between IDA job creation on the east coast and in Cork.  There has been a huge imbalance in relation to hospitals.  One statistic illustrates a wider point. The capital budget for Cork University Hospital &mdash; a regional hospital &mdash; in 1995 was £42 million while Beaumont Hospital received £76 million. St. James's hospital got £70 million and the Mater hospital got £52.59 million.  Any one of those hospitals does not have the same range of specialties as Cork University Hospital yet the budget for Cork University Hospital was only £42 million.That is another illustration of the imbalance between the investment by the Government in Cork city and other parts of the country.  The Celtic tiger may be alive and well but he has skirted Cork, with grave consequences for the people there.  That is not to the Government's credit.</P>

    <P>Section 12 of the Bill removes the power of local authorities to levy charges for a supply of water for domestic purposes or the disposal of domestic sewage.

The capital cost of those plants is very large and the running costs are also substantial.  The running costs of the plant in Cork will be about £2.3 million a year.  Who will have to pay for the running costs?  Will it be the PAYE taxpayers or the commercial ratepayers who are already overburdened?  I assume the waste water plant will have a higher annual running cost.

We are asking young people to vote for us yet if they knew what they might face in taxation the last thing they would do is to vote for the Government.

I am giving him an opportunity, as a professional young politician and as the person charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment, to redeem his reputation and to demonstrate that the action he is taking in this Bill is based on logical reasons, on the best professional advice and on the best conservation principles to ensure this country receives the maximum amount of Cohesion Funds in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>This is the meat of the Bill, the part I thought I would never read in legislation.  It effectively means that water or service charges cannot be reintroduced by any party unless amending legislation is introduced.  Deputy Quill is a brave woman.  In two weeks' time, probably, she will have to knock on doors and tell the people of Cork that her party in Government with Fianna Fáil will reintroduce water or service charges.  What she is saying is that her party disagrees with their abolition.  That is the message she is sending from this House to the people of Cork, Louth, Galway, Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about what may happen in 13 or 14 years' time on foot of an EU directive but the European Commission cannot change this section, it can only be changed in Dáil Éireann.  I do not know if there is a party which would be brave enough to introduce amending legislation to provide for the reintroduction of water charges.  I look forward to members of the Progressive Democrats knocking on doors in my constituency of Louth and elsewhere and telling voters that they will reintroduce them.  I admire Deputy Quill's courage, she is a brave Deputy.</P>
      <P>The European Union cannot dictate to us and tell us what to include in domestic legislation.  It cannot force us to reintroduce water charges.  The parliamentary Labour Party, of which I am chairman, will never vote for their reintroduction.  The best guarantee the public can have that they will not be reintroduced is to return the Government to office.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quill said that she was not opposed to the removal of water charges but then criticised the Minister and the Government for listening to the views of the people and members of the parties in Government, particularly the Labour Party, in removing them.  I prefer to classify the charges as a water tax.  During the years local representatives of all parties indicated that they were opposed to water tax and gave a commitment that when in Government their parties would do something about the matter.The Minister has decided to resolve it once and for all.

      <P>I am not.  Local services will be financed from central Government funds or a combination of central Government funds and local charges or through the mechanism proposed in the Bill.  People living in the greater Dublin area believe they are paying for services through PRSI and other contributions.  If an extra payment is required, it would be preferable to raise it through the mechanism proposed by the Minister rather than by way of water charges payable on a weekly or monthly basis.  We must listen to what the people are saying.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about what certain people in Brussels are saying may happen in future in relation to the payment of water charges.  It is our function to legislate.

      <P>I remember the time when water was collected in barrels.  When talking about conservation <Col N="1487" /> we should consider all options, and I ask the Minister to consider my proposal.  Even if a grant has to be given to householders to install such a system it would mean a saving to the Exchequer in the long-term.  We all know that as a result of the progress made in the economy by the Government and the Labour Minister for Finance we will receive less funding from the EU in the future.  We will make our decisions on this issue and will not be dictated to by Europe.</P>
      <P>My constituents are satisfied that the Minister has grasped the nettle on this issue.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats had an opportunity to come together and put forward a viable mechanism for the financing of local authorities but they ran in different directions.  They did not realise that they would have to depend on each other for support after the general election.  They left it to the Minister to deal with this hot potato.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise that water is a valuable asset which is not available in unlimited quantities.  It cost an enormous amount of money to construct the water distribution and purification systems, some of which are still not adequate to meet the demands of various communities.Given our high level of rainfall, there was little concern in the past that we would have a water shortage.  However, a short dry period can lead to water problems in some areas where there is inadequate storage capacity.  For example, the recent dry spell highlighted the serious problems with the system in some parts of my constituency.</P>
      <P>The group water supply scheme under which households get together to employ a consultant and avail of grants was the brainchild of an official in the then Department of Local Government.Hundreds of people in rural areas owe a debt of gratitude to the official who put forward the proposal and to the Minister who put it into operation.  This scheme has ensured a piped water system for households which would not have a piped water supply if they had to wait for the State to install it.</P>
      <P>Water is not an unlimited resource.  It costs much money to cleanse, purify and pipe water to households.  Water is used in huge quantities by industries and the agricultural sector.  The piped water system has been a tremendous blessing to housewives who no longer need to carry water in buckets from the local well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to exaggerate the problem but much concern has been expressed about the quality of the ground water supply.  Very few of the thousands of septic tanks installed since the war meet the strict requirements laid down by the EU <Col N="1488" /> in regard to percolation.  Geological and other surveys show that ground water is being seriously polluted by inefficient septic tanks and farm practices.The State must do everything possible to guard this necessary natural asset, the real uisce beatha.  When talking about the protection of the environment our first priority must be to protect the water supply.  Reports have highlighted the Ecoli, other bacteria and deleterious matter found in water.  I do not wish to exaggerate the problem but this must be a cause of concern.</P>
    <P>We must not waste this resource.  It is essential for the State to put in place a good water management programme.  In drawing up such a programme it is essential to take into account the statistics in regard to the public supply of water, that is the quantity of water pumped through public and private piping systems and the quantity which is consumed.  Surveys show that there is massive leakage of this expensive water resource in the public piping system.  A figure of 40 per cent was given for Dublin, while a figure of 60 per cent was given for my city of Galway. The Minister said that £30 million would have to be spent in trying to find these leaks in the system.There are people in my city employed, using EU funds, to discover, using new and old fashioned methods, the points at which these vast quantities of water are being lost in the system. They spend their time tapping and listening to pipes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been a Member long enough to remember when the Labour Party introduced service charges.  The Deputies who spoke earlier were not Members of this House when the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, introduced the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill in the early 1980s which implemented service charges.  Those charges were opposed by the Opposition at the time, of which I was a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and were passed in this House in an extraordinary way.  A charge would have to be made regardless of whether water was taken from the local pipe.  Those charges were introduced in the most arbitrary, dictatorial fashion. The issue immediately became a bone of contention because it was an unfair system in that it was arbitrary and varied across the country.  It was seen as an additional tax on the people and a fund gatherer by the Labour Party.  Labour Party Deputies do not even blush when they are reminded of that.  The people who supported <Col N="1489" /> their leader at that time, and who put themselves forward as candidates for the subsequent election, voted against those service charges in their local authorities because they were chicken hearted.  A Minister in this Government was a member of Galway Corporation at that time, and whenever the question of service charges arose as part of the funding of the local authority, he voted against them because of the legislation his leader had introduced.</P>

      <P>I understand the difficulty for both Progressive Democrats Deputies tonight.  They have a great difficulty and it is, in the phrase coined by a very distinguished and honourable Member of this House, a Member of Deputy Dempsey's party, the &ldquo;tyranny of consistency&rdquo;.  It is difficult for the Progressive Democrats to have any position on this because they have only very recently taken an interest in the whole issue of water.  When I published the KPMG report last June on water charges, on metering, on costings, there was not a peep from the Progressive Democrats; <Col N="1492" /> they could not have cared less.  Deputy Mary Harney did not even realise the report existed when she made her initial comments this year, some eight or nine months later.</P>
      <P>We have heard now the fourth position from the Progressive Democrats on this.  The first position was Deputy Bobby Molloy's position which was to pay any sum to solve the problem.  For ease of understanding let us call it the &ldquo;blank cheque&rdquo; position <i>à la</i> Bobby Molloy.</P>

We will call this the &ldquo;dig us out of a hole&rdquo; position.  The fourth position was reiterated tonight by Deputy Molloy.  It is to meter the water, but not just yet.

      <P>I have obviously struck the right chord.  The fourth position from the Progressive Democrats we have heard tonight is the most bizarre of all because, in essence, what they are saying is that they want to meter all the water, that they will start now but it will not be in position until the year 2010.  No Minister ever came into this House saying that we had to have fiscal rectitude and charges, to get the economy and everything else right and that we will start in 13 or 14 years time.  It is the most bizarre and pitiable position I ever heard put forward on any issue.  It is irrelevant to any of the issues faced by Government here and now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very valuable points were made by other Deputies in this debate.  I want to briefly answer the two questions posed initially by Deputy Quill.  Deputy Quill wants to know who will pay for Cork water and who will pay for Dublin water and all the other water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to waste water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The bulk of charges currently falls on the biggest polluters who are the commercial sector.  The commercial sector is untouched by all of this, a point totally lost by Deputy Molloy, since it is metered, properly and correctly. The import of the decision we have made is simply to abolish domestic charges.  The commercial sector pays not only for the actual use of water but towards the infrastructural costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy wanted to know whose advice I took.  I took a lot of advice.  I took advice from the people, a terrible sin in the eyes of the Progressive Democrats.  I listened to the views of the people expressed through the ballot box, through discussions, through our own councillors group, through our parliamentary party.  I am open, and will be for as long as I am in public life, to the views of the people and I make no apology for that.  I also listened to expert advice.  The KPMG report that I commissioned and published, on which I invited debate and on which I held a press conference last June which did not excite the interest of the Progressive Democrats, said that metering households to measure water consumption was not a viable alternative to the current system of water charges, that it would cost £200 million to put the infrastructure in place, that it would take years to do it and that it would cost £8 million a year to monitor and deliver.  Rather than spend £200 million on putting in a metering system at the end of line for households, I made <Col N="1494" /> a decision to spend that money instead on real conservation, on real infrastructure, and I made no excuse regarding that.  It was the environmentally correct, socially correct and economically correct thing to do.</P>
    <P>In terms of water conservation I have announced an investment scheme of £32 million in Dublin water which will reduce leakage in the system by 22 million gallons a day.  That is where scarce capital should be invested.  I intend to replicate that across the country.  That is a much more environmentally sound approach than putting meters at the end of a leaking system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, this is PD twisting again.  I said the commercial sector would pay a proportion of the costs as it always has done.  The abolition of the domestic charge will not affect the bulk of charges for water and waste water treatment which has always fallen on the commercial sector.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had been here for the earlier part of the discussion he would know that I have allocated the entire resource of motor <Col N="1495" /> taxation to local government funding.  That is a buoyant ring-fenced source of funding.  There are an infinite number of other charges available to local authorities for the services they provide. Service charges have been a tiny portion of total local government income.  This year the Government is investing some £150 million in water and waste water treatment, the highest level of investment we ever made.  Despite the comments from Deputies opposite.  I am confident of getting an increase on this sum for next year and for the end of this year through the European Union because of the necessity to put in place an infrastructure that will deal with all waste and ground water issues.  Before Deputy Molloy went off on a tangent, he made some important points about water pollution.  Those issues are on my agenda and in train to be implemented.  We will have ample opportunity during Question Time and other debates in the coming months and years to deal with those issues.</P>

      <P>My point relates to the charge for waste water and the Minister referred to that.  He is aware of a project in my constituency which can be developed in two ways, one of which would incur annual charges of approximately £180,000 and the other approximately £500,000. Is the Minister saying the State will subsidise the difference or will it have to be made up from the resources of local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that in view of the statement from the European Union today future grant-aid will be limited to 80 per cent instead of 85 per cent, the Exchequer, through the Minister's Department, will have to pay 20 per cent of the cost of all sanitary projects?  That will involve an enormous cost over a period of years.  One of the successes of the Fianna Fáil-PD Government was to secure 85 per cent grant aid from the European Union, but that will now drop by 5 per cent.  The level of home financing required will hinder our capacity to take on large infrastructural projects and in the case of the project in my <Col N="1496" /> constituency home financing will run into millions of pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in trying to answer the Deputy's question if he does not listen.  The total sum available from the European Union will not change.  This Commissioner's decision does not relate only to the abolition of charges, it also relates to the volume of projects this Government submitted to Brussels to draw down money.  I am determined that every scheme will be advanced as quickly as possible.  The reality facing future Governments is that Cohesion Funds will be less than the necessary funding to carry out all the work we are required to do under European law.  There will have to be a domestic input.  I have explained this many times at Question Time during the past two and a half years.  Not one penny will be lost from the change.  It will allow us to develop more projects, which we would have to develop in any case.</P>

Up to now if Brussels made £100 million available, the State had to provide approximately £15 million. That figure will increase to £20 million.  Therefore, in the case of every £100 million spent on infrastructural projects the Irish taxpayer will have to provide an additional £5 million.</P>

We succeeded in securing an increase in grant-aid from approximately 70 per cent to 85 per cent for specified countries. Up to then, for every £70 million spent on a project <Col N="1497" /> we had to spend £30 million, but because of our low level of development this placed a huge burden on taxpayers and limited the amount of work we could undertake.  It was cause for celebration that the negotiators succeeded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Irrespective of whether we pay 80 per cent or 85 per cent, we will meet the full cost of approximately £1.3 billion to implement the provisions of the waste water treatment directive to provide a quality water supply for every citizen.

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2), line 5 to delete &ldquo;within the Department&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the establishment of a local government value for money unit.  I will speak to all the amendments taken together. Members on all sides agree we need to get more value for money for every pound spent by local authorities.  Many local authority members throughout the country agree on that, as do a number of managers.  Taxpayers also support it and want to see value for money.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes the establishment of a unit in his Department which would carry out value for money audits in local authorities.  I disagree fundamentally with that unit being within the Department of the Environment.  It should be independent of the Department and its audits should be carried out independently of the Department and the equalisation council.  If the Minister wants to get the message across to the people that he wants to adopt a hands off approach to local government and to interfering with the money he said he will make available to local government, he must take his hands off the value for money unit.</P>
      <P>I hope that unit will be used by the equalisation council and others to establish criteria and to measure how local authorities meet the criteria set by the Minister, in the first instance, or that unit at a later stage.  Irrespective of what Minister is in the Department, there would be a whiff of political interference if that unit were within the Department and not separate from it.  I have no objection to officials in it advising the Minister or referring to him particular reports or him having a right to suggest or to direct them to carry out value for money audits in specific local authorities, areas of local authority business or other headings but I have a fundamental difficulty with that unit being part of the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>Through the good work of the Comptroller and Auditor General we have a system that works in terms of supervising and examining Government expenditure.  Since the value for money audit was put in place for the Comptroller and Auditor General useful information has been garnered and useful actions have been taken by various Departments.  I envisage this local government unit would act in a similar manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure this unit is completely independent of his Department?  This unit will be important in the future.  It will be an important part of the concept of equalisation of independence in judging local authorities on their merits as to how <Col N="1499" /> they undertake their work and value for money they provide.  While the Minister and I disagree on various aspects of the financing of local government, one of the areas on which we are at one is getting value for money.  One way to do that is to have a completely independent audit system.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the local government audit system in place.  I would not want people in that service to think I am casting aspersions on their work.  We are moving into the area of getting value for money, a different one from the book-keeping exercise carried out by the auditors at present.  As an indication of his earnest intent to give as much freedom as possible to local government and to give it independence, will the Minister accept my amendment and the other related ones, particularly amendment No. 19?  It seeks to delete the reference to &ldquo;officers of the Minister and local government auditors&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;suitably qualified persons&rdquo;.  Those persons may be former officers or local government auditors, but part of this section implies the Minister will hand pick people from his Department to do this work.  I am not alleging any political favouritism. This unit should be independent of the Department and the people appointed to it should be independent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 also seeks to underline the independence of this unit.  The Minister proposes that this unit would operate only on the basis of requests from him, but it should make its decisions on audits it wants to carry out, studies of systems, practices and procedures as outlined in this section.  If Ministers were to hand-pick people at the behest of officials in their Departments, we would not get value for money.  At times political decisions would be made to turn a blind eye to the waste of money in a particular local authorities because that might be a cause of embarrassment to a Minister or his or her party. The thrust of my amendments is to ensure the unit is independent, that the officers who work in it are independent and have an independence of action over and above any direction the Minister might give them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept these amendments. As I said at the outset, no one could reasonably object to the Minister having the power to direct an audit but it appears from section 14 that the unit can only operate at his behest.  We will not get good value for money or independence from such a unit unless it is allowed to be self-starting and independent.</P>

      <P>I strongly supported this section on Second Stage.  The concept of value for money audits is most welcome but what is at issue is how they are conducted.  We are all <i>ad idem</i> that the audits need to be carried out and that local authorities and their clients would benefit from them. I support Deputy Dempsey's amendment because the audit should not be carried out by an arm of the Department of the Environment.  The Department has traditionally had strong cultural <Col N="1500" /> links with local authorities &mdash; they have grown together down the decades.  If we are serious about putting in place a new system which takes on board principles of value for money and best practice in respect of all their services, it is time we established the type of independent unit advocated by Deputy Dempsey, where the procedures would be subject to independent verification.  The model for administering, adjudging and approving these schemes is already available &mdash; we can use the Q mark or ISO 9000, which are independent outside models with their own criteria.</P>
      <P>If the Minister administers the scheme in the way advocated by the amendment he will introduce a huge cultural change.  Local authorities will be much more conscious of their customers and clients and of giving value for money.  Apart from the direct benefits, that will have a number of downstream advantages also.  For the most part, people are fair and if they think they are receiving a good quality and standard of service with value for money, they will support whoever delivers it and will be prepared to pay.  The Minister will have a good Bill if he accepts Deputy Dempsey's amendment.</P>

      <P>I respect the views expressed.  The Deputies are worried that the Minister may hand pick people for the team, then they backtrack and complain about the team being within his Department because it will be linked to local authorities. I do not know how long it has been since some Members have served on a local authority, but the local government auditor is one of the strictest officers dealing with local authorities.  Local authority members are notified of his arrival, when he will open the books, and what he wants to do.  Elected people who are responsible to the public in the first instance have the right to be present.  I do not know what happens in other counties but my county is one of the best because the local authority is anxious to ensure that the changes to its structure and the management initiatives will ensure it delivers a quality service to the people in a friendly way.  That may not have happened in the past but we want to ensure it will in the future.  We already have put structures in place for greater involvement of public representatives in all areas, including this one. The Bill provides:</P>
      <P>A local government auditor may, in the course of an audit of the accounts of a local authority or at any other time, carry out such examination as he or she considers appropriate...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy's amendment is not casting aspersions on the existing system which is extremely strict, is in accordance with the current law and involves local authority members. He appears to want to set up a quango or another outside agency which he will pull down from <Col N="1501" /> Heaven.  The section will lay down a procedure, as the Minister has indicated.</P>
      <P>Before the abolition of water charges was mentioned.Tipperary South Riding County Council discussed value for money and whether installing meters, the current obsession of the Progressive Democrats, would be justified.  We were told that if we installed domestic water meters in every house, including those of old age pensioners who would only use a couple of kettles full of water per day, it would take five years to pay for the capital investment before people would start paying for the water.  Even then, if one took into account the minimum one would have to charge without a meter and the amendments by way of relief schemes, one would never recoup the cost of installing meters for domestic supply.  One must look at value for money when running local authorities and should not go off on a tangent. Meters were invented long before the Progressive Democrats were.  They existed for domestic suppliers, farmers and business people who pay according to usage and rightly so.  As the Minister said, they are paying a share toward development charges, development services and ensuring pollution is under control.</P>
      <P>We should be honest about what we are doing. I have the greatest respect for Deputy Dempsey but these amendments do not make sense and I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts.  The Deputy seems to want to set up a new independent body but I do not know who will appoint it.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Dempsey's amendment.  It would be most unusual &mdash; and also unsustainable &mdash; if these duties were coupled with the responsibilities of the local government auditor.  We have a centralised bureaucracy which has grown under successive Administrations.  Most people think it would be far better if we could gradually provide more power to local communities to do things for themselves as costs are inevitably reduced when people are directly involved.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, there is a huge variation in the administration of local authorities. We might not be able to agree on what order to put them in but they fall into three broad categories &mdash; good, fairly good and not so good.  I ask the Minister to tell us about the audits carried out in recent years in a variety of local authorities which indicate their efficiency or otherwise.  I think he will be able to tell the House there is an extraordinary difference in the cost of various operations, which are supported by his Department and EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. That should not be the case.  What measures have been taken by his Department to come to grips with these problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been my experience that any problems come back to the Minister and his Department, <Col N="1502" /> such as those associated with many of the bigger policy issues, negotiations in Brussels and a growing variety of coal face responsibilities in caring for the environment, such as dealing with new housing circumstances, the development of our road systems and sewage treatment facilities. More than most Departments, the Department of the Environment and the Minister deal with services which are essential to the public, and its wider role seems to be growing.</P>
    <P>It is fairly logical from what Deputy Dempsey has said and supported by Deputy Quill, that we should try to move away from taking extra responsibility anywhere we can legitimately and logically do so.  It must be clear to the Minister and his officials that with the recent growth of the system it has become extraordinarily burdensome, in terms of the requirements on the Department to cover the minutest details.  We should try to move away from that.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment which, in a sense, proposes a decentralisation of decision making processes.  However, I am more anxious to hear from the Minister about the model being developed in his Department, arising from the enormous discrepancies in the cost of similar operations in different local authorities.  That is not sustainable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In essence, section 14 sets up the value for money unit in my Department on a statutory basis.  Section 15 makes local authorities legally subject to value for money audits.  I strongly welcome the very supportive contributions from both sides of the House, both on Second Stage and tonight.  It is important that we get value for money.  Opposition speakers are quite right that local authorities do not provide uniform value; we do not get the same return in every local authority from the investment we make.  Deputy Michael Smith was generous in his categorisations as some of them could be categorised as quite bad in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith, my predecessor, will also have encountered the difficulty in the Department of having supplicant councils which are patently inefficient, looking for a rate support increase, while those who are efficient managers of the same resource are expected to do without.  The policy was to virtually reward inefficiency because of the growing huge indebtedness of such councils.  We must crack that nut.  I am determined to get value for money in a very public way, which is the only way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We established the value for money unit in the Department on a non statutory basis, and it has been working feverishly.  Last July we published the first series of ten reports by that unit.  That was the first time any such reports were made available to the public.  They cover areas such as purchasing, advertising, insurance, parking charges, photocopying charges, machinery yards, energy efficiency in local authority buildings, differential rents, property management and public lighting.  Four further reports have been completed <Col N="1503" /> and will be published shortly, and a fifth report is already under way.  I want to put that resource, expertise and talent which is available to me on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I had to think very carefully about the points made by Deputy Dempsey.  As is the case with the equalisation council, it is my view that the value for money unit should be at arm's length from the Department.  Perhaps I am more focused on that because I am anxious to keep it at arm's length from the Department of Finance, rather than the Department of the Environment.  The value for money unit might ultimately develop into an autonomous unit which requires an amendment of the statute, but I do not think we have got to that stage yet.</P>
    <P>I am minded in this regard of the basic requirement of value for money, which is not to duplicate the expertise we have.  We have a very independent unit with a great deal of experience and knowledge which I do not want to lose by duplicating it on an arm's length basis.  As Deputy Ferris said, the local government auditors have always been genuinely statutorily independent in the performance of their functions and that will always be the case.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, there is a great deal of merit in the thrust of the argument made by Deputy Dempsey.  I do not think the time is right for it now, it would be disruptive of the work which is under way and would not be good value for money.  However, I acknowledge there may be good reason in the future to establish the unit on an independent statutory basis to give it the degree of independence which Deputy Dempsey feels it needs.  It works extraordinarily well now and will be strengthened by putting it on a statutory basis and clearly in charge of the local authority auditing system.</P>
    <P>We will have remarkable results when we publish the value for money reports and the league table of performance.  It will be a traumatic experience for many when we quantify the cost of collecting a ton of rubbish, lifting a bin or providing any service, and the time it takes to allocate a vacant local authority house.  All this information must be published in league table form so that people can say whether they are acceptable.</P>
    <P>I hope that in parallel to this we can also encourage local authorities to apply for the other independent audit procedures and evaluations which exist, such as the ISO system.  Wexford County Council has them for motor taxation.  If we change the culture from being another bureaucracy to a service industry which must compete in a service focused way and must comply with the norms of a service industry in the commercial sector, we will have done a remarkable day's work for the future of local government.There is enthusiasm to do that among the practitioners in councils, both at elected and managerial levels.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 38, to delete &ldquo;Where&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2), where&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell for tabling her two amendments, which are an improvement on the present wording.  The Minister is, therefore, accepting them.  Deputies will note that two of the amendments have been worded so that their wording will be consistent with Deputy O'Donnell's amendments.  For further consistency with those amendments, my amendments Nos. 5a and 10a provide for the deletion of the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendments Nos. 3, 5, 7 and 9 are related and their purpose is to provide for a warning procedure for licencees at risk of having their licences revoked or forfeited.  On Second Stage Deputy O'Donoghue said that before initiating licence revocation proceedings, notice should be served on the licence holder that the Garda Síochána are of the view that illegal drugs are on sale or are being supplied on the premises and directing the individual concerned to put his or her house in order.  In a similar vein Deputy O'Donnell indicated that it would be fairer if licence revocation proceedings were initiated only after the Garda pointed out to the licence holder that known drug dealers were on the premises and the licence holder failed to do anything about it.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the vast majority of licence holders are decent people who want to earn an honest living.  They would be appalled if they heard that their premises were being used for drug dealing.  For that reason, the Minister has framed her proposals on the assumption that the Garda would warn licence holders before taking proceedings.  She did not envisage situations occurring in which licence holders would suddenly have the rug pulled from under them. Nevertheless, having reflected on what was said on Second Stage, she decided to include provision for a statutory warning.  Her amendments provide for warnings where there is a reasonable suspicion that the licence holder did not exercise reasonable control over his or her premises to prevent the sale, supply or distribution of any controlled drug.  The licence holder will be given a reasonable period of time to enable him or her to take whatever action is necessary to prevent drug related activity on the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen from the amendments that the Minister does not propose to apply the new warning to cases in which a licence holder permits or suffers the use of the venue for the sale, supply or distribution of any controlled drugs.  She decided not to do so because permitting or suffering drug abuse entails a more active involvement on the part of the licencee in drug related activity. In such a case, early action would be needed <Col N="1506" /> rather than waiting several weeks for the warning procedure to be completed.  I commend amendments Nos. 3, 5, 5a, 7, 9 and 10a to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking on board the reservations which Deputy O'Donoghue and I expressed on Second Stage and I thank her for accepting my amendments.  I was concerned that the current wording would seem to suggest that any sale of drugs in a premises was due to lack of proper control by the music licence holder.  Failure to exercise proper control would lead to the licence holder being barred from holding a licence for five years.  I had suggested that &ldquo;reasonable control&rdquo; is a fairer test.  Section 10 envisages the licence holder making reasonable arrangements to prevent the sale of drugs.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendments.  They indicate an acceptance that the vast majority of licence holders are willing and enthusiastic in helping the authorities to combat drugs on their premises.  However, the obligations placed on them must be reasonable in all the circumstances, given that the revocation of a licence is a serious penalty to impose.  The Minister's amendments have moved to make the tests and obligations on them more reasonable.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister's initiative.  However, while not blaming the licence holders generally, it must be borne in mind that large numbers of drugs are sold on many of these premises, at times to far more than the value of £10,000 and under the auspieces of the licence holders.For that reason Deputy O'Donoghue put down an amendment which he hoped the Government would accept, but unfortunately it was not acceptable and was deemed to be out of order.  It is a serious matter when people can deal on these premises.  This the first time the issue will be tackled from a specific aspect and it is right that the amendments be agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the super bug, MRSA, is rampant in acute hospitals. I am aware of cases where people died after they contracted MRSA in acute hospitals.  People are afraid that they will contract this disease, which can be fatal, after they are admitted to acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>I understand a number of operations have been postponed in an acute hospital in Dublin.  It is extremely costly to deal with MRSA because wards must be isolated and patients who contract the bug require great care and attention.  I bring this to the Minister's attention because it is a bug for which there is no known cure.  I understand also that, in many instances, it is contracted through open wounds, particularly by those who have had operations and who are susceptible to it.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by people in University Hospital in Cork that, at any given time, there could be ten to 20 people within that hospital suffering from this bug, a problem which manifests itself in all acute hospitals nationwide.</P>
      <P>While the Department has issued guidelines, some of the difficulties to which this infection gives rise are only now becoming apparent.  For example, this week I was contacted by the family of a terminally ill person who contracted this MRSA in an acute hospital.  The hospital discharged the person to a nursing home where the medical staff discovered that the patient had contracted this super bug.  It is extremely expensive for a nursing home to deal with somebody who has contracted MRSA, isolation being part and parcel of the treatment.  Therefore, it will clearly be seen that financial difficulties attend the care of such a patient in a nursing home.</P>
      <P>Over and above all of this, I have now discovered that nursing homes are not anxious, and some are unwilling, to accommodate people suffering from this bug on their premises.  Within the Southern Health Board area, while the patient about whom I speak was admitted to a nursing home, medical staff of the Southern Health Board visited the nursing home and suggested it was not appropriate for that patient to be cared for there because of the danger of spreading the bug within the home itself: therein lies the dilemma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having spoken to nursing home proprietors I know they are particularly concerned about possible <Col N="1510" /> litigation in the event of a spread of MRSA within a nursing home.  No doubt this will lead to an increased dilemma as owners of nursing homes become aware of the problematic nature of this bug and will be unhappy to receive patients who have contracted it.</P>
    <P>The dilemma for the Minister and acute hospitals is that, since these patients must receive medical care in isolation, they will have to remain in acute hospitals much longer than necessary to deal with the complaint for which they were originally admitted.</P>
    <P>My question relates to the establishment of a national surveillance monitoring unit.  The Minister will have had a report on his desk on it for well over 12 months.  The relevant study group recommended its immediate establishment.  This is important for the control of this super bug, establishment of the numbers suffering from it, its impact on the operations of acute hospitals in addition to monitoring the extent of meningit is and other diseases of that nature.</P>
    <P>I do not want to raise unnecessary fears.  I have been informed by medical people that, by and large, the bug which can be fatal in some cases, and can be less than harmful in many others. Therefore, it is crucial that the Department establish this national surveillance monitoring unit immediately to restore confidence among staffs in nursing homes and in patients' medical care, demonstrating that some pertinent action is being taken in an endeavour to establish the origins of this bug and effectively control it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to this Adjournment Debate on behalf of the Minister for Health who is anxious to ensure that all necessary measures be taken to control and reduce the prevalence of methicillin-resistant <i>staphylococcus aureus</i> or MRSA.  In September 1993 a committee, comprising representatives of the Department of Health, consultant microbiologists, specialists in public health medicine, general practice and the Infection Control Nurses Association, was established to identify the extent to which MRSA was a problem in our health system and to identify priorities for its control.  The committee recommended a comprehensive set of guidelines covering procedures for the management of MRSA in acute hospitals, in other health care settings and produced guidelines and information for patients and health care staff.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the Minister published national guidelines which were endorsed by a wide range of professional bodies involved in the control of MRSA, widely circulated nationwide, giving invaluable advice on preventing its spread.  These guidelines represent an important step in promoting awareness of the dangers it poses.  Indeed the measures taken for control of MRSA will ensure an even safer environment for the care of the sick both in hospital and within the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is also committed to ensuring that future trends in the prevalence of MRSA continue <Col N="1511" /> to be closely monitored and has accepted the need for a national communicable disease surveillance unit which will provide a comprehensive broad-based approach to the prevention of disease.  The organisational and structural issues involved are being considered by the Department of Health in conjunction with the relevant agencies and professional interests.</P>
    <P>However, when making a decision on the organisational and structural issues involved it will be essential to take account of developments in a number of other bodies, such as the Institute of Public Health, the Office for Health Gain, the Food Safety Board and the Virus Reference Laboratory, all of which are at development stage or under review and will have to have links with the unit.  Therefore, the intention is to work on the detailed arrangements for the unit, in conjunction with the ongoing work on these bodies during the coming year, with a view to its establishment in 1998.</P>
    <P>The Minister reassures the House of his continuing commitment to address the issue of hospital-acquired infection, including MRSA, in the context of his Department's strategy for effective health care in the 1990s &mdash;&ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;&mdash; which emphasised quality of service as one of its key principles.  He is confident widespread awareness of the guidelines for its control and the development of surveillance systems will prove valuable weapons in the fight to make our hospitals as safe as possible an environment for the care of the sick.  To that end he has asked his Department to reissue the 1995 guidelines stressing the necessity for hospitals to adhere to them to ensure best practice in the control of MRSA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for facilitating me this evening.</P>
      <P>Most people will be aware that a recent report of the National Economic and Social Forum involving a study of early school leavers highlighted a startling figure of some 3,200 children who leave school annually without any qualification.That figure was broken down to demonstrate another frightening fact, that approximately 1,000 children drop out of school even before reaching second level.  That report also confirmed what we had suspected for a long time, that each early school leaver represents a potential addition to the live register.  There are sufficient figures to demonstrate that 46 per cent of 15 to 24 year olds are unemployed, something with which not many will be familiar.  Unfortunately they are likely to remain unemployed because of their low educational achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These statistics come as no surprise to those of us who work in marginalised, inner city communities, in places such as Tallaght out of which my party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, operates or our party Leader, Deputy <Col N="1512" /> De Rossa who operates out of the Finglas area. Those of us who are elected to represent the inner city and other marginalised communities know where the jobless blackspots are.  In one large inner city community in my constituency of Dublin South Central as many as 55 per cent of adults left school before reaching the age of 15. In housing estates adjoining the inner city the figure is 40 per cent.  A recent survey of primary schools in the south-west inner city of Dublin found that 34 per cent of pupils in education need remedial teaching and 5 per cent do not attend school regularly.</P>
    <P>At a time of unprecedented job creation we must focus resources on education to ensure our young people are equipped with the skills they need to take up those jobs.  Programmes designed specifically for early school leavers such as Youthreach have an important role and I congratulate the staff and students engaged in Youthreach projects.  We must take preventative action by ensuring children stay in school for as long as possible.  I applaud proposals to raise the school leaving age from 15 years to 16 years.</P>
    <P>As well as increasing the school leaving age, however, we must ensure attendance in school is rigorously enforced, which is not the case at present.  We must devise a system whereby the Department of Education can track pupils and intervene before they join the early school-leaver statistics.  That would be best achieved by obliging school principals at primary level to report on the destination of every pupil who leaves the school and notify the Department of Education or FÁS of any drop out or suspected drop out within three weeks of the student disappearing from class.</P>
    <P>This is one of the issues which I hope will be addressed in the proposed legislation.  I urge the Minister to bring forward this legislation as quickly as possible to reverse the present trend where an increasing number of people find themselves marginalised and long-term unemployed, with no hope of a job in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the introduction of revised school attendance legislation.  The Government's programme of renewal identified among its priorities pilot initiatives to address the problems of truancy and early drop out.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has been charged with specific responsibility for this area. In April 1994 the Minister published the Report of the Working Group on Truancy.  This report followed a comprehensive review of the operations of the Acts governing schools attendance. In publishing the report on truancy, the Minister invited submissions from interested parties in order to tap the knowledge and expertise of all relevant interests in developing proposals on school attendance.  A significant number of submissions and views on the report's contents were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> It is evident from the report that truancy is a complex issue which demands a comprehensive solution and that the question of truancy and non-school attendance is an issue which can have its roots in a wide range of social, personal and educational problems.  The Department of Education has a wide range of strategies currently in place to help prevent early school leaving and under achievement.  At primary level these include early intervention measures which provide additional supports for young people at risk. These measures are aimed at optimising their participation in and benefit from the education system.  These include major initiatives such as pre-schooling, remedial and home-school-community liaison services, co-ordination with other agencies, guidance and psychological services and ancillary services and resources for schools in disadvantaged areas, as well as the recently launched Breaking the Cycle initiative.  A number of youth encounter projects are also provided for young people who have either become involved in minor delinquency or are at risk of doing so, and who have become alienated from the mainstream school system.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education also introduced a pilot scheme under which special counsellor teacher posts have been allocated to assist certain schools in addressing particular difficulties with disruptive pupils.  A total of 27 counsellor-teacher posts have been allocated under this initiative to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  This pilot scheme has been introduced in Dublin inner city schools and in schools in the Tallaght-Clondalkin areas.</P>
    <P>The strategy at second level includes curricular reform such as the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme, and the applied leaving certificate programme, which are all designed to encourage an improvement in retention rates to completion of senior cycle to up to 90 per cent of the total cohort of second level pupils.  There is also a significant emphasis on second chance education and training through the provision of Youthreach for unqualified early school leavers over age 15. This programme is provided jointly by FÁS and the vocational education committees in community training workshops and vocational education committee Youthreach centres.  Some 2000 Youthreach places are provided in the education sector and an additional 450 places are currently being allocated.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is conscious of the need for a comprehensive solution to the problems of truancy and non-school attendance, which can be best achieved by a mix of legislative, administrative, educational and social measures.  As a first step in the process of addressing these problems, the Minister of State announced the establishment of a task force in the Department of Education to examine submissions received in response to the truancy report and consider and make recommendations as to future action required to address the problem <Col N="1514" /> of truancy at first and second level.  The work of that task force is now concluded.  Proposals regarding school attendance legislation have been circulated to all Departments for their observations and these have been returned in recent weeks.  The general scheme of a new school attendance Bill will go to Cabinet shortly for approval to draft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is the first opportunity to do so on the record of the House, I express my sorrow at your forthcoming retirement, a Cheann Comhairle, and thank you for the courtesy you have always shown me and the assistance you have given me.  I wish you well in your retirement.  As you come from a neighbouring constituency, I hope our paths will cross from time to time in the south-east.</P>
      <P>Thank you also for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I hope I can convince the Minister for Education and the Minister of State to use common sense to resolve the problem of school transport to Ballyduff Upper national school in west Waterford.  In many areas rules and regulations are introduced with no provision for flexibility.  That often leads to a regime which no sane person would countenance if charged with the responsibility of finding a workable solution to a problem, and such is the case here.</P>
      <P>For the past 29 years, since Shean and Glencairn schools closed, the children of those areas have been provided with a school bus service to Tallow national school.  At the time this was deemed correct by the authorities on the grounds that both schools were in the Tallow parish, but the parish of Tallow runs to within a quarter of a mile of the village of Ballyduff.  Even Ballyduff national school lies within the Tallow parish.  In recent years the children in the Shean and Glencairn areas have gradually transferred to the school in their own community, Ballyduff.  This has happened to such an extent that there are now 22 children from these areas attending Ballyduff and not attending Tallow.  They are all taken to school, usually at great inconvenience, by private car.  The parents demand that the Department of Education provides a school transport service to Ballyduff national school from this area for the following reasons.  The people of this area recognise themselves as being part of Ballyduff community.  All parts of the area are closer to Ballyduff national school than to Tallow national school and representatives of the area are elected to the Ballyduff community council with no similar representation in any Tallow based body.  The historical parochial reason no longer has any validity.Tallow parish runs to within a quarter of a mile of Ballyduff village.  If the Department is in a quandry, it could solve it in that the school is within the parish of Ballyduff and the children will not be moved out of the parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Simple economics dictate that to provide a service <Col N="1515" /> to a more distant location than a nearer alternative is lunacy.  The parents will not be fobbed off by the Department's excuse that a transport service is being provided.  It is being provided but to a school outside the community, where no such need exists.  The provision of such a service has a tendency to confuse people's sense of identity, loyalty and belonging to their community.</P>
    <P>In the past neighbouring children regularly ended up going to different schools, breaking friendships and after national school finding it difficult to reintegrate in their community. Socially and morally this is unacceptable.  Many of the parents demanding this alternative service were children at the time of the closure of Shean and Glencairn schools and are aware of the social problems involved.  The region is an area of growing population which will ensure the long-term viability of the service.  Some 22 children attend the school: in the ten to 12 age group there are nine, in the five to nine age group there are 13 pupils and in the zero to four age group there are 11.  Therefore, the number of children in the area is increasing and, given the number of young families moving in, the population will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>All the parents involved live approximately two to three miles from Ballyduff and four to five miles from Tallow.  How anybody can say this is a sensible arrangement is beyond me.  I call on the Minister to use flexibility and common sense to provide school transport for Ballyduff and allow the children to attend school in their own community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenneally for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity to outline the position in relation to school transport for primary pupils from the Shean and Glencairn areas of County Waterford.</P>
      <P>I will explain some basic facts about the school transport scheme.  Bus Éireann, as agent of my Department, has a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 160,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout the country.  My Department has responsibility to ensure the State gets the best possible value for the money spent on this service.  It is not a cheap service.  In 1996 the net cost to the State was some £40 million.</P>
      <P>One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.  A school transport service to a national school may be established or retained only where there is a sufficient number of eligible children who are living in a distinct locality, and offering for transport to their nearest national school.  It must also ensure the average daily number of eligible children who would be conveyed each term would not be fewer than ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible for free school transport, children between the ages of four and ten must live <Col N="1516" /> at least two miles from, and be attending, their nearest national school, while older children must live at least three miles away.</P>
    <P>Closed schools which have amalgamated are taken into account in determining the nearest school for school transport purposes.  Where a school is closed and amalgamated with another, children in the closed school area are eligible for free transport to the school of amalgamation only.</P>
    <P>At all times it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice. However, it is not the object of the school transport scheme to facilitate parents in exercising that choice.</P>
    <P>The case referred to by the Deputy is that pupils from the Shean and Glencairn areas live in the Shean Beg closed school locality.  Shean Beg national school closed and amalgamated with Tallow national school.  The pupils living in the Shean and Glencairn areas are, therefore, eligible for transport to Tallow national school only, under the terms of the school transport scheme, and a service is available to this school.</P>
    <P>The other children, who do not reside in the Shean Beg closed school area, live less than two miles from Ballyduff Upper national school and are, therefore, ineligible for school transport on distance grounds.  Accordingly, none of the children in question is eligible for school transport to Ballyduff Upper national school, as they do not satisfy the conditions of the primary school transport scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, my Department's obligations are to eligible pupils only.  My Department would not be prepared to make special arrangements for basically ineligible children.  Therefore, it would not be possible to establish a service to Ballyduff Upper national school for the children from the Shean and Glencairn areas as requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>This question has been ongoing between the Department of Education and the school authorities for some time.  It appears that an application for disadvantaged status went astray last year and which, if granted, would have allowed the school to maintain its third teacher. Because of not being granted disadvantaged status the school is now being reduced from a three to a two teacher school.  In recent weeks one of the teachers has been placed on a panel for transfer.  The area schools inspector will have pointed out to the Department some of the <Col N="1517" /> ongoing problems experienced at the school for some time.  It would appear the Department is not prepared to take the necessary action to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>There are 50 pupils in the school which, in normal circumstances, would warrant a two teacher school.  The educational needs of many of the pupils in the school warranted the school being granted disadvantaged status last year.  As a result of an oversight disadvantaged status was not granted.  I made a late plea to the Minister to have this school included in the list of schools to be declared disadvantaged but that was not possible. I hope the Minister will reconsider the position.</P>
      <P>The parents of the children attending the school are worried.  They fear their children will not gain the full benefits available to them from the national school education system and that if they lose the third teacher there will be an imbalance in regard to the teachers who remain in the school.  This is very worrying for the future of the school.  Parents who met last night declared they will picket the school and the Department and take the pupils from the school.  This is not the appropriate action that should be taken.  I hope the Minister will accede to the request to grant the school disadvantaged status and in doing so to allow it to retain its third teacher.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for listening to my request but if he is not in a position to accede to it the parents will seek a meeting with him or the Minister for Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this matter.  I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the manner in which the staffing allocation of primary schools is determined.The staffing of a national school for a year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the INTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> The enrolment of Fenagh national school on 30 September 1996 was 53 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staff of a principal and one assistant for the 1997-8 school year.  In the circumstances, the second assistant's post will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  In addition to the staffing which I mentioned, this school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the enrolment of the school on 30 September 1996 had declined.  Fenagh national school would have had to achieve an enrolment of 55 pupils on 30 September 1996 to retain its second assistant teacher.  The teacher in question has been offered panel rights which effectively guarantees the teacher another permanent post in a school within a 28 mile radius of Fenagh national school.  Redeployment will not take place before September.</P>
    <P>The staffing agreement can be deviated from and additional posts allocated to a school in the current school year if either of two circumstances exists.  The first is where a school achieves developing school status.  This occurs as a result of rapid enrolment growth.  For Fenagh national school to achieve developing school status it would need to increase its enrolment in September 1997 to 78 pupils.  The second circumstance arises when a school is in breach of maximum class size guidelines.  Maximum class size guidelines in the current school year are as follows: 35 in the case of a single grade class grouping; 34 in the case of two consecutive class groupings; 31 in the case of multi-grade class groups and 29 in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.  If the managerial authorities at the school are unable to manage the enrolment within the recommended guidelines or if the school qualifies for developing school status, it is open to the authorities to contact my Department in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 May 1997.</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General wrote to the Secretary of my Department on 7 September 1995 advising that he wished to carry out a detailed value for money study of the Irish Genealogical Project.  The main issues to be examined were: whether prior appraisal of the project was adequate; the extent to which the project had achieved its objectives within time and budgetary targets; the systems and procedures established for managing the project.</P>
      <P>I laid the result of the report on Value for Money Examination of the Irish Genealogical project before the Dáil on 22 April 1997.</P>
      <P>In the study the Comptroller and Auditor General concentrated on the extent to which the project had succeeded in creating a computer database which would a provide a family history research service and the study also examined the management of the project.</P>
      <P>The study concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that by the end of July 1996 just over 29 per cent of the estimated 29 million records had been included in the database and that monitoring progress in implementing the project had been ineffective.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report.  It provides a committed and hard working team of genealogy tourism service providers throughout Ireland with an independent assessment of how improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of their operation can be put in place in the years ahead.  Focusing as it does on the effectiveness of the management of the project and the extent to which it has succeeded in creating the computer database, it highlights several important needs.  Chief among these is the need for the project to establish clear targets and to periodically assess progress relative to them.  As the report itself acknowledges, following the appointment of a chairperson and chief executive officer to Irish Genealogy Ltd. (IGL), a company established to function as the project's central co-ordinating agency, clear targets have now been set for the creation of a central referral index and for the development of a marketing plan for the project.  The research methodology employed in the compilation of the report provides a sound basis on which IGL will continue to plan and monitor progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated on page 32 of the report, recent management developments in the project are designed to ensure that the necessary leadership and direction are provided to build on the expertise, energy and enthusiasm of the many participants engaged in the project, whether in the Irish <Col N="1520" /> family history foundation centres, or as members of the professional genealogists associations, North and South, or in IGL and to ensure that the objective of providing a comprehensive family history research service based on a countrywide network of centres and independent professional genealogists is brought to completion.</P>
    <P>The Irish Genealogical Project will build this service for posterity which will be to the benefit of countless future generations of people of Irish ancestry.</P>

      <P>In response to the recommendations of the report of Ireland's Information Society Steering Committee, I launched the Government's Millennium Initiative on the Information Society on 9 April.</P>
      <P>I gave details of this comprehensive initiative in my answer to the House on 15 April and a copy of the press statement at the launch has been placed in the Dáil library.</P>
      <P>The Government's initiative, which will form part of Ireland's millennium celebrations, includes the Schools IT 2000 initiative announced by the Minister for Education, proposals to stimulate further developments in the business sector, and the establishment of an Information Society Commission.</P>
      <P>The Information Society Commission will have the function of shaping and overseeing the implementation of a strategic framework for the development of the Information Society Initiative in Ireland.  The commission will be asked to recommend changes in legislation to remove any limitations on the use of information and communication technologies.  The commission will also advise on measures to increase access to information and communications technologies, particularly measures aimed at those in disadvantaged groups.  In addition the commission will establish sectoral advisory groups to develop detailed recommendations for action based on the ideas put forward in the Steering Committee report.</P>
      <P>I have already announced the appointment of Ms Vivienne Jupp as Chairman of the Commission and the full membership of the commission will be announced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Information Society Initiative can be made most cost effective if there are elements of compatibility with what is being done internationally, in Britain and elsewhere.  The new British Government plans to &ldquo;wire-up schools, libraries, colleges and hospitals to the information super highway&rdquo;.  It plans a national grid for learning, franchised as a public-private partnership, which will help teachers update their skills.  It also plans a new university for industry, collaborating with <Col N="1521" /> the Open University to bring new opportunities to adults seeking to develop their potential.</P>
    <P>As a follow-up to the Information Society Initiative, I will be exploring possibilities for co-operation with the British Government during my visit to Britain this week.  There are opportunities for savings on educational hardware and software investments, and for co-operation on particular courses and subjects.  Specifically, I would like Ireland to have inputs to, and benefits from, both the proposed new national grid for learning, and the new university for industry.  I look forward to discussing the possibilities for co-operation in these areas with Tony Blair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department, in conjunction with the health boards and voluntary organisations, have been engaged in a programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap, including those with autism, from psychiatric hospitals and other unsuitable placements to more appropriate care settings.  It has been the policy of my Department for some 15 years that persons with a mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be appropriately treated elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of persons with autism are in receipt of services within the mental handicap services including multi-disciplinary support services, residential, respite and day services and home support services.  However, a minority require specialised facilities.  Specific services for persons with autism are available in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards which provide between 128 and 130 residential <Col N="1522" /> places overall.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities as outlined in my Department's Policy Document on Services to Persons with Autism which was published in 1994, is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.</P>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to £225,000 in 1994 and £300,000 in 1995 was made available for the development of services to persons with autism in line with my Department's policy document.Some of the additional funding provided in 1997 for the overall development of services to persons with a mental handicap is also being used to further enhance services to persons with autism in line with the recommendations outlined in my Department's policy document.</P>
    <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.  The committees are representative of the health boards, the voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap in each board area.</P>
    <P>Recently an Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap, 1997-2001 was published.  The assessment provides a comprehensive picture of the requirements for additional residental and day services for persons with a mental handicap, including those with autism, over the period concerned.  The Government is committed, under Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness, to the development of services to persons with a mental handicap, within overall resource parameters, based on this assessment of need.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>It is a requirement of the Chinese adoption authorities that applications for the adoption of Chinese children be transmitted by a relevant governmental organisation or by a recognised non-governmental organisation.  The Adoption Board is already undertaking the task of transmitting documents on behalf of prospective adopters to the China Centre for Adoption Affairs in Beijing.The relevant Chinese authorities have been informed accordingly.</P>
      <P>On 21 April I wrote to International Orphan Aid informing them that I was prepared to agree to that organisation also transmitting applications for adoption from China to the Chinese authorities.This approval is granted on the strict understanding that only applications from persons who have been approved by the Adoption Board for a foreign adoption in accordance with the requirements of the Adoption Act, 1991, will be forwarded to China and that International Orphan Aid will comply fully with the requirements of the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>I am at present making arrangements through the offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs for the Chinese authorities to be informed accordingly.  However, the final decision with regard to the approval of International Orphan Aid for the purposes of transmitting documents to China is one for the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>The role of the Adoption Board as regards the transmission of documentation to China will remain as before and it will be open to prospective adopters to decide whether they wish to have their documents transmitted to China by the Adoption Board or by International Orphan Aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> There are approximately 12,500 beds in the acute public hospital system.  As the Deputy will be aware, the total number of beds available varies because some beds will be closed from time to time and over the winter period extra beds are brought into the system.  Hospital bed closures are usually planned to coincide with periods when staff are on annual leave and this is to take advantage of a fall off in elective procedures during the holidays.  In addition, such periods are often used as an opportunity to refurbish wards or to carry out minor capital improvements.  Decisions on bed requirements are best left to local management.</P>
      <P>In looking at acute hospital service delivery it is inappropriate to focus solely on bed numbers as a measure of hospital resources.  In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on overall levels of service provided in acute hospitals rather than on the provision of a specific number of beds.  This is a reflection of the major changes in medical practice which have resulted in a reduction in the length of stay for in-patient care, the marked shift towards day case surgery and treatment of patients at out-patient level.</P>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will understand that the scheduling of admission to hospital is determined solely on the basis of the patient's medical condition and not on the length of time spent on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are obviously given priority.  My Department does not routinely collect data on average waiting periods for admission to acute public hospitals.  This is because waiting times can vary depending on the local conditions such as the impact of emergency admissions on scheduled routine admissions. Also, the success of many modern surgical procedures has led to increased demand and consequently longer waiting times for non-emergency cases.  We have experienced this in the case of hip replacements.</P>
      <P>However, I am anxious to improve waiting times and waiting lists.  Since I came into office I have provided significant resources for new developments to help improve access times to acute hospitals based on the priorities identified by the hospitals.  I have also provided £20 million under the waiting list initiatives since 1995 for specialities where waiting times have been deemed excessive and I am providing a further £8 million this year to further improve the position.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, a general manager has been seconded to the hospital from the health board very recently and financial expertise has also been engaged to assist the hospital.</P>

      <P>This Government is the first to assign specific responsibility to a Minister of State for services to persons with a mental handicap.

    <P>I am pleased that the number of organ donors shows an increase in 1997.  However, it must be pointed out that the number of organs offered, retrieved and ultimately used will vary due to a number of factors including size and compatibility.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I wish to take Questions Nos. 21 and 66 together.  The paramedics' pay dispute was referred to the Labour Court for hearing on Monday, 28 April 1997.  The court issued its findings on 30 April 1997, recommending, in summary, an increase of 5.5 per cent at the minimum point of each scale, 10.5 per cent of the maximum point of each scale, and a 2 per cent long service increment on the basic entry grade scale.</P>
      <P>In addition, the court also recommended setting up an expert group to examine and report on the changes in the relevant professions and in this context to address the anomalies within the group.  As the Deputies are no doubt aware, IMPACT, on behalf of the paramedic professions has suspended strike action and is currently balloting its members on the basis of the Labour Court's recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand from the health boards that the needs of applicants for incontinence wear are assessed on an individual basis, taking account of each person's particular medical requirements. Supplies are than provided according to need and individual needs are reviewed on a regular basis. In relation to the case to which I understand the Deputy is referring, I have asked my Department to seek an immediate report from the chief executive officer of the relevant health board on this matter.  I will communicate further with the Deputy on receipt of the report.</P>
      <P>With reference to the Deputy's query regarding the five year plan for mental health, I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the Government's commitment to the development of services for persons with a mental handicap.  My colleague, Deputy O'Shea recently published an Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap, 1997-2001 based on information from the national intellectual disability database.  The assessment provides a comprehensive picture of the requirements for additional residential and day services for persons with a mental handicap over the period concerned.  The Government is committed, under Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness, to the development of services to persons with a mental handicap, within overall resource parameters, based on this assessment of need.</P>
      <P>With regard to plans in respect of the mental health services, it has been the policy of successive Governments to restructure the mental health services through the development of services located in the community as an alternative to institutional-based care.  This policy is based on the recommendations of the report on the development of the mental health services &mdash; Planning for the Future &mdash; which was published in 1984.</P>
      <P>Acute psychiatric units at general hospitals, day hospitals, day centres and community residential accommodation are now being provided to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>The shift in the provision of services from the traditional institutional-based model of care to a community-based care setting has been extremely successful and is widely accepted as providing a more comprehensive service for patients and a much improved quality of life for persons who were former patients of psychiatric hospitals.</P>

        <i>North-Eastern Health Board</i>
      </P>
      <P>The board provides chiropody services in its institutions catering for elderly patients and for patients in day care centres attached to such institutions.  Arrangements are made with local chiropodists to provide such services on a sessional basis.  The board has been encouraging general practitioners in its area to provide services, such as chiropody, on a sessional basis and the general practice unit currently funds chiropody services in the Abbey House Medical Centre, Navan.</P>
      <P>
        <i>North-Western Health Board</i>

      <P>The board provides chiropody services at clinics in various locations.  A chiropody service is provided for persons in the following categories &mdash; persons aged 66 years and over, expectant mothers, mentally handicapped persons and diabetics.  The board employs a total of five chiropodists &mdash; four on a full-time basis and one on a sessional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" />
      <i>South-Eastern Health Board</i>
    </P>
    <P>The board provides some chiropody services on a sessional basis and, in addition, funding is provided to voluntary agencies, under section 65 of the Health Act, 1970, to provide these services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Southern Health Board</i>
    </P>
    <P>The community care chiropody service is available to the elderly and to people at risk. The services operates from five fully-equipped clinics, plus the use of another clinic, in Cork city and county.  The chiropodists also provide a service to St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork University Hospital &mdash; Diabetic Clinic only &mdash; two psychiatric hospitals and one geriatric hospital. Four full-time and one part-time chiropodists provide the services listed above.  Sessional chiropodists are employed to provide services to four centres in Kerry.</P>
    <P>A limited chiropody service is available to a number of community hospitals throughout Cork and Kerry.  This service is generally provided by local practitioners on a sessional basis every month &mdash; five weeks or whenever the need is perceived by hospital staff.</P>
    <P>Other chiropody services are arranged by voluntary organisations throughout the region as part of the service they provide to their client groups e.g. day care centres.  The majority of these organisations are in receipt of funding under section 65 of the Health Act, 1970 from the board.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Western Health Board</i>
    </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy is aware, last year, the Government set up an interdepartmental group to review the system of food safety controls in Ireland.  In October 1996 the Government accepted the group's principal recommendation for the establishment of a new statutory-based food safety body with executive powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation for the establishment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is currently being drafted and I intend to be in a position to bring a Bill before the House prior to the summer recess. Pending enactment of this legislation the new Food Safety Authority of Ireland has been set up on an iterim, non-statutory basis.  The interim board, which is chaired by Dr. Daniel O'Hare, <Col N="1531" /> President of Dublin City University, is charged with putting in place the structures and formulating the work programme for the new authority.This means that some of the groundwork will have been completed when the statutory body commences to operate and will allow the statutory authority to have a strong and immediate impact in the area of food safety.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the new Food Safety Authority of Ireland is to ensure that the highest standards of food safety and hygiene are observed and that the regulations and controls are properly enforced by the various State agencies.  As part of its work, the new authority will carry out audits to assess the effectiveness of the systems operated by the various official agencies engaged in the enforcement of food safety requirements.  The authority will publish reports of such audits and inspections.  The authority will also subsume the role and functions of the current Food Safety Advisory Board which I established, under Order, in June 1995, and which has been a major sources of expert advice to myself and other Ministers on food safety and other food related matters.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that this Government is strongly committed to food safety; the establishment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland represents a radical and innovative step in the development of our food controls.  Our comprehensive proposals for this new authority will give the consumer an independent and powerful body dedicated to ensuring compliance with the very best food safety and hygiene standards.</P>

The proposed programme would include studies on the possible health effects of ionising radiation on the population in the area, the establishment of a survelilance system for congenital malformations in the area, and a research programme to determine the epidemiology of cancers in the region and to report on the risk factors for the population.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I recently published an Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997 to 2001 as identified from the National Intellectual Disability Database.</P>
      <P>The overall number of persons with a mental handicap identified by the database is 26,694, of whom 22,804 persons are receiving a service; 604 persons currently have no services and require either a residential, including a day service, or a day service only and 3,286 persons have no current service requirements.</P>
      <P>The 22,804 persons who are receiving a service includes 1,280 persons who receive a day service but also require a residential place and 452 persons who are in residential care but also require a day service.  A small group of 23 persons currently receive only minimal support services and require both a residential and day service.</P>
      <P>These figures translate into a requirement for 1,439 new residential/respite places and 1,036 new day places over the next five years.  It is estimated that the cost of providing these services would be in the region of £63.5 million over the period. Additional funding of £12 million has been made available in 1997 to begin the process of meeting these needs.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed, as outlined in Partnership 200 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness to continue to build on the improvements in services for persons with a mental handicap which have been put in place in recent years within overall resource parameters and based on the needs identified in the Assessment of Need.</P>

I have been informed by the hospital that if, on examination at an outpatient clinic, it is felt that a patient requires an ECG, the patient will undergo the test immediately. That same day the patient will return to the cardiologist who then reviews the results of the ECG. As the ECG and consultation take place on the same day, there is no waiting period in the interim.</P>
      <P>With regard to patients who have been referred to the outpatient clinic by their GP, I am aware that the current waiting time for an appointment is approximately one year.  I am informed by the hospital that if a GP is concerned about the urgency of any particular case he or she has direct recourse to the cardiologist who will advise accordingly with regard to the timing of the child's appointment.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the waiting time for this outpatient service.  In recent days this issue has been discussed at a meeting between officials of my Department and representatives of the hospital.  My Department has asked the hospital to put forward proposals to address the current waiting times.  When received, these proposals will be examined with a view to alleviating the current waiting times for patients in the most effective manner and having regard to current available resources.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> There have been a number of investments over the past few years in the area of cardiac surgery.These have been concerned with supporting overall activity and with improving capacity in the public sector at the current adult cardiac centres at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the additional investment in cardiac surgery facilities, waiting lists for adults have been increasing.  The need to further improve facilities has been acknowledged and to deal with the immediate situation, I decided last year to use funding from the waiting list initiative to provide extra cardiac procedures.  This was achieved by entering into contracts with private hospitals both here and in Northern Ireland to carry out the additional work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> To address the needs of the service on a more permanent basis, I established a cardiac surgery group last year to review and report on proposals for the development of additional cardiac surgery facilities in this country.  Proposals for the location of 500 additional procedures will be considered by the group.  The four hospitals invited to submit proposals were Cork University Hospital, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, St. James's Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
    <P>All four hospitals have submitted proposals to the group who have also met representatives of the hospitals to discuss the details of the proposals.The group have also met cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons to ascertain their views on developments to this service.</P>
    <P>Cardiac surgery is a high technology speciality which requires advanced levels of medical and technical expertise.  The development of this service requires a complex analysis of demand and need taking into account clinical, epidemiological and financial factors.  The improvement of cardiac surgery facilities represents a major investment which must be considered in a structured manner.</P>
    <P>The group is in the process of finalising its report which will make recommendations regarding the future development of the service.  It hopes to present its final report to me shortly.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the proposals by the Galway branch of the Irish Society for Autism to develop a farm for young adults at Claregalway.</P>
      <P>The development of services for persons with autism in the western region is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board. Recently I approved an allocation of £850,000 to the Western Health Board for the provision of new residential/respite and day care places in 1997 for persons with a mental handicap, including those with autism.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the planning and co-ordination of services to persons with a mental handicap or autism in the Western Health Board area, and details of the precise services to be put in place, will be agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee in line with the priority needs which have been identified for the region.  The co-ordinating committee is representatives of the health board, voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> My Department is also examining measures to further enhance the services to persons with autism in line with the recommendations outlined in our policy document on Services to Persons with Autism.</P>

    <P>It is my intention to replace the existing Food Hygiene Regulations 1950-89 with a single statutory instrument which will also transpose into Irish law the provision of EU Directive 93/43 on the Hygiene of Foodstuffs.  To this end, my Department has been involved in extensive consultation with both the food industry and the <Col N="1537" /> enforcement agencies, and the preparation of the new Food Hygiene Regulations is now at a very advanced stage.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, I assure the Deputy that my Department is already actively promoting the principles and practices contained in the EU Directive.  A fundamental element of the Directive is the promotion of the system of HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) under which the operator of a food business is required to identify any step in his activities which is critical to ensuring food safety and to make sure that adequate safety procedures are identified, implemented, maintained and reviewed.</P>
    <P>Funding has been provided by my Department to the health boards to enable enforcement officials to undertake training in HACCP; most officials at local level have now been given formal training.  The National Food Centre is providing training courses for industry to enable businesses to install HACCP systems and National Hygiene Partnership, with which the Department of Health is associated, has developed a number of initiatives in food hygiene training for those employed in industry including a course, supported by my Department, which is based around the Directive.</P>
    <P>Directive 93/43 requires the member states to encourage the development of guides to good hygiene practice which may be used voluntarily by food businesses as a guide to compliance with the provisions of the Directive.  My Department has been very active in encouraging industry to become involved in the preparation of guides to good hygiene practice which are specific to different sectors of the food industry and has also sought the services of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  To date three sectoral guides have been completed in respect of the catering, beverage and food processing sectors of the food industry.  Two more guides &mdash; for the retail/wholesale sector and for food processors working from the domestic kitchen &mdash; are close to completion, and a further guide for Irish country markets is being prepared.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the new Food Safety Authority of Ireland which has been established on an informal basis, pending the early enactment of legislation.  The function of the new Authority will be to ensure that the highest standards of food safety and hygiene are observed and that food controls are properly enforced by the various State agencies. As part of its work, the new Authority will carry out audits to assess the effectiveness of the systems operated by the various official agencies engaged in the enforcement of food safety requirements and will publish reports of such audits and inspections.  My proposals for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland will give the consumer an independent and powerful body dedicated to ensuring compliance with the very best food safety and hygiene standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will be aware that in October 1995 I gave the go-ahead to the establishment of a national screening programme for women aged 50-64.  Since then work has been ongoing on the organisational structures and operational arrangements required to implement the phased expansion of the programme and on resolving the data protection issues surrounding the compilation of a population register.</P>
      <P>I was pleased, therefore, to be in a position to announce on 4 March 1997 the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the National Cancer Strategy.  The plan provides for the establishment of a national steering group to guide the implementation of the National Programme of Screening for Breast Cancer and the introduction of legislation to ensure the screening programme will comply with data protection requirements.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the National Breast Screening Programme will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas.  It will target 120,000 women in the 50-64 age group, which represents 50 per cent of the national target population.  The target group selected represents those women at greatest risk of developing breast cancer and it is intended to provide a comprehensive screening service on a national basis to women in that age group over the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is guided by the need for the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population, ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The valuable experience gained from the phased implementation of the programme will inform decisions about extending breast screening facilities to other groups of women, including decisions on the provision of screening facilities for other age cohorts.  In the circumstances, I do <Col N="1539" /> not have any plans at this stage to extend the programme to women over the age of 65 years.  The Department will, of course, continue to monitor international developments and research in relation to age as a factor in the targeting of groups for screening.  In the meantime, diagnostic facilities are available to all women, on referral from their GPs.  In this regard, the Deputy will wish to know that diagnostic mammographic facilities are provided at 19 centres throughout the country.  Furthermore, I am confident that the investment in the infrastructure for the national screening programme will have the added benefit of improving the quality of diagnostic and treatment services for all women with breast disease.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> IMPACT, on behalf of Environmental Health Officers, withdrew from negotiations which were being pursued under Clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and pursued industrial action in the form of a &ldquo;work-to-rule&rdquo; with effect from 15 January 1996.</P>
      <P>Efforts to resolve the impasse continued on an informal basis culminating in a formal meeting under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board on 25 June 1996.  On Wednesday, 26 June, I met with IMPACT and a delegation of Environmental Health Officers to explore whether the provision of the joint Government/ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 could usefully be applied to resolving the current impasse in the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 July 1996, with the assistance of a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission, an informal meeting took place between management <Col N="1540" /> and the union.  The meeting was of considerable assistance to both sides and as a result negotiations continued up until quite recently when IMPACT took the decision to escalate the work-to-rule.</P>
    <P>Following renewed contact between both sides the Health Service Employers' Agency and IMPACT met on 26 March 1997 with a view to re-opening discussions.  As a result the threatened escalation in the work-to-rule did not take place.</P>
    <P>The matter was referred again to the Labour Relations Commission and a hearing was held on Thursday, 1 May 1997, at which significant progress was made.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficult and protracted nature of this dispute, I am now confident that, with the ongoing assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, a satisfactory resolution will be achieved in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in my reply to Priority Question No. 7 on Wednesday, 30 April 1997, I gave a comprehensive account of the most recent political and humanitarian developments in the Great Lakes region and of Ireland's reaction to the grave situation facing the remaining Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire, as well as a detailed account of Irish Aid's integrated programme of emergency and rehabilitation spending both within Rwanda and in the Great Lakes region as a whole.</P>
      <P>The principles which govern the disbursement of Irish Aid moneys remain absolutely clear: aid should be used to reach those who need it most and should, as far as possible, support the capacity of local people to build peaceful and stable societies.  The provision of aid to the Government of Rwanda in 1995 and 1996 should be seen firmly in this context.</P>
      <P>Irish aid to the Great Lakes has been as part of the concerted international effort to bring about peace, stability and reconciliation in the region. Our effort has been ongoing for three years. Since 1994, Irish Aid has given almost IR£12.5 million in emergency and rehabilitation aid to the region.  Deputies will be aware of the Government's balanced approach in providing this aid from reports to Dáil Éireann as well as from the briefings which have been given to the Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation.</P>
      <P>Just over IR£2 million of our assistance has been channelled through Government of Rwanda programmes.  This money had been specifically targeted to support primary health care, the training of magistrates, the resettlement of refugees and the rehabilitation of genocide survivors, together with support for women's groups.</P>
      <P>A further IR£4.8 million has been disbursed, again since 1994, through Irish NGOs operating in Rwanda and through international organistions.Apart from providing shelter to genocide survivors and returning refugees from Zaire and Tanzania, a particular area of activity has been the improvement of prison conditions.  Ireland has provided support through the UN system for refugee resettlement and for human rights monitoring by the UN Centre for Human Rights. Assistance has been provided also to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Great Lakes region as a whole, 52 per cent of Irish emergency and rehabilitation aid for 1996 was given through NGOs.  It is likely that a <Col N="1544" /> similar percentage of aid for the region will be disbursed through NGOs in 1997.</P>
    <P>Funding to the Government of Rwanda, in common with all Irish Aid disbursements, has always been subject to systematic monitoring, evaluation and reporting requirements.  Officials from the Development Co-operation Division of my Department, including an auditor and a rehabilitation monitoring expert, who last inspected the projects in March 1997 are satisfied that the money provided is being used effectively and correctly.  A further three visits to Rwanda to inspect projects funded by Irish Aid and implemented both through the Government of Rwanda and through NGO partners are planned for the coming year.  Any allegations that Irish Aid money is being diverted for military purposes are, quite simply, groundless.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to continuing to support the rebuilding of Rwandan society and to providing aid through the most effective channels.</P>
    <P>With regard to the refugees remaining in eastern Zaire, it is a positive development that these refugees have begun to return to the camps at Biaro and Kasese from which they fled last week, thereby permitting their onward repatriation to Rwanda.  On the other hand, it is extremely distressing that almost one hundred people were killed as a result of overcrowding on a train transporting refugees from Biaro to Kisangani.  In addition, the fact that many of these refugees appear to have been attacked and wounded within the last week is a matter of grave concern. I reiterate the Government's unequivocal condemnation of any murders or other human rights abuses which may have taken place and our commitment to ensuring that the full facts of the events in eastern Zaire are investigated and made public.  The Deputy will be aware that a team of UN human rights monitors is being deployed in the Kisangani region in the coming days.  Ireland has agreed to provide IR£25,000 in support of this mission, aimed at preventing further human rights abuses.</P>
    <P>We have expressed our concerns to the Governments in the region who may have influence on the rebel alliance.  In the past two weeks, the EU Troika and Special Envoy Ajello have made demarches to the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda to express the Union's concerns about the humanitarian situation.  Mr. Ajello has had meetings with President Museveni of Uganda and Mr. Kabila.  We were also in touch with the US State Department about these concerns in advance of Ambassador Richardson's visit to the region.</P>
    <P>Following the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 29 and 30 April where the issue of Zaire was discussed in detail, the Council has called<i>inter alia</i> for the fulfilment of undertakings given by Mr. Kabila in relation to immediate access for the humanitarian agencies in Zaire as well as for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a peaceful and negotiated settlement. <Col N="1545" /> We have also expressed our deep concern at continuing reports of human rights violations and urged the UN to investigate them as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I confirm that this person's original claim form was mislaid in my Department after it was received in April 1992.  The claimant was informed about this by letter of 2 October 1992, the Department expressed its regret to him for what had occurred and he immediately completed and submitted a new claim form.</P>
      <P>This claim was sent to the United Nations Compensation Commission in Geneva with other category C claims and was not disadvantaged in any way.  Settlement of all category C claims has been delayed because of the non-availability until this year of funds to meet them.</P>

      <P>Information technology training requirements of individual Government Departments are primarily a matter for each Department.</P>
      <P>Over the years my Department has used a range of private companies to provide computer training for both its general service and information technology staff.  IT training for general service staff is currently provided by a commercial company, chosen as a result of a competitive tendering process conducted last year.  Such an exercise is conducted every three years.  Twenty six courses have been organised for staff of the Department since the present company was chosen and in the preceding two years 47 courses were organised for staff of the Department by its predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wherever possible, the services of the chosen training company are also used to meet the <Col N="1546" /> specialist technical training requirements of the Department's IT staff, otherwise these are sourced, as required, on the public schedules of a variety of training companies.  In the last three years, IT staff have attended 11 specialist courses with our chosen training company and 67 specialist courses with other companies.  Where possible, quotations are obtained from a number of suitable companies for such services, although the specialist nature of the training required and the timing of the courses may mean that this is not always feasible.</P>
    <P>The Centre for Management and Organisation Development (CMOD) of my Department has responsibility for the provision of some technical training to other Government Departments and Offices and has, where specialist expertise is required in so doing, engaged commercial companies to provide such training.  These companies were chosen following a competitive market exercise.Over the past two years three companies have been engaged on the provision of six systems analysis courses and four project management courses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person makes a gift of an asset to another, or transfers, an asset at under market value, the transaction may come within the scope of the following separate taxes:</P>
      <P>Capital gains tax (CGT) in respect of any chargeable gain accruing to the person making the gift; and</P>
      <P>Capital acquisition tax (CAT) on the taxable value of the gift taken by the person receiving the gift.</P>
      <P>It is unclear from the question the type of situation that the Deputy has in mind when he refers to a disposal which is exempt from gift tax but is charged to capital gains tax.  In general, where a parent makes a gift of property to a child the parent may be subject to capital gains tax on the disposal of the property and the child may be subject to capital acquisition tax on receipt of the gift.  However, the liability to each tax would depends on the precise circumstances and the reliefs available within each of the taxes.</P>
      <P>Where a person acquires an asset and subsequently disposes of it, the person is deemed to have realised a capital gain equal to the increase in the asset's value over the period.  In general, the gain is chargeable to capital gains tax at a rate of 40 per cent.  A disposal takes place whenever the ownership of an asset changes, irrespective of whether payment is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital acquisitions tax (CAT) is due whenever a person receives a gift or an inheritance, subject to certain exemptions, thresholds and reliefs.  A person may receive assets worth up to £185,550 (Class 1 threshold) from his-her parents free of capital acquisitions tax.  Therefore, a child would be entitled to reduce the taxable value of a gift <Col N="1548" /> from a parent by £185,550 and this means that no capital acquisition tax would be payable on gifts below this threshold received from a parent.  Furthermore, if the gift came within the rules of either agricultural or business relief, then the child could receive up to £1,855,500 in either farm or business assets free from capital acquisition tax.  These examples assume that the child has not received any previous benefits from all sources since 2 June 1982.</P>
    <P>While both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax may arise in respect of the same event, i.e., a gift, they constitute two separate and distinct taxes.  Capital gains tax is a disposals based tax and is levied on the gain made over the period of time that an individual has held the asset.  Capital acquisitions tax is an acquisitions based tax and is levied on the individual who acquires a gift or inheritance and takes into consideration the relationship between the disponer and beneficiary and any previous gifts received by the beneficiary.Therefore, situations can arise where capital gains tax is payable in respect of a gift but no capital acquisitions tax is due.  The opposite can also arise whereby capital acquisition tax is payable but a capital gains tax charge does not arise on the gift.  Given the different bases and objectives of the two taxes this should not be considered to be inappropriate in principle.</P>
    <P>Finally, I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that where capital acquisition tax is payable on a gift and this gift is also a disposal of an asset for capital gains tax purposes, then in calculating the amount of capital acquisition tax payable, credit is allowed for the amount of capital gains tax paid.</P>

      <P>The initiatives introduced in the third level education area by this Government effectively removed, for the most part, the reason for the provision of tax on covenants which I withdrew with effect from the 1996-97 tax year.</P>
      <P>The initiatives I refer to include the abolition of fees in respect of full-time third level under-graduate courses in publicly funded colleges and in respect of post leaving certificate courses.  Provision has also been made for tax relief on fees paid in respect of full-time approved undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in approved private colleges.</P>
      <P>These developments have significantly eased the financial burden for families whose children choose to enter third level education.  Consequently, I have no plans to restore tax relief on convenants.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The longer-term solution to the problem of the disposal of healthcare risk waste lies in the joint north-south approach to the market for a contractor to provide the service of collection, transport, treatment and disposal.  A joint waste management board, representing this Department and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, should soon be in a position to recommend the appointment of a contractor.  The treatment process will be a non-incineration one employing shredding and disinfection.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, following the closure of hospital incinerators here, the healthcare risk waste has been exported for incineration.  Initially England was the destination of this waste but the UK banned the import of waste for incineration last year.  Following representations from our Department of the Environment, the UK authorities agreed to allow importation of healthcare risk waste from Ireland up to the end of 1997. During the three to four month period while the UK ban was in force, the Department arranged for the waste to be exported to Holland for incineration.This arrangement ceased at the end of February 1997 at which stage the UK route had re-opened.  The health boards and voluntary hospitals have negotiated agreements with a number of different contractors who are exporting the waste for incineration in Britain.</P>
      <P>I understand that one of the contractors involved experienced some delays in obtaining the necessary import permits into the UK and as a result some containers of waste were held up pending receipt of the necessary transfrontier shipment documentation.  The position is that these containers were shipped immediately on receipt of this documentation at the end of March and I understand there is no backlog or stockpiling at present.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The waiting lists for health board long stay homes for the elderly vary from health board to health board depending on the stock of beds available.  Some boards have short waiting lists but the Eastern Health Board have long lists as their supply of public places is relatively small.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 under which applicants are assessed for subvention, do not compel any individual to sell his or her home in order to pay for nursing home care.  Indeed, when assessing an individual's means and circumstances the principal residence is treated as a special asset, and is not taken into account where the house is occupied by a dependent spouse or relative.  Where it is not so occupied and income from the house is imputed, based on notional value.  In the final analysis, the disposal of an individual's house to fund nursing home fees is a private decision and a matter of consumer preference over which I, as Minister for Health, have no control.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Nursing Homes Act, subject to regular review in its operation, is capable of meeting its objective, which is to provide assistance towards the cost of nursing home care for those who cannot do so from their own resources. I am aware that there are certain difficulties being encountered by some providers and persons seeking nursing home care.  I will continue to endeavour to address these problems within the resources available to me.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Eastern Health Board, we have been endeavouring over the past few years to increase the number of public nursing home places.  Fifty additional places have been provided in Peamount and 17 in Leopardstown Park Hospital.  New community nursing units and day facilities have been opened in Cuan Ros, Navan Road and on the site of the old Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.  In addition, between January 1995 and January 1997 the Eastern Health Board has contracted 90 beds in private nursing homes.</P>

On 22 October 1996 and in January 1997 the person attended the out-patient clinic in the Adelaide Hospital concerning her hip and was subsequent placed on the total hip replacement waiting st.  The hospital is not in a position to give an admission date at this time.  The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.  The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Over the past few years my Department has made substantial funding available to the International Missionary Training Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda in respect of the establishment of a CT scanning service.  In September 1996, I approved a consultant radiologist post for the hospital to initiate a regional CT service for the Louth-Meath area.  In addition, it was agreed that the existing single-handed radiologist based at Dundalk would provide cover at the International Missionary Training Hospital for the CT scanning service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I recently conveyed approval in principle to the appointment of a second radiologist <Col N="1555" /> post based at Navan.  It is understood that this post will also have a sessional commitment to the International Missionary Training Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this substantial investment in radiology services will facilitate the North-Eastern Health Board in the development of a high quality comprehensive service for the people of Louth and Meath and will also meet the CT requirements across the three hospitals.</P>
    <P>On the question of the delay in getting the CT Service off the ground, I have been advised by the health board and International Missionary Training Hospital that the main obstacle has been the securing of a permanent consultant radiologist.Generally there is a long lead in time from approval of the post to having a consultant commence duties, and this is common to all permanent consultant appointments.</P>
    <P>I am assured that both agencies are making every effort to secure an interim arrangement, pending the appointment of a permanent radiologist.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The hospital authorities at Naas General Hospital have submitted a report to me in recent days outlining a number of problems which have arisen at the hospital as a result of an increase in activity over the past three years.  In an effort to reduce inconvenience to patients the hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives as follows: provision of a new day ward to free up inpatient beds previously used for day case procedures; provision of a fully equipped observation room in the Accident and Emergency Department to accommodate six patients.  This facility is currently being extended to provide for up to 13 patients; appointment of a bed manager to ensure the most efficient use of in-patient beds; and assignment of extra medical and nursing staff to the A &amp; E Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the recent opening of the new day hospital for the elderly is expected to facilitate <Col N="1557" /> earlier discharge and day treatment for patients who would otherwise have to be admitted.</P>
    <P>In 1996, as you may be aware, I announced approval for phase 2 of a major development at Naas General Hospital at a cost of £19 million over the next three years.  Phase 1 of the development included a Psychiatric Unit and ancillary facilities and was completed in 1991 at a cost of £3.3 million.  Phase 2 addresses all the major problem areas in the hospital and provides for the development of many of the existing departments together with a new A &amp; E department, out-patients department, radiology department, theatre, day ward and pharmacy.  The detailed design and tendering stage will proceed as soon as the planning brief for the project is approved.</P>
    <P>The improvement of patient facilities at Naas Hospital together with the construction of the new hospital at Tallaght will serve to ensure the delivery of an efficient and high quality health care service for patients in this catchment area.</P>

    <P>There is no evidence to suggest any increase in cancer mortality in children due to Chernobyl or other nuclear accidents.  Since a system of national cancer registration was not in place at the time of the Chernobyl accident, data on cancer incidence are not available for that period.  It should be noted, however, that a national cancer registry has since been established, and its first report, relating to newly diagnosed cancers in 1994 will be published in the near future.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy may be aware, the report The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly, stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Additional funding was made available to the health services to implement key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers.</P>
      <P>I might add that my Department allocates £80,000 annually in core funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for people with dementia throughout the country.  I am providing an additional allocation of £50,000 to the society for 1997.  I have also allocated the sum of £100,000 in lottery funding this year to The Carers' Association who provide support services for carers, including those caring for dementia sufferers.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which commenced on 1 September 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Just over £17 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to mention the conference entitled Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders &mdash; Practical Management and Prevention, <Col N="1560" /> held in Limerick on 20-22 November last.  This conference was organised by my Department, in association with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and with the support of the European Commission.The purpose of the conference was to exchange information and to evaluate the success of practical advice and management and prevention strategies currently employed in relation to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.  The conference was extremely successful and the various papers presented were thought provoking.  It is intended to publish the conference proceedings this year and I am sure that the final document will provide a useful database for policy makers, health professionals, hospital managers and carers working with sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Following the Government decisions of February 1996 on measures to reduce the demand <Col N="1561" /> for drugs which included a number of key measures in regard to data collection, the Department requested that each health board put in place initiatives to ensure that it is fully informed of the level of abuse in its area and of any new emerging trends.  Additional funding has been provided to each board to implement these decisions and a proportion of each allocation is being used towards research.</P>
      <P>Funding is also provided to the Health Research Board which produces an annual report on treated drug misuse.  This report includes data related to persons who present for treatment for drug misuse.  The board has commissioned a study to be carried out in 1997 on the prevalence of hard drug misuse in Dublin.</P>
      <P>All health boards, in co-operation with the Health Research Board, are now setting up databases on drug misuse in each area which will improve the quality of data available on drug misuse, provide comparable data on misuse and a more complete picture of the incidence of such misuse.  This will allow for a more co-ordinated response to the drug misuse problem.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to be precise about the total amount of money being spent on research by the health boards as in many cases this research is funded from their ongoing allocations.  However, the North-Eastern Board has indicated that it has allocated £25,000 for research into drug abuse among 16 to 25 year olds.  The research is still in progress and will not be completed until September 1997.  The Southern Health Board also commissioned a drug and alcohol use survey in 1995 at a cost of £56,000.  The main sample totalled 1,500 in the 15-44 age group from the general population.  This was followed up by a booster sample totalling 600 from the 15-24 year old age group residing in the most deprived urban areas of the health board.  The results of the survey are currently being analysed and it is hoped to formally present them in mid-June 1997.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, as part of its ongoing restructuring programme, has been conducting research and is compiling databases of clients attending each new drug treatment project.The board has plans this year to fund a research post which will be based in Trinity Court, Pearse Street, to carry out evaluations of various treatment options.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department was involved in research during 1995 when Ireland participated in a European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs (ESPAD) which was conducted among a random sample of 16 year olds, averaging about 2,000 students in each country, under the aegis of the Swedish National Council for Information of alcohol and other drugs and the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preliminary results of the study show that 16 year olds in the UK and Ireland who were surveyed tended to report somewhat higher levels of illicit drug use than other countries in the study. However, it should be stressed that the majority <Col N="1562" /> of young people &mdash; about two-thirds &mdash; never tried any illicit substance even on a single occasion.</P>
    <P>The final results of this survey are being collated and will be published shortly.  The Health Promotion Unit of my Department has contributed £19,556 towards the cost of Ireland's participation in this survey.</P>
    <P>During 1996, the National Youth Federation, with financial support of £7,000 from the Health Promotion Unit, undertook an information-based piece of secondary research with a view to producing clear, reliable and understandable information on what ecstasy is and the problems associated with the use of ecstasy.  The report will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the Economic and Social Research Institute carried out a survey on the smoking and drinking behaviour of 4,000 young people aged 12-18 in Ireland on behalf of the Health Promotion Unit at a cost of £29,000.  A report on the findings of the survey has been published.</P>

The agency's total budget for 1997, including salaries, is £992,000.  The agency is funded by the health service employers it represents.  The agency incorporates the Office of Health Management which has been established to provide a health service management centre and to implement the other high priority recommendations in the recently published report on a management development strategy for health and personal social services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> There are no hard data on the percentage of youths who may participate in illegal drug use. The Health Research Board report on Treated Drug Misuse in Ireland (1995) noted that 3,399 people, of whom 31 per cent, or 1,054, were teenagers, presented for treatment in the greater Dublin area and 766 persons, of whom 39 per cent, or 299, were teenagers, in the rest of the country.  It must be emphasised that this is the number of people who received treatment, so the total number of people misusing drugs would be considerably in excess of this figure.  The main drugs of misuse in all health boards are ecstasy and cannabis, while the abuse of heroin is mainly confined to the Dublin area.  In order to address the problem of lack of information on the prevalence of drug misuse Government decisions in February 1996 recommended that &ldquo;there should be greater emphasis on providing basic information on the extent and type of drug misuse&rdquo;. As a result of these decisions, health boards are establishing databases in order to provide more reliable and comparable information in the future.</P>
      <P>The drugs issue has been a high priority for the Government, especially in the recent past.  On 20 February 1996 the Government approved proposals on new demand reduction measures to prevent drug misuse.  The objectives of the proposals were based on two key elements: reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes; and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which must be a return to a drug free lifestyle, although this may not be a realistic goal in every instance, in the short term at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards and my Department's Health Promotion Unit worked on the implementation of the decisions.  In addition, a Ministerial Task Force was set up to examine the measures required to reduce the demand for drugs.  It published its first report in October 1996 and the recommendations of the report in relation to service provision are: health boards to move to eliminate <Col N="1565" /> drug treatment waiting lists, with the Eastern Health Board waiting list to be eliminated in 1997; particular attention to the needs of young misusers in the priority areas, priority status for Community Employment (CE) applications offering integrated services for recovering addicts; a series of education and prevention steps, including enhanced measures to reduce truancy and anti-drug programme for all primary schools in priority areas; an estate improvement programme for severely run-down urban housing estates; and local authorities to develop sports and recreation activities in the priority areas, within the national sports strategy framework.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of £14 million was approved and arrangements to implement these recommendations are being put in place as a matter of urgency.  All health boards have developed comprehensive service plans for 1997 in response to the Government decisions and significant progress has been made, particularly in the Eastern Health Board to ensure that adequate prevention and treatment services are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report of the study group on the development of the mental health services &mdash; Planning for the Future &mdash; was published in 1984 and has been accepted as mental health policy by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>The report recommended the restructuring of mental health services through the development of services located in the community as an alternative to institutional based care.  Acute psychiatric units at general hospitals, day hospitals, day centres and community residential accommodation are now being provided by health boards to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made across all health boards in implementing the recommendations of the report.  Sixteen acute psychiatric units attached to, or associated with, general hospitals have been developed and more are planned.  The number of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals has continued to decline with a corresponding increase in the provision of community facilities.  In December 1984 there were 11,613 patients in psyschiatric hospitals and units compared to 5,327 on 31 December 1995, the most recent year for which published figures are available.In the same period the number of day hospitals-day centres increased from 32 to 159 while the number of places in community residential accommodation increased from 900 to 2,666.</P>
      <P>There are mechanisms in place to ensure that the quality of the mental health services, both hospital and community-based, is maintained. The inspector of mental hospitals carries out an annual inspection of all mental health facilities including community-based residences and facilities in the country.  While the inspector has identified areas of the services requiring improvement, he is generally satisfied with the standard of accommodation and care being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread consensus that the implementation of the policy outlined in Planning for the Future provides a more comprehensive service for patients and a much improved quality of <Col N="1567" /> life for people who had previously been in-patients in psychiatric hospitals.  I do not believe therefore that a review of policy on the provision of mental health services is necessary.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The latest information available to my Department from Temple Street relates to the numbers of patients who are waiting in excess of six months for an inpatient appointment as of December 1996.  On the basis of that information, there are a total of 530 patients waiting for all procedures at Temple Street.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that my Department has made substantial development funding available to the hospital in 1997 in respect of developments in radiology, ENT, plastic surgery, general surgery, anaesthetics and nephrology.</P>
      <P>In addition, during 1996 a sum of £44,000 was made available to the hospital under the waiting list initiative.  This additional funding enabled the hospital to carry out an additional 85 procedures in ENT, plastic surgery, paediatric surgery and urology.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this investment by my Department in the hospital will impact positively on the waiting times for inpatient procedures. Furthermore, the Deputy may be aware that a sum of £8 million is being made available in 1997 in respect of the waiting list initiative.  As in previous years, it will be targeted at those specialities with particular difficulties with regard to waiting lists.  It will be open to the hospital to bid for funding under the initiative in respect of problem specialities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> There has been a general increase in death rates from cancer in Ireland over the past 25 years.  After taking account of age factors, the death rate per 100,000 from cancer in Ireland has risen from 201.62 in 1970 to 221.71 in 1992, the latest year for which full data of this kind is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a higher mortality rate from cancer than the average for EU countries.  However, the <Col N="1568" /> rate of premature mortality, deaths among those aged under 65, from the disease has been falling towards the EU average in recent years.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Registry now collects data on the incidence, i.e., the number of new cases per year, of cancer in respect of 1994 onwards.  The Registry's first report is expected to be published in the near future.  However, incidence data for a single year should be interpreted with caution.  A better indication of the incidence of cancer will be available when a number of years data becomes available.</P>
    <P>The causes of cancer often involve a combination of factors including genetics, environmental factors and lifestyle behaviours.  It is estimated that tobacco, alcohol and diet, the three major lifestyle risk factors, contribute to two-thirds of all cancers in Europe.  Other factors such as exposure to cancer-causing substances, ultraviolet rays and radiation also carry a risk of cancer.</P>
    <P>In November 1996 I launched the National Cancer Strategy.  This strategy is aimed at reorganising cancer services to ensure that they meet the needs of patients in the best possible way.  The strategy's main objectives are to take all measures possible to reduce the rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment, and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to the National Cancer Strategy, I was pleased to be able to announce further progress in the plans for a targeted national programme of breast screening for women aged 50 to 64, and a national programme of cervical screening for women aged between 25 and 60 years.</P>
    <P>I announced a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the National Cancer Strategy in March 1997.  An extra £6 million for the development of cancer services in 1997 was allocated, and details were given of how services will be improved in each health board area.  The major elements of the Action Plan are:</P>
    <P>plans costing an extra £6 million this year for the development of cancer services in each region.  The plans include additional consultant appointments for treatment services, development of palliative care and funding for cancer research; a fundamental reorganisation of cancer treatment services including the appointment of regional directors in each health board area to co-ordinate services and develop a detailed cancer plan for their region; the appointment of a national cancer forum as promised in the National Cancer Strategy; the establishment of expert bodies to guide the implementation of national programmes of screening for breast and cervical cancer; and introduction of legislation to ensure that the breast and cervical screening programmes comply with data protection requirements.  This important legislation was passed at the end of March 1997.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will appreciate that the industrial relations process involves trade unions from time to time pursuing issues under threat of industrial action.  Such issues may be national claims, local claims or even individual grievances and the nature of industrial action may vary up to and including strike action.</P>
      <P>Over the past six months a number of groups have balloted for strike action.  These included nurses, ambulance personnel and certain paramedical grades.  I understand that laboratory technicians, radiographers and certain catering staff have also balloted for strike action.  I would appeal to all groups to use the industrial relations machinery available to them.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the Health Service Employers' Agency is continuing discussions with unions representing health personnel and it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware, the waiting <Col N="1570" /> lists for health board long-stay homes for the elderly vary from health board to health board depending on the stock of beds available.  Some-boards have short waiting lists but the Eastern Health Board has long lists as its supply of public places is relatively small.  The board inform me that there are currently 75 elderly people in acute hospitals who are awaiting care in a long-stay facility for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years the board has been endeavouring to increase the number of public long-stay beds for the elderly.  Fifty additional places have been provided in Peamount and 17 in Leopardstown Park Hospital.  New community nursing units and day facilities have been opened in Cuan Ros, Navan Road and on the site of the old Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.  In addition, between January 1995 and January 1997 the Eastern Health Board has contracted 90 beds in private nursing homes.</P>
      <P>The board has also initiated the development of community ward teams in each of its community care areas to provide outreach care services for the elderly in their own homes.  To date, a total of 23 such teams have been established. These teams are an invaluable source of care and support for the elderly in the community and their carers.  The board has also established support groups for carers to ensure that they receive adequate support to help them cope with the stress of caring for elderly family members.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is committed to the continued development of a range of services, both community and hospital-home based, to ensure that the elderly receive the level of care most appropriate to their medical needs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the speech and language therapy service has improved in recent years.  Health boards have viewed its development as a priority and additional speech therapy services have been provided in recent years with funding provided for the development of services for people with a physical disability or mental handicap.  Notwithstanding these improvements, it is clear that further development of the speech and language therapy service in general is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speech therapists were involved in the recent paramedics pay dispute which was referred to the Labour Court for hearing on 28 April 1997.  In addition to recommendations on pay, the court recommended the establishment of an expert group to examine and report on the changes that have taken place in the relevant professions, including speech therapy services, and to address such issues as recruitment and retention and <Col N="1571" /> development plans for delivery of services. Members of IMPACT are currently being balloted on the court's recommendation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will be aware that significant funding has been made available to reduce the numbers waiting and the length of time for admission to public hospitals under the current waiting list initiative which commenced in 1993.  Since this initiative commenced the total funding committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists is £50 million and a further £8 million will be allocated to agencies during 1997 to continue with this process.</P>
      <P>When the waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993, there were a total of 40,130 people on waiting lists for hospital treatment.  By end of June 1996 this figure had been reduced by 9,683 or 24 per cent over a period of three years. Additional funding was provided in 1996 for this area to ensure that waiting lists do not continue to rise for the remainder of 1996.  Waiting list figures for the end of 1996, the latest date for which figures are available, show that the total number of persons waiting for treatment has fallen to 25,959.  This represents a fall of over 17 per cent from a total of 31,519 at the end of last September.This represents significant progress in the reduction of waiting lists and demonstrates the Government's concern that the necessary resources are provided to improve waiting times for treatment.</P>

In <Col N="1576" /> 1996, and again in 1997, the amount available was increased to £900,000 and the scope of the scheme was extended to include voluntary organisations providing counselling to children whose parents have separated.  Prior to 1994 there was no money at my Department's disposal that could be used to fund such a scheme and, therefore, the provision of figures of comparative costs for previous years does not arise.</P>

Work is continuing in my Department on the examination of the application for benefit under this scheme in order to determine the full amount of the grant payable to each eligible organisation in 1997.  I expect that this work will be completed in time to allow payment of the second and final instalment to be made by my Department before the end of July 1997.</P>

      <P>Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) will be designated in accordance with the terms of the EU habitats directive.  This directive requires member states to protect, in an effective manner, the areas listed for protection as SACs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practical terms, this means that planning authorities will be required to make an appropriate assessment of the effects that proposed developments will have on the ecology of SACs. Where such developments will have a negative ecological impact, the position is that for SACs hosting habitats defined in the habitats directive as priorities, a development may only proceed where this is necessary for reasons of human health or public safety, or, further to an opinion from the European Commission, to other imperative reasons of overriding public interest.  (SACs proposed to date are those hosting such priority habitats).  For sites without such priority habitats, developments which will have a negative effect may proceed where there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social and economic nature, and where appropriate <Col N="1579" /> compensatory measures are taken to ensure that the overall integrity of the Europe-wide network of protected sites is maintained.</P>
    <P>Where my Department's National Park and Wildlife Service is asked for an assessment of the ecological implications of proposed developments, every effort will be made to take a balanced, reasonable position, and negative assessments will be given only where what is proposed would have significant negative effects on the environment.</P>

      <P>The floating jetty at Spenser Harbour in Lough Allen was primarily intended as a refuge for vessels using the navigation in inclement weather and, accordingly, it was not envisaged that it would be linked to the shore in the short term.  Nevertheless, the linking of this refuge to the land would be beneficial and such a development, including ancillary facilities, is currently at the planning stage.  Subject to the acquisition of necessary lands, it is hoped to start the project later this year and to complete it late 1998 or early 1999.</P>

      <P>Development works are being carried out at the National Botanic Gardens in accordance with the objectives outlined in the 1992 management plan for the gardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of works, completed in early 1996, involved the faithful restoration of the curvilinear range of glasshouses, the restoration of the director's house and works to the orchid, fern and aquatic glasshouses at a total cost of <Col N="1581" /> some £5.4 million.  The provision of a new library-herbarium, including fit out, at an estimated cost of £2.5 million is near completion.  Other works recently carried out, or in progress, include the provision of new compost storage bays, the upgrading of security fencing, renewal of footpaths, and the refurbishment of the curator's residence at a total cost sf £194,000.</P>
    <P>The next phase of works planned is the provision of visitor and educational facilities, which also necessitates rearrangement of glasshouses. As some of this work has just been tendered for it would not be appropriate to give estimated costs at this stage.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated to Deputies, on a number of occasions, the Government decision on the funding of initatives in the White Paper, &ldquo;Charting Our Education Future&rdquo;, is as set out in my foreword to the White Paper.  In essence this is that the amount of funding which can be made available in any given year will have to be decided by the Government in the context of its financial position and its other public expenditure priorities at that time.</P>
      <P>In making observations on the resource aspects of the White Paper, the Department of Finance did not produce detailed, comprehensive multi-annual cost projections, which would take account of all the variables on which future costs depend.  To attempt to do so would have been a very difficult if not impossible task and indeed would be of questionable value.  Government approval of the White Paper was contingent upon adherence to the Maastricht Treaty criteria, in accordance with the Government's fiscal policy objectives.

      <P>The school referred to in the question was identified as one of those which should have access to the new psychological service for primary schools. Accordingly, a Department of Education psychologist has been assigned to the school since the beginning of the school year 1995-96.  Pupils, parents and teachers have access to this service through the school principal.</P>
      <P>The school is visited by the psychologist concerned who carries out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow.  In addition, he engages in a certain amount of casework with those pupils and parents who would benefit from counselling in the school situation. The psychologist also provides advice to the school staff in relation to pupils who may have behavioural and learning difficulties, including difficulties with reading and maths.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the needs for remedial intervention which have been identified by assessments, my Department has also allocated two remedial teachers to the school.</P>
      <P>Where learning or behavioural difficulties are perceived to be more serious, pupils may be referred to the appropriate specialist agencies of the health authorities.  Parents also have access to these agencies through the school medical service or the family doctor.</P>

      <P>Following an approach from the Department of Health to my Department as to the feasibility of transfering responsibility for the delivery of training for radiographers to my Department, a tripartite working group was established.  This working group comprises officials of my Department and the Department of Health and is chaired by the Higher Education Authority.  The working group had its first meeting on 28 February 1997 and has subsequently visited the two schools of radiography and met with representatives of Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin, the two universities involved.  In the course of its work, the working group requested certain information from the schools and universities and it is expected that all of this information will be provided this week.  I understand the working group <Col N="1591" /> will meet this week and expects to complete its work by the end of the month.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the examinations is that the staff in the UCD School of Diagnostic Imaging wrote to the university in February 1997, stating that as there was no progress on the question of the transfer of responsibility for the school to the Department of Education, they would not be taking their positions as assistant examiners for the summer examinations.  The Higher Education Authority has advised both University College Dublin and the School of Diagnostic Imaging of the work schedule for the working group and it is hoped that this will facilitate the staff of the school to participate in the examinations, which are due to commence next week.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Dáil Question No. 215 on Tuesday, 15 April 1997, County Donegal Vocational Education Committee advised my Department that it supports the retention of a second-level educational facility in Bundoran and that the rationalisation of schools should be confined to those in Ballyshannon only.</P>
      <P>This proposal has implications for the level of accommodation to be provided in the new community school building for Ballyshannon, the planning of which had been based on an earlier agreement that the Bundoran facility would be discontinued under the rationalisation plan.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, my Department undertook a review of the future educational development of the centre.  This review is nearing completion and I expect to be in a position to take a decision in the matter shortly.  Architectural planning of the project will proceed on the basis of the decision taken.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the situation regarding a person (details supplied) in County Louth who attends St. Oliver's national school, Carlingford, who has been recently assessed dyslexic and who requires special reading and spelling skills; the proposals, if any, she has to assign a specialist remedial teacher to the school to assist in this regard, particularly in view of the precedent set in the nearby Ardaghy school which has received a special teacher to cater for the needs of one child; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.  I understand that the child in question has recently been assessed and that my Department is awaiting a report from the child's school on the precise nature of the special needs involved.  Once this report is received, my Department will review the educational arrangements for the child in question.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering the possibility of making additional remedial and resource teacher posts available to primary schools for the forthcoming school year.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be taken into account as part of this process.</P>

      <P>Detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The studies noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>In line with the findings of these studies, I recently launched the breaking the cycle initiative which seeks to target a special package of supports on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as suffering serious levels of educational disadvantage.  The selected schools were identified by the Education Research Centre on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of criteria devised by the centre.</P>
      <P>The operation of this new initiative will be closely monitored by my Department's Inspectorate and the scheme will be evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  The outcome of this evaluation will provide a basis for the future development of supporters for disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In the event of such further development being undertaken, the needs of the school in question will be considered.  However, I have no plans at present to allocate additional concessionary posts to primary schools.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently considering applications from the school in question for the establishment of a special class for traveller children and the allocation of a resource teacher. Decisions on these matters will be made a soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment of Wood school on 30 September 1996 was 22 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal only for the 1997-98 school year.  The first assistant's post at the school will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The suppression of the first assistant's post at the school does not impact on the school's participation in the breaking the cycle initiative.</P>

      <P>It is acknowledged that there are specific language difficulties at the school to which the Deputy refers.  These difficulties stem, in part at least, from the fact that a large number of pupils attending the school were born in non-English speaking countries.  The managerial authorities of the school sought, among other concessions, the provision of a language teacher and a remedial teacher for the school.</P>
      <P>On the question of the allocation of a language teacher, my Department's inspectorate have advised that a teacher with one or more foreign languages would not be of significant additional assistance to the school in view of the many different languages spoken by pupils at the school.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering the possibility of making additional remedial and resource teacher posts available to primary schools for the forthcoming school year.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of this school will be taken into account as part of this process.</P>
      <P>An offer of providing an in-service course on the methodology of teaching English as a second language to teachers working at the school was made to the managerial authorities some time ago.  However, this offer has not been availed of to date.  It is considered that the provision of such a course would be of considerable benefit to the teaching staff and would certainly contribute to resolving some of the difficulties which exist at the school.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently a student in the final year of the diploma in nursing studies course at University College, Galway.  This course forms the revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training which was introduced in October 1994 on a pilot basis.  It is operated by the Western Health Board and University College, Galway at the University Hospital Galway.The three year course leads to a diploma in nursing studies and to registration with An Bord Altranais.  The new programme has been extended to a number of other colleges of nursing in association with local higher education institutions.As these programmes are being funded by the regional health boards, the students' tuition fees are met by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Health, that his Department is currently engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions, including University College, Galway, in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which will be open both <Col N="1604" /> to nurses who successfully complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualify under the traditional model of education and training.  These one year part-time degree programmes will provide members of the nursing profession with an opportunity to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level.</P>
    <P>In the current academic year, Dublin, City University is operating a one year course which enables holders of the three year diploma obtain a degree of bachelor of nursing studies.  Access modules are available for registered nurses who qualified before the introduction of the diploma and who wish to pursue the one year course.  The courses are provided on a part-time basis and are self-financing.  The removal of undergraduate fees does not apply to part-time courses.</P>

      <P>The question of providing physical education facilities at St. Michael's Holy Faith school, Finglas, Dublin 11, which is not one of the schools listed on the capital programme, can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally, because of the huge demand for additional classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country.  I am not in a position at this stage to state when physical education facilities will be provided in this particular case.  However, should financial circumstances permit, the school will be given every consideration.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the position of staff in the college who are on temporary whole-time contracts and the question of making permanent appointments.  A review group, under the auspices of the Higher Education Authority is examining teacher supply and demand in the second-level sector including teachers of home economics.  Pending the outcome of this review it has not been possible to sanction the creation of permanent full-time posts in this case.  I must also emphasise that it is necessary to operate within the overall constraints imposed by Government policy on public service numbers.</P>

      <P>The basis for the decision not to categorise the school in question as disadvantaged on the last occasion when the scheme was expanded has previously been outlined to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools. Detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The studies noted that the disadvantaged area scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>The case made by the school in question has been noted by my Department and will be fully considered in the event of any further expansion of disadvantaged area supports being undertaken.</P>

      <P>Court records are not maintained in such a way as to provide ready access to the names of the premises or the dates for which the special exemptions were granted.

      <P>In the case of a widow's or widower's contributory pension, it is necessary to satisfy the contribution conditions at the relevant time, that is on the date the person's spouse died or reached pension age.

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is the primary mechanism for grant aiding tourism-related projects in this country.  As part of the overall mid-term review of the Community Support Framework and in common with other operational programmes, the mid-term review of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 is under way.</P>
      <P>The review process of the tourism operational programme began last year with the drawing up of detailed terms of reference for a mid-term evaluation, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the European Commission, and the appointment by the national monitoring committee of a mid-term evaluator.  The mid-term evalutor's report was finalised recently and, as part of the next phase in the review process, was considered at a specially convened meeting of the national monitoring committee of the tourism operational programme on 28 February 1997, which was chaired by my Department.  This meeting allowed the various interests represented on the national monitoring committee to discuss the report in detail with the evaluator and to put forward initial views.  These initial views will feed into the overall CSF mid-term review process and will allow the Government and the European Commission to review the general thrust and direction of CSF programmes, to decide on any strategic changes required and to determine any inter programme reallocations which might be required in the first instance, prior to considering changes within individual programmes.  The CSF review is due to be completed later this year.  Any changes arising from this review process which result in amendments to the operational programme for tourism will, of course, be published.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the position of many women who have worked in the home and, therefore, do not have credits, paid contributions or a social welfare payment of any kind, thus ensuring that they are not eligible for FÁS courses or community employment schemes; his views on whether such people are classified as non-persons; if he will intervene to rectify this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>FÁS training programmes are open to all persons who are unemployed and seeking work.  Priority of access is, however, given to persons on the live register, regardless of their gender.</P>
      <P>The community employment programme is targeted at a particular severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, i.e. those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other social welfare means tested payments.  Limited resources, unfortunately, do not make it possible to provide CE for all unemployed people.  It is necessary, therefore, to target the programme at those most in need.  The eligibility criteria for CE is in my view a fair, objective and cost effective way of achieving that target.</P>
      <P>To satisfy the eligibility criteria, persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension or deserted wives benefit can apply to transfer to one parent family payment to become eligible to participate in CE.  In addition, a married unemployed person who meets the eligibility criteria for CE can transfer that eligibility to his-her spouse, who is not on the live register, for that person to qualify for participation on CE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eligibility criteria for CE only came into effect last year following a detailed review of CE <Col N="1614" /> and in response to the recommendations of the task force on long-term unemployment.  They were designed to target the programme at those priority groups already referred to.  I have no plans at present to widen the eligibility criteria. However, I do of course keep all programmes under constant scrutiny in so far as their objectives and effectiveness are concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to female participation generally on FÁS programmes, I would point out that since 1990, FÁS has developed an action programme for women to maximise the participation of women in all of its programmes and as a result there has been a significant growth in the level of participation by women in FÁS programmes.  In 1996, 43 per cent of those who completed a FÁS training programme or a community employment programme were women.  FÁS has also been providing courses such as return to work and enterprise training, which have a high proportion of female participation particularly among home makers.  In 1996, 1,083 women participated in the return to work scheme and 732 women participated in the enterprise training scheme.  In a further response to the need for flexibility in this area, FÁS had advised me that they are currently undertaking a pilot initiative aimed at developing and testing new ways of delivering training for women.  This initiative, which is being piloted under the NOW, new opportunities for women, programme, aims to provide locally-based training in partnership with community groups.  This training is delivered in a flexible manner to suit the needs and circumstances of participants.</P>
    <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for child care facilities for women returning to work, and contributes over £5 million per annum to community based child care provision by way of support for community employment projects.  Over 130 community employment projects have such a child care dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community based child care for women undertaking training or education and for participants on community employment.</P>
    <P>The Partnership 2000 agreement provides for the establishment of a working party, representative of Departments and the social partners, to examine the question of equal access by women to labour market opportunities including training, education and employment programmes.  It is expected that this working group will be established in the near future.</P>

      <P>The position is that some £690 million has been paid out to farmers under the 1995 headage and premia schemes.  All currently eligible applicants have been paid their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to the 1996 headage and premia and BSE compensation schemes is <Col N="1617" /> that to date over £691 million has been paid to farmers.  Payment of 20 per cent balances under the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme and the EU suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 19 February and 20 February 1997 respectively.  To date some 93 per cent of applicants have been paid their balances under the May 1996 suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 special beef premium scheme.  Full payments under the October 1996 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 1 May and £4.334 million has been paid to date.</P>
    <P>The estimated value of each scheme, the estimated <Col N="1618" /> amounts remaining to be paid, the number of applicants, the percentage of applicants which are fully paid and the amount paid under each of the 1996 headage and premia schemes are shown on the following table.  It should be noted that not all applicants will ultimately qualify for payment.</P>
    <P>It is expected that payment of the 1996 extensification premium will commence within the next two weeks and be completed by the end of June in line with the Charter of Rights for Farmers and EU requirements.

      <P>The Charter of Rights for Farmers launched by the Taoiseach in April 1995 envisaged a programme of substantially improved services to farmers.  I am satisfied that significant improvements in the quality of services, including accommodation and telephone facilities, have been achieved in the two years the charter has been in operation.  As regards the payment targets set for the various schemes in the charter, I am happy to say that these targets have been largely met.</P>
      <P>When the charter was published in 1995 it was never intended that it would be a static document.In recognition of this, the Government in Partnership 2000, undertook to enter into discussion with the farm organisations on measures to improve targets, and other issues, in the charter, over the life of the partnership agreement. The first meeting of the review group, the forum established under the charter for review and feedback on the delivery of the charter by the Department, took place in October 1996, and meetings have subsequently been held on a quarterly basis. The representative associations on this group have been invited to submit any suggestions they might have for improving the quality of services, including the timely delivery of payments to farmers.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he has taken or proposes to take to improve the competitiveness of each of the major sectors of Irish agriculture, namely, livestock, dairy, cereals, sugarbeet, pig meat, poultry meat, horticulture and potatoes, in the context of the increased competition faced by each sector, the prospects of further CAP reform, the enlargement of the EU and the next round of World Trade negotiations which are due to being in 1999.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the challenges posed to the whole Irish agri-food sector by the developments mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Addressing these challenges will require a continuing emphasis on competitiveness.  Improvements in competitiveness will be achieved through continued structural improvement, appropriate levels of investment, research and training, and, vitally, through increased efficiency of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry <Col N="1619" /> (OPARDF) over £1 billion has been provided for the 1994-99 period to tackle various structural issues in the agriculture area, with increased competitiveness as the priority objective.  The OPARDF encourages investment in pollution control facilities and diversification of farm enterprises.  Incentives for investment are also provided under the taxation system.</P>
    <P>The installation aid scheme under the OPARDF, the CAP reform early retirement scheme and incentives under the taxation system contribute to improving farm structures and the age profile of Irish farmers by encouraging land transfer to younger farmers.</P>
    <P>Under the OPARDF, Teagasc's research, advisory and training services are being redirected to address the major challenges facing Irish agriculture.  Principal among these is the whole issue of competitiveness.  In addition, Teagasc's 1996 Agri-Food Economics Conference was devoted to the competitiveness of agriculture and food industries.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, the competitiveness of primary agricultural production will depend on the ability of farmers to reduce production costs and maintain or raise product quality.  By harnessing new technologies and improving management practices, farming will become more efficient and in turn will be capable of surviving in an increasingly competitive environment.</P>
    <P>The current development plan for the food industry aims to exploit the growth potential of firms by supporting increased competitiveness and innovation.  The various measures in the food sub-programme which cover capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion and human resources contribute to this aim by developing added value goods, increasing exports and promoting the achievement of quality standards.</P>

      <P>The control and enforcement of food safety is central to maintaining consumer confidence.  Ireland has an extensive framework of legislation in place and my Department alone implements some 62 separate pieces of legislation dealing with food safety and quality.  Over 1,750 administrative, professional and technical staff have control functions under legislation which encompass meat inspections, veterinary medicines, zoonotic diseases, beef classification, pesticide control and the application of quality standards in the dairy produce, poultry and eggs, fruit and vegetables and animal feed areas.  In addition <Col N="1620" /> over 200 professional and technical staff are engaged in related activities at the Department's various laboratories.</P>
      <P>In future the Food Safety Authority of Ireland will have responsibility for auditing these inspection arrangments and this will provide a further level of assurance to the consumer.</P>

      <P>The fall in lamb prices which took place in mid April is a normal seasonal market development which occurs every year when supplies of spring lambs become plentiful.  This reduction in price took place against a background of highly satisfactory lamb prices for over a year.  I am pleased to note that in the last week the price has levelled out at 122 pence per lb. There have been indications of consumer resistance on the French market to the high price of imported lamb.  The present price level should help to encourage consumption.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry attached to the Structural Funds, higher grant rates are available to small farmers participating in capital investment schemes, including provision to cater for increased costs incurred by islanders.  Under the farms diversification measures, higher rates are paid in the west for housing-handling facilities for alternative enterprises and special provisions are made for islanders participating in the agri-tourism scheme, i.e., rates of grant of 60 per cent for the provision of leisure facilities with investment ceilings for aid purposes substantially higher than elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), recent initiatives introduced will be of considerable benefit to island farmers. These include: a concession introduced in the 1996 budget, whereby the first £2,000 of REPS <Col N="1621" /> payment is disregarded for unemployment assistance means testing purposes and costs incurred in complying with REPS measures may also be offset against income for special welfare purposes; the inclusion of grazing rights as eligible area under REPS and the employment by Teagasc of a planner, nominated by Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, to assist in REPS planning work on the islands.</P>
    <P>The Leader II programme is not intended specifically for farmers although they may qualify for funding for eligible projects.  My Department is considering changes in the operating rules of the programme for the islands in the context of the mid-term review of Structural Funds.  Any changes, which require the approval of the European Commission, will be announced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The GATT Agreement of 1994 imposed a limit on the volume of subsidised exports of beef which the EU may export to third countries.  This limit is due to fall from 1.137 million tonnes in 1995 to 821,700 tonnes in 2000.  The EU Commission monitors this ceiling through the level of export licences issued in order to ensure an orderly allocation of licences throughout the year.  When the Commissioner considers there is a risk that this ceiling is likely to be breached, they have resorted to suspension-rejection of licences and cuts in the rate of refund in an attempt to reduce demand for licences.</P>
      <P>I have continously and consistently opposed this approach to the management of the licensing system and I have suggested more effective ways of managing the licensing system within the ceilings.These suggestions included (a) a reduction in the period of validity of licences; (b) the introduction of optional non-transferable licences; and (c) the application of a reduction co-efficient to applications for licences.  The Commission has taken on board my suggestion at (a) and has reduced the validity period of the licences from two months plus month of issue to 30 days from the date of issue.  I will continue to press for a better management of the GATT ceiling.  I have also suggested that in order to eliminate the speculation element from the licensing issue that the licences should be made non-transferable.</P>

      <P>The actual losses in any sector resulting directly from revaluations of the Irish <Col N="1623" /> green pound are difficult to establish precisely. The annual losses in the beef sector, as estimated by the European Commission, arising from the revaluations which occurred on 8 November, 1996, 11 January, 1997 and 29 March, 1997 amount to about £65 million.  Compensation in respect of 50 per cent of these losses will be provided by the EU in 1997.  Compensation for other livestock sectors has not been proposed by the Commission as they estimate the losses involved not to be significant because of the system of EU market supports applying to them.</P>
      <P>National funding of £17 million has been provided by the Government for the beef sector because of the particular difficulties in that sector and represents over 50 per cent of the maximum contribution which could be provided nationally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 231 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the income difficulties being experienced by beef producers because of the recent fall in cattle prices.  The main cause of the current difficulties is the series of cuts in export refunds by the EU Commission in an attempt to stay within the limits on EU subsidised exports which were agreed in the context of the last GATT.  The substantial fall in EU beef consumption arising from the BSE crisis has increased the surplus of beef on the market and made it more difficult to stay within these limits.  The effect of the reductions in export refunds on Irish producers has been exacerbated by the revaluation of the Irish Green Pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently announced a range of measures to assist producers, including those producers who sold finished heifers through livestock marts. These measures include (i) the £20 million EU funded aid package to compensate for the revaluations on 11 November 1996 and 10 January 1997; (ii) a further EU funded £11 million compensation package for the revaluation of 29 March and (iii) a nationally funded compensation package amounting to £17 million to top-up the EU compensation.  Subject to clearance with the European Commission, I intend to use the national funds to pay a top-up of £50 per head on all male cattle and heifers slaughtered in meat <Col N="1624" /> export plants and local abattoirs and on heifers sold through marts during the period 1 April-10 June 1997.  Applications will be required to provide proof of ownership of the animals on 1 April 1997.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of suggestions to the Commission for the strengthening of the EU beef support system in order to provide more effective support for the market and my Department will continue to pursue these through the Beef Management Committee.</P>
    <P>The adjustment to the deseasonalisation slaughter premium which I secured last year to ensure the continuation of this premium into 1997 and future years is of major assistance to our winter finishers.  This premium, which will be worth some £20 million to Irish beef producers this year or 7p per lb, should, along with all of the other measures I have mentioned, help to alleviate the difficulties of beef producers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>A formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of the negotiations in 1994 on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry (OPARDF).  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to this measure represented too high a percentage, 62 per cent, of the overall allocation to the Structural Improvement and Rural Development element of the Operational Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with a number of broad recommendations and following consideration of the report, I put a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes: (i) implement a ceiling of £3,000 on payments to individual farmers; (ii) reduce the higher rate of grants for Friesian cows and in-calf heifers; (iii) disallow headage payments to farmers over 66 in receipt of a non-means tested retirement pension; and (iv) pay headage to farmers in areas designated as degraded under the Rural Environment Protection <Col N="1625" /> Scheme (REPS) only if they were participating in REPS.</P>
    <P>As part of Partnership 2000, it was provided that proposals (ii), (iii) and (iv) would come into effect from 1 January 1998 and that proposal (i) would also come into effect on that date unless agreement was reached between the Government and the farm organisations early in 1997 on a workable alternative which did not involve exceeding the total OPARDF allocation for compensatory allowances.  I have not yet received any submissions in that regard.</P>
    <P>In accordance with recommendations of the consultants, the aim is to adjust the payment structure in favour of smaller farmers but, as also agreed in Partnership 2000, the Government is committed to maintaining the overall current level of resources allocated to the scheme under the OPARDF.</P>
    <P>Formal negotiations with the Commission services have now commenced on the proposals listed above.</P>

      <P>Consideration of the future of the EU dairy regime beyond the year 2000 is due to begin later this year.  As part of this process, the Commission will present to the Agriculture Council its analysis of the market situation and of the international environment likely to prevail at the time, as well as the policy options for milk in the coming decade.  Among the issues to be addressed in this context will be the level and nature of support for the sector.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy that direct income support will be sought by way of compensation for reduced support.  My overall priority will be to ensure that whatever policy is adopted is one in which the Irish dairy sector can continue to develop and increase its contribution to rural Ireland and to the wider national economy.</P>

      <P>Under EU Regulations effective up to 1996, farmers holding suckler cow quotas were required to use at least 50 per cent of the quota in any one of two consecutive years, otherwise the quota not used in the second year would be forfeited and returned to the National Reserve.</P>
      <P>The person named did not use any of his quota in 1994 or in 1995.  He failed to reply to a request from the Department in June 1996 for the reasons for the non-usage of his quota.</P>

      <P>The level of the ewe premium in any years is determined by the average prices paid in the EU market for that year.  EU and Irish market prices for lamb have been at record levels so far this year, largely because of buoyant consumer demand.  Since the premium is designed to compensate producers for low prices, it is inevitable that the premium will be lower than market prices are good.  However, overall returns to producers from the market and the premium this year should not fall below 1996 levels.</P>
      <P>Sheep farmers in disadvantaged areas will continue to qualify for payment of the rural world premium if at least 50 per cent of their holding is located in a disadvantaged area and if that area is used for sheep production.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 256 together.</P>
      <P>On 1 May last I announced that I had asked the CIÉ project team to start consultation on the Ballymun line without delay.  I have requested the project team to first consult on possible alternative alignment options which take into account the wider needs of the north Dublin area and to consider an extension to Dublin Airport.  In doing so I have made it clear that no preferred alignment has been determined at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Commissioner for Regional Policy, <Col N="1637" /> Monika Wulf-Mathies, has already expressed a willingness to co-finance the planning and design work on the Ballymun line and the Government has approved Exchequer funding to meet the non-EU financed balance of this work, the total cost of which is estimated at £10 million.  The funding arrangements for the construction phase will be decided in due course when a preferred alignment has been identified and costed.</P>

      <P>The person named applied to my Department in January 1997 for a road passenger licence to provide a weekend bus service between Achill, County Mayo and Letterkenny, County Donegal. Such licences are issued in accordance with the terms of the Road Transport Act, 1932.  In considering whether to grant an application for a passenger licence under that Act, my Department is required to have regard to the extent of authorised passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.  The scope for granting passenger licences, is, therefore, limited.</P>
      <P>With regard to the application referred to by the Deputy, my Department was not in a position to give its approval as there was a significant degree of overlap between the proposed service and authorised services already provided by other operators on various sections of the route in question.</P>
      <P>The applicant's case was reviewed recently in the light of the Deputy's renewed representations. However, I regret that no new factors have emerged to merit a change in the original decision.</P>
