      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Eoin Ryan.  I call on the Deputy to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil on a specific and urgent matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely the scientific reports from the British inspector of pollution regarding the actual threat posed by the underground waste dump at Sellafield.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 7a &mdash; motion re Instruction to Select Committee on the Central Bank Bill, 1996; No. 18 &mdash; Employment Equality Bill, 1996, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 17 &mdash; Decommissioning Bill, 1996, Second Stage (Resumed).</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; (2) the proceedings on No. 7a, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes, shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and Progressive Democrats Party and shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; and (3) Private Member's Business shall be No. 45 &mdash; motion No. 17 re. CIE and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>There are three matters to put before the House.  Is the proposal for a late sitting satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the <Col N="642" /> proposal for dealing with No. 7a satisfactory?

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated on yesterday's Order of Business that he would move with some speed on some new developments on the Lowry/Dunnes Stores inquiry.  Has the Tánaiste any news on that?  I understand there was a Government meeting last night to discuss this matter.  Has the Government cleared whatever action it will take on the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is meeting this evening at 6.30 p.m. to consider the report that was handed over yesterday.  It is our intention to move as quickly as possible.  I do not wish to preempt a Government decision but the Taoiseach intimated yesterday that we would be looking at the setting up of a tribunal.  It is very important that we take steps as quickly and expeditiously as possible to clear the air in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for his reply.  It is wholly unsatisfactory that what led to the investigation in the first place seems to be lost and nobody knows who received the millions of pounds which are supposed to be floating around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some newspaper articles this morning cast a slur on all politicians and I reject one allegation in at least two newspapers that the reason the report was circulated so quickly yesterday was that no other politicians were mentioned. I am sure Deputy Bell's committee feels strongly about this and I certainly do as a Member of this House.  I do not care which politicians are mentioned and I want to see this matter dealt with.  This day should not pass without the Government stating clearly what action it intends taking and it should be taken next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some discussion on this matter yesterday.  I do not want to see a repeat of that discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I have to refute that.  The decision taken yesterday was taken by unanimous agreement, even in consultation with a Member who was in New York, and seconded by a member of the Deputy's party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am agreeing with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ahern. From day one there has been a cloud of suspicion over all politicians and political parties.  It is important that as quickly as possible we explore this matter within the confines of the rule of law which we have to observe.  The Government will meet this afternoon.  It is the earliest opportunity since yesterday because the Taoiseach has <Col N="643" /> engagements this morning.  We will make decisions as it is in everybody's interest.  When we discussed this matter in the House last December, there were headlines of £5 million and £6 million. Let the people who wrote those headlines come before the tribunal and justify what they were saying.  The sooner we do that, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government decides today to proceed with the establishment of a tribunal we will be happy to co-operate with moving that motion tomorrow because it is important that we should act quickly in this matter.  Given that the Buchanan inquiry could not trace 63 per cent of the payments it would not be fair to expect the media, who do not even have as much access as Judge Buchanan had to information, to trace them.  In the interest of everybody in public life, not just politicians, the sooner the tribunal is established, the sooner the controversy will end. The public will only accept a fair and impartial tribunal of inquiry, not one conducted by five politicians.  I urge the Government to agree to establish the tribunal and, if it does so, to bring the motion before this House tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste think new measures are necessary to strengthen international police co-operation arising out of individual cases, particularly in light of developments in the Sophie Toscan du Plantier and Veronica Guerin murder investigations?  It seems international police co-operation does not have the legislative basis to deal with these matters effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance it is a matter for other Governments to devise their own legislative procedures.  Deputy Ahern is aware the level of co-operation between police forces within the EU is higher than ever before and on the basis of Europol being established the level will be still higher.  We must do everything at international level to co-operate against all crime and the tragic murder of Madame du Plantier is an example of where co-operation is necessary.  All the information we have is that there is the highest level of co-operation between the police forces involved.</P>

Will the Tánaiste recommend <Col N="646" /> to the Government that the Minister for Justice raise the cap imposed by the Charitable Lotteries Act by statutory instrument?  Rehab is currently making only 40 per cent of its potential earnings as projected a year ago and as a result is suffering dramatic losses.

    <Title>Central Bank Bill, 1996: Instruction to Select Committee.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs in the case of the Central Bank Bill, 1996, that it has power to make provision in the Bill for the supervision by the Central Bank of Investment Intermediaries; and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>The Committee Stage of the Central Bank Bill, 1996 is scheduled to be taken by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs tomorrow, Thursday, 6 February.  The Minister for Finance has circulated a number of Committee Stage amendments to the Bill.  The Minister of State responsible for commerce, science and technology announced on 3 January that the Government had accepted his recommendation that responsibility for the regulation of all investment intermediaries should be allocated to the Central Bank.  He indicated he had made this recommendation in the light of the Taylor affair and earlier financial scandals which had shaken public confidence in its ability to invest safely through the system of investment intermediaries operating throughout the country.  He also noted that the Irish Brokers' Association has decided to cease to act as a self-regulatory body in respect of its members and that the Insurance Intermediary Compliance Bureau had earlier decided not to undertake a regulatory role under the Investment Intermediaries Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding to transfer responsibility to the Central Bank, the Minister of State responsible for commerce, science and technology indicated that the Government had regard to a number of factors, including: the need to take strong and decisive action to restore confidence in the investment intermediary system; the experience to date in the implementation of the existing regulatory structure under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995; the fact that the regulatory regime envisaged when the original legislation was drafted was no longer feasible because of the decision by the Irish Brokers' Association to cease to act as a self-regulatory body in respect of its members and the earlier decision of the Insurance Intermediary Compliance Bureau or IICB not to undertake a regulatory role under <Col N="647" /> the Act; recommendations made to the Minister with responsibility for commerce, science and technology by the authorised officer carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Taylor affair; the need to maximise operating efficiency and ensure consistency in the approach to legislation; and, most importantly, the expertise and resources available to the Central Bank for the regulation of financial concerns generally and investment business firms specifically.</P>
    <P>To give effect to the Government decision as soon as possible, the amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act needed to transfer responsibility for the regulation of investment intermediaries from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the Central Bank are being put forward as Committee Stage amendments to the Central Bank Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Central Bank is responsible, under the Intermediaries Act, for the regulation of investment intermediaries who have discretionary control over client funds.  The proposed amendments to the Act will make the bank the sole regulator of investment intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The long title to the Central Bank Bill, 1996, does not contain any reference to amending the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  This motion will, with the approval of the House, remove any doubt as to whether the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs has power to discuss the proposed amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her speech, a copy of which I have just now received.  We will be opposing this and calling a vote in the Dáil.  I will outline the reasons.</P>
      <P>We are quite well aware of the Taylor collapse. It was I who asked at the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy &mdash; and the chairman, Deputy Michael Bell, agreed &mdash; for the setting up of a process to review what went wrong and the role for the future.  We had several meetings on the matter during the course of which Mr. Maurice O'Connell, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Garda Fraud Squad, the Irish Brokers Association and other interested parties gave evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of questioning at the committee the Governor of the Central Bank made it clear that the ring-fencing of investment intermediaries would not be feasible, and that was duly reported in all the newspapers.  Following that, the Industry Working Party on Intermediaries, which was set up by the Government in 1994 to advise on the ill-fated Act of 1995, made a submission which will be heard orally at 2 p.m. in full public session.  It is reporting that what the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is proposing will not be operable and will be to the detriment of consumers, in respect of whom the Minister of <Col N="648" /> State is properly exercised in terms of other duties that he carries out.</P>
    <P>My party, on my advice, is opposing this simply because the 1995 Act was flawed; the IBA was faulty in putting itself forward as being able to supervise it &mdash; its chief director, Mr. Paul Carty, spoke about it at the committee; and the carrying out of the investigation into it was initially flawed and faulty.  A Government-appointed group has now come out very strongly in favour of the proposition that what is being proposed cannot happen. In their submission which will be debated orally today, they say the Central Bank must have an overall remit and be the lead regulator for all savings investment intermediaries with additional devolved powers to an insurance regulator for intermediaries insurance activities.  The Governor of the Central Bank and the Government's own Industry Working Party on Intermediaries say that what is proposed in these amendments i.e. giving the Central Bank responsibility for the regulation of investment intermediaries cannot happen.  It can, of course, happen if the Government guillotines it as no doubt it will on Thursday morning.  However, everybody who has been engaged by the Government, including our own committee, is agreed that this should not happen, that it is not operable and will lead to further fraudulent acts by other bodies.</P>
    <P>I do not particularly find fault with the Minister of State, who was sent here to do a job.  Clearly the background to it, overlapping into the Department of Enterprise and Employment in the person of the Minister of State with responsibility for science, commerce and technology, is incorrect.  We are going from one flawed regulatory regime to what has been openly spoken of as another flawed regulatory regime.  It is not that the Central Bank is flawed but, in the words of its own Governor, it would be well nigh impossible to ring-fence financial intermediary operations because they overlap intrinsically with the operations of the sellers of insurance products.</P>
    <P>They are all concerned with consumers, with people's money.  We had full debates with the Garda Fraud Squad and they are looking into whether this was &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;.  However, that is for a separate investigation.  What we are concerned about today is the giving of power to the Central Bank to regulate financial intermediaries only which, in the words of the Governor, will be inoperable.  I will oppose this at every stage. Rather than giving much needed protection to consumers this will ensure that consumers will be badly, incorrectly and erroneously regulated.  It is not possible for this to work unless the Central Bank gets full regulatory powers for the intermediaries and for the sellers of insurance products. As stated in the working group submission, the Central Bank should be the lead regulator.</P>
    <P>The working party, whose submission we will be debating this afternoon, proposes that the Insurance Act, 1989, be amended to allow the Department to establish specific criteria for the approval of an industry regulatory body, including <Col N="649" /> the provision of powers of prosecution by the regulatory body and/or the Department.  The timing of proposed legislative independence is obviously important, and the working party says that it can be done by amendment as the Minister of State proposes, but the amendment should be more far-reaching and embrace the financial intermediaries and the insurers who sell financial products.</P>
    <P>I meant to say previously, a Ceann Comhairle, that I am taking the time of the other Opposition party which does not wish to contribute.</P>

      <P>It may end before then because what I have to say is very straightforward. What the Government is proposing flies in the face of every expert opinion on the system of regulation.  The industry working party group on intermediaries has warned that while its members, who are drawn from the intermediaries, have different views on regulation, they are all concerned that the Government's decision will be unworkable in practice.</P>
      <P>This view was echoed by the Governor of the Central Bank who warned when he appeared before the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on 8 January last that what was being proposed by the Government held &ldquo;unique difficulties&rdquo; which should not be understated. The Consumers' Association of Ireland has also voiced its concerns, warning that the Government's proposal to split regulation is unworkable.</P>
      <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, announced the Government's decision to transfer responsibility for the regulation of intermediaries selling investment products to the Central Bank, he said he was acting swiftly and decisively to restore confidence in the investment business. However, he will achieve the direct opposite of what he hoped for if he persists with this course of action, which all expert opinion has decided is half-baked.  The industry working party &mdash; the Government's own group &mdash; has also warned of the pitfalls.</P>
      <P>This proposal is lopsided and faulty and will prove inoperable.  The Minister's proposal to ring-fence investment and leave other parts of the intermediary business less regulated means that those seeking to diddle investors will opt for the business which is subject to the softest form of regulation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, seems to be in the same position as I was in the last Government, in that I was given all sorts of Bills to produce, talk about and steer through the Dáil by means of my professionalism, guile and charm &mdash; I put professionalism first lest I be taken as being sexist.  Therefore, I am not referring these remarks to her but to the misguided public service and Ministers who decided this was the way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> The Taoiseach lays great store on his commitment to the committee system.  Various articles written about him have stated he made his name on that basis.  On my first day in the Dáil in December 1982 we were in Opposition and he was the Minister with responsibility for reform of the Dáil, among other matters.  I remember him speaking glowingly then of the committee system. That was 15 years ago and various committees have been set up since then by various Governments. Some would say there are too many because we meet one another on the plinth and the stairs of Kildare House running to and from the bowels of Kildare House, the Seanad Chamber and the Dáil Chamber in pursuit of the various committees.  Although I am a member of several committees, I have decided that my commitment lies with the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, which is one of the four statutory committees.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach lays great store on the role of the committees which work through measures with a degree of consensus, call votes when it is necessary to do so and bring various measures before the Dáil.  However, in this case the views of one of the four statutory committees have been ignored.  The committee is still in session and we are meeting this afternoon to work through a document which states that the Minister's proposals cannot work.  Tomorrow morning I will be at another committee meeting in substitution for Deputy McCreevy &mdash; no doubt, the Minister of State will be there also &mdash; to debate the findings of another committee which fly in the face of what the Minister of State will recommend.</P>
    <P>How can that be proper committee procedure? I know this will be of interest to you, a Cheann Comhairle, in overseeing the Dáil.  How can the committee system be judged to be for the betterment of legislation, for which it was set up, and to bring about a consensus on important matters and augment the primary work of the Dáil, particularly the statutory committees which have responsibility for legislation?  There are many other estimable committees but, although I would not use the phrase &ldquo;talking shops&rdquo; as some people do, they are in general for putting forward policy viewpoints and aiding debate in many important matters.  They do not have an input into legislation as the Select Committee on Enterprise and Employment does.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Enterprise and Employment will meet this afternoon in pursuit of a duty given to it by consensus of the committee members.  The committee did not vote on whether it should put forward the motion by letter first and then proceed to investigate the best way to monitor and amend legislation to deal with the insurance intermediaries &mdash; all members of the committee, who are from every party, agreed to proceed on that basis.</P>
    <P>That process is to be completed today with the oral submission of the industry working group's presentation.  That will be followed by a question and answer session and then a decision will be <Col N="651" /> taken.  However, that decision will be null and void because the Minister of State is seeking this morning to have this motion passed by the Dáil. Tomorrow, the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs will seek to make the suggested amendments.  The Government suggested that the motion today be taken without debate.  It agreed to a half hour debate when we requested it &mdash; but we had to request it.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand how one section of the Government does not see that it is going against something the Government set up to make recommendations on amending, changing and adapting the regulation of financial intermediaries. It flies in the face of the Taoiseach's oft stated and much vaunted commitment to the committee system.  I take a particularly serious view of this because the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy is a statutory committee which, as part of its remit, has to advise the appropriate Ministers on appropriate legislative changes.  We are devising appropriate changes but they are being steamrollered and ignored by another arm of Government.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make our position very clear.  The Minister of State has been sent in to do a job. The senior Ministers, Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Quinn, are in charge of co-operation in this field.  They have chosen instead to drive a wedge between those who seek to make appropriate measures for this and those who have not done so.  It is quite apparent why my party opposes this motion.  Lest our opposition be described as bluster or opposition for its own sake, we are opposing it because the select committee, the Central Bank and the industry working group all oppose it.  We have an anomalous situation whereby Members of this House from all parties agree with the conclusion the select <Col N="652" /> committee will reach today, while a Minister of State comes to the House to push the measure through.  I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the case made by Deputy O'Rourke.  The industry working group to which she referred was not appointed by the Government. The proposal to transfer responsibility to the Central Bank does not cut across any other proposals which may emerge on the regulation of investment intermediaries.  A working group, representing the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Department of Justice and the Central Bank, is examining the operation of the Investment Intermediaries Act.  It will need to take account of any recommendations made by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy and the recommendations of the industry working group. The motion before the House is, in effect, a belt and braces motion.  It probably was not necessary for me to come before the House, on behalf of the Government, to request that the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs be instructed to make provision in the Central Bank Bill for the supervision by the Central Bank of investment intermediaries and other matters. Since the long title of the Central Bank Bill does not contain any reference to amending the Investment Intermediaries Act or on whether the select committee had the power to discuss the proposed amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, this motion was brought before the House to remove doubt.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 24 to 39 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;'disability' means the impact on an individual of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment which affects or substantially reduces their prospects of securing, retaining and advancing in employment; and 'physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment' means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the total or partial loss of a person's bodily or mental functions, including the loss of a part of a person's body, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the presence in the body of organisms causing or likely to cause chronic disease or illness, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the malfunction, malformation or disfigurement of a part of a person's body, or</P>
      <P>(d)  a condition or malfunction which results in a person learning differently from a person without the condition, or</P>
      <P>(e)  a condition, illness or disease which affects a person's thought process, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or which results in disturbed behaviour,</P>
      <P>and shall be taken to include an impairment which presently exists, or which previously existed but no longer exists, or which may exist in the future or which is imputed to a person;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> I congratulate Deputy McDaid on his promotion to the Fianna Fáil Front Bench and wish him well as his party's spokesman on equality and law reform.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Bill.  We debated this in detail on Committee Stage but unfortunately the Minister was adamant that his definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; was the correct one.  He also stated that the Disability Federation of Ireland had communicated to him that it was happy with his definition.  However, I pointed out that many people working in the area of disability had indicated their extreme displeasure at his definition. They regard the Bill as a proactive mechanism for people with a disability and believe that it should be more enabling legislation.  The Minister disagrees with their interpretation.  I hope that does not mean there is disagreement among different organisations working in the area of disability. Will the Minister again consider this amendment and indicate his intention in respect of the equal status legislation?  What definition does the Minister regard as appropriate for a disability Act, which I understand he favours?  If such a definition were different, what effect would it have on this legislation?  The Minister must have regard to the fact that many people working in the area of disability do not want as narrow a definition as that contained in the Bill.  They want people with disabilities to be afforded a greater degree of protection and do not regard the medical type definition as appropriate.  Will the Minister give his views on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

In particular, I thank my predecessor, Deputy Woods, who spent long hours over the weekend facilitating me in respect of this complex legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments define the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo; more clearly.  There is a list of meanings for the word in the Bill covering a number of areas but we are more concerned about the effect of such a definition on people with disabilities. We received a number of representations regarding this definition, although I am aware the Disability Federation of Ireland is satisfied with it. If such a body agrees with the Minister on the definition, we must accept that.  Fianna Fáil is firmly committed to the elimination of inequality for people with disabilities.  However, will the Minister indicate the problem with the definition put forward at the ILO convention, namely, that a person with a disability is an individual whose prospects of securing, retaining and advancing in employment are substantially reduced as a result of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological <Col N="656" /> or mental impairment?  Other definitions were also proposed but we believe the medical definition in the Bill is restrictive.  Will the Minister agree to qualify the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Bill by accepting these amendments having regard to their impact on people with disabilities? Am I entitled to speak again on this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in public with Deputy Keogh in extending my good wishes to Deputy McDaid on his appointment as Front Bench spokesperson for his party on equality and law reform; I already extended my congratulations to him privately.  I wish him the very best in this important position and assure him of my co-operation at all times.  I join him in paying tribute to his predecessor, Deputy Woods, with whom I had a good working and constructive relationship over the past years. I know that relationship will continue with Deputy McDaid.</P>
      <P>In response to an extensive discussion on Committee Stage on the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; I indicated I would be willing to review the definition if it could be shown that some category of person was left unprotected by my definition.  No such case has been made.  Having reviewed the matter further, I am satisfied it is appropriate to retain the approach in the Bill which focuses on ensuring a wide scope of protection against such discrimination.  Deputy McDaid is correct in pointing out that other possible definitions have been proposed by the ILO and others, but careful examination of those definitions show they would cut out a section of people from the protection of the Bill I wish to give them.</P>
      <P>The definition advocated by Deputy Keogh requires, for example, that it be a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment. That alone could be a subject of medical debate as to whether the particular impairment was duly recognised.  Representation has been made that the definition in the Bill should not be medically based but should have a type of descriptive social base.  That kind of description is acceptable for social reports and external documents, but the purpose of the Bill is to give protection to the entire range of people who require it.  I had meetings with the Disability Federation of Ireland which initially advocated the same type of definition proposed here, but when I explained that the definitions it advocated would cut out some people from the protection of the Bill, it accepted that position and recognised that my definition was more advantageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained on Committee Stage and repeat now for Deputy McDaid, there is one basis on which I would accept criticism of the definition and that is if it could be shown to me that any category of people who should have protection is left out of my definition.  I have invited all and sundry to put that position to me but nobody has <Col N="657" /> done so.  Looking at the other definitions, especially that proposed by the ILO, I am satisfied that people whom I intend to protect would be cut out.  My definition is widely cast and medically based but one must bear in mind that we are not dealing with a social report.  We are dealing with legislation and the intention is to give the protection of this important Bill to the widest possible spectrum.  I believe I have achieved that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister has genuinely endeavoured to make this definition all-encompassing, he did not refer to people's fears about future legislation on disability.  I have expressed the genuine concerns of people with disability and their organisations about the medical definition included in the legislation.  While I accept the Minister will not agree to the original definition agreed between ICTU and IBEC, will he at least accept the genuine fears about the implications of this definition for future legislation?</P>

      <P>The Minister is doing everything possible to ensure that all disabled persons are protected under the legislation, but is it not true that 80 per cent of people with disability are unemployed?  Is that because they are categorised as disabled?  TB is now a curable disease and while those who suffered from it in the past are recognised as disabled, that should not prevent them from securing employment.  Why are so many disabled persons unemployed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that an unacceptably high number of people with disabilities are unemployed.  One of the purposes of this legislation is to try to remedy that position by making it unlawful to discriminate against people on the grounds that they have a disability. The case of a person who suffered from TB in the past is covered at line 37, page eight of the Bill where it states:</P>
      <P>...and shall be taken to include a disability which presently exists, or which previously existed but no longer exists, or which may exist in the future or which is imputed to a person;</P>
      <P>I expect the employment position of people with disabilities to improve substantially as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;'sexual orientation' means heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual orientation;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Following the Committee Stage discussion on this issue and the agreed amendment to section 16(4) dealing with unlawful sexual behaviour, I reviewed the question of whether to provide a definition of &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; in the Bill.  In drawing up this definition I reflected on the constructive contributions of Deputies on Committee Stage.  I am satisfied this concise definition will enhance the legislation and I trust Members will reconsider the proposals for related amendments in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am happy to accept the Minister's amendment. He has gone a long way towards recognising the difficulties that could arise if those definitions were not included in the legislation.  I am pleased he accepted the arguments put forward on Committee Stage and amended the legislation accordingly.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 6 I propose that discrimination against a person who is believed to be of a different sexual orientation should be as unacceptable as discrimination against a person who has declared that he or she is of a different sexual orientation.  While the Minister said it would be impossible to prove this, such discrimination should also be outlawed.  Why can the Minister not provide for this in the legislation?</P>

      <P>Deputy Keogh's proposal for an amendment to extend protection under the Bill to persons who may be subject to discrimination because they are believed to be of a different sexual orientation may not be entirely practicable. While such a concept has exceptionally been adopted in the area of disability, I am reluctant to apply it generally across all other areas given the difficulties to which it could give rise in case law and the marginal benefit that might ensue.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 23, after &ldquo;ground')&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save that this ground shall not apply where a person admits to being a paedophile or where a person has a conviction for an offence involving the sexual abuse of a person under the age of 18, in work situations which involve access to or control of, minors&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to rectify an omission from this part of the Bill, which covers discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The Bill does not cover situations where a person admits to being a paedophile or has a conviction for an offence involving the sexual abuse of a person under the age of 18 years in work situations which involve access to or control of minors. There has been much publicity surrounding this area and the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have accepted the spirit of the Deputy's amendment because the House has just agreed to an amended definition of sexual orientation. Amendment No. 4 defines &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual orientation&rdquo;. This excludes paedophilia.  In the circumstances, it does not appear necessary to explicitly make a provision qualifying the definition of the sexual orientation ground in this way. The use of a definition of sexual orientation and the clear exclusion in section 16(4) of protection from discrimination based on sexual behaviour which is unlawful would appear to adequately cover the concerns raised by this amendment. While the amendment may perhaps have had force before the amendment to the definition of sexual orientation to which the House has just agreed, it is now unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Is the word &ldquo;paedophile&rdquo; used in the new definition?  The purpose of my amendment is to isolate this class of people.  The public is concerned that they may be included.  More clarification is required because of the number of cases of paedophilia that appear virtually on a weekly basis.  The amendment to which the Minister referred must make it clear that paedophiles are to be excluded.</P>

      <P>I would have preferred to discuss this within the context of section 16.  Amendment No. 20 in my name states:</P>
      <P>In page 19, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;of the&rdquo; in line 39 down to and including line 42 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;or information from a health board or a member of an Garda Síochána, that the individual engages in, or has a propensity to engage <Col N="660" /> in, any form of sexual behaviour which is prohibited by law.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the objective of that section is to combat paedophilia it should do so in conformity with other legislation, such as the Child Care Act, or the guidelines issued by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage that the terms of the section are sweeping and leave it open to challenge.  For example, the term &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; could damage the intent, which is the welfare of children.  The section could also be construed as encompassing non-criminal sexual behaviour and personal relationships of adult women and men.  It, therefore, detracts from the intent of protecting minors from the criminal and predatory actions of paedophiles.</P>
    <P>We must be concise in this matter.  I am not convinced that the definition put forward by the Minister in the form of an amendment covers the issue as well as it might.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider the amendment in the name of Deputy McDaid?  We must send signals about paedophilia from this House.  The effect of the Deputy's amendment would make it clear that it would not be covered by the Bill.  I know the Minister intends the same result, but it should be specifically stated in all relevant legislation that paedophilia is a heinous crime which must be eliminated.  The defence in not accepting the amendment, to the effect that a clause elsewhere deals with unlawful sexual acts, is not a strong argument.</P>
      <P>Would acceptance of this amendment damage the Bill or undermine the effect of its provisions in this regard?  It would not undermine the purpose of the section.  I would be more convinced by the argument, which has not been made, that the amendment would undermine the Bill than that it is unnecessary.  The amendment is necessary because legislators must make it clear that no legislation is intended to protect paedophiles. This is the purpose of the amendment and it should be accepted in that spirit.</P>

      <P>We are all agreed on the objective here.  The position is well covered.  The amended definition of sexual orientation states: ...&ldquo;`sexual orientation' means heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual orientation;&rdquo;.  The amendment in the name of Deputy McDaid would add to this: &ldquo;save that this ground shall not apply where a person admits to being a paedophile...&rdquo;.  Paedophilia is not encompassed by this definition.</P>
      <P>It could conceivably be argued that paedophilia is a form of sexual orientation if the words &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; were undefined, but they are not undefined.  Amendment No. 4 has defined &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; as meaning specifically &ldquo;heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual orientation&rdquo;.  This is covered by the amended section 16(4) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring an employer to recruit, retain in <Col N="661" /> employment or promote an individual if the employer is aware, on the basis of a criminal conviction of the individual or other reliable information, that the individual engages, or has a propensity to engage, in any form of sexual behaviour which is unlawful.</P>
    <P>Paedophilia is unlawful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I phrased it on the basis of a criminal conviction or other reliable information. Deputy Keogh's amendment would weaken the provision.  Concerns were raised on Committee Stage about the use of the words &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo;. I considered the matter and in view of the grave need to protect vulnerable groups from sexual abuse, section 16(4) as it stands must be retained.  I am satisfied that resort to the expression &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; in this context would not involve reliance on unsubstantiated rumour and would be information of an authoritative nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not wish to limit such information, as Deputy Keogh's amendment proposes, solely to information furnished by Garda or health authorities.  Reliable information could be furnished that a person is a paedophile by sources other than Garda or health authorities.  I wish to <Col N="662" /> allow an intending employer to take notice of that other reliable information even if it does not come from Garda or health authorities.  Protection for a person in the case of the employment of a paedophile is covered in the definition and section 4, which excludes any activity which is unlawful.  The amendment would not add anything to it.  It would cause confusion by seeking to introduce by way of clarification of the definition of sexual orientation included in amendment No. 4 something which is not and could not be encompassed by the definition in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to accept amendment No. 4 but the issue would be fully covered if my amendments Nos. 5 and 20, which are linked, were accepted.  The Minister said less protection would be afforded by amendment No. 20 but there would be full coverage if it and amendment No. 5 were accepted.  The points in relation to paedophilia were well made and it would be no harm to specifically include that aspect in the Bill. I do not fully accept the Minister's arguments in that regard and I support Deputy McDaid's amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's legal background and his interpretation that this matter is covered.  However, from the perspective of sending a specific message about paedophilia, I intend to press the amendment.  I agree heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality are covered but this issue is open to interpretation in the courts. A specific provision on paedophilia should be included because that would send the proper message.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with transsexuality.  When the Minister amended the definitions in amendment No. 4 why did he not include this aspect? That might have been helpful.  On Committee Stage the Minister referred to advice on the interpretation of the European Court of Justice judgment and said there was no need for this amendment.  Perhaps when he brings the Bill to the other House he might consider including this within amendment No. 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, there is no need for this provision as the Bill already provides protection for this group. The European Court of Justice found that such discrimination is based essentially if not exclusively on the sex of the person concerned.  They, accordingly, ruled that Council Directive 76/207 precluded the dismissal of a transsexual for a reason related to a gender reassignment.  In the circumstances, I ask Deputy Keogh to withdraw her amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(k) that one has a particular political opinion or belief and the other does not ('the political opinion ground');&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to discrimination for the purposes of the Act.  There should be general acceptance that we can express a political opinion or belief without fear of any oppression or suppression. It is a fundamental right and is supported by international human rights conventions and instruments.  In other jurisdictions there has <Col N="665" /> been criticism when this is absent.  If this was in the Bill we would be able to ratify the ILO Convention on Non-Discrimination; Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK have not ratified that convention and this would be of assistance.  On Committee Stage the Minister said there were nine grounds already provided for and we could not have everything in the Bill but this is fundamental.

Everybody has political opinions, there is no reason people should not have them and we should not believe that our civil servants do not have political opinions.  The great majority of Irish people have political opinions which they express.  We should not deny them the right to express those political opinions openly.  It is foolish to think we are doing so by the manner in which we are acting at present.  There are grounds for Deputy Keogh's amendment to be accepted and I am anxious to hear the Minister's response, bearing in mind the huge numbers of people to whom this amendment pertains.</P>

      <P>An amendment similar to amendment No. 9 was discussed on Committee Stage. As I stated then, a proposal to add new discriminatory grounds to the nine grounds already provided for in the Bill cannot but be an attractive one to any Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 identify political opinion and trade union membership as two of a range of further options available to me. There could be very many more but I have achieved progress on this difficult Bill because its scope, although quite broad, has remained focused.  That focus has been to give effect to the Government's commitment to enact legislation which would outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community. There are many other grounds which could be considered but they will be matters for another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In bringing forward this legislation, the Government has covered a very broad spectrum and is providing anti-discrimination protection to a wide range of groups who have had no protection since the foundation of the State.  I do not claim that the list is exhaustive but we are making great strides in providing protection for these categories, most of which have had no protection until now.  Other grounds can be considered on <Col N="666" /> another occasion.  With regret I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed.  I realise there is wide scope within the Bill and referred to it earlier. However, if the Northern Ireland Fair Employment Act includes political belief we should try to have the same protections within our law.  The Minister should address this.</P>
      <P>Political opinion and membership of political parties should be actively considered by most people and, unfortunately, it is not.  It is extremely important to get young people involved politically and we should nurture this, but when someone can be discriminated against because of their political beliefs, that makes it more difficult.  We should remove barriers and encompass as many matters as we can within the scope of this Bill.  Many people would consider the political ground when thinking of an employment equality Bill.  Ours is a very politically aware nation and many people have vociferous political views.  Because of particular circumstances such as the troubles in Northern Ireland there is great sensitivity about this issue.  Will the Minister reconsider this?  It would make sound sense to have this included in the Bill.</P>

This is a specific area which the Minister can and should include.</P>

      <P>In the interests of time, it is not necessary to have a vote on this.  Many people recall a time when there was total discrimination in regard to membership of a trade union and if anybody even attempted to join one in some industries they were fired.  We have come a long way since then and there are protections in labour law.  We should include membership of a trade union in the protections of this Bill because it is specific to employment and it makes sense to include it.  On Committee Stage, the Minister did not want to take this on board and he used the argument that we are extending the remit of this <Col N="667" /> Bill and are making it even broader.  So what? That is what we should do.  The purpose of putting down amendments is to try to improve the Bill as much as possible.  The Minister has a pecking order of nine grounds and says that political opinion or belief and membership of a trade union do not come as high in the pecking order as other grounds.  That is not the way I look on it.  We should examine those issues under which people can be and have been discriminated against.  In the past membership of a trade union has been the cause of discrimination and has prevented people from being employed.  There are people who have a known record in fighting for the rights of other members in a particular industry.  When they go to seek a job in another company they do not even get an interview.  It is difficult for people to prove that but were it within the compass of the Bill, employers would think long and hard about discriminating against such people.</P>

His colleague, Deputy Woods, asked me on Committee Stage to consider this matter further.  I have done so and I am satisfied that given the lower age threshold of 16 which applies in respect of all other grounds of discrimination in the Bill and in view of the application of this lower age threshold for protection against discrimination as regards vocational training, 16 to 18 year olds enjoy wide cover in this legislation.  My resistance to moving the threshold in respect of age discrimination in employment continues to relate to the unique and special protection already afforded to employees under 18 in the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, and the need to accommodate transition from school to work for such young people, notwithstanding the special obligations on employers under the 1996 Act.

      <P>, <i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): We come to amendment No. 13 in the name of Deputy Keogh.  Amendment No. 14 is related.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 can, therefore, be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 4 to 16, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  both perform or, if both were employed would perform, the same work under the same or similar conditions or each is, or if both were employed would be, interchangeable with the other in relation to the work; or</P>
      <P>(b)  the work performed by one is, or if both were employed would be, of a similar nature to that which is, or would be, performed by the other and any differences between the work which is, or would be performed, or the conditions under which it is, or would be performed, by each either are, or would be, of small importance in relation to the work as a whole or occur, or would occur, with such irregularity as not to be significant to the work as a whole; or</P>
      <P>(c)  the work which is performed by one is equal in value to the work which is or would be performed by the other, having regard to such matters as skill, physical or mental requirements, responsibility and working conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extremely important amendment.  The absence of what is described as a male comparator is a significant lacuna in the Bill.  This amendment is designed to address that because women still earn substantially less than men.  There is no debate about that; it is a fact.  There is a high propensity at the moment to use women as cheap labour.  We must, therefore, have a mechanism to ensure that all women can secure what would be the male rate for the job.  Where there is employment <Col N="671" /> of women only, employers seem to believe they can pay them a reduced rate for their work where men doing the same type of work would be paid substantially more.  We must try to deal with that within the confines of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was the intention originally to have a hypothetical comparator.  The Minister should agree to this because one of the key criticisms of this legislation is that it does not afford an opportunity to workers in segregated employment to achieve equal pay, and that is something that must be addressed.  It has been suggested that we discuss the issue of low pay for certain types of work under labour legislation, but it is important in talking about employment equality that we make the case that women are now used as cheap labour and deal with that in this legislation.  Were we to do so, we would be going a long way towards redressing an imbalance in society.</P>
    <P>I did not claim that my amendment was perfect, but I did ask the Minister to examine it because we did not have before us any other example of how this might be dealt with.  I have tried to frame a reasonable and workable amendment. I am happy that I have done that.  In talking about increased numbers in employment, we have to be realistic about what type of employment it is.  If people are in low-paid, dead-end jobs, and many of them are women, we should be asking why that is so.  One of the reasons is that we do not allow for comparison with a hypothetical male.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This section of the Bill is extremely important.  Up to now we have been dealing with sexual orientation.  Here is a completely different area where we are dealing with women, the vast majority of whom are in low-paid employment.  If they have to remain in that type of employment, at least they should get recognition for the work they are doing.  My party leader has expressed his concern about this, because there is no way these women can compare themselves to men in a similar position. Many women work in jobs that are not normally done by males.  In order to get around this, a number of other countries have adopted the concept of the notional comparator.  As I said, I am interested to hear what the Minister will say about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the issue of a notional or hypothetical comparator was thoroughly debated on Committee Stage.  The relevant amendments proposed by the Opposition were voted on and defeated.  However sympathetic I am to the concept, I am satisfied that it has not been possible to come up with an appropriate and workable provision in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies know, I sought to develop a workable model for a hypothetical comparator because means must be found to gradually dismantle the vertical and horizontal segregation of the labour market.  The issues I set out to address <Col N="672" /> when I considered this matter are complex and ingrained in the structure of the labour market.  I examined this issue in considerable detail and I consulted widely, both the public service and IBEC and ICTU, on how it might apply.  Unfortunately, it did not prove possible to develop a viable model for a hypothetical comparator that would achieve the intended results.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the Second Commission on the Status of Women also acknowledged problems with the hypothetical comparator approach and opted instead for a minimum wage approach to address the issue of low pay.  Low pay is, of course, a separate matter from equal pay and is appropriate for attention in the context of existing industrial relations machinery through, for example, the employment regulations orders and registered employment agreements.  It is not an issue for attention in this Bill which is an anti-discrimination, equal pay Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, Deputy McDaid is not correct in saying that workable models of this type have been achieved elsewhere.  My information is that the hypothetical comparator arrangement is not in existence in any other European state.  I understand that it was tried in the Netherlands for six to 12 months, where it was found to be unworkable or unsatisfactory and was discontinued.  The distinction must be drawn between the position of low pay and equal pay.  I agree with Deputies Keogh and McDaid that low pay is an issue which has to be addressed.  However, that is a matter for another Minister and other legislation and not for this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point is that the reason women get trapped in low paid jobs is that they are women.  If there were a male comparator perhaps they could be lifted out of that.  History teaches us that many employers have taken the view that the income of women employees represents a second family income or that they work for &ldquo;pin money&rdquo;.  Our social strata have changed but, unfortunately, this realisation does not seem to have hit home in many industries.  That is why a male comparator is needed.  If employers asked themselves what would be a living wage for their employees, they would come up with different answers for men and women.  Employers choose to employ women because they know that many women are prepared, because of their financial circumstances, to take on any work for virtually any wage.  That is the truth of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the issue of low pay should also be addressed in other places.  However, we cannot separate these issues from this Employment Equality Bill.  The Minister said, contrary to what Deputy McDaid said, that we do not have an example of this model.  I am not yet on the Internet and I have not been able to examine all the information, but why can we not lead the way in this?  Why are we waiting to see what everybody else has done?  Could we not find some way to provide a comparator?  Is the Minister prepared <Col N="673" /> to try to do that?  To a certain extent, he seems to have given up on it on the basis that it has not worked anywhere else.  That is not how it should be approached.  This is a very fundamental issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to an Australian model which I read about when I was trying to address the complexities of this Bill over the weekend.  I was not aware of the model in the Netherlands.  Will the Minister give us some indication of what was tried in the Netherlands?  As Deputy Keogh said, what is not applicable in another country might be applicable here.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point in regard to the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  If it has examined this area it will have gone into it in great detail.  We must recognise the complexity of the issue because I am sure no other body would be more determined to have a provision such as this included in the Bill.  As Deputy Keogh said, some employers employ women because they will get away with paying them a lower wage.  Unfortunately, there are some women whose situation means they are available for such work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I would like the Minister to comment on the experience in the Netherlands.  I am unaware of what the Second Commission on the Status of Women said on this issue but I accept it <Col N="674" /> is a complex one which I will not press until I have more information from the Minister and the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not saying this is not complex &mdash; it is &mdash; but let us find a solution.  Building on the work of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the National Women's Council asked that this matter be re-examined.  It is essential we find a solution to this issue because otherwise women will get stuck at the bottom level of society by dint of the fact they have no way out. The argument which should be made on their behalf cannot be made because there is no comparator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have information about the situation in the Australian state to which Deputy McDaid refers.  If he locates further information about it I would be interested to see it. My understanding of the position in the Netherlands is that it had some kind of notional comparator in operation for a relatively short period but I do not know its exact structure.  My information is that it was found to be unworkable and was discontinued after it was in force for a relatively short period.</P>
      <P>The key point is that it was examined in detail by the Second Commission on the Status of Women, an expert body, who sat for a long time and had all the necessary expertise available to it. It recognised that the problem was low pay rather than equal pay and, consequently, there was no recommendation for a notional comparator in that report.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the one year derogation provided for in section 9 which states that collective agreements and orders which discriminate against workers will be null and void. The one year derogation before the section comes into operation on all other grounds except gender weakens the current legislation covering gender and marital status.  I am surprised that a one year derogation was provided for and my amendment proposes to delete it.  Deputy McDaid in his amendment proposes a three month derogation.

I draw attention to the need in the review process to examine not only provisions which give rise to direct discrimination but also those less obviously indirectly discriminatory provisions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The formal establishment of the Western Development Commission was announced by the Government on 23 December last.  The new Western Development Commission will build on the important achievements of the former Western Development Partnership Board which prepared an action plan for the economic and social development of the western region.  The central function of the new commission will be to complement and add value to the activities of the State agencies and local development bodies which currently operate in the region in the interests of the people of the region.</P>
      <P>A number of locations in the western region are currently being considered for use as offices for the Western Development Commission.  A decision on this matter will be taken in consultation with the Western Development Commission and will be announced in due course.</P>
      <P>The commission as constituted reflects a dynamic and focused approach to the regeneration of the west and best ensures the success of its objectives.  I do not propose any reconstitution since the membership has only been announced in the past few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, the purpose of the Western Investment Fund will be to provide long-term <Col N="678" /> risk capital for developing business projects in the region not currently attracting funding from commercial or State agencies.  The Government has committed £25 million over the next six years towards this niche venture capital fund.</P>
    <P>It is expected the demands on the fund will grow gradually in its first year of operation as projects for investment are identified and matching funding, particularly from the private sector, is put in place.  The Western Development Commission will have an important role in this regard over the coming months.  One of its central functions will be the promotion and management of the fund in accordance with arrangements currently being settled with my Department.</P>
    <P>The commission will hold its inaugural meeting tomorrow and I expect it will start to develop its work plan and priorities, including the Western Investment Fund, as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, I recently announced I will not seek re-election to this House.  As a parting gesture to myself and, more importantly, as an incentive to my successor, will the Minister of State agree that Sligo is the ideal base for the new commission because of its geographical location, communications facilities and because it is the location of the temporary partnership board?  Will he assure me all of these considerations will be given full weight when the time comes to make the decision?  As the Minister of State will be responsible for the decision, will he assure me Sligo is the favoured location for this important institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is currently examining alternative sites in the west.  As Deputy Nealon correctly stated, the temporary headquarters is located in Sligo which I suppose gives that county a slight edge.  However, many considerations must be taken into account before a decision is made on the location for a headquarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider other areas like Sligo and Galway for the location of sub-offices.  In regard to the constitution of the commission, it should be remembered that it was small farmers in south Galway who approached the bishops concerning its establishment, and the farming organisations and the co-operative movement are disappointed they will not be represented on the commission.  Of the £2 million investment, will money be made available to people, as was proposed, for the promotion of projects?  I refer in particular to the problem of the proposed curtailment of the two freight lines in the western region.  Will funding be provided to address that problem in liaison with the State agencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the meetings, the first informal meeting of the commission was held in Knock and was successful.  The commission decided to hold the second meeting in Ballaghaderreen; perhaps they will hold the third in Sligo.  Formal headquarters have not yet been established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the constitution of the commission, the Western Development Partnership Board recommended a figure of 21 in its plan.  In considering the matter, however, the Government wanted to encourage dynamism on the commission and it felt that a compact group of seven people was more suitable.  The commission is made up of two businessmen, representatives of the trade unions, the county managers, the county council and the Department of the Taoiseach.  In addition, there is provision for sectoral committees as recommended by the Western Development Partnership Board in its plan. A sectoral committee will deal with natural resources and will focus mainly on agricultural policies for the west.  That is necessary to prepare for the possible sub-regional division of the country when the west may seek objective 1 status following the depletion of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>We prepared well for this, but I am disappointed the co-operatives did not know exactly what was included in the plan produced by the Western Development Partnership Board.  They wanted a discussion on natural resources and a special group is being set up to deal with that matter.  We have appointed a dynamic, energetic and tightly focused group of people with proven management abilities and a focus on enterprise. Above all, there will be fresh thinking and a new approach to the problems of the west.  As there have been many casualties, even on the venture capital side &mdash; the most notable being NAD-CORP &mdash; I believe the correct decision has been taken and I stand by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, who took questions on western development on 17 December said the commission will develop close working relations with regional and local authorities and agencies engaged in local development in the western region.  As a large number of bodies draw down significant funding from Government and the European Union, is the Minister confident the commission will not duplicate some of the work already being done? Does he envisage the commission co-ordinating existing projects and programmes?  If not, does he agree co-ordination must be considered at this stage?  I am raising this matter before the commission holds its first meeting, otherwise there could be a great deal of confusion because of all the programmes involved.  Irrespective of the good work done under those programmes, if the commission does not co-ordinate all the activities at the outset, it will not be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government published the terms of reference of the Western Development Commission it said its central function would be to complement and add value to the activities of State agencies and local development bodies currently operating in the region.  Most counties in the west have established county strategy groups and devised strategic plans.  The expertise of those on the commission will ensure that a co-ordinated approach is adopted.  The appointment of the Donegal county manager is a clear indication of the Government's intention to ensure there is not duplication of activities and that strategic plans are put in place for the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I and the late Deputy Blaney were the only Members who attended the meeting that acted as the catalyst for the bishops' movement which resulted in the establishment of this commission. Does the Minister of State believe the commission can be dynamic and act in an effective and focused manner when the funding allocated to it will be only a little more than £4 million per annum for the next six years?  In view of the area to be covered and the difficulties that will arise in terms of demarcation lines and co-ordination, does he believe the commission can achieve anything dynamic or worthwhile with such a paltry sum of money?  Will he clarify the counties that will be included under the work of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity Deputy Molloy, who has an interest in the west, has not read the documents that have been published since last May, in which the counties to be included were outlined. Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Clare will be included and the amount of money involved will be much more than £4 million.  I fail to understand why Deputy Molloy persists in talking things down.  In ringfencing projects for the west I have ensured that £100 million will be made available over the next six years.  While the initial sum may be somewhat <Col N="681" /> modest, as a former Minister, Deputy Molloy should know that projects do not develop overnight. On another occasion he criticised me for not utilising moneys allocated for the islands when the projects were not in order.  Capital projects take some time to develop.  I am disappointed the Deputy is trying to talk down a special effort that is being made for the west.</P>
      <P>I am confident that three flagship projects for the west will emerge from the Western Development Fund and the commission in the coming year.  Deputy Bertie Ahern was helpful in highlighting problems that might arise with duplication and co-ordination.  It will be the job of the commission and myself to ensure there is no duplication of activities.  A successful businessman from County Galway, who has done a great deal for indigenous industry in the region, is a member of the board.  Rather than trying to find fault with this development, I expected Members from the west to make helpful suggestions to improve the position of the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept the Western Development Commission could not get a commitment from Government to deal with problems that will cost money?  As usual, rather than focusing on the real problems, its answer was to set up another body that will duplicate work already being done.  Does the Minister of State accept the Government's contribution to the commission will not touch the tip of the iceberg in regard to the problems facing the west, such as lack of infrastructure and services and a total degeneration of rural communities through decreasing population?  Does the remit of the commission cover Gaeltacht areas?  If so, does that mean another body has been set up to tease those who have been already driven crazy by a multitude of agencies and groups?  Does the Minister accept this is a kneejerk rather than a serious response to the problems of the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable Deputy Ó Cuív finds it necessary to criticise the plan of the Western Development Partnership Board which was drawn up by people nominated by a Fianna Fáilled Government.  They produced the plan, sought the establishment of a commission and called for the setting up of a western development fund. There was no political difference on the matter.  I have been successful in persuading the Government to ring-fence £100 million &mdash; which could increase to £200 million &mdash; especially for the west. I fail to understand why Deputy Ó Cuív finds it necessary to decry that achievement.  Surely we should encourage people to invest in the west.  In so far as jobs are concerned, I thought Deputy Ó Cuív would be modest enough to praise Údarás na Gaeltachta for its great work in the past two years in increasing the numbers employed in <Col N="682" /> Gaeltacht areas, but he appears to be negative about that also.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that my colleague, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, has decided to relinquish his seat at the next general election and to continue serving as an MEP for the constituency of Connaught-Ulster. While the country overall will lose its Objective 1 status for EU funding from 1999, this does not apply to any part of Connaught-Ulster. Will the Minister of State assure the House that the Western Development Board will treat this region as a priority?  Is the Government considering the possibility of ensuring that the region enjoys positive discrimination in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked an interdepartmental committee to consider Objective 1 status for the west with a view to preparing a submission to <Col N="683" /> Government regarding income levels in the region.  The Western Development Partnership Board plan dealt with the five major sectors and those involved will be given the opportunity to study sectoral policy.  In the compilation of this policy they will also assess information on income which will form the basis for proving that the west and the north-west should continue to have Objective 1 status.</P>

I am reasonably up to date with the preparation of the essential documents to make a subregional claim.</P>
      <P>The subregional aspect should have been tackled long ago.  Regrettably, the west was left out of the previous application for EU Structural Funds.  Major infrastructural plans, including parallel road, railway and industry structures should have been included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the terms of reference in which the Deputy is interested.  The central function of the commission will be to complement and add value to the activities to the State agencies and local development bodies which currently operate in the western region.  The commission will approach the economic and social development of the region and the interests of the people there.  It will achieve this in collaboration with the existing statutory and community based agencies who are working in the region.  This relates to the question raised some time ago by Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
      <P>It will prepare a strategic plan and agree targets with regard to economic and social development, monitor progress and establish, promote and operate the pilot initiative.  It will also support and promote the local enterprise network, LENS, and will act as a regional resource and support of local development initiatives.  In addition, it will prepare and publish an annual report on developments in the western region and on the activities of the commission.</P>

      <P>The national development plan for EU Structural Funds was compiled on the basis of the regions submitting their plans.  This was the basis on which the sum of almost £8 <Col N="684" /> billion was negotiated.  It is factually incorrect, therefore, to say that an area was not covered.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree there is a serious imbalance in the distribution of IDA jobs and employment generally?  The area for which he is responsible, Connaught and the Border region, showed a net increase of 100 jobs last year at a time of economic growth of approximately 6 per cent and the deployment of large amounts of EU Structural Funds.</P>

The Deputy excluded this from his figures.  In addition, figures from Forbairt indicate that there has been a substantial increase in employment in the west.  Furthermore, figures published recently by Údarás na Gaeltachta auger well for the region.  Most communities are becoming involved in the Leader programmes or in ADM.

When the officer reports on the project, I am sure it will be referred to the western investment fund as one of the flagship projects I mentioned earlier.</P>

      <P>The policy areas which will be examined in subgroups will involve all the interested parties.  I am disappointed in the approach taken by the co-ops on this matter.  The co-ops in the west have a contribution to make to a radical agricultural plan which will be required if sufficient numbers of people in rural Ireland are to be retained.  I have not yet heard the western co-ops' radical plan because, unfortunately, it will require sacrifices by agricultural people throughout the country.  The four farmers from Loughrea set a challenge for politicians, the establishment and the church in the west.  The western development board had an opportunity to develop a radical plan.  The Opposition may think it is radical but I do not agree.  I fully support the solid idea put forward by the four farmers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the task force which I chair are currently being put in place.  In order to make it as clear and simple as possible for people applying for funding, a pre-application form is now available in local offices in the Border region.</P>
      <P>In order to give people in the region better information on the programmes available, a guide to sources of funding is currently being prepared which will be available in the spring.  In addition, local offices in the region have been asked to submit suitable case studies and information for a forthcoming newsletter which will be circulated widely to people in the region and will provide information on the projects being funded under the programmes available.</P>
      <P>A seminar for people working in local offices, which I hosted, was held in Monaghan on 9 December last.  It provided an opportunity for people to discuss the various programmes and consider the common issues that affect them. There was a general recognition of the need for information sharing locally between agencies, for greater co-operation between agencies and for better information to be made available to people applying for funding.</P>
      <P>The mid-term review of EU funding programmes is currently under way.  Any adjustments required, either within or across programmes, will be carried out on the basis of an independent evaluation and decisions will be made by the relevant monitoring committee and the CSF monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>Since I was asked by the Taoiseach to chair the task force on Border funding on 7 February 1996, I have taken the opportunity, both in accepting invitations to functions and in taking various initiatives in visiting the Border region, to meet a wide cross section of people from the area.  I was in Cavan last week for a further meeting and I expect to be in south Louth within the next month.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister state that the report was published last June and he is still preparing plans to implement the two miserable recommendations contained in it?  The Minister did not state how many times he has visited the Border region.  He referred to one visit since I tabled my question.  I do not doubt the Minister is aware of the support of the United States and the European Union for the development of the Border economy.  Will the Minister accept that the Government has failed miserably to underpin that support or attract jobs to the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern, referred to Connacht/Ulster.  Is the Minister aware that 25 overseas jobs were created in one <Col N="688" /> county in my constituency and 22 jobs were created in the other but there was a net loss of 60 jobs in the two counties?  Those figures are despite the 14,081 new jobs coming into the country. What plans do the Taoiseach, the Government and the Minister have to ensure overseas investment is attracted to the Border counties, particularly in view of the fact that American and European support will not last forever?</P>

      <P>I was there twice during the by-election. Regarding the report, the pre-application form has been available for some time.  However, the Deputy is correct that the preparations for the newsletter have been slow.  There were difficulties with the compilation of the information but it is moving along apace.  A booklet will also be available. I appreciate the Deputy's question but I made great efforts to ensure people were made aware of the programmes.  It was heartening to attend the recent meeting in Cavan and see that approximately 180 people from different areas of community development turned up for the all-day seminar.  They took part in five different sessions during the day and I am satisfied that people in the region are becoming more aware of the programmes.</P>
      <P>Regarding the infrastructural problem in terms of the IDA and the attraction of overseas investment, by and large responsibility for that lies with the preparation of the infrastructure of the area.</P>

I recall there were road candidates in his constituency.  As has always been the case, there is difficulty in getting money from central funds.  Some of the terms that apply to the investment of Structural Funds should be relaxed.  Economic criteria apply to investment in national primary routes, and the Government of which Deputy O'Hanlon was a member agreed that matter with the European Commission.</P>

      <P>In the past two years Deputies have tried to convince the Government to spend some of the moneys available under the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and other funds for Border areas, which unfortunately were not available when we were in Government, on industrial infrastructure which, as the IDA and everybody in the House recognises, was badly needed.  Money was needed in the Border region to entice industry into the area.  Did the Minister see the map produced by Dr. Séamus Caulfield, a member of the Council for the West who for some reason included Louth in the calculations of net jobs lost?  Is the Minister aware that last year Louth had a net loss of 500 jobs?  Nothing has been done for that area by the Government.  It has taken its eye off the ball in the last three years.  When the Minister comes to Louth he should concentrate on creating jobs there.</P>

The <Col N="690" /> reason for the delay in the programme is that we must undertake widespread consultation, a process which I inherited.  It is not a process where the main contributor is the State; there is a partnership with the EU which insisted on conditions and requested a focus on particular areas of social life.  That is why the programme is geared in that direction.  Some 723 applications have been approved under the Peace and Reconciliation Programme to date and approximately £24 million was committed to projects in the Border region to end December 1996.</P>

      <P>When the Peace and Reconciliation Programme was set up the necessary officers were not available to guide people locally.  Project officers have been appointed in all the Border counties, thereby helping to progress the efforts of communities.  People were dissuaded from applying because they could not develop the cross-Border element, but with 723 applications approved and £24 million committed, it is my intention to ensure that as much money as possible is spent before the election.  The greater the concentration in the Border region the happier I will be.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the crisis in regard to export refunds was repeated in 1997 in view of the very severe effect of cuts in 1996.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3210/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no cuts in export refunds in 1996.  Refunds were actually increased by 7.5 per cent for beef and 5 per cent for live cattle in February 1996 followed by a further increase of 12.3 per cent for both categories effective from 1 May 1996.  Between September and November 1995 the Commission cut export refunds on four different occasions in order to control the level of subsidised exports to third country markets to comply with the GATT export ceilings which had come into operation for the first time in 1995. Under the GATT agreement the limit on subsidised exports of beef is due to fall from 1.137 million tonnes in 1995 to 821,000 tonnes in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following these cuts in refunds I expressed serious concern to the Commission about the approach being adopted to limit the level of subsidised exports and I suggested alternative ways which would achieve more effective management of the licensing system to achieve this objective. In any event these cuts were fully reversed in 1996 through the increases I have already outlined. <Col N="691" /> These high refunds, in conjunction with the very flexible intervention arrangements, stabilised the industry and underpinned producers' incomes in a period of great difficulty for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The decision to cut refunds by 10 per cent on 15 January this year following the suspension of licences applied for in the previous two weeks was a matter of serious concern to me.  The decision is attributable to concern on the part of the Commission about the high volume of licence applications in a situation where two thirds of the GATT ceiling has already been used.  I raised the matter immediately with Commissioner Fischler while the Taoiseach raised the matter with Commission President Santer with a view to having the decision reversed.  The matter has also been raised formally at the Agriculture Council with support from other member states.  The fact that the Commission has acceded to my request to reduce the validity period of licences to 30 days as a method of controlling applications in order to stay within the GATT limits is a first step in the process which will hopefully see refunds increased to their former level.  I will maintain pressure on the Commission and seek the continued support of my colleagues in the Council of Ministers to achieve that result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  From May 1996 to January 1997 they increased again to 64p per pound.  The Deputy should be aware this is all part of the GATT deal he negotiated.  The licence prefixed so far is for 770,000 tons.  As he knows, the GATT year runs out on 30 June and the limit is 1.19 tons. The Commission divide up the remaining 35 per cent of licences available and try to have an orderly disposal.  They do not want a situation where there are no prefixations left in April or May.  That is the reason for the cut.</P>
      <P>The Irish had heavy prefixations before the revaluation but they have acted very responsibly subsequently.  The very heavy prefixations on the Continent caused the problem.  Whether our representations to have them reversed will be successful will depend on the level of prefixations that now apply at the lower rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that in autumn 1995, following the major cuts, the Minister publicly declared this was a temporary matter and he would have it reversed, thereby deluding farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, on 5 January 1997, the same optimistic <Col N="692" /> statement was made, and rather than a reverse, an additional penalty was put on when the South African market export refund was cut by a further 10 per cent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I was successful in getting a temporary decision whereby the cuts in autumn and late 1995 were reversed and we had the full level of refunds for the massive level of prefixations from May 1996 to January 1997.  Whether the present level is temporary will depend on the level of prefixations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned South Africa.  This is not a matter relating to the GATT.  It is particular to South Africa and the rate of refund for boneless female beef and boneless male forequarters. There was an 8 per cent reduction because there was a change in the refund zone applicable to South Africa for those cuts of beef.  This pressure was put on by South Africa and neighbouring States because of the damage higher refunds were causing their native beef production.  Those African countries have sought the abolition of all refunds and a compromise was reached to modify by 8 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether current measures in relation to weights for intervention are adequate to ensure the orderly disposal of the beef herd in the first quarter of 1997; and the steps, if any, Egypt is requesting to reopen the beef market to that country.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3211/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Since last March I have succeeded in securing flexible intervention arrangements with regard to weight limitations and eligible categories, despite reservations from the Commission and most member states.  These were significant factors in underpinning market prices to date.</P>
      <P>The Commission indicated quite clearly early last year that the higher weight limits would only apply for a limited period and that they would move to the 340 kg weight limit as quickly as possible.  The Commission is accordingly progressively reducing the weights for intervention tenders in January, February and March from 380 kg to 360 kg.  It had also intended excluding the 04 category.  I succeeded in getting a derogation providing for the continued eligibility of the 04 category for this period.  Intervention purchasing can therefore play a very significant role in underpinning cattle prices in the first quarter of 1997 as up to 50 per cent of steers will be eligible under these arrangements.  In addition, the recovery in beef consumption in the EU should allow our exporters to regain some of the market share lost since the crisis.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the support measures in conjunction with improving commercial markets will allow for the continued orderly disposal of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Egypt, the authorities there have <Col N="693" /> suspended the importation of live cattle but beef has continued access to that market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On weight limits, does the Minister agree that the effective reduction in the weight limits from 380 kg in January, 370 kg in February and 360 kg in March will exclude up to 40 per cent of eligible animals?  Can beef producers look forward to the Minister reversing that decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear about what happened in 1996 regarding this matter.  The Commission made it clear around the middle of the year that one of the ways they would cut production was by cutting average carcase weights. Average carcase weights had gone up in the EU by about 10 per cent over the previous 9 to 10 years.  They saw a fairly painless way to cut production was to slaughter cattle at lighter weights. They signalled this progressive timetable of weight reduction by the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>I got a derogation so that there was virtually no reduction until January 1997.  I then publicly spoke, as the Deputy may remember, about what I called &ldquo;elephants&rdquo; of cattle and that marketing for these cattle would be very difficult.  I said people buying cattle into sheds should not consider heavy cattle for intervention.  It is simply the age and weight at which the animal is slaughtered, which is at the farmer's discretion.  As the months went by, the French and others made it clear to us that we were on our own.  They had all washed these heavy cattle out of the system.</P>
      <P>I made it abundantly clear to all concerned and I will continue to press the question of weights. The Deputy is right: with existing statistics, if there is no change in farmer patterns of slaughtering, up to 40 per cent may be excluded.  That would be at 360 kg.  The O4 category is a significant factor and it would be double if it was not for that.</P>
      <P>There is a permanent shift in the intervention purchasing arrangements both because it is difficult to dispose of heavy carcases and weight needs to be shed without shedding numbers.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point that if the third country markets on which we are dependent deteriorate, we will become more dependent on intervention.  We will use that argument.  When the Deputy was in office there was a change in the weights at which lambs were slaughtered. Lambs were slaughtered at 60 kg live weight and now they are slaughtered at 35 to 40 kgs.  The same shift has to take place with bovine animals. It is nothing to do with the negotiations.  One might get a temporary derogation but the long-term shift is clear.  I asked Teagasc, in their cattle advisory and breeding advice programmes, to factor this into the permanent change likely to occur in this regard.</P>

      <P>The possibility of recovering EU disallowances which related to breaches of EU regulations in the beef sector was examined by a group of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General assisted by an independent legal adviser.  The group submitted its report to the Minister for Finance and to me in March 1996.</P>
      <P>The legal advice obtained by the group and endorsed by it was that the disallowances levied on Ireland did not of themselves give any entitlement to me to recover any part of the disallowances from companies which may have featured in the case made against Ireland by the Commission. Any proceedings brought against companies must be based upon a recognised cause of action in Irish law and be proven in accordance with the applicable rules of evidence in civil proceedings. In accordance with advice received it was decided to take proceedings in two cases relating to AIBP &mdash; Shannon Meats and Rathkeale. These proceedings have not yet come to a court hearing.</P>

The figure had been much higher but we got a mitigation of about £20 million.

The microscopy test used by my Department has identified either avian or mammalian bone in 76 samples since the beginning of 1996 and 39 of these cases are being investigated further.  In view of the control difficulties being encountered and the difficulties distinguishing between mammalian and poultry bones, I propose to introduce licensing arrangements governing the incorporation of poultry offal into feedstuffs for animals and bringing this offal on to premises producing such feedstuffs.</P>

That is the information available to me.  The inspections are carried out by the cereal inspectorate and 31 inspectors are involved from time to time.  In so far as the avian meat and bone meal is concerned, the line I have taken is to have dedicated white meat plants separate from ruminant feed.  I am disappointed by the delays and the lack of awareness of the farming and consumer concerns displayed by the feed and compounding industry.  I will not hesitate to revoke licences where cross contamination is found.  I am determined that everyone buying feedstuffs will have the maximum disclosure of feed ingredients.  I have secured agreement that there will be a breakdown by alphabetical order.  The new national beef safety assurance scheme will involve statutory and non-statutory provisions with regard to registration and I will seek to go further than that.</P>

When we carry out a test and find tiny traces of meat and bone meal, as happened in the 76 samples, we look at the licensing stocks arrangement.  While it is true that there is a technical control analysis difficulty in differentiating between two elements, we can determine whether the stocks are due to cross contamination or whether avian meat and bone meal is being fed.</P>

      <P>The best scientific information available to me is that the transmission of BSE is through the infected prion being in meat and bonemeal.  We will ensure that any form of meat and bonemeal &mdash; poultry or mammalian &mdash; cannot be used for feeding.  However, there is not a scintilla of scientific information to suggest that feeding poultry or avian meat and bonemeal to bovine animals represents any danger to human or animal health and in other members states it is perfectly legal.  There is no Community law to debar poultry meat and bonemeal from being fed to ruminants.  I am going further than that science. In case I am accused of not being frank in giving information to the House, I intend, within a matter of days, to make some radical decisions in regard to meat and bonemeal which I will announce shortly.</P>

This Act was introduced in 1988 and unfortunately it has taken a long time for it to be implemented.  In view of the outrage among certain sections of the public over the lack of departmental action in carrying out these inspections what will the Minister do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was first brought to my attention in detail in September 1996 when the full horror of the lack of uniform local authority cover in our 460 abattoirs became apparent.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was responsible for the export of meat and has a nationwide team of VIs and TVIs but in our local abattoirs it was left to the local authority.  Some local authorities had deliberately failed to meet their legal obligations.  I will not hesitate to take litigation as the Minister now being given responsibility for this area against any local authority that does not meet its obligations.  It is our ultimate intention that the entire slaughtering service &mdash; domestic and export &mdash; will be brought under my control and we are having discussions with the staff unions involved to take it out of the hands of the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the issue of E-coli, which is a matter of hygiene.  The inspection in regard to raw meat as against cooked meat is a matter for environmental health officers, the health service and for domestic and commercial hygiene.  It is not a contagious disease in that sense.  Proper hygiene and cooking procedures dispense with and destroy E-coli.  Bacteria is common in our food anyway.  These changes in the Abattoirs Act, 1988, did not relate to E-coli.  They deal with antibiotic checks, BSE checks and all other work done in meat factories by VIs and AOs to get a uniform service across the country. A solution to this is in sight after many years with the £2 million I have secured and the national charge which is to be put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Parliamentary Questions Nos. 16, 19, 57, 65 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has no function in the determination of fees for the preparation of agri-environmental plans.  REP scheme plans are prepared by planners approved by my Department and farmers are free to choose any planner from the approved list.  I do not intend to change this approach in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is disquiet throughout the country at the variation in charges for the preparation of REP scheme plans.  Can the Minister of State give an assurance that in the future there will be a flat rate or a consistent, standard charge for the preparation of such plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department does not intend to become involved in the level of charges. However, the Agricultural Consultants' Association, which represents about 50 private planners, has a standard charge.  We are trying to create competition in the market by adding new planners and we are running a course for new planners from 18 to 20 February.  There are already 240 planning agencies, plus Teagasc, which is supplying 200 offices.  We have competition between the agencies and that will improve with the introduction of new planners.  This should ensure that charges for plans are kept at a reasonable level. It is up to farmers to decide the level of charges with their planners.  If a farmer is not happy with the level of charge I suggest he seek the advice of an alternative planner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister be satisfied that he should not become involved?  In the interests of the success of the REP scheme, <Col N="702" /> should prices not be consistent and standard throughout the country?  Is he satisfied that the relationship between private planners, his Department officials and Teagasc is harmonious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is a standard charge; Teagasc charges about £300 and private planners charge in the region of £500 to £600 plus a fee per hectare.  Farmers have a choice between these different planners.  There is a good relationship between my Department and the private planners, they operate successfully together.  As regards the relationship between Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants' Association, I understand that association is to complain to the Competition Authority that Teagasc is using its subsidised position to illegal advantage.  Our Department will not get involved in the dispute but apparently the complaint will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will an input from an environmental scientist be required for REP applications from within NHAs and SPAs?  If it is, there will be a substantial cost, so is it the intention of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to subsidise or pay the full cost of the consultant? Can the Minister inform us when the second half of the first REP scheme payment will be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the subject of a later question but I will respond.  A system on REP scheme planning for NHAs has been agreed with the farming organisations.  Certain standards and procedures must be complied with by farmers in NHAs who are using the REP scheme.  It will depend on the plan submitted by the planner and they will not need the services of a scientist.  I think that any fears which exist are unfounded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>After extensive negotiations and discussions between my Department, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the farming organisations, agreement was reached and announced last October and it is acceptable to farmers.  Farmers will have to farm in an approved fashion within NHAs.  The plan will be the normal one drawn up by the planner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  A £10 top-up for REP schemes has been proposed but has not yet been agreed.  In those areas outside SACs where farmers will not be in the REP scheme, discussions are ongoing about compensation based on headage and premia payments.  There is no delay in REP scheme payments.  We have already paid out £100 million and the scheme is now an important part of the income of farming communities and rural areas.  The scheme is working well at the moment, over 23,000 first applicants have been approved and paid and over £100 million has been paid out.  This is possibly one of the best schemes ever introduced in Ireland and it has <Col N="703" /> been handled efficiently by our Department and all involved.</P>

      <P>No doubt Deputy Ring is aware of the arrangement reached in January 1996 whereby special provision was made for people to reduce their stocking levels in commonages, especially where there was agreement between the various owners. This has worked quite successfully in some areas.  In other areas there has not been a great take-up.  It has been agreed by the Commission. There is a destocking incentive for farmers with attractive compensation and I hope there will be a greater take-up in the future.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Walsh, I have always been magnanimous in politics and will readily recognise the contribution of any politician. I accept that this is a creative scheme which arose from the reforms of 1992.  However, we deserve some of the credit for driving this scheme and popularising it, despite the fact that Fianna Fáil tried to pour as much cold water on it as possible when they went into Opposition.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a report of the Court of Auditors on the clearance of the EAGGF Guarantee accounts for 1992 and certain expenditure for 1993.  The report examines how the Commission audited the expenditure declared by member states and reached the clearance decision.  The court did not visit Ireland in the course of its work.</P>
      <P>In its report the court reported on difficulties which the Commission had in examining export refund files in two audit visits and commented that in a further mission in October 1994 the Commission noted some improvements.  The Commission reply, which is included in the report, states that the improvements required of the Irish authorities in its supporting documents and files were verified in the October 1994 visit, and that the Commission were satisfied that the records permitted an audit to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation as far as my Department is concerned is that difficulties arose because there were not sufficient resources and computerisation in place to manage a large volume of complicated and interrelated transactions in a timely way. Laborious and detailed cross-referencing was required.  A task force was put in place at the end of 1993 to deal with the more complicated work, the recording arrangements were overhauled and a programme of computerisation was advanced. <Col N="705" /> The Commission was briefed on the setting up of the task force and on the progressive improvements and the problems have not recurred.  The Commission's understanding that the upgrading of this area would take time was greatly appreciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 20, 24, 52 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a total sugar quota of 200,200 tonnes which is administered by the Greencore Group, the sole manufacturer of sugar in the country.  Under the quota arrangements Irish Sugar plc., a subsidiary of the group, places contracts with farmers to deliver agreed tonnages of sugar beet.  In purchasing the beet, the company is required to pay at least the minimum price specified by the EU, which is set annually.  Payment above this is a matter for negotiation between the company and the growers' organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, I recently met representatives of both the beet growers and Irish Sugar.  I understand that the price agreed in 1996 was above the minimum prescribed price and compares favourably <Col N="706" /> with the price paid in competitor member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's answer that he is aware of the grave difficulties between the beet growers and the company, and that a &ldquo;grow no beet&rdquo; strike is more imminent every day.  Does the Minister agree that this would be a disaster for the economy and the 25,000 people involved in beet growing?  What was the result of his meeting with the growers and the company?  What are his proposals?  Does he intend to intervene in this substantial dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties between the growers and Greencore are not new and relations have probably deteriorated.  The growers' representatives have stated that their disquiet relates to the substantially increased profits of Greencore. They say that because of technological developments the company can now achieve higher sugar extraction rates.  The company extracts sugar from tops, but excludes tops in declaring the weight of delivered beet, and the growers are looking for extra compensation for these factors.</P>
      <P>I understand that there was a conference in Cork on 23 January where these points were forcefully made to the managing director of Irish Sugar.  The company position is that its profitability has increased because of substantial investment in plant and productivity.  It says it has a requirement for reinvestment to secure the future viability of the industry, that it must compete with UK and French companies and that it must remain competitive.  The role of the Government is quite clear.  It is no longer a shareholder of Irish Sugar.  This is, therefore, a matter for free collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>I have also raised questions about rumours and disquiet because of the level of subletting of quota.  This is not allowable, and quite intricate arrangements seem to be in place.  I am anxious that a system be put in place for a reserve to allocate that.  My job as Minister is to ensure that the sugar company complies with EU regulations.  I do not, therefore, have a legal case to oblige the Irish Sugar company to pay more, but I would like to see this matter resolved in an amicable way.</P>

      <P>The golden share is vested in the Government, in the Minister's department. That is part of the problem where the quota is <Col N="707" /> not transferable.  If the golden share is vested in the Department, why should it not shed that responsibility and give it back to the growers to whom it lawfully belongs?</P>
      <P>There are major problems as a result of two devaluations in the green pound in recent months in respect of which farmers have not, to date, been compensated.  If the Government can find £100 million to compensate farmers in respect of all other commodities, including sugar beet, the row with the sugar company and Greencore will be put to bed, but not until then.  The Minister is aware that beet prices dropped substantially this year, and the new harvest will be in serious difficulty because of the revaluation.  Beet growing will become practically uneconomic if there is not an adjustment in the price.</P>

That sum is currently in the process of being negotiated by my officials. Obviously, given the difficulties of the beef sector, I am looking at the question of further resources being made available, along with the BSE compensation, as I am very anxious to put together a comprehensive package of compensation based on the development of prices over the coming months.  However, there will be no unnecessary delay and, of course, those beet growers will have their proper entitlement back dated.  There was no question of chickening out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to beet tops, from which I assure him sugar has always been extracted.  I agree with him there is now a greater extraction rate because of technology. Does he agree that some payment should be made to farmers for sugar extracted from the tops?  No such payment is being made.  Does the <Col N="708" /> Minister accept he has a legal right and obligation to ensure farmers are paid for that commodity?</P>
      <P>In case the impression is given that this is greed on the part of farmers because they see a company making more money and want to get a slice of the action, that is not the case.  Has the Minister been told that the costs of sugar beet production have increased substantially?  Farmers feel that if profits increase they should, at least, have their costs covered, which is why they are asking for an increased payment.  I accept what the Minister said about how there are people at the moment seeking contracts.  What are his concerns in relation to the 25,000 people involved in the industry?</P>

      <P>In 1994 Greencore's pre tax operating profit was £48.6 million and after tax it was £39.6 million.  The sugar activity accounted for more than half of that amount.  During the debates in this House when the sugar company was privatised into Greencore &mdash; a decision which we did not oppose &mdash; the concept of a golden share was not there to act as an arbiter on price.</P>

      <P>None of my predecessors, including Deputy Joe Walsh and Deputy O'Kennedy, who have operated since it was privatised have seen their role as arbitrating on price.  Essentially, we have no statutory function in that regard.  The role of the golden share is in relation to an overseas acquisition and the mobility of the sugar quota out of the country.  The golden share is to protect the national sugar quota of A, B and C sugar.  However, the sugar quota is managed by Irish Sugar, not by me.  I want to make that clear. <Col N="709" /> The situation is similar to that in other member states.</P>

      <P>The price of sugar to the confectionery industry and consumers is dictated by the EU sugar regime rather than by the profitability of Irish Sugar.  There is no doubt that we have a strictly protected and artificial regime to protect the sugar production industry in Europe.  In that regard, there is no competitive disadvantage between the price of Irish sugar relative to that of the UK or France.</P>
      <P>However, there is no doubt that the world price of sugar is a great deal lower.  It is the consistent policy of the Irish and other Governments to restrict imports to the EU of sugar cane and other produce, simply because of the economic and social factors involved in supporting our indigenous industries.  That is a deliberate political choice, but is a matter of Europe versus the world rather than variations on sugar prices within the EU.  We are competitive within the EU.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16a:</P>
      <P>In page 27, to delete lines 42 to 47 and in page 18 to delete lines 1 to 15 and to substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) For the purposes of ensuring the availability <Col N="711" /> of nurses to hospitals and teachers to primary schools which are under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values, and in order to maintain the religious ethos of the hospitals or primary schools, the prohibition of discrimination in subsection (1), in so far as it relates to discrimination on the religion ground, shall not apply in respect of &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the nomination of persons for admission to the School of Nursing pursuant to clause 24(4)(a) or (c) of the Adelaide Hospital Charter as substituted by paragraph 5(s) of the Health Act, 1970 (Section 76) (Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital) Order, 1996, or</P>
    <P>(b) places in a vocational training course specified in an order made under subsection (5).</P>
    <P>(5) Where an educational or training body applies to the Minister for health, in the case of hospitals, or to the Minister of Education, in the case of primary schools, for an order permitting the body concerned to reserve places in a vocational training course offered by the body, the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education, as the case may be, may, with the consent of the Minister, by order allow the body to reserve places in such numbers as seem reasonably necessary to the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education, as the case may be, to meet the purposes set out in subsection (4).</P>
    <P>(6) Without prejudice to section 3(1), an order under subsection (5) may be revoked by a further order made by the Minister for Health, or the Minister for Education, as the case may be, with the like consent; but any such revocation order shall contain transitional provisions safeguarding any person who, in reserving places on such a vocational training course as is referred to in that subsection, took advantage of the provision made by the order being revoked.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a textual amendment, for purposes of clarity, to No. 16a as circulated.  I have discussed the matter with my colleagues and they are agreeable to it.  I move the following amendment to amendment No. 16a:</P>
    <P>To delete paragraph (6) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>(6) Without prejudice to section 3(1), an order under subsection (5) may be revoked by a further order made by the Minister for Health, or the Minister for Education, as the case may be, with the like consent; but any such revocation order shall contain transitional provisions safeguarding any person who took <Col N="712" /> advantage of the effect of the order when it was in force.</P>
    <P>As I explained extensively at the select committee, a provision along the lines of section 12(4), (5) and (6) is considered necessary to accommodate the needs of minority denominations in particular and the successful launch of the Tallaght Hospital.  In the circumstances I must oppose amendment No. 17.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16a, in its new form, arises following the further consideration which has taken place on section 37(1).  I agreed to re-examine the text of section 37(1) and in doing so I held extensive consultations with a comprehensively wide range of interests.  In the course of those consultations it was put to me that the interests of minority denominations in particular, would be best served if a similar arrangement with regard to discrimination on the religion ground as regards reservation of places in the school of nursing could also be applied in respect of reservation of places on a training course in a college established for the purpose of training teachers for primary schools.</P>
    <P>It was also represented to me that since section 12 was published last July, the Minister for Health has introduced the Health Act, 1970 (Section 76) (Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital) Order, 1996.  This order gives effect to the charter negotiated and agreed which facilitates the establishment of the new Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>The relevant authorities associated with the charter have indicated that explicit reference to the order in this Bill is warranted if the agreed elements of the charter which protect religious ethos are to be safeguarded.  This exclusion is intended to respond to this concern and ensure that the successful evolution of the new hospital is not compromised.  This amendment seeks to respond to the various representations.  It ensures stringent controls will continue to be applied in the application of any special arrangement of this nature.  In particular it involves the participation of both Houses of the Oireachtas where an order is made in any specific case.  I am satisfied that such a provision will ensure that minority denomination interests in this respect will be appropriately protected.</P>
    <P>In regard to Government amendment No. 33, Deputies will recall that I undertook to give early notice of any amendment I might bring forward on Report Stage on section 37(1).  My proposed revision of this provision is the culmination of a long process of consultation which I have undertaken with a wide variety of interests and it was duly published on 29 January 1997 to facilitate Deputies.  The purpose of this provision is to recognise that there is an appropriate balance to be found between the rights of denominations and those who use and work within their establishments.</P>
    <P>From the outset I have sought to achieve this balance of rights and have taken the initiative of <Col N="713" /> seeking a broad range of views on the Bill to determine whether and how the text might be improved.  As well as examining a large number of submissions and representations, I and my officials had a meeting with IBEC and ICTU, the three teacher unions &mdash; INTO, ASTI and TUI &mdash; representatives of the Catholic and Church of Ireland hierarchies, CORI, the Secondary School Council of Governors, the National Parents Council primary, as well as a wide range of other bodies.  In the light of all these consultations as well as extensive deliberations with colleagues and with the Attorney General I have obtained Government agreement to a new draft of section 37(1).  The revised version represents a reasonable and measured balance between the very different views on this most complex and sensitive issue.</P>
    <P>This amendment benefits considerably from the constructive submissions made by both teachers and the churches.  It is not a victory for one side over the other but rather the Government's best effort to find the right balance which protects the legitimate interests of both.  In so far as it gives discretion and flexibility to denominational bodies, it does so in order to support development of greater pluralism in Irish society and afford due respect for the rights of minorities in this State.  However, this discretion is made subject to certain clear criteria and is reviewable by an independent director of equality investigations.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage we did not take these two sections together and I wonder why they are amalgamated for the purpose of discussion today.  When we discussed on Committee Stage the section dealing with Tallaght Hospital I expressed my reservations about the section.  I listened very carefully to the arguments the Minister put forward at that time.  He said he had sought to apply a tight control on the operations of the Act.  I accept he has tried to arrive at an amendment in relation to Tallaght Hospital, the availability of nurses to hospitals and teachers to primary schools which are under the direction or control of a body established for a religious purpose. I accept that under amendment No. 16a he has tried to reach a compromise that would ensure the tightest controls possible are applied. He said it would be tightly controlled, I accepted that at the time and said I looked forward to the Report Stage amendment.  I do not have a problem with the proposal in amendment No. 16a as it is important to respect legislation already in place.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy that we are dealing with section 37 at this stage and I would like to know the reason for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Keogh, I do not have a problem with amendment No. 16a.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks all Deputies have received correspondence on the provisions in section 37(1). We have excellent schools and it is important that <Col N="714" /> they maintain their traditions and ethos.  This section is broadly designed to achieve this.  It is important to remember that individual freedom does not imply one can go around willy-nilly and have one's way in everything regardless of its effects on society.  It does not mean that when we talk about reform we should throw the baby out with the bath water.  This country has accumulated great treasures in terms of tradition and values over the centuries.  These are largely based on the basic precepts of highly respected religions and we would be very foolish to be so arrogant as to readily discard them.</P>
    <P>On 21 November last year Deputy Kathleen Lynch told the Select Committee that her party, Democratic Left, was not at all happy with some aspects of the Bill.  One of her specific reservations related to section 37(1).  She said she proposed to table an amendment on Report Stage which would seek to delete section 37(1).  She claimed she spoke on behalf of her party.  The Minister told the committee that the Government, which includes Democratic Left, had agreed unanimously on the wording of the Bill. The Minister rightly queried Deputy Lynch's position and stated &ldquo;it was puzzling in the extreme&rdquo;.  I could not agree more with him.  My sympathies in this matter lie entirely with the Minister.  It appears Democratic Left decided as far back as last November to go into an election mode and to start its campaign by trying to create problems between it and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Section 37 is an important part of the Bill.  The word &ldquo;pluralism&rdquo; is bandied about a great deal nowadays.  One definition of pluralism is the existence in a society of groups having distinctive ethnic origin, cultural forms, religions etc.  Most people would agree we must do everything in our power to enable these groups to maintain their chosen ethos to the greatest extent possible so long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others.  It appears Democratic Left wishes to deprive all these groups and individuals of the rights enshrined in the Constitution.  This would be an attack on the fundamentals of pluralism.</P>
    <P>The original wording of the section was stark, to say the least, and I understand why many people objected to it.  It seemed to justify the concept of discrimination which is defined as &ldquo;unfair treatment&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;positive discrimination&rdquo; might have been a wiser choice.  The Minister's amendment is an improvement but I had difficulty at first glance with the inclusion of the words &ldquo;prospective employee&rdquo;.  However, I assume this means that a prospective employer, having being satisfied that the candidate is properly qualified for the job on offer, has the right to point out to the candidate that he or she must not go outside the bounds of the job or seek to undermine the religious ethos of that institution. If the Minister can satisfy me on the meaning of the wording I will have no hesitation in supporting it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the amendment circulated by the INTO which proposes to <Col N="715" /> broaden section 37 to include the groups it believes will be discriminated against.  Will the Minister give his views on this amendment and reassure the INTO that these groups are already adequately covered in the Bill?  In many areas individuals on a board of management may have reason to object to the appointment of a person who belongs to one of the groups referred to in the INTO amendment.  Will the Minister outline the protections available for the groups referred to in the INTO amendment and what is meant by &ldquo;prospective employee&rdquo;?  My understanding is that it relates to discrimination before an interview. This would be the same as a garda arresting a person immediately he leaves his house because he thinks he may rob a bank.  It may be possible for people to be discriminated against at an early stage because of their beliefs.  This section has given rise to a great deal of debate in recent weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a rather extraordinary Committee Stage debate on this matter during which Deputy Lynch read out a prepared script, which is unusual on Committee Stage, to the effect that Democratic Left would not support section 37 as it stood.  Those of us who had worked on the Bill and put down amendments were taken aback.  A question was raised as to the Government's collective responsibility for the Bill, but the Minister has come back subsequently with a different amendment.  I am not too unhappy with the Minister's amendment because the original amendment I tabled on Committee Stage called for the deletion of the most objectionable clause which stated &ldquo;... or is reasonable in order to avoid offending the religious sensitivities of its members or clients&rdquo;.  I regarded that as most offensive and felt the most reasonable approach to take was to delete it.</P>
      <P>The different ethos in relation to Tallaght Hospital has already been mentioned.  Much debate has taken place on maintaining the ethos of particular denominations within schools and it is reasonable for parents and students of a school which they understand to have a certain ethos to expect that to be maintained.  Did the Minister get all round agreement on this issue?  I am aware the Church of Ireland is anxious that amending legislation would reflect its concerns so that the ethos and traditions of its schools are preserved. It says anything less is unacceptable.  The Church of Ireland is obviously not totally happy with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to respect the ethos of a school. It was unreasonable to have the prospect of an individual being discriminated against simply because somebody else's religious sensitivities might be offended.  If we are to have a pluralist State, we must protect the rights of individuals; we do not want the spectre of the Eileen Flynn case coming back to haunt us.  In respecting the ethos of a school we must ensure that individual teachers do not fear they will be discriminated <Col N="716" /> against on minor grounds, as many people see it. It is not appropriate that the private lives of teachers who are supporting the ethos of their schools be put under scrutiny.  That is not fair and it should not have been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that his amendment meets the needs of the many disparate groups?  It is obvious from newspaper reports that the teachers' unions are divided on the compromise put forward by the Minister.  I do not know about the Catholic Church but the Church of Ireland does not appear to be too happy with it.  Is the Minister confident it will have the support of all these groups?  I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister because one would need to have the wisdom of Solomon to adopt the right approach on this issue, but a reasonable balance must be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the views of the Minister's colleagues in Democratic Left on this matter.  The least they will say is that an amendment was made but I cannot understand the reason well established procedures in the House were not adhered to and why we did not have sight of its members' amendments to comment on them more fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I spoke in detail on Second Stage and, like many other Members who contributed to that debate, I referred to the difficulties that might arise in regard to the implementation of section 37(1) as originally drafted.  I understood and supported the intention of the Minister to provide legitimate protection against discrimination in employment while respecting the traditions and ethos of the various State institutions.</P>
      <P>The Minister acted on the best advice available to him but he told us on Second Stage that he would listen to suggested wordings for the section.  He asked me privately about my suggested wording and I had to admit that while I could identify the shortcomings in the proposed section 37(1), it was more difficult to balance the various legitimate interests in any replacement wording.  I acknowledge the Minister's openness in trying to improve the wording of the section.  I am aware the Minister consulted many groups in the preparation of the Bill and following Second Stage debate.  His proposed amendment to section 37(1) is the best attempt we can make to balance the legitimate interests to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was puzzled by the suggestion in the original section 37(1) that nothing in this Part or Part II applies to discrimination by religious, educational or medical institutions if the discrimination is on grounds other than gender, age or disability.  I did not see the logic in excluding those while including the other grounds.  It is more appropriate to suggest, as the Minister does in the revised section 37(1), a more positive way of examining and addressing those concerns.  We are accepting the ethos of religious institutions in a positive way <Col N="717" /> while acknowledging the rights of individual employees.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of the INTO in relation to this matter and I would like to hear the Minister's response.  From my discussions with INTO members at local level I believe they would be happy with a provision prohibiting the employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution in question.  I understand that is what the Minister has proposed.  The INTO members conceded the right of schools in this case to promote and maintain a religious or nonreligious multi-denominational ethos as the case may be.  They were prepared to concede that employees, such as teachers, should not deliberately undermine that ethos and this amendment is the most reasonable way to address that concern.</P>
    <P>I share the puzzlement of Deputies McDaid and Keogh at the interventions of my colleague, Deputy Lynch, on Committee Stage.  Deputies Woods, Eric Byrne, Keogh, myself and others expressed reservations about section 37(1) as drafted.  I had no reason to believe &mdash; I was subsequently proved right &mdash; the Minister would not note the concerns expressed.  He was open to suggestions and positive proposals on the divorce and occupiers' liability legislation.  To go on a solo run and threaten to put down an amendment, which did not materialise, was not the way to deal with the matter.  I can understand why such a threat might be necessary in the case of some Ministers, but not in the case of this Minister and this legislation.  However, the matter got newspaper headlines and focused attention on the Bill. I wonder if Deputy Lynch will engage in similar threats on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his efforts and hope he addresses the concerns raised by the INTO. I am satisfied he has gone as far as possible to accommodate the concerns of the Church of Ireland Board of Education, Catholic primary school managers and other organisations.  This amendment will enhance considerably the effectiveness of the legislation.</P>
    <P>None of these amendments will impinge on existing rights.  I am confident this section, along with others, will allow teachers and other employees to vindicate rights that may have been implied but not explicit in law.  It will provide an accessible avenue, through the equality investigations officer, for cases of discrimination to be investigated and redressed without going to court. The Bill will enhance protection against discrimination for all people in employment.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy McDaid on his promotion.  This is probably one of the toughest assignments a Member has been given on his or her first day in a new position.  It is a huge tome of legislation, the most comprehensive and far reaching introduced in the past 20 or 30 years.  It will take us well into the next century and ensure workers have a degree of protection that is afforded to very few.

      <P>Deputy Gallagher made an interesting contribution.  Irrespective of what he says, or how glowingly he puts it, the Minister and those close to him do not believe they are ready for sainthood yet.  While the Minister has the qualities not only of a great man but a great Minister, they do not qualify him for sainthood.</P>
      <P>Despite what Deputy Gallagher might believe, I did not go on a solo run.  I love the way some people hear what they want to hear or have read to them what they like to hear.  It is like a bishop being told he will not see a hungry day.  The Deputy should read the newspapers.  We were in negotiations and our concerns had been expressed.  I am one of the few Members who believes in a strong, powerful and adequately equipped Opposition.  The recent changes to the Front Bench will ensure that we have better opposition in the future.  In a democracy Government and Opposition must operate effectively. Unfortunately, the Opposition did not function at all on this issue and we had to take on its role.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment is excellent because it limits the scope to the protection of the religious ethos.  It is a question of balance. None of us would deny that religious institutions have served us well, but we are discussing legislation to protect workers.  A proper balance must be struck.  This may not be a perfect solution, but there is never a perfect problem. Democratic Left said it would be forced to table an amendment if one was not tabled by the Opposition.  The Minister co-operated, an amendment was agreed and, while it may not be a perfect solution, we are satisfied with it.  Consequently, it was not necessary for us to table an amendment.  We are not talking about an amendment which states that it will have to be determined that it is &ldquo;reasonable and necessary&rdquo; to protect the ethos of a school.  The term &ldquo;reasonable and necessary&rdquo; is difficult to prove.  The provision applies to a person who actively undermines the ethos.  It does not apply to one's private life.</P>
      <P>The section dealing with offending the sensitivities of clients has been deleted.  As originally drafted, section 16 dealt with unacceptable sexual behaviour which, depending on the person involved, could mean anything.  Such behaviour is now illegal.</P>
      <P>This Government is about negotiation.  It is made up of three parties that do not have a similar ideological outlook on all issues. However, the Government works well.  It deals with the concerns of its backbenchers and, depending on the Minister, with the concerns of other parties.</P>
      <P>This Bill, especially sections 16 and 37, proves the Government is prepared to listen and negotiate. We have reached a compromise.  It is rich for the Opposition to blame those who brought about these changes when it did not have the courage to propose them.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister.  When we are long gone from politics the Bill will stand as a testimony to the Government's determination to protect workers.  It is a huge Bill, and the Minister has taken it through the House very well.</P>

      <P>I supported this section in the original Bill and to that extent I am disappointed changes have been made, although I accept the Minister had a very difficult job and was under pressure from all sides.  By and large, he has not done a bad job in producing this compromise. Perhaps he would provide more detail on the views of the different churches.  Many of the minority churches are more concerned with this legislation than the majority church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said her party was not on a solo run when it originally raised this issue.  If so, and her party had signalled its unease, then the Minister must have been on a solo run, otherwise he was playing poker with the issue.  We have heard <Col N="720" /> much over the past two years about a cohesive, strong Government which works together and speaks with one voice.  However, if what Deputy Lynch said is correct then somebody's bluff was being called.  In this respect, the Minister should recall what happened in November 1994 when somebody tried to call somebody else's bluff.  It could end up in a mess.</P>
    <P>While the differences may be acceptable, I am disappointed the wording dealing with the religious sensitivities of members or clients has been removed.  By my definition, &ldquo;the clients&rdquo; mean parents.  I am surprised that those Deputies who are advocates for parents in other education debates appear to take a different view on this issue.  Presumably the Minister has teased out this aspect with his colleague, the Minister for Education, in connection with the Education Bill. Does the new wording pass the test of that Bill?</P>
    <P>The controversy over this section arose on the issue of rights.  It is important that the rights and dignity of teachers be guaranteed.  Everybody, including the churches, is agreed on this.  Similarly, it is important that communities can avail of key services, the most important being medical and educational, which are delivered according to the ethos shared by their members.  This is why the rights of parents are central to this section.</P>
    <P>Rights sometimes clash.  It could be argued that a teacher's right to a private life may be in conflict with the expectation of the school and by extension the parents served by the school and its ethos.  For example, an affair between a teacher and a senior student could cause conflict in this area.  There are no easy solutions.  While it may be believed that a person's private life should not be a consideration with regard to promotion it would in this instance be an issue of concern to the school, especially to parents.  They would expect the school authorities to take action on such matters.</P>
    <P>How are conflicts of rights resolved?  There must be a test of reasonableness when disputes like this arise.  The Minister has provided for an appeals system, which is the guarantee teachers and other workers require.  What test must be applied by the appeals mechanism?  According to the new wording for section 37(1)(a), provided by amendment No. 33, more favourable treatment to maintain the religious ethos must be on the religion ground.  Will the Minister clarify that this refers to the religious ethos of the school, rather than the religion of the teacher?  If it referred to the individual's religion, rather than the religious ethos of the school the focus would be too narrow.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 also stipulates that, under section 37(1)(b), the action of the school must be &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; to prevent the undermining of the ethos.  Notwithstanding the negotiations the Minister undertook, this carries a real threat of discrimination against the rights of parents, especially those whose children attend a school with a strong religious ethos.  Much depends on the definition of the words &ldquo;reasonably necesary&rdquo;. <Col N="721" /> It could be construed as being close to essential.  This would make it too onerous on a school to prove, in an atmosphere where any kind of values based choice may be suspect, that its action was &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason for the action must be to prevent the undermining of the ethos.  How would the school prove that?  Would it have to show that the teacher would undermine the ethos as well as show that its action would prevent the undermining? These are very difficult to prove.  The burden of proof is on the school manager and the parents to show their action is necessary to defend the ethos.  More simple wording, such as taking action which is reasonable to maintain the ethos, might be better because it would uphold the concept of reasonableness while defending the rights of parents and schools to uphold their ethos and give the children the benefit of it.  I appreciate the Minister has done his best.  It was difficult, both in Government and the wider community, to get everybody on board and keep them happy. However, I am disappointed the Minister has, to some extent, bent under pressure.</P>

      <P>This is important legislation for which we have waited a long time.  It is most welcome and credit is due to the Minister for his work and his efforts to deal with the different issues, particularly those relating to the amendments. It would be a shame if the Bill was undermined by a misunderstanding of the intention of the section.  Will the Minister clarify how he considers it will work in practice?  What type of behaviour could be seen as undermining the ethos?  Will the Minister outline the criteria under which that will be judged and the other factors which will influence it?  The unfair dismissals provisions will continue to apply.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides greater protection to all workers and it is ironic that teachers and other groups are anxious that their rights may have less protection under the legislation.  Will the Minister comment on that fear?  It may involve a misunderstanding of how the section will apply and how it could be interpreted.  The trust of the Bill is to give more protection to workers in many areas and, given the Minister's efforts to balance the rights involved, it may help if the section is clarified. There are concerns that, for example, a teacher who is a single parent may be more vulnerable under the legislation.  I ask the Minister to clarify that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is complex and even with everybody's best intentions, it is not easy to find a wording which will satisfy all the interests.  I was happy with the Minister's original wording in section 37 but I recognise the pressures to which he was subjected.  He acknowledged those pressures when he described Deputy Lynch's statements as puzzling in the extreme.  The Minister told the committee there was unanimity in Government about the original wording.  His presumption that unanimity existed must have been <Col N="722" /> based on a belief that full examination and consultation had taken place in relation to what the Government considered proper and correct and a recognition that the best possible provision had been proposed.  I maintain that the Minister initially came up with a most acceptable form of wording in a most difficult and complex position. I spoke to the Minister and I expressed my personal attitude by making that point to him.</P>
      <P>However, it appears to people who were satisfied with the original wording that the change occurred because of the attitude of an individual or a small party in Government and that it was forced on the Minister for political reasons which are not necessarily the best in the circumstances. I do not intend to be disrespectful but the change places the Minister in a discredited position.  This is the view of people who supported the original wording and who recognise that the Minister had to yield to the 1 per cent reflected by Democratic Left, formerly the Workers' Party.  I suppose little changed except the name.</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged that explanations and definitions must be given to the House about the change.  The words &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; are contained in the amended section but what is considered reasonable and necessary must be established. Will the Minister illustrate the circumstances in which he would consider something is reasonably necessary?  I envisage many problems in this area, whether it involves teachers or people seeking services in hospitals.  For example, a board of management in a school may have a view on what is right and necessary.  This also applies to parents and it has been acknowledged that they have a special right in the educational area as the primary educators.  In addition, there are different views in different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>One view may be held in Dublin and the other cities but there may be views in rural Ireland which may not necessarily be similar or compatible. It is difficult to come to terms with different social attitudes because a matter may be acceptable in one location but unacceptable in another. There were examples of this problem in the past. I do not consider it proper that a person who is not married should be considered unsuitable because they have a child.  People should be entitled to personal private lives unless they import them into their employment and work from that position.  A difficulty arises if they introduce an ethos into their work which conflicts with what is intended as a necessary and primary basis for the type of education offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must provide examples of what he has in mind in relation to the new wording.  In so far as he can, he must provide the fullest possible definition of &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; because I envisage a broad basis for argument, misunderstanding and conflict.  This must be avoided in schools, between schools and parents and between strong individuals who are members of management boards and who may have a severe or less severe attitude.  The Minister moved from <Col N="723" /> the original position, which is regrettable, for reasons that are not the best, that is, for political reasons.  He was put under obvious pressure by Democratic Left and in the circumstances he should justify the changes made.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> There are two views on this matter.  I defend the religious ethos of schools, particularly since I was a teacher &mdash; I am not as concerned about hospitals although that is an important issue for them too.  Schools are entitled to make decisions in favour of their own supporters.  For example, if a Muslim school receives applications from Roman Catholics, Church of Ireland people and Muslims, it would be reasonable to expect that it would favour a person of its own faith.  That is very much in keeping with what I regard as the ordinary person's view.</P>
      <P>Teachers who contacted me are very concerned that extreme lines may be taken on grounds of religious ethos, that if a person does not practice the faith according to high standards, the board of management or chairperson may ask that person to resign.  I spent more than 32 years teaching and never witnessed an unreasonable attitude on the part of managers towards teachers.  Sometimes they were over-lenient with people who had characteristics that were not suitable for teaching. It is a sign of the times that people are not concerned about bishops or priests but about right wing Catholics who take a strict line on what they believe is the standard which teachers should meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are encouraging to teachers in that they do not place unreasonable demands on them &mdash; they will not have to go around with halos.  The religious ethos may be undermined not by a teacher not attending Mass on Sunday but by deliberately preaching that which is in direct conflict with the religion.  To preach, for example, in the Roman Catholic Church that the Pope is a fool or that the Blessed Virgin never existed would undermine the Catholic ethos. Teachers are human and will never be declared saints by the Church &mdash; I know many great teachers and I do not wish to run them down &mdash; but they are genuinely concerned that they may <Col N="724" /> be treated badly simply because somebody decides they are not as good as they should be.</P>
    <P>In these amendments the Minister has reached a compromise.  The religious ethos is preserved and schools are defended.  The compromise reached preserves the ethos of schools while assuring teachers that they do not have to be angels. The Minister has done as good a job as possible in dealing with this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed on this particularly difficult section.  I appreciate their thoughtful and analytical comments on such a complex matter.  Having listened to the debate, I accept there is broad support in the House for the amended provision.  I wish to make a preliminary point which was referred to by Deputies Frances Fitzgerald, Gallagher and others. Workers and prospective workers have various rights under legislation, such as the Unfair Dismissals Act which provides for the making of claims for judicial review in the event of unfairness and so on.  This Bill in no way amends, revokes or repeals existing remedies for workers under legislation.  It gives additional rights to a broad range of people in certain categories &mdash; the nine categories are listed in section 6 &mdash; for example, people with disabilities and people who are discriminated against on grounds of race, religion and so on.  The Bill does not take away existing rights, and that should be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDaid spoke about a prospective employee and I am glad he mentioned that point because it warrants clarification.  The Bill deals with circumstances of employment and covers a person's maintenance in employment, for example, whether a person can be dismissed. That is one aspect of employment it includes.  The second category is whether or not a person would be promoted in their employment and the third category is whether a person would be taken into employment or not.  That is the position of the prospective employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked for an illustration of that position.  It might arise if a vacancy was advertised for a teaching position and a person who applied felt they did not get the job because he <Col N="725" /> or she was black or had a disability.  That is a prospective employee who would have no remedy under existing legislation.  With this Bill, if the person could establish that he or she was discriminated against as a prospective employee because of colour or a disability, a claim could be brought and adjudicated by the independent adjudication system and director of equality investigations being established in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty sought examples of cases that might arise.  That is difficult because the cases and facts of each case are capable of such variation that it would be extremely difficult to categorise specific facts and cases.  The number of possible permutations and combinations there could be is enormous.  That is why, in preparing legislation such as this, one must accept the best norm.  The best that can be taken is reasonableness, which depends on the particular facts that arise in each case.  Virtually all our law works on that basis, such as the law of negligence.</P>
    <P>What is negligence?  It is the aspect of law used more frequently in our courts than any other and it is what a reasonable person would or would not do.  That is determined by the tribunal taking all factors into account.  However, I will assist Deputy Doherty by giving him a case from both extremes but he should bear in mind the huge area in between open to the determination of the tribunal, depending on the facts of each case.</P>
    <P>Part of amendment No. 33 states:</P>
    <P>(a)  it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or a prospective employee over that person where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution;</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind we are not just speaking of teachers but all employees.  Let us consider a Protestant educational institution with large grounds that seeks to employ a gardener.  As it is a Protestant institution they may insist on having a Protestant gardener; a Catholic gardener may apply for the job and be refused because he is Catholic.  The director of equality investigations would have to determine if it is necessary that the gardener be of the same religion as the institution to maintain the religious ethos.  I would think it unlikely that the director would so hold.</P>
    <P>That is one end of the spectrum.  The other end would be a vacancy in a Protestant school for a teaching position that involved teaching the ethics of that religion.  The tribunal would, I think, hold that to maintain the religious ethos it would be necessary that the person be of that religion if the subject to be taught was religion or a connected subject such as morality or ethics.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to amplify the following part of amendment No. 33:</P>
    <P>(b)  it takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The basis is simple and the best law is always simple <Col N="726" /> law.  We accept that denominational education in Ireland is an integral part of our system. There are a small number of non-denominational schools but we are talking about the overwhelming majority of denominational schools.  We accept, therefore, that the religious ethos of these institutions is a key factor.  With this part of the amendment, if an employee is doing something to undermine that ethos, then he or she will not have the protection of the Bill, though the circumstances and all factors would have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty raised an interesting comparison between a school in an urban part of Dublin and one in a rural area of his constituency.  That could also be a factor that the director of equality investigations would take into account, though it would not be the only one.  The nub of the decision is simple and clear: is what is being proposed by the school reasonably necessary to prevent this person from undermining the religious ethos of the school?  That is the ultimate point for the independent director of equality investigations to determine as best he or she can, taking all factors into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh asked if this proposed amendment reasonably met the needs of the various groups.  That is difficult for me to say.  I listened carefully and sympathetically to all representations and this strikes a reasonable and fair balance. The INTO have a position on this and Deputy McDaid referred to an amendment suggested by them.  The INTO are not elected Members of the House and amendments are tabled by Members.  The amendment before the House is structured in such a way as to give a fair balance.  I do not see amendment No. 33 giving victory to one side or the other, nor was it intended to.  It results from my listening carefully to and taking cognisance of all points made to me and striking a fair and reasonable balance that takes account of the employers' and employees positions.</P>
    <P>There is a new procedure here.  The decision is being made by an independent tribunal which will not depend on the decision of one side or the other.  There will be an independent adjudication process and an appeals procedure available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern asked what the test would be.  The test is the one that applies in most aspects of law of this nature &mdash; reasonableness.  What better test can one have?  The converse of reasonableness is unreasonableness, which nobody would advocate.  The test is appropriate, fair and will work reasonably well.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a question about the burden of proof.  The usual procedures would apply as in any other case.  A person who alleges something has to establish it on the balance of probabilities. That is the basis on which the legal system operates and it would operate in that way in regard to this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the understanding and support of Members.</P>

If an institution of the minority religion wants to employ a member of its denomination it may have to let go a person of another denomination who is already employed there.  Will that be regarded as being discriminatory?</P>

It would be open to any person who feels disaffected to go to the director and have the case adjudicated upon on the basis of (a) and (b).  However, it refers to the religious ethos.</P>
      <P>The wording of paragraph (a) in amendment No. 33 states: &ldquo;it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee ... over that person where it is reasonable to do so ...&rdquo;.  In other words, if there was a promotion vacancy the school could give more favourable treatment on the religion ground to an employee. However, if that was challenged they would have to be in a position to establish that giving the promotion was reasonable in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution.  A vacancy for a religion teacher would be an obvious example.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 19, lines 35 and 36, to delete &ldquo;but this subsection is without prejudice to section 35(4)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and, subject to section 35(4), an employer shall do all that is reasonable to accommodate that person's needs, in particular, by allowing or, as the case may require, making provision for, such treatment or facilities or, by providing such treatment or facilities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 19, 29 and 31 arise directly from my commitment to strengthen the Bill's provisions with regard to the employment of people with disabilities.  In the course of the wide range of consultations I had on the definition of disability it was repeatedly mentioned that the Bill should seek to be more proactive in its approach to protecting the positions of persons with disabilities in gaining access to and retaining employment.  I indicated in response to these representations that I would seek to build on the positive approach adopted in section 16(3).</P>
      <P>As a result, I have enshrined in the Bill the concept of reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities.  This is accomplished by the requirement in the amendment to section 16(3) for an employer to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability. While this requirement is subject to the revision of section 35(4), it is suitably reinforced by an amendment to that subsection.</P>
      <P>The obligation placed on the employer to provide this reasonable accommodation is subject to what is reasonable.  A test of undue hardship is therefore applied so that unreasonable demands are not made.  The clear exposition of criteria in section 35(5) against which undue hardship can be assessed is a necessary and valuable protection in the interests of employers and persons with a disability.  I recommend these amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 23, lines 44 to 46, to delete &ldquo;, other than an act which no reasonable person could consider to be sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating to A&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A great deal of concern was expressed about sexual harassment provisions in the original draft of this Bill.  The difficulty was that the Bill introduced new tests of sexual harassment despite the fact there is well established <i>juris prudence</i> and exemplary practices by employers and unions in Irish workplaces with codes of practice.  The belief was that we were stepping backwards from the trend already established.  There were difficulties about questioning a complainant's personal lifestyle etc.  The Minister went some way on Committee Stage by deleting subsection 4. The fear is that people will find it more difficult to pursue sexual harassment in the workplace.</P>
      <P>A key feature of sexual harassment is that it is unwanted and unsolicited.  People are not concerned whether it was deliberate or unintended. A person is the victim of sexual harassment if he or she does not want it, did not solicit it and the issue is not whether it is deliberate or unintended. Some people also feel that it is gender based and that one cannot have sexual harassment of a person of one gender on a person of the same gender. The Minister has not quite addressed that. Can that be addressed in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In November I explained at some length why I could not accept Deputy Keogh's amendment to delete the reference to reasonable person tests which have been adopted in this section.  A reasonable person test has been incorporated into this provision as a legal way of providing for an assessment of the offensive, humiliating and intimidating nature of any act from the perspective of a neutral observer.  Some interest groups fear this approach will lead to weakening of protection against sexual harassment in Irish law.  I am satisfied, however, that this is not the case.  In the first instance, the arbitration of what is reasonable will be for the director of equality investigations, the Labour Court or the Circuit Court to decide.  Second, I see no reason for the Labour Court which has already adopted a progressive approach on this matter under the 1977 Act to interpret this explicit provision in a less protective way and employ a less reasonable approach to harassment under this Bill than to date.  In the circumstances I propose the reasonable person test should be retained as drafted and accordingly I request the withdrawal of Deputy Keogh's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already examined the proposal in amendment No. 24 for an additional paragraph in this subsection.  In drawing up this section I sought to catch a wide range of activities as constituting sexual harassment.  In particular, in section 23(2)(c) I provided that any other act or conduct not already mentioned in (a) and (b) which would <Col N="730" /> meet the reasonable test of what is sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating will be encompassed in the Bill.  Deputy Keogh's amendment focuses on exclusively subjective considerations and in the circumstances would not be appropriate as a provision of primary legislation.  I am not in favour of the inclusion of such a provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are grave reservations about this.  The Minister gave a detailed reply on Committee Stage but I want him to reflect on the fears that section 23 may be in breach of the 1996 directive.  I do not know if he must refer to that. I hope this section will be adequate but I remain to be convinced.  The Minister said he has heard of these reservations but feels he is adequately answerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  At every place where 10 or more people are employed, the employer shall have a duty to introduce, publish and effectively communicate to all persons employed and all customers, clients or business contacts of the employer, a Code of Practice or Conduct in relation to sexual harassment to be observed at that place or any other place where the employer carries on business, within six months of the commencement of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil moved this amendment to highlight the issue of a code of practice on sexual harassment in every workplace where ten or more people are employed.  A code of practice or conduct would make it clear that sexual harassment would not be tolerated.  Aer Lingus and the ESB operate such codes of conduct very well.  This Bill sets out to give statutory definition to the term &ldquo;sexual harassment&rdquo; but it does not go far enough.  Sexual harassment in the workplace is so broad that it would require more focused legislation.</P>
      <P>Another deficiency relates to the Employment Equality Act, 1976.  I am referring to the absence of an adequate provision dealing with liability for employers for the acts of their employees which would involve sexual harassment.  A code of practice would be relevant because it would at least give responsibility to the employer.  For example, if two employees have a problem and the employer has a code of practice, neither of them could say the employer was not doing anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A code of practice would put the onus or at least the responsibility on the employer.  If, for example, such a problem arose between two employees and if the employer had a code of practice, neither employee could say the employer was doing nothing about it and thus he <Col N="731" /> would be covered.  Sexual harassment is an abuse of power but it is inadequately dealt with in the Bill and we should make employers more responsible for dealing with it.  I agree with Deputy Keogh that the Bill fails to distinguish between sex and gender.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept this amendment and I await his comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate I agreed to see what the Employment Equality Agency might suggest to ensure the preparation, publication and implementation of the codes of practice on sexual harassment. While the agency has intimated some interest in the display of suitable notices on employment premises, it is not clear that the policing of such a proposal would be its priority in promoting appropriate codes of practice or conduct.  The value of such an approach as a means to bring this issue to the attention of customers and clients is dubious.  The proposal would involve policing across all employment establishments as regards not only display, etc. but also content.  I am satisfied that resources necessary to pursue this policy could be better used by the agency in promoting its nationally developed standards in this area.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the constructive nature of this amendment I am not convinced that it is an appropriate way to provide for better protection against sexual harassment in employment.  I am satisfied that other provisions in the Bill, particularly as regards the admissibility of approved codes of practice in evidence in any proceedings under the Act, will reinforce the adoption of such a code across employment.  The responsibilities of employers in this matter are dealt with under section 15, which covers the vicarious liability of employers and principals for sexual harassment acts of their employees in the circumstances laid down in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe a more definite and pro-active approach could be taken by the Employment Equality Agency in this regard?  This relates to the point behind my earlier amendment, that the onus is on the person who has suffered as a result of harassment rather than on the employer to ensure that the person does not get harassed in the first place.  The difficulty with codes of practice is that we need to be sure they are established and implemented within the workplace.  From that viewpoint the onus should not be on an employee &mdash; usually a woman &mdash; to ensure that colleagues or senior people within the organisation adhere to reasonable standards of behaviour.  We should not <Col N="732" /> always couch these matters in the most negative terms; in other words, we should not wait for an offence to happen before reacting to it.</P>
      <P>How can we ensure that codes of practice drawn up by the EEA become part of the ethos of every organisation and business?  People tend to dismiss the seriousness of this issue.  We are talking about the violation of an individual and although some might think it a minor matter, it is serious and should not be allowed to happen. There should be a facility within the workplace to ensure that all employees and employers are aware of their responsibilities and of the standards of behaviour which are required within the organisation.  How can we ensure this happens? Deputy McDaid's amendment is interesting in that regard because it places a duty on organisations employing ten or more people to introduce, publish and communicate the code of practice. There must be some way to put the onus on employers to ensure the presence of and adherence to codes of practice.  The amendment may not be the best way to go about it but we should be definite in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Keogh's comments and I may be able to clarify the position. Paragraph 4.5 of the national code of practice, which was prepared by the agency and published by my Department in 1994, states:</P>
      <P>Policy statements should be communicated to all employees and others who may impact on the working environment, for example, customers and suppliers.  In particular, they should be (a) provided to all new employees, (b) circulated from time to time among employees, (c) clearly visible in appropriate locations where employees and others will see the statement frequently, for example in canteens or on office notice boards or in changing rooms.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, if a similar text is adopted in the code revised under the Bill, due account can be taken of the failure to follow this recommendation in any relevant complaint before the director of equality investigations, the Labour Court or any other court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Employers' liability in the workplace has not been dealt with adequately.  I accept the Minister has mentioned it in those provisions but if we made clear that a specific code of practice was required we would give better focus to an area which will probably cause more problems in the future.  We should try to be pro-active rather than reactive and if the Minister had accepted my amendment it would have sent that message.  I will therefore press this amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) All employers who employ more than 30 persons shall, by the 31st day of December, 1999, ensure that three per cent of their workforce are persons with disabilities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory.  The only employer which has a quota of 3 per cent of its workforce with disabilities is the Civil Service.  If the Minister accepted the amendment all employers employing more than 30 people would have to ensure by 31 December 1999 that 3 per cent of their workforce were people with disabilities. People often correspond with us on this issue and they say we are not making any effort to deal with it.  I think there is a directive along these lines</P>

Will he give some <Col N="735" /> indication of whether he could implement something akin to what Deputy McDaid suggested?</P>
      <P>The opportunities for people with disabilities to gain employment are limited because employers look at all the negative aspects rather than considering the positive ones.  We need to make a breakthrough in terms of the thinking on this issue.  It is encouraging that the 3 per cent quota has been achieved within the Civil Service but we also need to achieve it in the public service and the private sector, otherwise people with disabilities will continue to be marginalised.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, this proposal seeks to introduce a statutory obligation and would require considerable development as regards application, dispute resolution and so on before it could be brought into operation.  As I indicated previously, such a statutory measure is not appropriate for this Bill.  Such a provision has the objective of promoting the employment of people with disabilities as distinct from protecting such persons from discrimination.</P>
      <P>It is an issue which is clearly before the Government for consideration, following the publication of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  I intend to address this area in that context and I wish to focus in this Bill on addressing protection against discrimination.

      <P>There are long-term unemployed people over the age of 40 years.  The Bill allows for positive discrimination in favour of those over the age of 50 years.  Will the Minister change the limit of 50 years to 40 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was considered in committee I explained that when it came to deciding at what age positive action measures should be targeted I faced the dilemma of setting too high an age threshold which would miss out some age levels which are beginning to experience some age discrimination or set too low an age threshold which would fail to focus the positive action of the age level where discrimination experiences are most acute.  I opted for the higher age threshold of 50.  I do not dispute that workers younger than that can experience age discrimination.  That is why I have legislation like this in the first place and I am sure workers over 40 years of age will benefit greatly as regards protection from age discrimination under the Bill.</P>
      <P>However, I consider that positive action measures should particularly target the most disadvantaged age cohort.  Age prejudices in employment are most acutely felt by over 50 year olds and if positive action measures for them are developed, the contribution of older workers will be increasingly recognised and other workers under 50 years of age will also benefit.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned also that by setting a lower age threshold, as proposed in the amendment, positive action measures might be concentrated at workers under 50 years of age, thus exacerbating the acute discrimination experienced at the higher age level.  The provision does not require an employer to adopt positive action measures in this area.  Such positive action will, therefore, comprise voluntary measures to be adopted by employers and other interests.  In all the circumstances, therefore, I propose to retain the age threshold at 50 so as to focus special attention on the plight of workers who are most disadvantaged by age.</P>

      <P>I do not know if Deputy McDaid wishes to press this amendment.  The point is well made that discrimination on age grounds has become widespread.  In some major organisations one will have to look far and wide to find anyone over the age of 45.  I do not wish to name those organisations but they seem to think those over 45 have no potential.  That is not the attitude employers should adopt.  Slightly older people can bring their experience to bear in the workplace. It is a good reminder for us of the ageism that has crept into society.  I do not know the average age here but I suspect it is nearer 40 or 50 than 30.  I hope most people would think Deputies are well able to fulfil their functions and pursue their legislative and other duties, regardless of age. People are not dispensable after a certain age.</P>

      <P>These amendments are repeats of amendments which were discussed at the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  In regard to amendment No. 37, I indicated on Committee Stage that an amendment similar to this was not necessary but that I would further examine the provision and revert to the question on Report Stage if necessary.  I have re-examined this provision and I confirm that the provision, as drafted, is correct. The exception provided in the subsection clearly applies only to employment in the Defence Forces, in the Garda Síochána and in the prison service. There is a clear statutory basis for delimiting those who are employed in the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.  Civilians employed by the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána are outside the statutory delimitation.  The exclusion of civilian employment, as proposed in the amendment, would not be appropriate as regards the prison service since all members of that service are civilian employees.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 38, I appreciate Deputy Keogh is attempting to narrow the exclusion in respect of age and disability provided for here for the security services.  As I indicated on Committee Stage I am not in a position to acquiesce to this amendment.  The Government agreed to these exclusions based on the concerns of the security services that the essential functions of these occupations require that they be undertaken by able-bodied personnel of an age group which is commensurate with the various demands which arise in a security context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> In the Defence Forces every soldier must possess the physical and psychological attributes necessary for combat.  The Garda Síochána must be similarly equipped to deal with aggression and criminal activity to maintain the internal security of the State.  Similar considerations apply in the prison service.  I am concerned to ensure, through the exclusion in section 37(6), that the requirements of the Bill will not diminish the capability and function of the security forces.  On the basis of these requirements I have agreed to the present exclusion in the Bill.  Accordingly, I must, with regret, continue to oppose these amendments.</P>

    <P>In page 65, line 23, to delete &ldquo;<i>Employment Equality Act, 1996</i>'; and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Maternity Protection Act, 1994, the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, the <i>Employment Equality Act,</i><Col N="742" /><i>1997</i>,' and for the words 'either or both' there shall be substituted 'all or any'; and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following representations made to me by the Employment Equality Agency prior to Committee Stage I undertook to review this section, particularly as regards amendments to the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, dealing with the agency's powers and functions.  I explained that it is my intention to address the functions and powers of the new equality authority more explicitly in the forthcoming equal status legislation.  I intend, therefore, that the provisions of the forthcoming equal status Bill will facilitate the full repeal of the remaining provisions of the 1977 Act not disposed of in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed, however, by the case made by the agency for some amendments to the Bill.  Accordingly, I have acknowledged the agency's role in advising on the recent Maternity Protection and Adoptive Leave Acts by expressly providing a new statutory function in the Bill in relation to both these Acts.  My amendment will confer on the new authority a specific function to advise me on the operation of these Acts and to make proposals to amend them where it considers it necessary.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am responding further to the agency by amending the 1977 Act so that the authority will be empowered to represent a complainant in all types of proceedings under the Bill. In specific cases where an important point of principle in the law is concerned, the agency would wish to have discretion to represent the complainant to the High Court or even the Supreme Court on appeals and points of law. There is some doubt that the provision in the 1997 Act in this regard permits such a step and the text of section 73(6) does not appear to cover this area either.  In the circumstances I have brought forward amendments Nos. 54 and 55 to meet this need and, accordingly, I commend these amendments to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>

      <P>I sincerely thank all the Deputies who contributed to the passage of the Bill, particularly Deputies Woods, McDaid and Keogh.  Listening to some commentators and critics over the past six months I felt insufficient recognition was given at times to the considerable merits of this momentous legislative proposal.  Some critics may have lost sight of the ground-breaking nature of the Bill and some seem to suggest that Ireland should not only adopt a uniquely extensive anti-discrimination law exceeding those in most other countries, but also apply in all areas of discrimination covered by the Bill standards which even surpass those of the advanced countries that have chosen to focus protective provision on a smaller number of discriminatory grounds.  That suggestion is not realistic.</P>
      <P>The vision and ambition of this and the previous Government in striving to provide protection from discrimination on a wide range of grounds must address many complex legal, social and economic considerations.  This Bill balances those various considerations and I make no apology in seeking to bring forward a measure which is sensitive to the many issues involved.  In doing so, the Government has adopted a sophisticated, rights-based model which has been tried and tested in the gender area over the past 20 years both here and in Europe generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complexity of the Bill is because of the extensive scope of the protection involved and the range of constitutional, statutory and international legal considerations which must be taken into account as well as the social, economic and <Col N="744" /> commercial context in which the law must operate. I would have preferred to bring forward a more simple Bill but I would be misleading the House if I suggested there was anything simple about the law in this area.</P>
    <P>Today we have debated in some depth the extremely delicate religious ethos provisions in the Bill.  I appreciate there is a reluctance on the part of some of the interests concerned with this area to welcome the considered text which has now been brought forward.  I am convinced, however, that the interests of all the parties concerned have been fairly treated.  I thank all the interests involved for their constructive contributions to the conclusion of this subject.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the chief Opposition spokespersons for their contributions. I am glad I was in a position to respond to some of their concerns.</P>

I may have been critical of some provisions of the Bill but I have always acknowledged the delicate balance that had to be achieved in some areas. Regardless of whether we agree on the result, everyone will acknowledge it was difficult to arrive at some of those conclusions.  Many people will be satisfied with the Bill and the Minister knows only too well that he cannot please all the people all the time.  I am glad the Minister listened carefully to the arguments put forward on Committee Stage and was prepared to amend the Bill as a result.  The one question he did not answer during our discussions was whether it was Deputy Lynch who succeeded in making the breakthrough on section 37; perhaps we should leave that for another day.</P>
      <P>I was happy to be involved in the debate on the Bill.  I thank the many people who made representations to me.  I know many of them will be glad to see this legislation in place.  I hope it achieves its objective to ensure people will not be discriminated against on the nine grounds proposed by the Minister.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with concern the turmoil at CIE which has resulted in the company's plans for change being in disarray, has led to a threat of an all-out strike at CIE and produced the recent massive disruption to services; condemns the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications for failing to take a hands-on approach to the crisis and for not developing a strategic plan for CIE and the semi-State sector; and calls on the Minister immediately to bring forward policy initiatives and a White Paper to chart a future course for the development of the semi-State sector.</P>

      <P>The crisis looming in CIE is apparent to anyone who uses or is responsible for public transport services.  A few months ago other Members and myself were invited to meet members of Iarnród Éireann management in Buswells Hotel. At that time the writing was on the wall about this dispute.  The proposed cuts were weighing heavily on the minds of members of CIE management and they realised they were heading down a difficult road.  It was obvious from the meeting that as a result of cuts requested by previous Governments serious industrial disputes had taken place.  This Government promised to turn over a new leaf and to properly resource an efficient, trimmed down and modern public transport system, but it reneged on it.  Consequently, we are facing further cutbacks in the public transport system.</P>
      <P>The public transport system must make interest repayments on loans and bear the brunt of being one of the least resourced systems in Europe, if not the world.  In 1995 CIE's overall costs were £463 million, £329 million of which was paid for by money received in fares.  In other words, 71 per cent of the company's costs were paid for by fares, a high percentage in European or world terms.  The Government reneged on its responsibility to provide a properly resourced transport system.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that the sales of new cars has increased?  In 1996 we imported 115,000 new cars which, apart from Government taxes, returned little to the economy.</P>
      <P>The Government is guilty of bad economics and bad treatment of those depending on public transport.  If it is serious about our economic welfare it must take public transport seriously.  I support an efficient public transport system that does not waste money or the time of the people, the company or the Government.  Such a system must be met half way by Government support that ensures people do not have to rely on private transport.  That makes sense from an economic, environmental and human welfare point of view, but the Government is guilty of not delivering on that basic argument.</P>
      <P>Constituents from north Dublin proposed to send more than 4,000 letters about public transport services in their area to the Minister's predecessor, but he refused to accept them on the basis that they were not a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  The Government must change its attitude and become the custodian of the public transport system.  It is not sufficient for members of the Government to talk about supporting public transport as they travel around in large chauffeur driven cars.  They must use the system whenever practicable. Members of this Government have yet to experience that learning curve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider his predecessor's <Col N="747" /> decision and communicate with the commuters in Dublin North who wish to outline the shortcomings in the public transport system, particularly the rail service, in Dublin North?  Transport services have not been developed in conjunction with the increase in population.  The Minister must realise that public transport should evolve in conjunction with the numbers of people it is designed to serve.</P>
    <P>The service provided by the numbers 33, 41 and 42 buses is seriously overburdened and under resourced.  CIE's responsibility for those services is being tested because of a lack of resources.  The Minister will be aware of the controversy in the past week about large scale rezoning in the Swords area.  He knows the population in that area is increasing Every morning buses are full when they come to Swords.  That is also bad economics as it forces people to consider taking out a loan to pay for the purchase of private cars.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to cutbacks in CIE.  He is disillusioning customers that would otherwise help to pay for running CIE.  He must change current policies and realise that increased car sales is not sustainable growth.  He must realise that if we do not promote sustainable growth we are only making trouble for the future and public transport can play a role in this regard.  The Minister should communicate with the unions in this dispute and provide a modern and efficient transport system properly supported by the democratically elected Government.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Bradford, Kenny and Ryan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan's call for strategic development in the semi-State sector contrasts oddly with the proposal of his party leader.  Last October he decided it was Fianna Fáil policy to dispose of the entire sector to the highest bidder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the public record.  The Fianna Fáil Front Bench is in need of an internal communications strategy.  The current unrest in CIE and the threat of an all out strike did not arise out of a vacuum.  The hands-off approach adopted by successive Fianna Fáil administrations encouraged the development of a management ethos that allowed more for confrontation than for partnership.  In addition, the attempt by management in the three sections of CIE to impose change by diktat has generated great mistrust among the workers.  This has been compounded by the inexplicable action to remove paid sick leave for Dublin Bus employees injured in the course of their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <P>The plans by Iarnród Éireann and others were produced by management without <Col N="748" /> any consultation with the unions.  Is it not time for management to seek an input from the unions and redraw them?</P>
      <P>An efficient, reliable and cost effective transport system is both an economic and social necessity.  However, cost effective does not mean cost reduction.  We know it is not possible for the public transport system, which serves the social needs of the population, to be completely self financing.  Anybody who believes otherwise is living in could cuckoo land.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the Exchequer has subsidised CIE by approximately £1 billion.  That is a reasonable price to pay for an efficient public transport service.  However, CIE is not efficient. The bus service in urban areas is a hit and miss affair for users.  It has failed to entice drivers from their cars and the resulting transport gridlock threatens to bring our major cities to a halt.</P>
      <P>An improved public transport system is not the only way to resolve this gridlock.  The number of private vehicles, mostly occupied by one person travelling to and from work, is multiplying at an alarming rate.  Some Government initiatives encourage this traffic chaos.  I would welcome a review of the tax incentives currently available for multi-storey car parks in tax incentive areas. We also need to look at company parking spaces. Perhaps treating them as benefit-in-kind would discourage people from bringing their cars into work.</P>
      <P>A two pronged approach is required to discourage the use of private cars while encouraging the use of public transport.  A number of simple initiatives, which have more to do with common sense than with viability plans or strategic initiatives, could make public transport more attractive. For example, why can drivers not open the middle exit doors on buses?  Present arrangements compel passengers to press forward when alighting.</P>
      <P>Hitherto, it appeared that strategic planning in CIE focused on changes in work practices, with little reference to the customer.  The greater Dublin area has undergone massive population shifts in the past decade.  Urban renewal has encouraged more single people to move from the suburbs to the inner city, while pressure on space and rising house prices has forced many families to move into west Dublin, County Kildare and County Meath.  Sadly, the transport infrastructure has yet to catch up with new demands, despite recent developments such as the opening of the Lucan quality bus corridor.  The necessary demographic data is available to predict future transport needs.  I wish this played a larger role in the viability plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am especially concerned with the plan by Iarnród Éireann.  Its focus appears to be a reduction in workers' earnings.  We all know there is a high level of overtime payments in the company, but this is largely due to low basic pay. Given modern industrial relations in an era of partnership, the way to increase productivity and flexibility at no extra cost is to allow workers <Col N="749" /> retain their current gross earnings while introducing changes permitting them to work more flexibly. The success of the viability plan or any other strategic initiative will ultimately depend on the relationship between management, workers and consumers.</P>
    <P>Present semi-State structures need not remain cast in tablets of stone.  There is a need for change.  However, economic salvation does not lie in the privatisation agenda pursued by Thatcherites, the Progressive Democrats or even the Deputy McCreevy wing of the Fianna Fáil Party. Socialisation, rather than privatisation offers the best opportunity to develop new partnerships and to harness the collective intelligence of the workforce to the benefit of both companies and consumers. This aim would be best achieved through the development of collective share ownership along the lines of the successful employee share ownership plans which have been piloted in the USA.</P>

      <P>The basic concept of an employee-management buy out can be adapted to a number of situations and can be structured in such a manner that consumers as well as workers have a formalised role in both the structure and operation of an enterprise.</P>
      <P>Consideration should be given to the sale of CIE, or its three constituent companies, to the managers and employees who best know how to run them.  This could be financed in various ways. There is no need for a give-away, similar to the sale of B &amp; I, organised when Fianna Fáil was in Government and which was sold for £7 million with debts of £36 million written off.  The proposed third banking force and other such institutions could possibly have a vital role in providing the finance, not only for the CIE employee-management buy out but for similar innovative initiatives in the semi-State sector.  For example, I understand the Government is giving favourable consideration to a proposal by workers in Telecom Éireann to acquire up to 15 per cent of the company.</P>
      <P>This approach represents the best chance to revitalise the semi-State sector without embarking on the kind of wholesale privatisation undertaken in the UK and other countries.  I hope acceptance of this concept will become more widespread and more people will consider it as an option.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the previous two speakers.  Given what they said it is clear we need a broad debate on public transport. The political and ideological climate has changed over the past decade.  What were the certainties in life are no longer certain.  However, we must concede that there will always be an economic and social need for a proper public transport system. The country has benefited significantly from the work of the CIE group over the years. <Col N="750" /> Nobody can claim that the organisation is perfect but it is far from imperfect.  We must try to address the issue of making CIE as strong as possible to face all the challenges in the future. Given the competition which will exist as EU regulations change and private operators have access to the best routes, CIE must have its house fully in order.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that there will always be a social sphere to public transport and I support and welcome the Government's commitment to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan's contribution last night reminded me of the contributions of Deputy O'Donoghue in debates on crime and Deputy O'Rourke in relation to unemployment.  A person who had been abroad for a year would suspect that CIE's problems only began two years ago. We must be honest and accept that many of the difficulties and problems were brushed aside and not addressed.  In the context of the current proposals, politicians, union members and CIE management must face the difficulties and try to overcome them.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to public transport and CIE is obvious from the subvention of £105 million which is being made available to CIE this year, an increase of over £5 million since 1996.  This is being done to ensure that the group remains as strong as possible and that there is a good, solid base for CIE's public service contract. We must accept that the public service element of CIE, which will never pay for itself in economic terms, must be as efficient as possible.  It must deliver the best possible service to the maximum number of people.  The Government is anxious to ensure that the CIE group puts in place at the earliest possible date whatever steps are necessary to take full advantage of the public subvention which is being made available to it and uses it to maintain and develop the social service which CIE has always provided.</P>
      <P>The point has been made to me by individual CIE workers that some of the current proposals under the viability plan involving dramatic cuts in wage levels will be extremely difficult to sell to the workforce.  Members of the Oireachtas would not be impressed by a proposal to reduce our salaries by 20 or 30 per cent overnight.  We must expect the same response from workers in CIE when proposals are made to significantly reduce their salaries.  The viability plan contains difficult choices and decisions.  However, we must recognise that the future of the group will be put at great risk if some form of the plan is not implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan last night called for a hands-on approach.  However, he blissfully ignored the fact that he was in charge of the CIE group when he was Minister and that, while his party has had much responsibility for it over the years, a hands-on approach was never taken.  The idea behind the development of the semi-State sector was that there would not be day-to-day political or ministerial involvement.  CIE management, the board of directors and the unions should be to the fore <Col N="751" /> in coming together to resolve the group's difficulties and planning for the future.</P>
    <P>In the last decade £1 billion of Government money has been paid in subventions to the CIE group.  Most of it was made available to ensure that the group's social responsibilities would be met.  However, given the extent of the Government's financial and political commitment, we must expect and demand a reasonable response from CIE's management and unions which involves them coming together to debate and resolve their problems.  We could talk at length about the options which the group must consider in the next couple of years but the fact that there has not been a debate on the wider aspects of public transport, including the environmental aspects and the socio-economic cost, does not mean the relevant facts and figures are not available to people in CIE.</P>
    <P>The Government has an obvious commitment to the future of the CIE group, given the huge level of investment, and I hope the unions and management will respond in a reasonable and serious manner.  The last thing we need is strike action because it would send the wrong signals to people who are served by public transport.  I hope whatever difficulties arise can be resolved by debate and without recourse to a serious industrial dispute.  The CIE group did itself no favours in the various strikes which took place during the 1970s and 1980s.  I hope, as a result of the Partnership 2000 agreement and the different economic and social spirit which currently exists that people will agree to settle their differences without recourse to strike action.  I support the Government's action of putting money into CIE but giving responsibility to management and the unions to work together to maintain the strength of CIE and to make it stronger in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The motion refers to the Government's failure to develop a strategic plan for CIE and the semi-State sector but what is Fianna Fáil's strategic plan?  I note from a newspaper report that the Fianna Fáil leader unveiled his radical plan for the semi-State sector at a meeting of influential IBEC members on 10 October 1996 when he announced that Fianna Fáil is set to sell off a multi million pound stake in the country's semi-State companies.  He said the companies targeted by a Fianna Fáil policy group include CIE, RTÉ, the ESB, Coillte, Bord Fáilte, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the remaining State holding in Telecom Éireann.  Fianna Fáil is adopting the policies of the Progressive Democrats in calling for the privatisation of the entire semi-State sector.  Workers in the sector are being told what faces them if a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition comes into office.</P>

It states that FOTO outlined its proposals at the invitation of Deputy Martin and that the discussion was seen as the first in a series of discussions with the Fianna Fáil parliamentary group on school transport.

      <P>This year the State subvention to CIE was increased to £105 million, over £5.5 million more than last year's provision.  Having spent most of my working life with CIE before I was elected to this House, I am well aware of the concerns that exist at all levels among the company's workforce arising from the proposed viability plans.  The decision by the CIE board to close down its rail link freight service which generated £5 million per annum in revenue was an act of the utmost folly.  Matters were not helped when management made payment of the final increases under the PCW conditional on acceptance by the CIE unions of the viability plans.  Nor was the position helped by a letter sent to all employees by the CIE group chief executive which, in the view of the CIE trade union group, was a distortion of the facts.  The position is also not helped by the change or die school of successive ministerial scriptwriters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investment programmes in Iarnród Éireann, <Col N="753" /> Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann, entailing cost savings of £30 million, £8 million and £6 million respectively, were announced late last year. Those plans incorporate proposals which would dramatically alter and erode conditions of employment and take home pay.  Those proposals have generated understandable opposition.  The matter was recently resolved by a Labour Court recommendation which resulted in payment of the increases negotiated under the PCW and committed all concerned to negotiate on the proposals. Those negotiations are ongoing with a view to establishing mechanisms through which the issues may be addressed.  I welcome the adoption of Partnership 2000 and the whole partnership approach to resolving disputes.</P>
    <P>This motion proposed by Fianna Fáil is opportunist in its timing, motivated by cynicism and calculated to stir up industrial unrest in the CIE group of companies.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this Private Members' motion on what I thought would be the future of Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, particularly its employees, but I was disappointed. Whatever else Deputy Brennan spoke about last evening, he rarely alluded to the future of CIE as a group or addressed the concerns of its workforce.  Deputy Brennan knows that he and his party have lost credibility in the semi-State sector.  This motion and the Deputy's previous rantings about Telecom Éireann represent a forlorn attempt by Fianna Fáil to boost its reputation among public sector workers.  This PR exercise is doomed to failure.  Deputy Brennan's chances of succeeding in this task are, unfortunately for him, nought, as is evident each time Fianna Fáil's chosen bedfellows, the Progressive Democrats, contribute to a debate on public services.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this House and in CIE knows that change is inevitable.  In many other semi-State organisations such as Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann, ESB and Bord na Móna, it has already taken place.  Mostly this change is driven by EU legislation.  Regardless of whether we like it, Europe is moving in the direction of full, open and unhindered competition, and the majority in this House are in favour of that.  The best our industry &mdash; it is our industry &mdash; can hope for is a short breathing space before deregulation is introduced.  Some people would prefer if that did not happen, but there is no use in the Government, management, workers or Opposition spokespersons putting their heads in the sand, however politically expedient it would be for the latter.  Collectively we must avail of this opportunity to bring about the necessary changes, and changes arrived at by agreement will be even more durable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no direct competition in rail traffic and it has not been privatised.  It is interesting to note that Deputies Brennan and Cullen suggested, in the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, <Col N="754" /> the privatisation of two of Iarnród Éireann's most profitable ventures, Rosslare Harbour and the catering service within the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The railway is already under pressure to compete with other forms of transport &mdash; for instance, our road network, which is greatly improved, is a formidable alternative to rail freight, but that is not in our long-term interest. In terms of the environment, rail is a more viable alternative to roads.  The bus industry is in a unique position.  Nominally, Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann are free from competition under the 1933 Act.  There are, however, numerous private operators, mainly operating inter-city services but also to some extent in Dublin.  They operate in a legal quagmire, between regular service provision and private hire.  That position needs to be regularised and a level playing pitch provided.</P>
      <P>The current source of controversy within CIE relates to the three viability plans for the companies. While it is often perilous for politicians to involve themselves in industrial relations problems, a few points must be made about these plans, particularly the way the workforce and its representatives were informed of them.  The figure mentioned in the cost-cutting package is £44 million, a substantial figure which adds to the public perception that CIE and its three constituent companies receive huge amounts of State subvention. However, is that actually the case?  Out of the annual £100 million subvention to CIE, more than £55 million is spent by Irish Rail on infrastructural maintenance.  In contrast, the roads infrastructure is funded entirely by the Exchequer.  DART interest costs amount to more than £10 million per annum.  Public transport in Dublin is the least subsidised of any European capital and consequently this city has a huge traffic problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point that must be addressed is the low basic rate of many groups of employees in the three companies and the need for equity in terms of shareholders' contributions &mdash; there has been no equity in the company over the years. The parliamentary Labour Party met the CIE unions on a number of occasions to discuss this issue.  We outlined our position clearly to the previous Minister.  Bus Éireann must lift the threat to implement its proposed changes to allow meaningful negotiations to continue.  The same applies to Iarnród Éireann.  In each case change <Col N="755" /> will be best accommodated within the parameters laid down in the ICTU document, Managing Change.  This and future Governments must redouble their efforts to influence European transport policy away from untrammelled competition. That is not just to preserve good jobs but to preserve quality and economic efficiency.  Integrated public transport will then become the first choice of commuters and inter-city travellers.</P>
    <P>The ultimate benefit would be in quality of life and in the welfare of the physical environment.  I heard the board of CIE put an embargo on EU-aided projects pending agreement of the viability plan.  If this is so, it is an attempt at blackmail and I call on the Minister to intervene should it prove to be true.</P>
    <P>As a former CIE employee, I look forward to an agreement that will ensure the future of these companies and of their workforce in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I must declare an interest in that I was a CIE worker for 25 years.  I would defend those workers anywhere as genuine, dedicated and hardworking.  Like anyone else, if given the proper leadership and motivation they will respond.  For too long, CIE workers have been bashed.  Long before it was fashionable to knock politicians, CIE workers were used to taking abuse.  Politicians should understand the damage done to morale when people are constantly and unfairly criticised.</P>
      <P>CIE workers and unions know they are in a changing world and are prepared to adapt.  Any job in CIE is not the best paid job in town; wages have always been on a par with or just below others.  Over the years, the take-home pay has been supplemented by pay for long hours, overtime and weekend work.  No board or Government should try to drastically reduce those salary levels in one fell swoop.  Standards of living and mortgages have been built up over a long time and huge pay reductions should not be threatened; in some cases reductions of up to £180 a week are mentioned.  It is scandalous for any Minister or member of management to suggest that such a pay cut be accepted.  How can any Government Deputy defend that?</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán Ryan mentioned Fianna Fáil's reputation with the semi-States.  Fianna Fáil set them up, encouraged and developed them.  The Labour Party has recently tried to paint itself as the friend of semi-State bodies.</P>

      <P>The pious talk is for nothing. Previous Fianna Fáil statements can be dragged out but the Labour Party should look at what it is doing.  People are not fools.  They can see what is happening and do not listen to rhetoric.</P>
      <P>Some of the suggestions, such as the wage reduction of £180 a week, is scandalous.  Many CIE workers still work a six-day flat week.  Most of us got a five-day week between ten and 35 years ago but many CIE workers are still on a six-day week, which is scandalous.  They manage to get a week's pay by regularly working overtime. Many grades work overtime that is rostered in, month after month and year after year.  It becomes part of their wages and to try to frighten people by threatening to cut back on overtime overnight is scandalous.</P>

      <P>The work was done by Fianna Fáil.  CIE workers understand competition but the competition they are suffering, especially from provincial bus companies, is unfair.  Some of these companies get money under the table and tamper with salaries to get State subsidies.  It is unfair and unprofessional competition.  CIE workers are capable of giving a very good service and will compete fairly with anybody and it is up to Government to ensure fair competition.  The Minister should talk to CIE workers and agree on matters so that there is no strike.  If they need a temporary pay cut or share in the company as in the Aer Lingus case, it should be negotiated.  The company must go forward.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me to share his time.  When the last election campaign began in 1992, worried workers from Telecom Éireann came and asked me what the philosophies of the other parties would be in regard to Telecom.  Sadly, their worst fears have been realised.  The Telecom strategic alliance brought about by the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has caused many of the workers and Fianna Fáil grave concern.</P>
      <P>The price is scandalous and the deal heavily weighted in favour of KPN and Telia.  They now hold all the rights and options although they paid a bargain price for 20 per cent of Telecom.  Now there seem to be talks with the Swedish partners about privatising the company.  The Minister should not have stood over the KPN-Telia deal as it betrayed the taxpayers and Telecom workers. Fianna Fáil's history and philosophy has been consistently to support semi-State bodies in providing energy for economic growth.  As Deputy Séamus Brennan, our spokesman on Transport, Energy and Communications, said last night, the aim of Fianna Fáil is to reinvigorate the State enterprises and create a new renaissance in the sector.</P>
      <P>With regard to the crisis in CIE, workers are frustrated and neglected by the Minister.  He should take a hands-on approach as the approach of CIE management is unprecedented and turns the clock back on the principles of social partnership, as Deputy Séamus Brennan said last night. The concerns of the CIE workforce have to be recognised and accommodated.  If the Minister, with the backing of the Labour Party and Democratic Left, continues to turn a blind eye to what is happening in CIE, the losers will be the CIE workers and the consumers who wish or have no choice but to use public transport.</P>
      <P>When cost-cutting in an organisation is mentioned, it is often the most vulnerable who are squeezed.  I refer particularly to the railway lines in the west of Ireland.  The maintenance and service of these lines needs funding and very little EU funding is available for them.  If a line is not maintained, effectively it is closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We argued the importance of having a passenger service on the Ennis to Limerick line some <Col N="758" /> years ago.  We did not get a good hearing from the CIE management at the time and it was only after many years of persuasion that CIE put a service on that line.  CIE's argument was that there would not be enough passengers and that the service was not needed.  It was wrong and when the service was provided it proved to be effective.  Public pressure at local level also resulted in the improvement of the Dublin to Sligo line.  I would like to see the return of a passenger service on the Limerick to Galway line, on which a freight service operates at present.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain value for money CIE cannot just hope that things will happen.  It must put in place a proper marketing programme.  Those who live in the west need a proper rail service.  This would help keep existing jobs in the region and perhaps help to create more.  It would also give the commuters in the west the facilities to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister has refused to meet the unions in the CIE dispute.  He is not facing up to any of the problems confronting his Department.  The abolition of duty free facilities is going ahead unchallenged. Does the Minister intend to allow my constituents to lose jobs and revenue when duty free shopping is abolished?  He should have the political courage to put up a fight and give a long-term reassurance to those working in the duty free area in Shannon.</P>

It was dictatorial and draconian in publishing rosters on notice boards throughout the country which would have had a dramatic impact on the salaries of the workers.  It was an act calculated to undermine industrial relations in the company and the basis which has underpinned social partnership since 1987.</P>
      <P>It is odd that a Government which includes the Labour Party and Democratic Left could allow the Minister to direct this operation.</P>

      <P>This was what happened under the Government's authority.  This act created an atmosphere which was not conducive to reaching agreement on productivity or rationalisation.  It was a fundamental mistake.  The company's <Col N="759" /> approach and the Government's directions to the company were wrong.</P>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Noel Ahern's comments on the income of CIE workers.  My father worked as a bus driver for many years and the only way he could earn a decent salary to feed and educate his family was by working long shifts and driving long journeys.  For generations the workers have not had a decent basic income or decent pension rights.  I do not mind rationalisation or changing pay structures, but the workers should have a decent basic pay at the outset.  We can then deal with removing overtime and unsocial hours allowances.</P>
      <P>The Government recently negotiated Partnership 2000, apparently in a spirit of agreement, yet there was a deliberate attempt to move the pay and conditions of CIE workers back to the Dickensian era.  Shame on the Labour Party and Democratic Left for being party to that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The CIE restructuring plan makes severe demands on the company's workers.  Asking individual workers to take wage cuts of 30 to 40 per cent is not just demanding but unrealistic. People have entered into long-term financial commitments on the basis of their historical earnings. If the pay cuts were to be accepted many people would find themselves unable to meet their mortgage repayments, afford the cost of putting children through third level education or keep up with other financial commitments.  In some instances the pay cuts demanded are so severe it is as if the company was intent on making an offer the workforce simply could not accept. This is hardly the way to secure acceptance of a restructuring package.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that we seem headed for a nation-wide transport strike that will not only disadvantage the public but damage CIE and the prospects of all those employed in the operating subsidiaries.  In the CIE companies overtime and allowances have become an integral part of the overall earnings package.  It is clear that should not have been the case.  The emphasis should have been on basic pay rates.  However, the present situation and the problems with the pay structures were allowed to develop over several decades and it is unrealistic to expect that they can be sorted out in one fell swoop.</P>
      <P>The ability to rationalise and restructure is one of the key functions of modern management. Most private sector institutions have been brought through a process of rationalisation and restructuring.  Some of them have been through it several times in order to cope with the rapid pace of change in their business.  The main banking organisations, for example, have dramatically altered the way in which they do their business. They stay open longer, provide a wider range of services to their customers, have a more flexible workforce and are equipped to cope with domestic and international competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public sector organisations have had to <Col N="760" /> embrace change.  This has happened on a dramatic scale in other countries.  For example, Telecom Éireann's new partner, the Swedish company Telia, shed a third of its workforce over a number of years.  The ESB has completed a major restructuring of its operations in order to prepare itself for the competitive market in electricity.  The company may have paid top dollar, so to speak, in compensation for securing agreement to the restructuring.  However, agreement was secured without industrial dispute or interruption to supply.</P>
    <P>Another example is Bord na Móna.  The former chief executive, Mr. Eddie O'Connor, transformed the fortunes of the company in little more than five years.  Staff numbers were halved; productivity was increased; management was reorganised and new markets were established.  As a result, a loss of £16 million a year was converted into a profit of £5 million a year.  As Minister for Energy from 1989 to 1992, I was in a position to support and encourage Mr. O'Connor and the then chairman, Mr. Brendan Halligan.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Connor's achievements were made without strikes or disruption.  In other words, he completely rationalised the company's operations without antagonising the workforce.  As a good manager should, Mr. O'Connor explained the realities of the situation.  He outlined the areas in which savings were needed, he impressed upon the workforce that change was essential for the company's survival and he consulted with it on the restructuring-proposals.  In short, he won the trust and confidence of the workforce in his bid to carry through the most fundamental changes in the history of the company.  It is remarkable in hindsight that Mr. O'Connor should have been able to command the confidence of several thousand Bord na Móna workers but was forced to leave the company because he was unable to command the confidence of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry.  Mr. O'Connor is a great loss to the semi-State sector.  He showed how flair and commercial sense could be brought to bear on the management of a State company and how taxpayers and workers could benefit as a result. Whatever difficulties arose with regard to Mr. O'Connor's remuneration package, they could have been sorted out without the unseemly witch hunt launched against him by the former Minister.</P>
    <P>There must surely be a lesson for CIE in the experience of the ESB and Bord na Móna.  Both companies showed that comprehensive restructuring and rationalisation can be achieved provided there is adequate consultation between management and the workforce.  The process of consultation has to be built on trust.  I worry whether that trust between management and staff exists in the CIE group of companies; if not, it will have to be established.  There is no doubt that the CIE companies need restructuring.  They all face the challenge of increased competition in a deregulated <Col N="761" /> European market and none of them is adequately equipped to cope with that competitive threat.</P>
    <P>Deregulation of the road transport market will mean that Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus will have to face more competition in the years ahead. Both companies will have to fight for customers with private sector operators whose costs are much lower than theirs.  For both companies the message is clear, they must rationalise to survive. The position is potentially even more serious for Iarnród Éireann, the CIE subsidiary most heavily dependent on support from the taxpayer.  The previous Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, allowed competing operators access to the CIE rail network, a measure that has gone largely unnoticed because nobody has yet taken advantage of it.  There is no need for me to spell out the implications of this for the future viability of Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>The most dangerous scenario for the company is one where Northern Ireland Railways is privatised by trade sale to one of the independent train operating companies in Britain.  Instead of co-operating with CIE on the Dublin-Belfast route, as at present, NIR could then decide to compete with it.  It could become a competitor not just on the Dublin-Belfast route, but on other inter-city routes such as Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Limerick and Dublin-Cork.  On the basis of recent developments in Britain the most likely bidder for NIR is Stagecoach and I am sure management and workers at CIE are already familiar with its track record.  The company pursues expansion in a very aggressive way, believes in ruthless competition and is prepared to use predatory pricing to force rival operators off the roads and rails.  Originally a bus company, Stagecoach is one of the largest train operating companies in the privatised system which obtains in Britain.  A company such as this operates on the principle that there is no such thing as an uneconomic route, only an uneconomic operator.  It has proven its ability in buses and trains to cut costs to the minimum while still delivering a service that passengers will support.</P>
    <P>I understand CIE management is waking up to the possible challenge from Stagecoach and that memorandums are circulating around Heuston Station about the possible impact on Iarnród Éireann.  One does not have to be a genius to work out what that impact would be.  If Stagecoach were to select two or three high density inter-city routes such as Dublin-Belfast or Dublin-Cork and engage in predatory pricing through a low fare strategy, Iarnród Éireann would suffer badly.  The company would see its revenue base crumble quickly as it was forced to cut fares while losing passengers.  It would then be left with two stark choices.  It could engage in a severe and sudden cost reduction programme involving wholesale redundancies and across the board wage cuts or it could go to the Government and look for a huge increase in the annual subvention.  I am not sure it would get a favourable hearing from the <Col N="762" /> Government of the day unless it could show it was seriously willing to tackle its cost base.</P>
    <P>The issue for the CIE companies is whether they rationalise now on their own terms or rationalise later on somebody else's.  Management clearly understands the need for rationalisation and restructuring.  The unions also understand the need for that process.  Why are the two sides unable to come together and sort out the issue as they did in Bord na Móna, the ESB and hundreds of companies in the private sector here?  Some of us were Members of this House when Deputy Séan Lemass was urging Irish industries to rationalise in preparation for entry to the EEC.  We are in a similar critical situation in regard to our State companies.</P>
    <P>Cost cutting on its own will not be enough to solve the problems for CIE.  It has developed as a protected monopoly over a half century.  Like most monopolies, it did not pay as much attention as it should have to customer service and quality assurance.  There is no charter of customers' rights, for instance, in any of the CIE operating companies.  There are no performance indicators to tell passengers what percentage of buses or trains ran on time or ran at all.  This basic information on the quality of service is displayed at all main stations in the Northern Ireland Railways network.</P>
    <P>The CIE group and Iarnród Éireann in particular, has placed too much emphasis on engineering skills and not enough on marketing skills.  There has been enormous investment in a main line rail network over the past five years, yet the number of passenger journeys has risen by only 6.5 per cent over the same period.  Huge investment has gone into developing the diesel suburban rail service in the greater Dublin area over the past years, yet passenger numbers using these services are lower than five years ago.  The population of Dublin is increasing, the number of tourists visiting the city has risen dramatically and traffic congestion is making high quality public transport an attractive option.  All this should translate into higher demand for the DART service, but what do we find?  The number of people using DART in 1995, the last year for which figures are available, is lower than in 1990.  This surely puts a question mark over the ability of Iarnrod Éireann to market its products properly.</P>
    <P>The same is true of rail freight.  In spite of road improvements, traffic congestion still makes it difficult and costly to get road freight to many of our major ports, particularly Dublin Port.  Does that not present an opportunity for the rail freight division of Iarnród Éireann, especially when the company enjoys good rail access to most of our ports?  Apparently not.  Despite the purchase of an expensive fleet of powerful new Canadian locomotives and a continuing programme of improvements to the rail infrastructure funded largely by EU money, rail freight has gone downhill in the last five years.  Since 1990 the total tonnage of goods carried on the Irish railways has fallen by 4 per cent while total cash receipts from <Col N="763" /> the freight business has fallen by more than 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>The situation is little better at Bus Éireann where passenger numbers are lower today than five years ago and this despite a huge investment in new coaches for the Expressway routes.  The CIE group needs a change of direction.  Iarnrod Éireann and Bus Éireann should surely be stand alone companies.  Equally it makes little sense to have a single company in Dublin, Bus Éireann, running the city bus services in Galway, Limerick and Cork.  Would it not make more sense to follow the example of other countries and devolve control of local bus services to the regions?</P>
    <P>The Minister should take the opportunity of this debate to state clearly his policy for the future development of CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition motion and their contributions to this debate represent nothing more than a further display of the kind of cheap attention seeking which is their substitute for serious political analysis and debate.  The Minister yesterday set out the real facts of the CIE situation in an objective, clear-sighted and dispassionate fashion.  CIE management and unions have a job to do.  They must negotiate difficult and unpalatable issues which are bound up with the changes taking place in the public transport sector, not just in Ireland, but throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>The management and unions in CIE, with the support and assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery are engaged in this.  The negotiation of change cannot be accomplished by anybody else.  The litany of opposition calls for ministerial intervention is based on the principle that &ldquo;CIE's difficulty is Brennan's opportunity&rdquo; and not on any concern about the future of CIE, its workforce or customers.</P>
      <P>The changes in the public transport sector require public transport providers to focus outwards, on their customers, rather than inwards on themselves.  CIE is no longer the only player in the public transport market.  Private sector competition is a reality, and the private sector presence in the market is certain to intensify in the coming years.  The public transport sector is the only major area that has remained relatively untouched by the tide of liberalisation from Brussels which is transforming the energy and telecommunications sectors, and which has already changed the aviation and road haulage sectors so radically.</P>
      <P>That situation is already changing.  Gradual liberalisation of the public transport sector is clearly on the agenda of the European Commission. Changes in that direction are already taking place in many European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why it is so important that the CIE group of companies should be ready to meet competition <Col N="764" /> on price and quality of service.  Change, however, needs to be tackled in a managed and measured fashion, with management and unions working together towards realistic agreed solutions. I wholeheartedly endorse the Minister's call to both management and unions to get down to real talking and to resolve the issues in a realistic and co-operative fashion.  The days of constant confrontation and mutual suspicion between management and staff in CIE must be put firmly in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The challenge to both sides is to find a way of hanging together, for if they do not they will certainly hang separately.  Models for the pragmatic and inclusive management of change in the commercial State sector already exist.  In the ESB, Bord Na Móna and Aer Lingus change has been addressed by negotiation between management and workforces.  The detailed approach in each organisation differed in line with the differing needs and circumstances which they faced. Nevertheless, the agenda for change in each of those organisations was identified, agreed on and is being implemented on the basis of partnership. That is the way forward for CIE.  The resources of the State's industrial relations institutions and machinery are there to support that process and are doing so.  Old-fashioned confrontation and conflict, however tempting they may seem when tempers become frayed in the heat of argument, will not achieve the necessary objectives.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about an area for which I have specific personal responsibility.  That is the issue of replacing the outdated and unworkable Transport Act, 1932, with modern legislation which can deal with the licensing of the bus sector in a sane and reasonable way.  This issue has been on the political back burner for some years now. I have been discussing the matter with all the interested parties in the sector over the past 12 months.  I am now working towards the development of a new set of proposals, building on all the factors laid before me in the course of my consultations.  The proposals put together in the late 1980s and early 1990s have been largely overtaken by events, including massive programmes of public transport investment and some developments in relevant European Union legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into details as to what the proposals I hope to develop will contain.  Many of the elements have still to be refined further before they are ready to be put into the framework of a new Bill.  There are, however, some basic principles which I am determined to see as the foundations for a new licensing regime for the bus sector.  The primary objective of any new legislation must be the provision of the best possible service to the public transport user.  Any new arrangements will be as simple as we can make <Col N="765" /> them.  They will provide a sensible, transparent and fair framework for competition.  They will contain proper enforcement provisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there will be a commitment to deploying the necessary resources to ensure proper enforcement.  Above all, the new arrangements will provide a workable and understandable regulatory framework for the industry, taking account of the needs of the travelling public and the need for flexibility to enable the sector to respond to changing patterns of demand.  My proposals, while providing a framework for fair competition, will also seek to avoid the kind of free-for-all and cherry-picking which turned the bus sector in the UK into a highly successful commercial venture for the very few and a chaotic nightmare for many among the travelling public. While it would be unrealistic to give a commitment on the timing of new legislation, it is my intention to complete the review and policy formulation aspects over the coming months. Larger political issues will determine the timing of the Bill's introduction to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The future of CIE is largely in its own hands. The Government is pursuing a programme of investment which is bringing about an enormous improvement in the public transport system. Initiatives on public service contracts to replace the CIE subvention arrangements and on new bus licensing legislation are well advanced.  The final element of the equation requires radical improvements in the cost base and efficiency of the CIE group itself.  These have to be achieved by agreement and through direct negotiations between CIE management and unions.  They must be achieved in order to enable the CIE group to meet and beat private sector competition from at home and abroad, to maximise the opportunities presented by EU funds for public transport and to generate funds for investments which will not attract EU financial support, including bus fleet replacement.  The window of opportunity presented both by EU funds and by the few remaining years before liberalisation begins to bite hard at CIE's customer base is limited. It must be grasped now or it will be irretrievably lost.</P>

      <P>I support the motion in the name of our party spokesman, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  The time has long passed for this Government and its Ministers in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to take a positive initiative to ensure that equity prevails in the CIE group of companies.  They have failed completely and dismally in the last few years and there is now turmoil in a vital semi-State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the outgoing chief executive of Iarnród Éireann, Mr. David Waters.  I wish him <Col N="766" /> every success in his retirement, which commences next week, and thank him for his services.  I wish his successor, Mr. Joe Meagher, every success in the formidable task ahead of him.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, the board of CIE, the management of Iarnród Éireann and everyone associated with the CIE group to ensure the deletion of that section of the cost base review pertaining to the western freight corridor from Claremorris, County Mayo to Limerick city.  I further call on them to ensure investment is made in this vital rail line so that it can take the maximum amount of freight and provide adequate rail car services as required between the relevant towns in counties Galway, Mayo and Clare and the cities of Galway and Limerick.</P>
    <P>We in the west are not prepared to be treated as second class citizens.  Over the years there has been massive investment in the capital city in all sectors of activity and all sectors of State.  We need a modest, reasonable investment between Limerick and Sligo to bring that railway line up to the proper standard.  We are entitled to this as citizens.  It is vital that it be done.</P>
    <P>There are major opportunities for CIE.  It is the dominant player in the transport market and had a monopoly for many years but failed to capitalise on it.  There are major potential markets in the third level institutions and Government offices in Galway, Castlebar, Sligo, Limerick and Athlone. There is constant customer demand for a proper service and a major opportunity for an initiative on the rail car system between Athlone and Galway and from Limerick through Galway to Castlebar, Claremorris, Ballina and Sligo.  There are great tourism opportunities in the summer season and at Easter and Christmas.  The freight service to the ports of Galway, Ballina and Limerick could be developed.</P>
    <P>When the Louisiana Pacific company intended to locate in Ireland, a major plan was put forward, not by CIE but by the Claremorris chamber of commerce.  The company subsequently located in Waterford but the proposals put to CIE and Iarnród Éireann at that time ensured that they could capitalise on this investment in Ireland and a major freight opportunity has resulted.  Many similar opportunities are available to the company if it is prepared to research and market them.  Massive investment is required in Gort and Tuam railway stations to ensure these towns get the same type of opportunity as other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In 1851 a railway station was opened in Ballinasloe, the county town of Galway.  It is ironic that Fine Gael and Labour, aided and abetted by Democratic Left, are currently in Government because in 1986, when they were in Government on a previous occasion, a decision was taken to close down the freight depot in Ballinasloe.  There were 20 people employed there before the <Col N="767" /> decision but the operation was moved to Athlone and only five people were left in the station.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government in the last few years, we put massive European funding, coupled with Irish Exchequer support, into the rail system. Some £20 million was invested in the national primary line between Dublin and Galway.</P>

      <P>The Government now proposes to automate the railway station in Ballinasloe, one of our biggest provincial towns, and make the five employees, including the station master, redundant.  Where is the human face of the company or the hands-on commitment of the Minister into leading a policy plan which would ensure this would not prevail?  I want a <i>de facto</i> commitment that Iarnród Éireann will not proceed with closing down the Limerick-Claremorris line, that the investment will be made, that the people of Ballinasloe will be allowed to retain their jobs and that a proper marketing initiative will proceed to maximise the opportunities that are so obvious to Iarnród Éireann and its sister companies.  I hope common sense will prevail, that human respect and dignity will be accorded to the workers and that proper negotiations will be put in train to ensure that this company makes a massive contribution, into the next millennium, to the national transport service in an equitable fashion right across the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this resolution for two reasons, first because the workers in CIE are being disgracefully treated by the Government and the management of CIE and, second, because the Government's policies right across the board in semi-State companies are in total disarray.  The policies which were led by the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, are now being carried on by the new Minister, Deputy Dukes.</P>
      <P>The workers in CIE have been ignored by the company, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes and, I presume, by the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.  The company is heading for a standstill.  We have had a number of stoppages, and will have more.  What can one expect when, without consultation, one tells people who drive trains for a living that their income is to be cut by £180 a week.  That is a savage way to treat workers in any company, and I am amazed that parties who call themselves left-wing would stand idly by in the Government and allow a board of directors or management to behave like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are proposals for cuts of the order of 100 to 250 in the engineering divisions.  What about safety in that area?  The unions and the people in CIE have, for years on end, shown that they will manage change.  They have made sacrifices <Col N="768" /> before.  There were 11,000 people in Iarnród Éireann some years ago.  That is down now to about 5,000.  The unions played their part before, and they will play their part again in managing change.  They have always shown themselves able to do that.  This deliberately confrontational style, started by the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, continued by the Minister, Deputy Dukes and the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, which gives a nod and a wink to the management to behave in this way is not acceptable and cuts right across the principle of social partnership.  Just before Christmas the workers in CIE were told that their PCW entitlement would not be paid unless they gave in to threats which were made to them.  They quite rightly said they would not negotiate in the face of such threats.  The PCW was negotiated and it should have been paid, but we have heard nothing from the left-wing members of this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>It is a scandal to see particularly the left-wing parties of this Government standing over this treatment of workers in CIE, the turning of it into a yellow-pack operation.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Dukes, again tonight to come off the perch that was put there for him by the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, and meet and talk to the workers, to give social partnership a real meaning by meeting the people who run the company rather than handing them and backing up diktats from a management that should be more sensitive and that should know how to handle situations like this.</P>
      <P>I asked for a hands-on approach by the Minister although last night he told me that a hands-off approach was better.  We did not take a hands-off approach to the problems in CIE in 1994.  We did not take a hands-off approach to Aer Lingus and TEAM.  We got directly involved and sorted out the problems.  From 1987 to 1994 Fianna Fáil negotiated EU funds of over £600 million for investment in public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that this new Minister would take a different approach.  I had hoped he would know better than to take this gun-slinging, gung-ho, dictatorial approach to running State companies, and that he would give some flesh and bones to the idea of social partnership.  However, I was disappointed. He simply came into office and when I asked him in the Dáil some weeks ago if he would change any of the policies of the former Minister, he told me that he did not propose to unpick the decisions of his predecessor.  Deputy Stagg's party and the Democratic Left, which is <Col N="769" /> not represented here this evening, should not let him away with that.</P>
    <P>Also on the question of State companies it was reported in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> last Sunday that a flagship project in the midlands, the peat stations, was in jeopardy.  On Monday the Minister said that there was no problem, that the tender was going out next week.  On Wednesday the EU stated that this was subject to review, and disclosed today that the Irish Government was told it was not allowed to mention in its invitations to tender that EU funds were available because the project had not been finally approved.  This happened before in regard to Luas when we were not told that the EU had a sanction on it.  Who is right?  Why is the Minister saying that it is on track, that tenders will go out next week while the EU is stating that it told the Irish Government some time ago it could not do that because the mid-term review was in place and was indicating that unless these funds were drawn down quickly this project would not go ahead.</P>
    <P>This is typical of what is going on under Deputy Dukes and the previous Minister &mdash; private consultants' reports, secret sell-offs of State companies, secret deals behind closed doors, not telling us the full story.  We have it again here in regard to this project.  Why did the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, refuse to explain why he cancelled the first competition in regard to Bord na Móna?  Why did he refuse to tell us why the operational programme had not been drawn down?  I would like an explanation of those matters as soon as possible from the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in office for over two months.  There are 11 Bills in his Department, only one of which is coming up now.  The Minister mentioned that this evening.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, said that in regard to the new Competition Bill, any new arrangements will be as simple as the Government can make them and will provide a sensible and transparent framework for competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The origins of this Bill are in the joint communiqué agreed by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister on 28 November 1995 when it was agreed to launch the twin track process with a view to making parallel progress with the decommissioning issue and all-party negotiations. We were fortunate to have the services of Senator George Mitchell and his two colleagues to provide an independent assessment of decommissioning. <Col N="773" /> That body was asked also to report on the necessary arrangements for the removal, from the political equation, of illegally held arms, to identify and advise on a suitable and acceptable method to fully decommission and report where there was a clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve that end.</P>
      <P>The whole issue of decommissioning has taken up much of the time of the negotiations in Northern Ireland.  One cannot but be aware of the anxiety felt by people in all parts of this island and in Britain on the need for decommissioning. Large quantities of arms are held not only in the North but in the Republic.  I have seen proof of that both before and after the ceasefire.</P>
      <P>The situation in Northern Ireland is complex. We must have a ceasefire if we are to make progress. The only way we can move forward is through a ceasefire, decommissioning and a build up of trust on both sides of the religious and political divide.  Much work has been done by both Governments towards this end.  That they got agreement for all party talks on 10 June 1996 was a major step forward and meant this problem we have lived with for almost a century could be dealt with in a meaningful way.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the IRA which has many links with Sinn Féin decided to plant bombs in Canary Wharf and Manchester.  There was also the tragedy in Limerick which involved the death of the late Jerry McCabe.  He was gunned down when IRA activists tried to take money out of State property.  I strongly believe that had the money not been in crates and had been transferred to their own transport, Jerry McCabe would be alive today.  It would be claimed the money was taken by rogues or scoundrels and it would have been used by all types of people some of whom even refuse to claim expenses at council meetings and try to show up everybody else as rogues.</P>
      <P>Section 5 clearly states that an amnesty linked to decommissioning would enable arms, bombing material etc.  to be given up in an organised way and that the people giving them up would not be liable to legal action by the State.</P>
      <P>One cannot help but refer again to the bombings at Canary Wharf and Manchester and the killing of a garda in Limerick.  We all want to see a return to peace, which led to prosperity and goodwill in the North.  In north County Monaghan the ceasefire enabled the reopening of roads which had been closed and had frustrated farmers and local communities and divided parishes and people.  In many cases the closure of roads did more to increase activity by the IRA-Sinn Féin than it did to stop the bullets and bombs.  I never want to see those roads closed again.  If the Bill enables the organised decommissioning of arms to take place then it will give hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The achievement of peace in Northern Ireland has to be the main goal of the Government and Opposition.  It is important to save lives.  Thankfully <Col N="774" /> fewer lives have been lost since the ceasefire than were lost during previous years.  The ending of the ceasefire has led to much rancour and anxiety.  For example, policemen, SDLP and Unionist councillors and others must look under their cars in the morning to see if bombs have been planted.  In some cases there are hoaxes, but it is very sad that we have had to return to these days in the name of Irish freedom.</P>
    <P>The ceasefire showed during its 18 months that jobs could be created and industry and tourism could be promoted on an all-Ireland basis.  The agreement by the two tourism bodies on a joint logo is one example of what was achieved.  The ceasefire gave young people something to live for. For example, they could go out at night and take part in normal activities without anxiety.  John Hume, the Reverend Roy Magee and many others have devoted much of their life to try to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict in the North.  It must be dreadful for them to see people and organisations, particularly the IRA, stalling and drawing back from the peace process.  People on the other side are not all that innocent either, but thankfully there has not been a total breakdown in the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>We must do everything possible to ensure all avenues are left open so that consultation and meetings can take place between the people in the middle ground.  If those who occupy the middle ground in politics in Northern Ireland, across the water and in this State continue to work closely together they will show those on the fringes how much better it is to be involved in the political process than to be isolated.  It is important to point out that these groups have isolated themselves and that if they had been able to control their members and had not continued to make bombs in County Laois and other areas then the ceasefire would not have broken down.</P>
    <P>This Bill can act as an important measure in achieving peace.  Its introduction has proven that the Government is prepared to live up to its commitments in this area.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and all those involved in the peace process must be given full support both inside and outside the House.  There is nothing to be gained from politicians making snide and derogatory comments outside the House.  I hope we can quickly regain the momentum which existed so that the next generation can look on this island as a great place to live.  We have an economic boom, and one can only imagine what could be achieved if we had peace. It would lead to further prosperity and enable us to take our rightful place in Europe.  During the last six months of 1996 Ireland held the Presidency of the EU.  We are all proud of the good job done by the Government which showed what smaller countries in Europe can do in furthering the momentum towards the introduction of a single currency and how they can play their part in a much larger Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for sharing his time with me.  On the night the ceasefire was announced I said in the House I did not believe it.  I also referred to the very muted response given to it by the late Neil Blaney, the person in this House who was probably closest to the mindset of the IRA.  He gave the ceasefire a very lukewarm reception because he did not believe it either.  The reason he did not believe it is that the <i>raison d'être</i> for the IRA is a united Ireland and there is no way it will ever renounce that.</P>
      <P>Sadly, I have been proven correct.  What we were offered was a mirage, a phoney peace, which attracted many gobshites who believed the IRA, the worst killing machine in Europe since Adolf Hitler.  I do not believe the IRA is sincere in its efforts to achieve peace.  I live two miles from the Border and last Sunday I visited Newcastle in County Down where, as Deputy Crawford said, the benefits of peace are there to be seen.  The potential benefits of peace for my county, which has suffered grievously because of its proximity to the Border, are tremendous.  I do not doubt the desirability of peace but I question how one can marry Unionism with republicanism, given that one seeks integration with Great Britain and the other seeks a united Ireland.</P>
      <P>In a perfect society a united Ireland would be a logical solution, but one million Unionists do not agree with this.  They see decommissioning as the central issue in any possible solution to coexistence in the North.  Can one blame them for being cynical given the murder of postman Patrick Kerr in Newry for £30,000 or £40,000 within weeks of the so-called ceasefire, the murder in Canary Wharf of two Pakistani people who did not know what the conflict was about and the murder in Adare of an Irish policeman, the sixteenth Irish policeman butchered by that band of killers, the IRA?</P>
      <P>The IRA has taken the lives of 16 members of the Garda Síochána and seven members of the Army.  These are the people who now proclaim peace and exhort the people of Ireland to seize the opportunity for peace, as emblazoned on notices around the country.  Can anyone blame the Unionists for doubting their sincerity?  I join them in doubting their sincerity.  I will only accept that the IRA believes in peace if it decommissions its weapons of death, not necessarily to the British Government but to our Government or a United Nations peacekeeping force.  If that happens I will respect the IRA's statement that it believes in peace.  Until then there will be no movement in the Unionists' statement of no surrender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator George Mitchell is doing a fair job with the rival contenders at the talks who cannot seem to agree on a set menu for lunch.  That man is in danger of going mad listening to the rationale used in Northern politics by terrorists gangs.  Part of the problem is that our Government and the British Government give recognition to this killing machine, the IRA, and to the UDA and the <Col N="776" /> UDF.  We refer to Sinn Féin as if it were some type of legal organisation.  Ten years ago the Supreme Court decreed that the IRA and Sinn Féin were indivisible; they were one organisation. As part of the game we play in politics we give them recognition and pretend they are a separate organisation.  Until the IRA realises it cannot bomb its way to a united Ireland by killing other Irish people of a different persuasion, no progress will be made because the Unionists will not believe anything until decommissioning takes place.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill but I fear it will not produce the desired results; I hope I am wrong in those sentiments.  A more serious attitude should be adopted towards those who hold kangaroo courts at the side of the road and callously snuff out people's lives.  That was done to a young farmer in my county, Tom Oliver, the father of seven young children &mdash; I believe the youngest was four.  That man was callously killed by the organisation now claiming in a hypocritical way that it wants peace.  They should put their money where their mouths are and hand in their weapons. We can then all breathe a little easier on this island.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to follow Deputy McGahon down the road he has just travelled. He will not be surprised to know I agree with some of the sentiments he expressed but disagree with others.  The Deputy said he hoped he was wrong in his sentiments.  He is wrong in one respect, namely, his failure to believe that the republican and Unionist traditions can be reconciled. I believe it is possible for the republican and Unionist traditions to be reconciled.  I say that as someone with 25 years' experience of politics in the North and seven or eight years' experience here.  The only future in relation to Northern Ireland is a partnership based on the reconciliation of the Unionist and Nationalist traditions. There is no other solution and I hope Deputy McGahon agrees with me.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  There has been a broad welcome for the Bill and recognition of the fact that it seeks to be consistent with the terms of the report of the international body which inspired it.  That report was itself welcomed by all sides in this House on its publication.  It was seen then &mdash; and continues to be seen now &mdash; as the best framework possible for taking forward the issue of decommissioning. There was also recognition in the debate that the Bill can have a positive part to play in the Northern Ireland talks and the broader peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two general issues touched on those wider considerations raised in the debate which I wish to address before dealing with some other specific points raised on the terms of the Bill.  The first of those more general issues was the concern expressed by Deputy Bertie Ahern that the passage of the legislation might be used to create further preconditions to the participation of Sinn <Col N="777" /> Féin in the Northern Ireland talks.  In making that point Deputy Ahern equally acknowledged our obligation in this House to show good faith and to take the legitimate concerns of others seriously.</P>
    <P>The Government firmly believes that enactment of the Bill will be an important demonstration by this House of our commitment to the report of the international body and our willingness to work with others to give it effect.  It will provide a framework against which the decommissioning issue can be meaningfully addressed in the context of the Northern Ireland talks and enable any agreements reached there to be given effect in this State.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this Bill, the Government's objective is to make a positive contribution to the Northern Ireland talks and the broader political process.  Of necessity, the Bill is enabling in character in certain important respects and does not, therefore, prescribe in detail how and when decommissioning should take place.</P>
    <P>The passage of the Bill will not create new preconditions for participation in the talks.  The basis for the participation of all parties in the talks is set out in the Joint Communiqué agreed by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister on 28 February 1996 and the Ground Rules for Substantive All-Party Negotiations agreed by the two Governments on 26 April last.  They will remain unaffected by the passage of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A close reading of the Bill will show that, consistent with the report of the international body, it has been prepared with a view to putting into effect agreements reached by the parties within the talks framework as to how decommissioning should be effected and not with a view to imposing peremptory decommissioning.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the second general issue I wish to address &mdash; the fact that certain provisions of the Bill are enabling only, something which appears to be of particular concern to Deputy O'Donoghue.  That was a matter of conscious and deliberate choice.  The key considerations in that context, which derive from the terms and recommendations of the international body's report, are that decommissioning, in the sense the term is used in that body's report, can be effected only by the persons who have actual possession of arms and in circumstances where they are prepared to decommission; and that the international body recommended that the details of decommissioning should be determined by the parties themselves.</P>
    <P>The international body specifically acknowledged that the methods or modalities of decommissioning would need to be subject to negotiation and that the independent commission established to oversee the decommissioning process &mdash; whose precise role will, incidentally, also depend crucially on the method or methods of decommissioning eventually adopted &mdash; should be acceptable to all parties and appointed by the Governments on the basis of consultations with them.</P>
    <P>The enabling character of the provisions of the <Col N="778" /> Bill concerned with the modalities of decommissioning and the Commission need to be seen in that broader context.  They make it clear the two Governments do not wish to prejudge the issues involved and are open to adopting any approach on the precise modalities and details of decommissioning, consistent with the report of the international body and which may be agreed to by the parties.  It is the enabling character of those provisions which will enable legal effect to be given to agreements between the parties to the talks.</P>
    <P>While the Bill contains enabling provisions on the modalities of decommissioning and the commission, it also contains substantive provisions on issues such as forensic testing and the prohibition on the taking of proceedings arising from the decommissioning process, as Deputy O'Malley recognised.  These substantive provisions enact into law the recommendations of the international body relating to these matters which are properly a matter for Government and primary legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the question of the agreement between the two Governments establishing the commission, referred to in section 3. That agreement, as the Deputy surmised, does not yet exist.  Contrary to what he said, my advice is that the definition in section 1 or the terms of the long title do not require that the agreement should be in existence at the time of the enactment of the legislation.  Progress in the talks will obviously have a significant bearing on when decisions relating to the commission are made and put into effect.  Section 3(1) provides that the subsequent provisions of that section, which relate to the commission, will come into effect on such day as the Minister for Justice, after consultation with the Secretary of State, may appoint for enabling the agreement to have full effect.  I shall deal later with the question raised by Deputy O'Malley concerning the definition of &ldquo;Secretary of State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It will therefore be possible for the Bill to be enacted before the agreement between the two Governments setting up the commission is concluded. Furthermore, section 9(2) provides that the Act, other than section 3, &ldquo;shall come into operation on such day or days as ... may be fixed therefor ...&rdquo;.  This naturally includes section 4, which provides for regulations in relation to the commission, including its functions and role generally. Deputy O'Malley also raised a question about the definition of &ldquo;Secretary of State&rdquo;.  He is correct in concluding that the definition of that term in section 1 is not confined only to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  This reflects the legal position and convention relating to the use of that term in the United Kingdom.  &ldquo;Secretary of State&rdquo; is defined by their 1978 Interpretation Act to mean &ldquo;one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State&rdquo; and can mean any such secretary of State.  The Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Bill, 1996 uses the term in that sense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> In regard to section 5, Deputy O'Malley asked if it is the intention that compliance with any one of the four conditions listed in the section would be sufficient to bring about a prohibition on proceedings. This is neither the intention nor the effect.  All four conditions will have to be met before the prohibition applies.  This is to ensure that the existence of the &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo;, provided for in section 5, is not misused for unlawful purposes inconsistent with the purpose of decommissioning and to avoid doubt as to the circumstances in which the prohibition on the taking of proceedings will have application.  Were it, for example, only necessary for one of the conditions to be met, it would be open to anyone found in unlawful possession of firearms at any time during a period that might be specified for the purposes of decommissioning under the regulations to claim the benefit of the section.  That would not be acceptable to the House.  That is why it will be necessary for all the conditions to be met before the prohibition on the taking of proceedings will apply.  The precise nature of those requirements will be a function of the regulations and arrangements made under the Act.  Those remain a matter for discussion with the parties.</P>
    <P>In her opening remarks, the Minister for Justice referred to the fact that there had been significant changes and developments in the political situation since the international body's report was published just over one year ago.  Multi-party talks have been under way for some months in Northern Ireland in accordance with agreed procedures and mechanisms and under the eminent chairmanship of the authors of the international body's report.  While progress in the talks has been regrettably slow to date, they continue, in the view of the Government, to offer the best means of securing an overall agreement on the future of Northern Ireland acceptable to both communities and all sides.  That is why the Government continues to work for early progress into substantive negotiations within the three strands within the framework of the talks.</P>
    <P>The Government also remains committed to the principle of fully inclusive negotiations and wants to see an early and unequivocal restoration of the Provisional IRA cessation of violence of August 1994 so that fully inclusive negotiations can become a reality.  It recognises that progress on decommissioning requires the participation of all parties to the talks process.  It believes that, when the Provisional IRA make that possible by restoring the August 1994 cessation, the report of the International Body can provide a realistic way forward to a position where the gun will be removed from Irish politics forever.</P>
    <P>I hope the passage of this legislation will assist progress in the talks and the peace process more generally. I commend it to the House on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, as an seans a thabhairt dom caint faoin ceantair beocht seo do Baile Atha Cliath. In raising this matter I am making an appeal to Government for a neglected, if not forgotten, area of Dublin city.  It is an area that is not properly represented by any elected Member. Changes in constituency boundaries have perhaps contributed to this.  Cherry Orchard and its communities need representation more than many other communities.</P>
      <P>Despite the selfless work and efforts of community groups, not least the Cherry Orchard Development Council, the many local youth projects and football clubs, the area has major social problems, including heroin addiction.  These principally stem from massive unemployment.  In response to a parliamentary question I put down on 22 December 1995, I was told that 50.5 per cent of the labour force in Cherry Orchard C district was unemployed.  This community of 5,500 people and 1,200 households is without a school and has virtually no community facilities other than a small community centre and a church. That is a recipe for despair which often results in people succumbing to heroin and other drug addiction.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of people in the area are decent.  They detest drug dealers and want a future for their children.  Nevertheless, the image provided by many of them has shocked me.  I felt obliged to bring it to the attention of the House.</P>
      <P>Sections of the community of Gallanstown, Cherry Orchard, are under siege from drug dealers.  The bulk of Dublin's heroin is being shifted to areas such as Gallanstown and parts of Cherry Orchard due to community action elsewhere. Many of the city's drug users converge on this area by train, bus and taxi, and even on foot, to get their heroin supply.  Addicts are openly using needles on buses, terrifying regular passengers. They have been seen waiting in groups for their heroin supply to arrive by Arrow train at the Cherry Orchard station.  Convoys of taxis carrying addicts converge nightly on the area, despite special Garda checkpoints.</P>
      <P>Despite Operation Dóchas, Garda manpower is inadequate and the active Garda drug unit, which is small but very effective, has been overwhelmed by the scale of the drug problem.  I am told by local people that drug dealing is organised openly and in public view in many parts of the area.  The vast majority of decent people in the community live in isolation and fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> Some years ago I warned of the threat of drugs to the centre of Dublin.  That warning was ignored and I was accused of false exaggeration. I hope that is not what I will hear following what I have said about this area of Cherry Orchard.  If adequate action is not taken this community will be overtaken by drug dealers.</P>
    <P>My recommendations include the redeployment of Garda forces in the areas in numbers sufficient to meet and remove the threat.  Dublin Corporation's area action plan must be speeded up to provide urgently needed amenities.  Local industrial development land must be specially designated to get local jobs now.  The plans by the Department of Education for a national school and by the Eastern Health Board for a nursery must be speeded up.  There must be an immediate resolution by Dublin Corporation regarding the derelict new houses at Gallanstown extension. The small minority of drug dealing tenants involved in heroin dealing must be removed from the estate.</P>
    <P>These are minimum requirements to help this community resist drugs.  If they are all to be enforced there must be an interagency co-ordinating group made up of the Department of Justice, Dublin Corporation, the heath board and the other agencies, including the Garda Síochána, to bring them together and to ensure speedy implementation in support of the community.  Only coordinated action of this type will help save it, drive out the drug dealers and eliminate the threat posed by heroin.  This community of 5,500 people is at the cross-roads.  It deserves the Government's full support and assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the serious economic and social conditions in Gallanstown.  I listened with interest to the Deputy and I will take the necessary steps to have these serious allegations investigated.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the provision of services for drug misusers in the Gallanstown area, is aware of the serious drug problem there.  A recent trend is the large number of young people smoking heroin.</P>
      <P>The board is in the process of establishing new treatment facilities in a building which is in the same locality as its Aisling Clinic.  At present, the clinic is working to capacity, providing services seven days per week to approximately 150 people from the general catchment area.  The new facilities will provide treatment, counselling and family therapy, especially for young heroin smokers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, the treatment required for heroin smokers is an eight-week intensive programme which includes much family support.  The Eastern Health Board is also in discussion with Cherry Orchard Help Against Drugs, a community group which operates in the area, with a view to this group providing further support and back-up to the statutory services.  The health board is fully supportive of the group's efforts to establish itself <Col N="782" /> more strongly, as it will provide assistance to the board with family support and rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>One of the health education officers, newly recruited by the Eastern Health Board, will work in the Cherry Orchard area, providing education and training to young people and their parents. This officer will also liaise with Cherry Orchard Help Against Drugs and any other community and voluntary groups working in the area to involve them in a concerted action aimed at preventing young people turning to drugs in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the drugs problem and I am aware that Ballyfermot, which encompasses Gallanstown, has been identified by the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs, of which I am a member, as a priority area for attention.  In order to implement the recommendations of the task force's first report, which was published last October, a local drugs task force has been established in the area and is working at present on the development plan to combat the drug problem.</P>
    <P>A significant development in recent times has been the positive support of local communities for locally-based initiatives.  I hope this support continues, as it is only with integrated action that efforts to stem the rising problem of drug misuse can be addressed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the problem at St. Aidan's primary school in Enniscorthy. With due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, I am disappointed that the Minister for Education has again refused to come to the House to reply to a matter on the Adjournment. However, that is not unknown for the Minister because I have raised numerous education matters on the Adjournment but she has not had the courtesy to reply to any of them.</P>
      <P>Enniscorthy CBS and Presentation Convent schools amalgamated in 1994 to form St. Aidan's national school.  There is usually uproar in towns where amalgamations take place but with the cooperation of the parents, teachers and the local representatives the amalgamation in Enniscorthy went smoothly.  However, it was based on certain commitments from the Minister for Education that the upgrading of toilets and the heating system, the insulation of the building, the implementation of the fire officer's report and the modernisation of some parts of the school would take place.  In 1994 in the early days of the school, the management received a letter from the Minister's office stating that all the work should be carried out without undue delay.  However, three years later nothing has happened.  The parents, teachers and pupils feel betrayed by the Minister and the Department of Education because they have continuously refused to honour the commitments given at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> Hygiene at the school is inadequate due to an old toilet system which needs to be upgraded. The heating system is inadequate to heat the school and most of the heat produced is lost.  During last week's cold spell, the temperature in the school was nine degrees Celsius.  The acceptable minimum level of heating in classrooms, as agreed by the Department of Education and teachers, is 16 degrees Celsius.  The students were forced to wear their coats in the classrooms and that is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The parents and teachers are angry.  A public meeting in the school on Monday night was attended by almost 300 parents and they outlined to the Department of Education and politicians that they are not prepared to tolerate this situation any longer.  There will soon be a strike by the teachers and the children will be withdrawn from the school by their parents because of the lack of understanding by the Department of Education. Idle promises are no use to the teachers and parents of St. Aidan's national school, Enniscorthy. They want action by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Government is giving out millions of pounds daily to different parts of the country but St. Aidan's national school requires only £400,000 to upgrade it to modern standards.  We are not asking for something out of reach; £400,000 is a small amount of money.  More importantly, the Minister gave a commitment in 1994 that if the CBS and the Presentation Convents schools amalgamated, she would ensure without delay the modernisation of the school.  However, nothing has happened and the Minister stands indicted on this matter.</P>
    <P>The parents and teachers have a plan of action for the coming weeks, including a protest outside the school.  They have also been asked to write to all the Deputies in the county and to visit their clinics.  A public meeting will be held on 18 February in Enniscorthy and if the Minister has not given a commitment by then regarding the work at the school, serious action will be taken by the parents and teachers.  This will include the withdrawal of the children from the school or one day strikes by the teachers.  I ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister for Education the serious concerns of the parents and teachers of St. Aidan's national school, Enniscorthy, to ask her to deal with the matter promptly and to honour the commitments she gave in early 1994 when the amalgamation took place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the Deputy's opening remarks, I point out that I am replying to the debate as Minister of State at the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline the Department's position regarding St. Aidan's national school, Enniscorthy, County Wexford. The school is an amalgamation of the Presentation Convent and CBS national schools, Enniscorthy, and has a current staffing level of a principal <Col N="784" /> and 30 assistant teachers with an enrolment of 705.  It is housed in two buildings with accommodation of 25 classrooms, a general purposes room and ancillary accommodation.</P>
    <P>When the two schools amalgamated, it was agreed that refurbishment works would take place on a phased basis.  Improvement works have been carried out on a continuing basis at the school over the past two years.  These works have received grant sanction at a rate of 95 per cent from my Department.  A total of £139,776 has been sanctioned to date and I reject the suggestion that the school is in a deplorable condition. I am aware that there are remaining works to be carried out at the school and for this reason my Department has combined the works into one major project which was included in the 1996 capital programme.</P>
    <P>There is a major electrical and heating job involved in these outstanding works for which a consulting engineer has been appointed.  The engineer has completed a survey of the school's electrical and heating systems and a scheme has been prepared.  Further inspections have taken place at the school and costings have been submitted for the works involved.  However, the House will appreciate that a decision on the timing of the tender and contract process must be taken in light of existing contractual commitments and the funds which will be available in 1997.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by my Department's technical advisers that due to the nature and extent of some of the works, it would be desirable to undertake them during a period when the school is closed, ideally during the summer holidays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the Government's outrageous decision to agree at the EU Council of Ministers meeting in Dublin Castle on 16 and 17 December last to the proposal which slashed the butter voucher scheme by half.  This decision could have been prevented if the Government cared.  The worst impact of the decision will be felt by families.  For example, a family with five children who previously received 14 butter vouchers a month will now only receive seven vouchers a month.</P>
      <P>I went to the Library and examined the regulation and the report of the Commission to the Council of Ministers' meeting.  It states that the scheme was working well and created a good image for the Community in Ireland.  A European Commission report of 6 December 1996, ten days before the Dublin Castle meeting, concluded that a reduction in consumption could result in sales of butter into intervention.  It continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> Furthermore, a withdrawal of this long standing benefit to the less well of sectors of society, for example, unemployed people and old age pensioners, could hardly be defended from a social, market or economic point of view.</P>
    <P>This is a report of the European Commission to the Council of Ministers during the Irish Presidency. It continued:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the favourable public perception of a Community scheme promoting butter sales should not be neglected.</P>
    <P>That is a direct quote from the report received from the Commission.  The report goes on to say: &ldquo;Nevertheless they recommended that the maximum quantity eligible per beneficiary each month should... be reduced from 1kg to 0.5 kg.&rdquo; That is not a logical conclusion.  It could easily have been contested.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, failed to act to protect and maintain what is a hugely successful scheme, which benefits more than 850,000 people on social welfare payments, 450,000 direct beneficiaries and 405,000 dependants.  These are means tested payments made to people on the lowest income.</P>
    <P>At a time when the European Community is awash with an ever-increasing butter mountain following a drop in consumption in recent years, it is incomprehensible and utterly indefensible that the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, did not fight tooth and nail against the butter-slashing proposal which emanated from the Commission early last December.  The course of action taken by the Minister is even more alarming considering that every day farmers throughout the country literally pour fresh milk down the drain because of the super levy.  It is obscene that no action has been taken by the Government to reduce such monstrous waste.</P>
    <P>In reply to parliamentary Questions Nos. 42 and 146 of today, the Minister stated he is making special arrangements to ensure that milk quota restrictions fall least heavily on small producers. In this case butter vouchers are being taken from people who depend on the Government to defend them.  If the Minister and his Government colleagues do nothing to revert such a disastrous decision of the Irish Presidency, we in Fianna Fáil, on return to office, will take up the issue.  In the meantime we will continue to demand the full restoration of the butter voucher scheme.  We will present without delay a watertight argument to the European Commission for the complete reinstatement of this essential scheme.  We will revoke this decision when we return to power.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry have abjectly failed to fulfil their responsibilities to those in greatest need in the community, but Fianna Fáil will not fail them.  I note that neither the Minister for Social Welfare nor the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry <Col N="786" /> came in tonight to defend their actions. Instead they sent the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan to represent them.  The Minister for Social Welfare washed his hands of the scheme and, pointing to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, said we should blame him. The responsibility lies with the Minister for Social Welfare who operates the scheme.  It is unacceptable that the number of vouchers is being reduced from 22 million to 11 million, with a reduction in payment from £9 million in 1995 to £4.5 million.  The poorest people are those who are hit by this disastrous decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme is fully funded by the European Union without any national Exchequer contribution.  It is one of a range of EU market measures designed to support the butter market.  The social assistance butter scheme, although open to all member states, is availed of only in Ireland where it has operated since 1978.  Recipients of non-contribution assistance payments under the Department of Social Welfare and Department of Health schemes are issued with vouchers for use when purchasing butter.  Dependants of the beneficiary are also covered by the scheme.  Each voucher is currently worth 52p against a pound of butter.  Vouchers may be used only against the purchase of butter as defined in EU legislation and, hence, low fat, mixed fat and non-dairy fat spreadable products are not eligible under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since 1988 the relevant EU legislation requires the European Commission to review the scheme every two years and to report to Council on the possibility of continuing it for a further two years. Following its most recent review the Commission concluded the scheme could continue until 31 December 1998 at the existing rate of subsidy, but that in view of the decline in Irish butter consumption levels the eligible quantity should be halved.  Since the eligible quantities were originally fixed under the scheme, <i>per capita</i> butter consumption has fallen by two thirds and now stands at less than one pound per month.  It is startling to note that 15 years ago the Irish market consumed in the region of 40,000 tonnes of butter per annum and that has now fallen to 13,000 tonnes.  With the reduced entitlement, beneficiaries will be able to purchase at a reduced price one pound of butter per month for themselves and one for each of their eligible dependants.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the importance of the scheme for the less well off and it was out of that concern that Ireland sought to have the scheme extended on the most viable basis possible.  However, in the circumstances and particularly given the significant reduced level of Irish butter consumption, realistically it will not be possible to have this decision reversed.</P>

      <P>The proposed dump by Nirex at Sellafield is a cause of great concern in Ireland and England.  Various leaked reports prove the site is unsuitable for a variety of reasons, some of which were raised by the Government at the public inquiry in England.  It is important waste management companies demonstrate that the worst case scenario will never happen, but they fall far short of proving that.  There are rumours that £50 million worth of contracts were signed for the next stage of this development, even before planning permission has been granted.  That is alarming for many people.  We are being drip fed information on this issue.  Those involved are determined to build the dump at Sellafield, although it may take many years to get people to agree to it.  It is obvious from scientific reports that this is probably the worst site for such a dump &mdash; it is definitely not the most suitable one. Site 6 has been shown to be a much more suitable site and should be investigated further.</P>
      <P>I am concerned there is no coherent statement from the Government regarding our position on this matter.  The Minister of State has raised it, but unfortunately the Minister for the Environment said in the House he will not raise it with his counterpart in the British Government, Mr. Gummer.  The matter must be raised at the highest level, if not by the Taoiseach, by the Minister. We are asked to have confidence in an industry in which there have been three accidents in recent days, two at the site at Sellafield and one on a train travelling from France to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The accident happened to a BNFL train in France.  We are being asked to have confidence in an industry that is accident-prone, that has avoided telling the full truth and that has consistently had accidents over the years.  We are to have confidence in a dump they will build that will be left there for thousands of years.  Nobody on this side of the Irish Sea has any confidence in this and the Minister of State should get his senior colleagues in Government to raise this at the highest level with their British counterparts.</P>

      <P>I travelled to Sellafield and THORP some years ago with other Deputies to see what was involved although it had not been <Col N="788" /> commissioned at that time.  After being shown around we were given coffee.  The BNFL people told us they did not expect us to be in favour of Sellafield but asked if we were happier as a result of what we had seen.  I was even more frightened than I was before I had seen it.  They wondered if they would get commissioning and authorisation from their Government to proceed but £3 billion was not going to be spent on a facility that was already built.  Furthermore, 350 people worked there even before the authorisation, practising what they would do when the authorisation came through.  They tried to tell us it was not a foregone conclusion but I felt it was and within months they got their authorisation as we and they knew would happen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eoin Ryan made the point that they are softening us up on this Nirex issue.  There is no doubt that we do not want this nuclear waste disposal on our doorstep and the majority of the British people would not either if they knew what was going on.</P>
      <P>The lesser of the two evils is that it at least be overground; if this is underground we and future generations will never know what is happening. However, it would be better if it was not there. Amazingly, any time there is an incident in the nuclear industry there is never a risk.  The only time a risk was acknowledged was when something like Chernobyl happened; God help us if that happens in Sellafield.  In relation to the smaller incidents, there is never any risk.  When the train was derailed in France this week, there was no risk to the public.  Will the Sellafield authorities ever acknowledge there has been a risk? There has been a cloud of secrecy over this.</P>
      <P>We are not strong enough as a Government. We should bring in the British Ambassador and insist our protest be listened to rather than receive cavalier treatment.  The British Government gave authorisation for THORP on the day of the Joint Declaration.  We do not want this to happen with Nirex and it is up to the Minister of State and the Government to ensure it does not, which we will support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to summarise the Irish Government's objections to an underground laboratory at Sellafield.  Nirex's plans for the development of a rock characterisation facility is the first inevitable step towards an eventual underground waste dump which would represent an unnecessary and unacceptable addition to the extensive and complex operations already in the general Sellafield area.  We have grave concerns about the possibility of a waste disposal facility virtually at the edge of the Irish Sea.  The potential transboundary effects of such a development so near to the Irish coast represent an unacceptable risk to the health, environment and economic wellbeing of the Irish people.  No degree of radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea is acceptable. I consider that the building of a nuclear waste dump near the marine environment is not compatible <Col N="789" /> with the UK's commitments under EU and international law.</P>
      <P>My objections to this dump were outlined at the public inquiry which I attended in January 1996.  I will set out briefly the major points made during the Government's submission to the inquiry.  We contended there has been an absence of a fully open and transparent site selection process with independent review.  The refusal by Nirex to release full information on alternative site options and processes militated against an effective assessment of the potential environmental impact, which would make it impossible to understand the environmental basis on which the choice of location or project was made.  We considered that the environmental statement submitted by Nirex should have addressed all repository options and alternative disposal processes.  We believed the case being made by Nirex for Sellafield as the site for a dump was advanced, not primarily on safety considerations, but on cost and transport advantages and on the assumption that the local community in Cumbria might be more receptive to such a facility.  These core arguments made at the inquiry still stand.</P>
      <P>There has been a spate of media publicity relating to information which has emerged concerning the scientific and economic arguments about this project.  I welcome the debate which this has engendered and regard it as playing a positive role in furthering opposition to the proposal. First, there was the leaked memorandum by Nirex's director of science, which exposed Nirex's considerable doubts about the project's scientific basis.  Second, two reports concerning problems facing a radioactive waste disposal facility at Sellafield &mdash; one edited by R S Haszeldine and D K Smythe and the other by Gordon MacKerron and Mike Sadmicki of Sussex University &mdash; suggest that there is insufficient convincing evidence that a safety case could be made which would justify development of a rock characterisation facility at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend there was the further media story identified by Deputy Eoin Ryan.  As I understand it, this media coverage refers to two in a series of more than 40 reports provided by Nirex to the UK Environment Agency &mdash; formerly the HMIP.  The Environment Agency is the UK authority to which Nirex would eventually submit an application for an authorisation to build the dump which would hold the intermediate and low level radioactive waste.  The reports have been submitted to the UK Environment Agency to allow it to prepare for a formal application by Nirex to dispose of radioactive waste eventually.  It is a way of speeding up the decision-making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports mentioned deal with hydro-geological matters and probabilistic risk assessment. I understand that the Environment Agency persuaded Nirex to make the reports available to the public and that these reports were disclosed to all interested parties at the planning inquiry which I attended in Cumbria.  However, the recent publicity <Col N="790" /> surrounding the reports has heightened the perception of serious scientific and economic pitfalls associated with pressing ahead with this rock laboratory.</P>
    <P>Taking all the above into account and given the prospect of a decision by the Secretary of State, Mr. Gummer, I wrote to him yesterday reiterating Ireland's strenuous objections to the Nirex proposals and highlighting the fact that there has been an absence of a fully open and transparent site selection process with independent review.  I indicated that this made it impossible to understand the environmental basis on which the choice of location for the project, so near to the Irish Sea, was made.  I called for the plan to be abandoned and maintained that more research should be undertaken into alternative sites and disposal options which would avoid an environmental threat to the Irish Sea.  I urged him to refuse Nirex's appeal or, at the very least, to reopen the inquiry so that the many scientific and geological factors which have come to light could be properly assessed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to tell the House that I have been informed today that the UK Government has decided to engage in a public consultation process about a whole series of additional information which has come to light in the recent past about the Nirex proposal, in effect reopening the inquiry.  My Department will be included in this consultation process.  As I understand it, the results of this new consultation will eventually be considered by the UK Secretary of State for the Environment when he adjudicates on the Nirex appeal.  Accordingly, my Department will now examine this new area of consultation and elaborate as necessary on our strenuous opposition to the Nirex proposal because of the significant risks which it represents.</P>
    <P>I have previously made firm commitments about the Government's determination to prevent this dump being located at the Sellafield site.  Any objective observer would agree that the Government has done all in its power to vigorously press its case and to influence decision making by the UK authorities.  My own appearance at the public inquiry and the forceful arguments put to the inquiry on Ireland's behalf are a measure of that steadfast approach.  We will not shrink from pursuing the case further if the rock characterisation facility is approved and we will draw on the best scientific and legal advice to advance that case.  I have sought an early meeting with the UK ambassador to discuss all aspects of the UK nuclear industry, including recent developments relating to Nirex.</P>
    <P>The Deputy opposite may feel that he is not up to the task of dealing with this issue.  If he wants to hand over his brief to his party leader, that is a matter for him.  If he is confused, it is under-standable given his party's senior spokesperson, Deputy Dempsey, is cosying up to BNFL in private meetings in Dublin and accusing the Government of megaphone diplomacy while <Col N="791" /> Deputy Eoin Ryan accuses us of not shouting loud enough.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I have the committed support of the Government for the effective course of action I have pursued which has led to an international debate on the nuclear question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When it was subsequently being vetted, it was discovered that certain points of information had been omitted from the original application and the applicant was allowed to make an amendment to the original application to clarify that it had not lodged an application in any other member state and that the country of origin of the beef was Australia.  Two amended documents giving this information were submitted to the Department and associated with the original application.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 33, 45, 48, 60, 61, 63, 64, 72 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The range of breeds available in Ireland is adequate to meet the diverse needs of the industry and the marketplace.  There is a multiplicity of beef breeds available in Ireland and there is an open policy in regard to the importation of breeds from other countries.  In the circumstances I do not consider there is a compelling requirement for the development of new breeds.</P>
      <P>The key to future progress lies in the expansion of the national cattle breed improvement programme and an upgrading of the systems for genetic evaluation.</P>
      <P>The current national programme for the genetic improvement of the beef herd involves the following components; on-farm recording of weight for age and linear assessment in pedigree beef herds; central performance testing in the tully performance test station selected young pedigree bulls; central progeny testing of bulls in AI for growth and carcase traits and ease of calving; importation of superior genetic material from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The on-farm recording and central performance testing are carried out by the Department in co-operation with approved breed societies while the progeny testing is carried out directly by the AI organisations under the supervision of the Department.  All of the data is analysed by the Department to provide genetic evaluations of potential breeding animals.  This programme provides <Col N="796" /> reliable information which enables the selection of breeding stock of reasonably high genetic merit particularly through AI.</P>
    <P>Given the increasingly competitive nature of the marketplace for beef and greatly liberalised trading in breeding stock it is recognised that upgrading of the national breeding programme is required.</P>
    <P>There is broad agreement on the need for the establishment of an industry led national cattle breeding authority and proposals to bring this about are well advanced.  It is envisaged that this authority would put in place expanded recording, testing and genetic evaluation systems to facilitate genetic improvement in the beef herd.</P>
    <P>Over £2 million is provided in the measure for the improvement of cattle breeding infrastructures included in the current EU assisted operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry.</P>

      <P>The new regulations for the transport of cattle by sea from Ireland which I introduced last February contain detailed criteria for the approval of cattle ships.  Inspections of vessels are carried out by veterinary inspectors of my Department accompanied by independent marine consultants nominated by my Department and the Department of the Marine.  Vessels which comply with the criteria in the regulations are approved for a period of 12 months after which a further inspection is necessary.  Every opportunity is given to ship-owners to make improvements where defects are noted during the initial inspection. In such cases, follow-up inspections are carried out, if requested by the owner, to verify that improvements have been carried out before approval can be given.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are nine vessels which meet the requirements of the regulations and are approved for the transport of cattle by sea from Ireland.  These vessels have a combined capacity for the carriage of about 15,000 animals.  I understand that another two vessels were found on inspection to have a number of features that required correction before they would be in a position to comply with the new regulations.  Five other vessels that were inspected have not been approved.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to publish details of the results of inspections as such information is confidential to the Department and the ship-owners.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the serious losses suffered by a number of hill-sheep farmers in the Nire Valley, County Waterford, in March 1996.  I arranged for my Department to ensure that <i>Force Majeure</i> provisions of the relevant EU Regulations were applied to allow payment of the ewe premium, rural world premium and headage payments, valued at £30.50 per head.  The consent of the EU Commission has been secured to enable these payments be made on a once off basis for 1996.</P>
      <P>The situation in 1982 is not comparable with the Nire Valley case.  Six hundred and ninety thousand pounds emergency aid was provided by the European Commission to Ireland in 1982 when wide spread blizzard conditions caused extensive disruption throughout the country. Costs incurred as a result of the blizzard were in the order of £66 million of which £2 million was incurred in the agriculture sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>Having received the recommendations of the milk quota review group following its meeting in early January, I have announced the details of the 1997 milk quota restructuring and temporary leasing schemes.</P>
      <P>In deciding the conditions for the 1997 restructuring scheme I was mindful of the success of this scheme over the years in redirecting quota to priority category producers, in particular to smaller-scale producers and new entrants.  The 1997 scheme again makes special provision for these producers and indeed goes further by recognising the especially difficult position of young farmers who have entered dairying for the first time in recent years.</P>
      <P>The maximum price for restructured quota will be £1.75 per gallon &mdash; as against £2 per gallon last year.  This is a fair one which reflects both the realities of the market and also the situation of potential purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining the temporary leasing scheme conditions for 1997, I have also reduced the maximum price from 30p to 27p per gallon. Smaller-scale producers will be given priority and within that category special priority will be given to producers with a track-record of participation in this scheme over the years.  I have accepted the recommendation of the quota review group that medium-sized quota holders who have also demonstrated their dependence on temporary leasing should be given some priority also.  For this reason, I decided that the available pool would be split on a 75:25 basis between producers under <Col N="803" /> 35,000 gallons and producers between 35,000 and 55,000 gallons respectively.</P>
    <P>The closing date for the first stage of the temporary leasing scheme will be 30 April 1997, thereby ensuring that producers will be aware of the bulk of their 1997 quota entitlement as early as possible in the new quota year.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other measures which are already in place and which will continue to direct quota to the most deserving producers namely ring-fencing of quota in the disadvantaged areas and the clawback provisions on land leases and sales.  Both these measures have proven very successful and I have thus decided to retain them.</P>

      <P>I can give no assurance that detrimental effects of currency devaluations will not occur in the future.</P>
      <P>Tomatoes, in common with most fruit and vegetables, are the subject of a common organisation of the market and member states of the European Union are precluded from providing assistance out of national resources.  The principal influence on tomato prices is the supply-demand situation in the Community rather than currency fluctuations.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EC) 2611/95 of 25 October 1995 provided for the possibility, subject to European Commission approval, of national aid being granted in compensation for losses of agricultural income caused by monetary movements in other member states since the beginning of the 1994-95 marketing year and no later than 31 December 1995.  The latest date for notification to the European Commission of any proposed aid project under Regulation 2611/95 was 30 June 1996.  I understand that only two member states, Belgium and France, provided national aid under this regulation, none of which was in respect of horticulture.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that there was a considerable improvement in tomato prices in 1996 as compared with 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the reform of the common agriculture policy in 1992, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is obliged under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3508/92 to establish an integrated administration and control system (IACS).  A specific requirement of the system is the development of an alpha-numeric land parcel identification system (LPIS) for all land parcels which are the subject of an area aid application. The original deadline for implementation of the system was 1 January 1996.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this was an extremely large project involving over 130,000 farmers who between them submitted just under 500,000 maps comprising some 750,000 land parcels.  Given the size of the project and the short timeframe within which to complete it, it was almost inevitable that some problems would arise with its introduction last year.</P>
      <P>However, those problems which arose on the 1996 area aid applications have been addressed. Amendments identified on the 1996 area aid applications are being taken into account in updating the system for my Department which is in contact with those farmers affected with a view to having the position clarified in time for 1997. As part of the update for 1997, validation of the land parcel identification system against aerial photography is taking place.</P>
      <P>My Department will commence issuing maps to farmers in mid-March 1997 in time for submission of 1997 area aid applications.  As a further improvement on last year, these updated maps will be printed against a photographic background and will be centred on individual farms rather than on a townland as was the case last year.</P>
      <P>While the LPIS, as with any mapping system, will be subject to ongoing amendment, I am satisfied that the additional development of the LPIS over the past year will eliminate the majority of the problems experienced by farmers when it was first introduced.</P>

      <P>In recent months, my Department has been working on providing improved computer facilities in relation to the identification and tracing of bovine animals.  In that regard I am glad to say that a new on-line computer facility, known as the animal location file (ALF) is about to be made available to the Department's veterinary control and certification staff throughout the <Col N="807" /> country.  The animal location file will include animal data from the following sources: database of headage-premium schemes; animals recorded in ERAD special category herds; animals registered under the calf birth registration scheme introduced in early 1996; animals slaughtered at meat plants and at local abattoirs; animals exported live.</P>
      <P>The animal location file will clearly give a wide range of information on significant numbers of individual bovine animals for use by my officials, thus enabling us to provide significant additional reassurances as regards the origin and status of our cattle and beef.</P>
      <P>The system will contain a comprehensive snapshot record of each animal without necessarily listing each individual movement.  The latter is an important and necessary feature of a fully comprehensive cattle traceability system and is the next element to be introduced.  In that regard I am considering what arrangements should be put in place to record movements on and off farms and via marts.  I envisage that as from a date to be decided later this year, farmers and others disposing of and acquiring bovine animals will have to notify the details of each animal's movement to my Department for recording on the computer database.  Such an animal movement notification system would be immediately preceded by the taking of a national census of all herds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In early January, Egypt banned the importation of live cattle from Ireland and a number of other countries for a period of six months.  They also introduced new veterinary certification requirements in respect of boneless beef.  Following representations made to the Egyptian authorities at the highest level, a veterinary delegation visited Ireland late last month to examine the situation on the ground.  During their visit the delegation <Col N="808" /> conducted a detailed review of our control arrangements.  They expressed their satisfaction with the stringency of the measures which we have taken to combat BSE, the rigour of our control system and the contamination free status of our beef.  They indicated, however, that they were purely an advisory body and that the authorities in Cairo would make the final decision.</P>
    <P>The current position is that the Egyptian authorities are still considering the report of the veterinary delegation.  I am monitoring the situation very closely and I am pressing for an early and favourable decision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The charter of rights for farmers which I introduced four months after taking office as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is a clear commitment by me, by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and by the staff of my Department to a quality, user-friendly service. I am satisfied that the charter is working well and that the farming community welcomes the improved service it is receiving.</P>
      <P>The charter envisaged a programme of substantially improved services to farmers.  The payment targets set for 1995 and 1996 have been largely met and in some cases exceeded.  Record direct payments in excess of £900 million were made to farmers in 1996.  This was an increase of over 20 per cent on 1995 payments which were themselves a record.  Significant progress has been made on improving office accommodation in all our offices in line with the commitment to providing confidential office consultations for farmers and better accommodation for staff.  In this context work commenced late last year on a £4 million extension and refurbishment to our offices in Castlebar and new local offices are being built in a number of counties.  I was also pleased to announce the placing of the contract for the construction of new decentralised offices for the Department at Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.  In addition an improved telephone system is being installed in our local offices.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The commitment to establish an appeals unit was met on target and I am pleased to say that this is working well.  The review group to monitor the implementation of the charter has been established and is meeting quarterly.  The farm organisations are represented on this group and I believe that this provides a very useful forum to monitor progress on all commitments given in the charter.</P>
    <P>In the light of progress achieved, I am disappointed that due to industrial relations difficulties, the charter commitment of having an information desk, or one-stop-shop in place in every local office has not yet been achieved.  However, the introduction of this service has been agreed in the context of a restructuring deal which is now being considered by staff of the union concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Protocol concluded with the Russian veterinary authorities in October last, meat derived from cattle from three counties, Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, is currently excluded from the Russian market.  An additional five counties, Cavan, Donegal, Limerick, Meath and Wexford, will be added to that list with effect from 10 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is in constant contact with the <Col N="810" /> Russian authorities regarding the operation of the ban.  While the recent addition of five counties is extremely regrettable, it is important to note that a formula for the lifting of the restrictions has been agreed.  The Protocol provides for a review of the situation every three months and the next such review is due to take place in May. In the interim the Russian side have reiterated their strong commitment to continued trade in beef from Ireland and I am assured that normal trading arrangements will be restored as soon as there is evidence that the level of BSE has peaked in Ireland and the number of cases has declined.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the full Russian demand for Irish beef in 1997, which will be significant, will be met by counties not involved in the restrictions and that there will be no negative impact on cattle prices or on the beef export trade as a result.  I would also point out that there are no restrictions on the supply of livestock or beef from the excluded counties to other markets.</P>

To date, only 469 of the 6,600 approximately who have been checked have been found to have failed to comply in full with all of their undertakings within a year or more of receiving payment and penalties ranging from 5 per cent to 100 per cent of payment have been imposed.  Of these some 90 are the subject of an appeal under the Department's appeals system. The most common level of penalty is 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this control system is ensuring compliance with the scheme's regulations. This is evident from the results to date of the compliance checks, the level of which I will keep under review.</P>

      <P>Measures adopted by the Council of <Col N="811" /> Agriculture Ministers in October 1996 obliged member states to introduce an early marketing premium scheme for veal calves or the calf processing scheme.  As Ireland has no veal industry we are obliged under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2222/96 to introduce the calf processing premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Nine EU export licensed meat premises have been selected as processing centres and are now in a position to implement the scheme.  A processing premium of 120 ecu is payable on male dairy breed calves and 150 ecu on beef breed calves which are less than 20 days old.  The premium will be paid only on animals which are in a fit and healthy condition on presentation and are processed in conformity with the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The objective of the calf processing premium scheme and the early marketing premium scheme for veal calves is to reduce by one million the number of calves available for beef production. This number is equivalent to about 350,000 tonnes of beef per annum within the EU.  The purpose of this measure is to assist in bringing the market into balance, thereby assisting producer prices to recover to reasonable levels and orderly marketing to be restored within the EU and internationally.</P>

      <P>A total of £873 million in direct payments was used by the central statistics office in the calculation of its Advance Estimate of Agricultural Output, Input and Income which was published on 9 December 1996.  This represented just over 42 per cent of estimated farm income &mdash; income from self employment and other trading income &mdash; in 1996.</P>
      <P>An updated estimate of Agricultural Output, Input and Income is due to be published by the CSO on 6 February 1997.  This estimate will include a revised figure for direct income payments which will be in excess of £900 million.  This will affect the proportion of income represented by direct payments but until the revised income figure is released it is not possible, of course, to say to what extent it will be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proportion of direct EU payments made to farmers annually arises under the scheme of compensatory allowances which operates in the disadvantaged areas.  Under that scheme higher payments are already made to farmers in the more <Col N="812" /> severely disadvantaged areas.  In addition, I forwarded proposals to the European Commission in October 1996 for the creation of a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas.  This category will include areas, mainly in the west, where it can be shown that the disadvantage is more extreme than in other more severely handicapped areas.  When approved, this proposal will give additional payments to farmers in the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>Everything possible is being done to get the recent cut in export refunds for beef reversed. The decision to cut refunds was taken by the EU Commission in order to reduce the demand for export licences because they believed that the level of applications was excessive relative to the quantity allowed under the GATT agreement. Licences totalling 60,000 tonnes had been sought on the day prior to the decision.  I have made it clear to the Commission that these cuts are unjustified and unnecessary at a time when the income situation of beef producers is still under severe strain.</P>
      <P>I have proposed an alternative approach to the Commission for controlling the demand for export licences in a fairer and more effective manner, thereby allowing the refunds to support market prices at reasonable levels.  This issue was raised at the Council of Ministers meeting in January and support was forthcoming from a number of member states for a quick reversal of the decision.  The Taoiseach has raised the matter directly with the Commission President, Mr. Santer, and he has also written to him seeking an immediate increase in the refunds.  The fact that the Commission have acceded to my request to reduce the validity period of licences to 30 days as a method of controlling applications in order to stay within the GATT limits is a first step in this process to get the refunds increased to their former level.  I will maintain pressure on the Commission and seek the continued support of my colleagues in the Council of Ministers to get a quick reversal of the decision.</P>

      <P>The Government remains gravely concerned at the continuing deterioration of the political and human rights situation in Burma.  During the Irish Presidency of the European Union I expressed EU concerns in a forthright manner to the Burmese Foreign Minister, Ohn Gyaw, in meetings with him in Jakarta in July and New York in September.  Following the failure of the Burmese authorities to make any significant response to the EU's representations, the Council of the European Union adopted, on 28 October 1996, an EU Common Position on Burma which provides for a ban on entry visas to EU member states for senior members of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and their families as well as for senior members of the military or the security forces who formulate, implement or benefit from policies that impede Burma's transition to democracy, and their families; and the suspension of high-level bilateral govenmental visits to Burma.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Common Position recalls the action that has already been taken by the EU i.e. the expulsion of all military personnel attached to the diplomatic representations of Burma in EU member states and the withdrawal of all military personnel attached to diplomatic representations of EU member states in Burma; an embargo on arms, munitions and military equipment; and the suspension of non-humanitarian aid or development programmes.</P>
      <P>The EU Common Position states further that its implementation will be moniored by the council and in the light of developments in Burma, further measures may need to be considered.</P>
      <P>Apart from the embargo on arms and military equipment, there is at present no trade restriction on Irish companies trading with Burma. However, CSO trade figures indicate that Ireland's trade with Burma is minimal.  In 1995 it amounted to only £1.6 million made up of £1.3 million in exports and £0.3 million in imports.</P>
      <P>If NGO's are aware of private companies working in such countries it is, of course, open to them to approach these companies with a view to discussing the concerns they have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As they are closely related, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 87, 88, 90, 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Fees for revision applications and for appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation in respect of determinations in respect of such applications were first introduced under the provisions of the 1988 Valuation Act.  Fees for appeals to the newly established Valuation Tribunal were also set under the same Act.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner of Valuation, who has immediate responsibility for the operation of the valuation system, proposed to me last year that a revised application fee of £100 be introduced.  The Commissioner argued: the revision application fee of £20 was too small to deter the blanket listing of properties for revision where there may have been actually no reasonable or substantial grounds to expect that such revision applications would lead to a significant change in rateable valuations; and a higher fee would deter revision applications in respect of properties which pay no rates, particularly domestic property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The blanket listing of properties where a revision application is unlikely to lead to a significant change in their rateable valuation and the listing of properties which are not liable to rates absorb a considerable amount of the Valuation Office's resources.  The new fee level should <Col N="818" /> encourage a more judicious listing of properties for revision, thus allowing the Valuation Office to deploy its resources towards revision applications where substantial issues have arisen and where considerable work is needed.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner also argued that the income from fees represented only a fraction of the operating costs of the Valuation Office.  In 1995 fees for revision applications represented about 7 per cent of the Valuation Office's staff costs. Given that the great bulk of the Valuation Office's resources is dedicated to processing revision applications, I considered that it was reasonable that a greater portion of the Valuation Office's costs should be recovered from its main clients i.e. ratepayers and rating authorities.</P>
    <P>The arguments for increasing the fee for making a revision application also had a direct relevance for fees for making appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation and to the Valuation Tribunal.  Again, quite a considerable amount of valuation office resources are being allocated to processing such appeals.  The objective of the new level of appeal fees is to encourage ratepayers and rating authorities to confine appeals to cases where there are reasonable and substantial grounds for making appeals.  It is also intended that a greater recovery be made of the costs to the Valuation Office of processing appeals.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that fees for revision applications represent a form of double taxation on businesses.  The fees are in respect of a service provided by the Valuation Office.  Ratepayers generally make revision applications in the hope that lower rateable valuations resulting from such applications will produce lower rates liabilities.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that notwithstanding the increases in appeal fees referred to by the Deputy, I have introduced a lower appeal fee level for properties with rateable valuations below £25.  The objective of this lower level is to ensure that the appeals system is accessible for smaller businesses.</P>
    <P>It is a central tenet of the valuation code that the unit of valuation is the tenement and each tenement must be valued separately.  Situations can occur with regard to large commercial and industrial complexes in cities or large towns where the commercial or industrial premises comprises more than one tenement.  Where this occurs, a fee per tenement applies.  This situation rarely occurs with small businesses.</P>

      <P>The bulk of the commercial rateable valuation base of the country is centred, in fact, on the greater Dublin area.  The four Dublin local authorities alone <Col N="819" /> account for 46 per cent of the total commercial valuation base.  The commercial valuation base of counties Louth, Meath, Kildare, Wicklow and Dublin together amount to 54.5 per cent of the total.  Since there is no comparable concentration of commercial property in any other part of the State, I am not satisfied that a sound case exists, on the basis of work load, for the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

The scheme provides that where retirement is on the grounds of permanent infirmity, an additional period of notional service may be added to actual service for benefit calculation purposes.  The amount of notional service which may be added is dependent on the person's age and actual service. In line with the provisions of the scheme, a total of 5.663 years was added to the individual's actual service.</P>
      <P>In awarding benefits in this case, the board advised the individual that in the event of his feeling aggrieved by the amount of the award, he could appeal the matter to the Minister for the Environment who has statutory responsibility for the scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Irish Wheelchair Association submitted a pre-budget submission which was discussed at a recent meeting with officials of my Department. The provision of funding for services to people with physical disabilities is primarily a matter for health boards who make grants to voluntary organisations under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953.  In 1996, health boards made grants amounting to over £1.4 million to the Irish Wheelchair Association for its services.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future,</i> sets out the requirements for the development of services.  The report has been circulated to health boards and officials of my Department are now in discussion with the boards regarding the process of implementing the report.  Also under discussion is the prioritising of services for funding under the additional £1 million provided this year for the development of new services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  This additional funding will be allocated by the health boards on the basis of the agreed priorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note that as well as the £1 million provided for development of new services this year, an additional £2.188 million was built into the health board allocations in 1997 to help put existing services on a more secure financial footing. Of this £350,000 is being provided in respect of Irish Wheelchair Association services.</P>

      <P>From discussions in the steering group dealing with judicial co-operation in civil matters and the responses to a questionnaire it became clear that the requisite level of support was not forthcoming. The reasons given by the other member states for not proceeding further included the following: full implementation of the proposal would be costly, particularly for those member states whose court records were not automated; it was unlikely to be cost effective; for some member states, the proposal would involve legal problems relating to individual privacy and data protection; for certain countries, access to the fact that an action was pending against a firm could adversely affect its commercial reputation and financial standing; the proposal offered little assistance to maintaining the overall effectiveness of the Brussels convention; the database would contain no information on proceedings which would not have a crossborder element; court officials would not always identify proceedings taken under the Brussels convention and this would reflect on the accuracy of the data bases. The responses to the questionnaire from the delegations of the other member states are classified as restricted and, accordingly, I regret that I am not in a position to make them available.</P>

Examination of the preliminary report for the scheme is now proceeding and I hope to be able to make a decision on the matter in the near future.  The scheme is also the subject of an application for Cohesion Fund assistance, made to the European Commission in June 1996, and which has not yet been approved.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties experienced by unqualified early school leavers in finding employment, which were highlighted in the NESF report &ldquo;Early School Leavers and Youth Employment.&rdquo;  An interdepartmental committee is being established to develop a framework with explicit targets to address the issue of early school leaving.  The group will be required to submit its final report to Government by the end of May 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> A fundamental objective in the White Paper: Charting our Education Future is to increase retention rates in education to completion of senior cycle to 90 per cent by the end of the decade.  Progress in the achievement of this target is being made, and rates of retention have increased from 70 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent in 93/94.</P>
    <P>My Department has a range of strategies in place to help prevent early school leaving.  These include the development of Early Start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the new breaking the cycle initiative; the home/school community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; improvements in the quality of teaching and certification systems; the expansion of psychological and guidance services; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees, for necessitous pupils; and the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and the vocational training opportunities scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department provided 2,000 Youthreach places in the vocational education committee sector for unqualified early school leavers in 1996 and a further 1,500 places approximately were provided by FÁS on this programme.  An additional 450 Youthreach places in the vocational education committee sector are now being put in place.  This will bring the combined provision under the programme to 3,950 places. Youthreach is targeted at young people in the 15 to 18 year age group who have left school with no qualifications.  The vocational training opportunities scheme, which provides education and training for unemployed adults has also been expanded to 5,000 places.</P>

This committee is an independent body of five persons, consisting of two officers of my Department and three members from outside my Department, including the chairperson.  The school is seeking that question papers be read to the candidate and that a scribe be available to write down the candidate's answers.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to have the matter considered by the special arrangements appeals committee at their next meeting on 17 February 1997.  The committee's decision will be communicated to the candidate's school as soon as possible after that meeting.</P>

      <P>The details of national schools which amalgamated in the period 1992 to 1996 are contained in the following list which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 70 on Thursday, 30 January 1997 no specific budget is set aside to meet the cost of school amalgamations.  Additional cost arising from amalgamation in respect of areas such as the provision of extra school accommodation or new transport services are met from the overall budgets provided for those areas of expenditure. Accordingly, the information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and I cannot justify assigning scarce staff resources to its compilation.</P>

      <Quest>if she will grant full disadvantaged status to Littleton national school, Littleton, Thurles, County Tipperary; if she will provide a full time remedial teacher and funding appropriate to a disadvantaged area; if the current staff numbers will be retained in spite of a fall of one pupil per class from the retention figure on 30 September 1996; and if she will provide a substantial structural building grant to this school.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.</P>
      <P>A detailed study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre has recommended that disadvantaged area status be confined to 16 per cent of the school going population. The report noted that the current coverage of the scheme is already in excess of 17 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.  Such posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need and subject to available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.  I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances <Col N="837" /> across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service or supports for disadvantaged schools, the needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will receive every consideration.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to state if the current staff numbers will be retained in Littleton national school for the 1997-8 school year.  This is because decisions have not yet been taken regarding the staffing allocations for primary schools for the 1997-8 school year.</P>
    <P>However, as soon as the allocations are determined, officials of my Department will review the position of the school in question, and will correspond directly with the board of management in the matter.</P>
    <P>My Department has no record on file of an application from the school in question for a building grant.</P>

      <P>Following recent discussions with the various interested parties, including regional technical college Cork, on the need for a process to facilitate the growth and evolution of the colleges in the regional technical college sector, I have announced the establishment of a high level group to advise on the criteria which would be applied to the redesignation of a Regional Technical College as an Institute of Technology, including the devolution of responsibility to colleges within the technological sector in relation to the award of qualifications, at various levels, within a national certification framework and the most appropriate means whereby institutions would be independently evaluated in relation to such criteria.</P>

      <P>There are just in excess of 5,000 petitions awaiting decision in my Department.  They are being dealt with in accordance with the criteria indicated in the High Court judgment in the case of Patrick J Brennan v. the Minister of Justice, Ireland and the Attorney General.  The judgment indicates that petitions should be granted only in &ldquo;the rarest of <Col N="838" /> circumstances&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional cases&rdquo;.  I will be issuing new guidelines shortly which will assist both members of the public and public representatives to ascertain whether there is a case for a petition to be considered.  It should be noted that in opening a petition since the Geoghegan judgment, all petitioners are informed that the judgment will be taken into account and that a petition does not prejudice the powers of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Under present arrangements, parents in receipt of one-parent family payment can avail of a number of full-time educational opportunities while retaining full title to their social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The educational opportunities open to people parenting alone consist of the vocational training opportunities scheme run by the Department of Education and which is operated by the vocational education committees around the country, second level certificate courses which involves attendance at any community, comprehensive, secondary or vocational school, and the third level allowance for people who wish to pursue a third level course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> In 1996, improvements were made to the third level allowance run by the Department of Social Welfare whereby students can avail of an annual £100 book grant and lone parent students on reduced rates of payment now receive the maximum rate of one-parent family payment &mdash; currently £79.70 a week for a one child family, rising to £82.70 a week from June next.</P>
    <P>Further improvements in this area were announced in the budget, so that participants on second level certificate courses will now also qualify for the book grant and be paid at the maximum rate where they are currently in receipt of a reduced rate of payment.</P>
    <P>I regard access to educational opportunities as a vital element in enabling lone parents to enhance their self esteem and confidence while also improving their chance of securing employment. While matters relating to educational policy are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Education, I am satisfied that the social welfare system is responding positively to the needs of lone parents in full-time education at this time.</P>

      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is a short-term payment which is designed to provide immediate assistance for those in need.  Assistance may be provided in the form of basic payment, a basic supplement, an exceptional needs payment or an urgent needs payment.  The scheme is administered by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Neither does the legislation allow me to prescribe either the circumstances, or the nature of the need, in respect of which a payment may be made.</P>
      <P>Under section 173 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, persons in full-time employment are excluded from receiving assistance, other than urgent needs payments, under the SWA scheme.</P>
      <P>However, urgent needs payments are only made to meet immediate needs such as food, accommodation and clothing in the aftermath of a fire or flood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the applicant in question is engaged in full-time employment the health board could only <Col N="840" /> consider his entitlement to an urgent needs payment. As the contingency for which he sought assistance is not covered by urgent needs payments his application was refused.  I understand that an appeal was lodged on 14 January, 1997. The appeals officer disallowed the appeal on 23 January, 1997.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>All new employees recruited to the public service after 5 April 1995 are subject to full PRSI rates.  Staff recruited to the public service in a permanent and pensionable capacity prior to that date or who subsequently transfer between areas within the service without a break in service continue to be insured at the modified rates of insurance.</P>
      <P>A person who worked as a temporary teacher over the operative date and who became employed with the same employer in a pensionable capacity without a break in service would then become insurable at the modified rate.</P>
      <P>A primary teacher who is insured at the modified rate and who returns after a career break with the same employer without a break in service would similarly be insurable at the modified rate.</P>
      <P>Regarding the position of primary teachers who were out of the service without contracts on the operative date, they would be insurable at the full rate if they subsequently re-entered primary teaching.</P>
      <P>The measures arose from recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare and were discussed in detail with the staff interests concerned before being applied under the Social Welfare (Modifications of Insurance) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995 (SI No. 77 of 1995).  There are no proposals to change these arrangements.</P>
      <P>Certain transitional provisions were included concerning persons such as garda trainees, armed forces cadets who were serving on the operative date.  Where they subsequently qualified as full officers and without a break in the service, they were then insured at the modified rate.</P>
      <P>In the case of employees of Bord Telecom, the modified rate of contributions only applies to persons who were insured at the modified rate on 5 April 1995.</P>
      <P>Regarding students who entered colleges of education prior to 6 April 1995 they were not in insurable employment.  Neither did such persons have a guarantee of employment after they qualified as teachers after that date and consequently they are insured at the full PRSI rate when becoming employed after the operative date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have set out above the general principles that apply.  However, I would emphasise that a decision in a particular case regarding the PRSI rate of contribution payable can only be given by a deciding officer of the Department after the case is investigated.  This would be particularly necessary in the case of substitute teachers.  If the <Col N="842" /> Deputy has particular cases in mind, I will have these investigated.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that where a person has means the amount payable is equal to the standard rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to the person reduced by £1 for every £1 of means assessable.</P>
      <P>The appropriate maximum weekly rate of long-term unemployment assistance payable to a married couple with one child is £116.20 per week. Accordingly, if their net assessable means following deductions for PRSI, tax, work related travel, medical insurance, and other allowable business expenses were £6,000 a year, the couple would be entitled to a weekly payment of £116.20 less their weekly means of £115 &mdash; £6,000 &mdash; giving a weekly payment of £1.20.  Their maximum weekly rate will be increased to £120.70 in June giving them a weekly rate of £5.70.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 43 of 29 January last from the Deputy, I explained how means from self-employment are assessed after work-related expenses such as travel, PRSI, tax and medical insurance are excluded.  As these vary from case to case, it is not possible to determine the exact amount of unemployment assistance payable in any particular case without all the relevant information.  However, as an example assuming £4,000 expenses to be disregarded the means assessed would be £2,000, giving a weekly unemployment assistance rate of £78.20.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the Department's medical assessors are qualified doctors and have been specially trained to carry out medical reviews and assessments. They operate under the general management of <Col N="843" /> the Department's medical adviser.  The medical assessor does not make an initial diagnosis of a case, as this is already done by the person's own doctor, but provides a medical opinion as to a person's capacity to work.</P>
    <P>The medical assessor reviews the history of the case, considers all available medical evidence, including consultants' reports, carries out a medical examination based on the certified cause of incapacity and expresses an opinion on the extent to which the incapacity, at that point in time, affects the person's ability to work.  Examinations are carried out in a fair, equitable, impartial and independent manner to the highest standards in accordance with accepted medical practice and ethics.</P>
    <P>Following an examination, the opinion of the medical assessor is passed to a deciding officer who decides on the person's eligibility for benefit based on all the available evidence.  If the claim is disallowed the person is notified in writing and advised of his-her right to appeal the decision.  As part of the preparations for an appeal, and to ensure that the case is dealt with as fairly as possible, the person concerned would be examined by another medical assessor.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons called for examination are fully safeguarded. Their own doctors are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit appropriate medical reports including any recent consultants' reports.  In addition, the person's doctor may attend the examination if he or she so wishes.  A nurse attendant is always present during examinations.</P>
    <P>Medical assessors must have at least six year's satisfactory experience in the practice of medicine since registration.  Many of them have specialist qualifications.  All reports of the medical examinations they carry out are submitted to the Department's chief medical officer &mdash; the medical adviser &mdash; for approval.  I am satisfied that the Department can stand over these reports.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will be glad to have it investigated if he supplies the relevant details.</P>

      <P>At present there are a number of schemes available to unemployed people who wish to participate in full-time or part-time educational courses while continuing to retain their social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education operates the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) through the network of Vocational Education <Col N="844" /> Committees (VECs).  This scheme involves a specially designed second level education course which can lead to qualifications such as junior certificate, leaving certificate and certain city and guild certificates.  To qualify under the scheme an unemployed person must be at least 21 years of age and have been unemployed for at least six months.  Participants are paid the equivalent of their unemployment payment directly by the Vocational Education Committee and there is provision also for the payment of certain meal, travel and book allowances.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for some 5,000 VTOS places in the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
    <P>The second level certificate scheme is available to unemployed persons who do not obtain a place on a VTOS course.  Participants may attend full-time second level courses at any community, comprehensive or vocational college provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions for the VTOS scheme.  Up to now participants were entitled to receive a payment equivalent to their appropriate weekly unemployment payment.  However, I was pleased to announce, as part of the budget package, that, in future, participants under this scheme will receive a standard weekly personal rate of payment equivalent to the full unemployment benefit rate, for the duration of their course.  They will also receive a £100 book allowance and will not be required to sign the live register.</P>
    <P>There are 400 people participating in this scheme for the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
    <P>Unemployed people wishing to pursue a third level education course may participate in the third level allowance (TLA) scheme operated by my Department.  To qualify under the scheme a person must be aged 21 years or over and be unemployed for at least six months.  Since October 1996 participants receive a standard weekly personal payment equivalent to the full unemployment benefit rate while attending an approved full-time third level course at any university, third level college or institution.  In addition, they receive a £100 book allowance and are not required to sign the live register.</P>
    <P>To date, some 3,000 people have been approved under this scheme in respect of the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
    <P>An unemployed person who so wishes may attend a part-time education course and retain their entitlement to unemployment payments. People availing of this option must, however, satisfy my Department that they continue to be actively seeking and available for full-time work. There are no statistics available on the numbers availing of this option.</P>

      <P>A submission made to me towards the end of last year by the Irish Hotels' Federation, the Town and Country Homes Association and the Irish Farm Holidays Association on the statutory licensing of all tourist accommodation is currently being examined.</P>
      <P>However, as I have stated in the House on a number of occasions it has been not only my view but also that of my predecessor that the statutory licensing of all tourist accommodation would not be practical nor would it necessarily lead to an improvement in accommodation standards to any great extent.  In addition to potential difficulties as regards policing and prosecution, licensing could in fact also lead to a reduction in the accommodation bank available, particularly during the high season and at festival times.</P>
      <P>At present unapproved operators do not have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the tourist information office network, nor do they have access to tax breaks or other subsidised finance schemes which are available to the approved sector.  The pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas and the subsidised tourism loan schemes were carefully designed so that only approved operators would be eligible.</P>
      <P>Unapproved operators are, on the other hand, obliged to comply in the same way as the approved sector with official requirements, for example, in the areas of taxation, planning, fire and safety, and hygiene.  My Department has been impressing on the relevant enforcement agencies the need for constant vigilance to ensure that their policing or inspection practices do not discriminate as between the approved and unapproved sectors.</P>
      <P>The ideal solution would be for unapproved operators to become approved and I can confirm that both Bord Fáilte and the recognised approving bodies will be mounting an information campaign encouraging operators to seek approval and explaining clearly not only what is involved in terms of procedure but also in terms of the benefits to be gained from being part of the approved tourist accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>The herdowners applied for suckler cow premium on 40 animals four of which were deemed to be in-calf heifers.  The herdowners were deemed to have made an intentional false declaration and were excluded from the suckler cow premium scheme for two years &mdash; 1995 and 1996.  This decision was appealed.</P>
      <P>To progress this appeal, the Department must clarify some outstanding issues with the herdowners.  This is being done at present.  As soon as the investigation is completed, the herdowners will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>In 1996 £7.98 million was paid out in Ireland under the EU set-aside scheme.</P>
      <P>As part of the measures introduced under the CAP reform, a system of compensatory payments for cereals producers was introduced in 1993.  The aid payable was to compensate farmers for the fall in the EU's support prices for their products. The rules of the area aid scheme require farmers who are applying for arable aid on more than 37 acres &mdash; 15.13 hectares &mdash; to put a percentage of their arable land into set-aside, i.e. they must leave the land, which was used to produce a harvestable crop in the previous year, idle.  Strict management rules apply to this land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following table shows the top ten payments <Col N="847" /> made in respect of set-aside in 1996: £30,085.76; £24,701.77, £24,365.05, £23,747.16, £23,108.44, £21,445.69, £21,310.31, £20,834.74, £20,029.40, £17,172.52.</P>

      <P>The number of cases of BSE in each county since the first confirmed case in Ireland in 1989 is set out in the following table.  As far as research into BSE is concerned, a number of research projects has already been completed while projects are under way into areas such as the development of an automated ELISA test, the effects of scrapie infection on gene expression and an in-vitro analysis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy replication.  Other research projects should be initiated shortly under the auspices of the EU non-commissioned food research programme or the fourth framework research programme.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces pensions schemes provide for the payment to a retired soldier of a basic pension in respect of 21 years' service with a special <Col N="852" /> increment for each further year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 31 years' service.  As a general rule, the special increment ceases to be payable when the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The deceased person in question was in receipt of a service pension &mdash; including special increment &mdash; based on 28 years' pensionable service under the Defence Forces pensions schemes. In late September 1994, the Department of Defence became aware that he had been granted a social welfare retirement pension with effect from 2 December 1993.  The special pension increment under the Defence Forces schemes had continued to be paid to him throughout this period thus giving rise to an overpayment of £1,096.85.  The overpayment was being recovered at the rate of £50 per month and, at the time of the person's death on 31 August 1995, the sum of £500 had been recovered.  This left a balance of £596.85 to be recovered from the deceased's estate and the matter is being pursued with the solicitors acting for the estate.</P>
      <P>The pension cheque for September 1995 in the sum of £525.49 was issued after the person's death but this was returned to the Department by the solicitors.</P>
