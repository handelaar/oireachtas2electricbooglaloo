      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8, the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Second Stage (resumed); and No. 9, statements on the 1996 Annual Report of the Ombudsman (resumed).</P>

      <P>I want to ask about the implementation of legislation but, before doing so, let me say we are fortunate that today we are not mourning the deaths of many young people in a very serious accident yesterday.  When is it proposed to implement the Control of Horses Act which was passed in this House some considerable time ago?  Is the Taoiseach aware that county councils in the Dublin area cannot implement that Act because they do not have the resources to do so?  Also, can he tell this House what initiatives are being taken as a result of the summit he held a fortnight ago dealing with traffic and road accidents, and what aggressive advertising campaign is he proposing the Minister for the Environment should involve himself in, in view of the fact that so many people are losing their lives on our roads and that so many are involved in accidents? Nothing is being done by the Government. We are waiting for the Government to do something, and every morning we hear another litany of accidents, deaths and injuries on our roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Owen's remarks. Given what happened yesterday it behoves the Taoiseach to bring before the House proposals from the Government.  Yesterday morning I again raised the continuing concerns about road traffic accidents.  It behoves the Government to introduce proposals to deal with this matter.  A strong message from the Taoiseach and the Government is warranted to stop the mayhem on our roads.  I urge the Taoiseach to make a statement or to provide time for the House to address this matter.</P>

      <P>We could be mourning the deaths of dozens of children this morning following the near catastrophe yesterday.  The House <Col N="846" /> went to much trouble to put in place a Control of Horses Act, which had been demanded for many years by those concerned about the welfare of horses and the dangers posed by animals running loose in housing estates, close to roads and built up areas.  Will the Taoiseach urgently bring together the county managers of the major urban areas where uncontrolled horses are a serious problem to find out why the Act has not been implemented?  He must ensure that the by-laws are in place and managers have the resources to deal with this matter.  This must be done urgently because near misses occur daily in my area and in Cork, Limerick and other urban working class areas where horses are uncontrolled.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Is the Taoiseach aware that parents groups have expressed concern for some time regarding the need to introduce regulations to govern large numbers of pupils on buses?  Regulations are needed to require bus operators to provide safety belts for every passenger and proper supervision of large numbers of school children on buses to ensure the risk of injury or death is minimised if a mishap occurs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, a tragedy did not occur yesterday and I acknowledge the efforts of the Garda and the rescue services who assisted the young people.  It was undoubtedly a close call and on behalf of the House I express sympathy to the many people who regrettably suffered severe injuries.</P>
      <P>Regarding the circumstances of the incident, as Deputies are aware it is not entirely clear whether horses were involved or how the accident happened. Investigations are continuing in that regard.  Regarding the points made by Deputy Spring and Deputy Owen, the initiative which began a number of weeks ago of bringing together all the groups and bodies involved in road safety must be pursued with vigour.  That will be the case and whatever is necessary will be done.  There will be a pre-Christmas advertising campaign and ongoing road safety programmes but they are not enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not make that point just in relation to yesterday's events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of horses legislation has, by and large, been implemented.  From my experience, it is being implemented on the ground to a greater extent than heretofore.  There is a major problem in terms of resources and the microchip tagging which is an essential element.  I raised this issue recently with the Department of Agriculture and Food to ensure that the difficulties surrounding microchip tagging are overcome.  There is also a problem regarding local authorities and the Garda working together to confiscate horses. Many Deputies are familiar with the difficulties which arise when animals are confiscated and <Col N="847" /> placed in pounds.  It is intolerable that when horses are confiscated by the local authority or the Garda and brought some miles away, they are released again almost without difficulty.  That has happened for the last two years, and I have pursued it with the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>Several Members mentioned school transport. Although yesterday's incident did not involve normal school transport, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is already examining the issue of seatbelts and safety, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education has been examining other aspects of school transport in the context of a current review of that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we reflect on the mood in this House if one child had lost his or her life yesterday, never mind dozens?  We came near to that.  I remind the Taoiseach that while there are wider questions regarding coaches and belts as well as implementation of the Control of Horses Act, 1996, there is a more immediate problem.  Yesterday my office was in contact with South Dublin County Council about horses roaming the Lucan area adjacent to the motorway.  I was speaking to a council official an hour before this accident occurred, pointing out the danger of something that later happened.  We must have immediate action about the horses that were roaming Lucan this morning and which were referred to by &ldquo;AA Roadwatch&rdquo;.  The tragedy narrowly averted last night must not happen today or tomorrow while South Dublin County Councils and other local authorities are sitting on their hands.</P>

      <P>I go home via the Lucan Road to Celbridge, and a black horse, which was very hard to see at night, was killed on that road by a car.  I do not know if anyone was injured in that crash, but horses are frequently seen on that road.  All sides of the House share the anxiety about this matter and we would like to see greater enforcement of the Control of Horses Act.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his answer, but we have not been told what will happen. As the Estimates have not been published, will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who is silent apart from when he is trying to spread rumours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a number of deaths were caused in any other area of policy, we would have an urgent debate and take initiatives.  Between 400 and 500 people die on our roads every year and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government does not seem to be taking responsibility.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister for Justice, Deputy &ldquo;ZT&rdquo; O'Donoghue, or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in charge of taking initiatives in this area?  Can both Ministers ensure that their Estimates provide funding to local authorities to erect the required road safety features?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that he understood the Control of Horses Act was being implemented.  To my knowledge, it is not being implemented effectively.  Deputies, particularly those from urban areas, can cite instances where horses wander in herds and where old people are unable to leave their houses in some estates because they are in fear of life and limb because of the lack of control over these horses. Yesterday we avoided an appalling tragedy by the skin of our teeth and we should learn a lesson from that.  We should call in the managers of these councils and demand to know why the legislation is not being implemented and what action is needed, otherwise we will find ourselves mourning a major tragedy in one, two or three months' time.</P>

      <P>As regards what Deputies Owen, De Rossa, Spring and Higgins said, powers exist under the Control of Horses Act but the will must also be there.  Despite what almost happened yesterday, which may or may not have involved horses, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have urged the implementation of these powers.  This problem has gone on for several years.  Deputy Owen <Col N="849" /> will know that the legislation was enacted during her term when unfortunately little was done.</P>

      <P>I raise the position of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill initiated in the House on 1 October to give 20,000 citizens the right to nominate a presidential candidate. Second Stage was passed and it is now a question of when we will take Committee Stage. in view of comments made in relation to the cabinet confidentiality Bill, will the Taoiseach consider taking this Bill in Government time rather than at a select committee so that we may get the job done as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for negotiation between the Whips.  It would not be advisable for the Bill to be rushed through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitution review group which has looked at many of the matters would be the best committee to consider this Bill before we make a final decision.  As the Deputy is anxious to press this Bill, the Whips can discuss how best to move it to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution does not have the powers of a select committee and could not, even if it wanted to, deal with this <Col N="850" /> Bill on Committee Stage.  I suggest that it be dealt with in the House.  All Bills amending the Constitution should be dealt with openly and with sufficient time for debate.  Like all constitutional amendment Bills, this Bill should be dealt with in the House and sufficient time provided for an open debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What legislation has the Taoiseach in mind arising from the Law Reform Commission's report on the Unidroit Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects? Part of the report's commentary deals with the illegal export of antiques and stolen property. Does the Taoiseach intend implementing the proposal in chapter 9 that the Minister for Arts, Culture, Gaeltacht and the Islands be nominated as the person to whom citizens report stolen objects?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach resolved, in the context of the legislative programme, the issue of literary objects?  Will they be covered by separate legislation or by the copyright legislation which is included in the Government programme?  Does Ireland propose, on foot of the strong case made in the Law Reform Commission's report, to sign the convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report will be examined to see what legislation is required.  The Law Reform Commission clearly believes that legislation is required in this area.  If the State is losing valuable antiques and assets we should deal with the matter.  It seems from a brief look at the conclusions of the report that more than one Minister will be involved.  On whether we will sign the convention, I will let the Deputy know the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's positive reply but he has not answered the vexed question on whether literary objects will be covered by copyright or other legislation.  The question of who should resolve this matter has given rise to tension between Departments.  Will literary works, intellectual property, be dealt with separately from the regime governing information technology which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise and Employment and which has a heavy United States influence? A separate regime is needed to protect the rights of writers and artists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at the Deputy's point.  The legislation produced by the Department of Enterprise and Employment contains 400 sections and it will take a considerable time to debate.  I will look at the Deputy's suggestion that we deal with the issue of literary objects separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago the Taoiseach told us that the local government funding Bill would be brought before the House in November. Given that local authorities have begun consideration of their annual Estimates, when <Col N="851" /> will the Bill be brought before the House?  Will he give an assurance that it will be introduced before local authorities conclude consideration of their estimates for 1998?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The key point is that the legislation will not delay the Estimates one way or the other.  The Deputy should be aware of that and should not use it as an argument.  The legislation is in the final stages of preparation and while I still hope it will be introduced in November it might drift into December.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Dick Spring well on the backbenches as he takes his leave as Leader of the Labour Party.  I pay tribute to him for the service he gave as Leader of the Labour Party for 15 years and for the diligent and caring work he undertook in the House on behalf of all people.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the person who answers questions every day from Deputy Spring, I concur with the remarks about him.  Deputy Spring is not leaving the Labour Party or the House and, therefore, we are not paying the usual tributes. He has led his party since the end of 1982 during which time there have been many elections and many trials and tribulations in the political system. He has done an excellent job for the country. During his 15 years as leader of his party he dealt with all matters relating to Northern Ireland and, in addition to his work in other areas, that is something for which he will be remembered.  I wish him, his wife Kristi and his family many years of success.</P>

      <P>No, the Deputy may relax. As anybody who has aspired to or been a party leader will be aware, whether we are talking about a large or small party, it is not an easy task. Neither is it an easy task to make up your mind to go.  Many people depend on leadership. Regardless of the difficulties or disagreements within any party, the cohesion of the party depends to a large extent on the quality of leadership of that party.  It is in that context Deputy Spring has demonstrated his ability, having brought the Labour Party from a point where it was extremely weak, fractious and disunited to one of the largest parties of the left in Irish history, and he deserves great credit for that.  He intends to continue to make a contribution to politics and he is still young enough to return to the job of leader in the future.</P>

      <P>While Deputy Spring is not leaving the Labour Party, it is appropriate to pay tribute to him since he has been leader of that party for so long.  During his 15 years as leader he experienced highs and lows and many of us who have not been that long in the House can learn from the lessons of that time.  As a member of one of the few parties that has not been in Government with the Labour Party, I take it all the people who spoke who have been in Government with him mean every word they said in his praise and that is good enough for me.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach and Deputies Owen, De Rossa and Sargent in paying tribute to Deputy Spring.  It is difficult to imagine that at the age of 47 he has served 15 years as leader of a political party, which must be unique.  The Ceann Comhairle's predecessor, having heard the tributes paid to him, said he might change his mind about leaving, and I do not know if Deputy Spring is tempted to do that. He has been one of the giants of Irish politics for the past 15 years.  He has made an outstanding contribution to public life, particularly in regard to Northern Ireland and bringing peace to this island.  For that, we will all be eternally grateful. I wish him, his wife Kristi and their family the best of luck in whatever they do.  They deserve time together and all our support.  I know Deputy Spring intends to stay around for a long time and to be a thorn in the Government's side.  I am sure he will do that, but we all wish him the best of luck.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle and colleagues, I shall arise and go now.  I am tempted to use Deputy Rabbitte's remark on a late night radio programme when the broadcaster allowed the conversation to go all over the place.  When it came to his turn to speak he said, &ldquo;You had better ask me a question, I can't think of anything to say&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Deputies Owen, De Rossa and Sargent for their kind remarks.  The important thing in politics is to have the last word.  I will try to have a little <i>gravitas</i> and make some weighty remarks because my remarks may not carry as much weight from three or four benches back next week.</P>
      <P>I thank the Clerk of the House and his staff, the Superintendent and the Captain who has never had to have any involvement with me because of my conduct in the House.  In 1944, one of his predecessors had to escort my father from the House, but I shall take my own leave.  I also thank the Head Usher and his staff, the officials and the staff in the restaurant for their assistance.  I have experienced nothing but courtesy from every one of them during the past 16 years.  I hope there will be time for more courtesies during the next 16 years.  I thank the Taoiseach and all his colleagues for their kind remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> I led our party to the best of my ability for the past 15 years.  We have had our difficulties and exchanges, but I would like to believe many good friendships have been made.  I will create some mischief, but I will support the important work of the Government, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.  As I said publicly yesterday and again this morning, I will co-operate with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the important work that needs to be done during the next few months.  I wish members of my party and my colleagues every success and I will continue to work with them for the foreseeable future.  I think I am doing the right thing.  To use John B. Keane's words, when you are from Kerry and as ignorant as us, you have to be fierce clever.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This comprehensive Bill which contains 64 sections is worthwhile and can be recommended to the House.  Section 17 provides that Aer Rianta may acquire land by agreement, or subject to certain conditions, compulsorily.  It also provides that land may be acquired by the company, where the land is not required for immediate use but where the Minister holds that there is a reasonable expectation that the land will be required in the future, for one of the purposes specified in section 18.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with this lukewarm section. Perhaps it will give the company the opportunity to acquire land which will not be utilised in years to come.  It would be proper planning for Aer Rianta to undertake feasibility studies around all its airports to find out what land is required.  Buying huge tracts of land which lie dormant for years is not wise.  I hope the Minister will initiate proper planning by Aer Rianta to ensure it acquires sufficient land to meet its requirements in the next decade or two, and thereby ensure it will not invest in property which may not be of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>Section 16 assigns to the company the functions previously undertaken by the Minister in relation to the management and development of the three State airports.  The company must also ensure that necessary services and facilities are provided at these airports.  In addition the company may, subject to certain conditions, establish new airports or become the owner or manager of existing airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The logic of Aer Rianta acquiring airports outside the State is dubious.  Before this debate was adjourned, I called on Aer Rianta, in the establishment of new airports, to consider areas which <Col N="856" /> have little access to airports.  Some parts of my constituency of Cork South-west are 120 miles away from an airport.  Bantry Bay is the mariculture capital of Ireland.  Mariculture exports need prompt shipment to the continental market to ensure they arrive in first class condition.  It is of paramount importance to the development of the mariculture and aquaculture industry along the south-western seaboard that a direct air flight be made available through the construction of a new airport in Bantry.  There is a huge demand for this service.  There is vast mariculture and aquaculture development in the seashore around Castletownbere, Bantry and Carbery Hundred Isles.  If this facility was provided by Aer Rianta, it would help the industry to develop because Bantry is the centre of aquaculture and mariculture development in that area.</P>
    <P>We are told mariculture and aquaculture will be the greatest money spinners for this economy in the next decade.  If that is true, perhaps somebody will argue in ten or 15 years' time, when I no longer have a seat in this House, for the establishment of an airport in Bantry, like those in Sligo, Waterford or Farranfore.  I urge the Minister to ask Aer Rianta to carry out a feasibility study so that a new airport can be built in that area which deserves recognition.  I hope the study shows that my proposal is viable.</P>
    <P>This is also important from a tourism point of view because the sunny south-west is an important region.  There is no train service from Cork city to any part of west Cork.  That was taken away in the 1950s and no alternative transport service by sea or air was provided.  There is no reason an airport could not be established in Bantry, like that built in Knock by Canon Horan.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides that the appointment, terms and conditions, and removal of the chairperson of the board of directors will be as determined by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I am pleased the Minister for Finance will hold the upper hand in this respect because it is necessary that he should have a say in the appointment and activities of the chairman of the company.  Section 25 provides that the Minister may, by order, confer additional functions on the company, subject to conditions which may be specified in the order.</P>
    <P>Section 41 provides that the Minister may give a direction in writing to the company requiring it to comply with policy decisions of a general kind related to the functions assigned to the company, or to do or refrain from doing anything to which a function of the company relates, which is necessary or expedient in the interests of the State.  The company must comply with such a direction from the Minister.  Perhaps this is a little high handed. Will it interfere with the natural running of the company?  Will the company be tied to the Minister's coat tails so that it is not able to expand as it would like?  Is the Minister wise to include this section in the Bill?  Do we need it in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I would be slow to support a section which would interfere with progress in any company. <Col N="857" /> Perhaps the section could be reworded in such a way that the company would have to seek the Minister's views on such expansion.  It might not benefit a company to tie its hands with too many ministerial regulations.</P>
    <P>Air transport accounts for 65 per cent of all passenger traffic in and out of Ireland, which is a huge percentage.  I can envisage the day when that figure will increase to 75 per cent and over. The emphasis today is on getting from A to B in the shortest possible time.  Time will be very valuable in the years ahead.  It was not so valuable when we were growing up because it was not possible for us to travel around the globe as quickly as nowadays.  Aer Rianta must focus its attention on how it will handle the escalation in passenger traffic in the next decade.</P>
    <P>Air transport is an increasing source of polluting emissions, particularly carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  I am pleased to note Ireland is supporting the initiation of action by the European Union to address the problem in the wider international context and with due regard to its effect on national competitiveness.  This is a very important matter because polluting emissions must be combated if we are to protect the life of future generations.  It is important for Aer Rianta and Irish airlines to meet those requirements.</P>
    <P>Aircraft noise poses particular problems in the immediate environs of airports.  Ireland is already implementing standards of noise certification and limitation which have been agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation through the European Union Civil Aviation Conference.  In addition, development planning in the vicinity of airports is monitored and controlled to minimise the impact of aircraft noise.  This is a very good attempt by our airlines to minimise such noise. Despite the increase in traffic through our major airports, the EPA reported in 1996 that noise reduction had been achieved by a combination of improvements in aircraft technology and greater attention to operational matters, including noise abatement procedures and the selection of takeoff and landing route orientations to minimise the impact of noise.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to do everything in his power to retain the duty free service at our airports. From where else will the money come to make our airlines viable?  A huge number of jobs will be lost if that service is ended.  I ask the Minister to get his European counterparts to support him in this regard and to make a strong case for the retention of the duty free service at our airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seeks to modernise arrangements between the Minister and the commercial State body involved.  The Minister described it as a framework document for the operation of State airports into the new millennium and beyond.  The genesis of the Bill occurred before the term of the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general welcome for the Bill and I have no difficulty with legislation which will provide <Col N="858" /> a framework for the operation of State airports. I am reluctant to strike a discordant note.  I do not have ideological but strategic concerns.</P>
    <P>While it appears to be minimal, the legislation moves Aer Rianta in a specific direction.  Doubtless all the implications of the change, including the gains and losses involved for the company, have been assessed by the Minister, her predecessor and officials in her Department.  I am more interested in the gains and losses which might arise for each of the three airports under the new arrangement.</P>
    <P>While I am more familiar with Shannon Airport, the difficulties for the future of Shannon are similar to those which will apply to Cork, regardless of the legislative changes.  Dublin is in a different situation and may well face difficulties depending on what happens in the future and the moves the new company makes.</P>
    <P>We must all recognise the strategic importance of airports for an island such as ours.  We have a small open economy which is very dependent on trade and exports.  We need access in and out of the country for business travellers and we depend to a huge extent on tourism, which is a growing multi-million pound industry.  Deputy Sheehan outlined the importance of airports and the perceived loss to areas which are in difficulty in terms of access to markets and tourists.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Department to put existing State bodies on a similar footing.  For example, the Minister mentioned that Aer Rianta will be more or less on the same footing as the ESB and Bord Gáis.  However, I am unsure if that is appropriate for Aer Rianta in view of the strategic importance of the airports.</P>
    <P>We saw the difficulties created for farmers when the ferry companies refused to carry stock and effectively ended live shipping.  That was overcome to some extent but with great difficulty and at considerable cost to farmers.  The collapse of Irish Shipping continues to have implications for the trade of the country, not so much in good times but in a specific political context which does not apply at present but which may well apply in the future.  At present, exporters face difficulties arising from the French truckers' dispute.  These difficulties point to the importance of strategic access points for an island such as ours.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta's control of airports is not a monopoly, which makes it different from the ESB and some other State bodies.  There are regional airports at Galway, Sligo and Donegal with larger ones at Knock and Farranfore.  However, the State airports deal with by far the greatest percentage of traffic in and out of the country.  Their strategic importance cannot be overstated.  For example, airport charges will be set by the new company &mdash; a great deal more independently than heretofore I fear.  Is there a danger that the need to be profitable will drive Aer Rianta towards a policy which will make it reliant, because of commercial pressures, on higher airport charges?  This would act as a huge disincentive <Col N="859" /> for tourism and business traffic at the airports.</P>
    <P>Ryanair, the largest independent airline in the State, has been pushing strongly to have a second airport provided in Dublin where it claims airport charges are excessive.  I disagree strongly, airport charges are extremely competitive.  We have to accept that Aer Rianta plays a constructive role in ensuring that the cost of air traffic in and out of the country remains competitive and will become more competitive in time.  That is the direction we need to take.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to offer them advice, particularly in airport matters, but I urge public and trade representatives in Dublin not to make the mistake made in the west where there has been a proliferation of airports.  This has not had the effect of improving matters but of dissipating efforts whereby the airports in question have to survive on a smaller traffic base, both outgoing and incoming and, as a result, are less competitive.</P>
    <P>Certain currently fashionable economists like to put forward the theory that Belfast has benefited by having two airports but even a cursory examination of the facts will show that airport charges for airlines using either airport are substantially higher and that both airports are in considerable difficulty in ensuring financial survival. I am concerned that Aer Rianta, in its slightly new role, will be pushed by forces such as Ryanair into making strategic decisions that would be disastrous for the country in the long-term.</P>
    <P>Many people, inside and outside the House, have reservations about section 41 of the Bill under which the Minister will have considerable powers to intervene where it is felt the company is pursuing an inappropriate line from the point of view of the national interest.  The section should be sufficiently strong to allow the Minister to intervene where it is necessary for him to do so to protect the economic interests of the State or for any other strategic reason.  Many others take the opposite view.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the agreement referred to in Part III of the Bill which deals with the transfer of assets will set the agenda for the new company in a fundamental way.  If too high a premium is put on the property to be transferred to the company it may find itself impoverished from the start.  This would have knock-on effects and create difficulties for the company.  The matter needs to be examined closely to ensure it will not be placed at a huge disadvantage.  This also applies to the section which deals with borrowings. Ministerial approval will be required for extra borrowings.  It is understandable that the State would wish to retain some control but the figure needs to be pitched at a realistic level.  The company will be reluctant to seek the Minister's approval for a project that would place it at a huge strategic advantage.</P>
    <P>The current dividend is in the region of £14.5 million.  Given that the airports will be liable to <Col N="860" /> rates and other taxes it is difficult to assess what impact the changes will have.  It is not clear whether the new rates and charges will be substantially greater than the dividend payable up to now.</P>
    <P>It is not clear either whether the company has an estimate of projected net income in the next five years, particularly at Cork and Shannon airports. It is important to remember that, for the most part, the company operates on a cross-subsidisation system under which the high profits made at Dublin are frequently used to subsidise elements of developments at the other airports. In future, the rates will be by way of an individual charge on Cork and Shannon Airports.  I am not clear how that will impact on the balance sheet of the company, or in particular on the balance sheet of each of the two smaller airports where substantial works are in progress.  Developments at Shannon will cost approximately £23 million, a good deal of which must be met out of company profits.  I am concerned that in the future there will not be airport profits at Shannon to pay for developments there.  I want to be assured that the cross-subsidisation which has operated heretofore will continue in a manner that does not discriminate against the smaller airports.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the impact on staff of the changes proposed in the Bill.  I particularly welcome the initiative on the part of management, staff and unions in Aer Rianta to co-operate with the contract for constructive participation, of which the Minister has been extremely supportive and encouraging.  No doubt she would be well disposed to consider a generous staff shareholding in the new company.  From what I have heard her say, and from my private conversations with her, I know she believes in incentive and reward for the staff of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Section 32 deals with staff superannuation. There is already a difficulty in the case of some staff who have a complicated superannuation system arising from their transfer from direct employment by the State approximately 15 years ago.  They stand to lose, some quite substantially, if this matter is not straightened out in the not too distant future.  Some of them are concerned that another change may have a further detrimental effect on their superannuation entitlements. This is something that can be readily dealt with and resolved by the Minister to ensure everybody is satisfied and that there is no loss or threat to their entitlements.</P>
    <P>While in many respects laudable, sections 39 and 40 appear, on cursory reading, to encourage what appears to be an almost unhealthy ethos of secrecy in the company.  Of course, it has to be recognised that it is a strategic company and that a good deal of its activity ought to be confidential. However, section 7 lists penalties very much more severe than would be applicable in the private sector or in most other State jobs.  I do not understand why that should be the case and I have some concerns in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> There are concerns about staff numbers in all three airports.  I am most familiar with the position at Shannon where within ten years job numbers have been reduced from just under 1,000 to 470.  A similar position applies in Dublin, though not quite as dramatic.  I understand that an even more dramatic reduction has taken place at Cork Airport where there are now 120 staff only.</P>
    <P>Although the purpose of this Bill for the most part is to modernise a <i>de facto</i> arrangement, there will always be staff concerns about what the future may hold.  Jobs are an issue at airports, for Governments and for politicians generally. People working in catering departments at airports will be concerned that this aspect of their operations might be put out to tender and transferred to the private sector.  The same could arise in other areas.  These are genuine concerns of workers which can and ought to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the treatment of temporary workers in several State or semi-State bodies, including the ESB, where staff on contract work are ever more frequently recruited and laid off without notice.  As a former member of a local authority, I welcome the fact that airports will become liable to pay rates.  This development represents a potential financial windfall for local authorities.  The three authorities involved would argue that they have incurred substantial costs in providing infrastructure for the local airport.  In that context, I must advert to the experience of Clare County Council and other local authorities in whose catchment areas ESB power stations are situated.  When the change to which I referred earlier was made five to six years ago and rates became liable to be paid directly, the Moneypoint rate became payable in County Clare and the council gained £6.5 million per year.  However, this money was promptly lopped off the block or rate support grants the council received from the Department of the Environment.  Therefore, with the exception of the ESB paying its rates on time &mdash; the Department was also somewhat tardy in forwarding moneys during the period in question &mdash; the council gained no advantage in gross terms.</P>
    <P>I fear the imposition of rates on airports will prove a substantial burden and will not benefit local authorities by offsetting their costs in providing infrastructures for the various airports. The Minister does not have direct responsibility in this area but I would like to see this aspect of the matter resolved.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the future of the duty free service.  Duty free sales have played an enormous role in ensuring that rates for people travelling into and out of Ireland have become increasingly competitive.  While the EU Commissioner and other experts are convinced that sales will level out in the short-term, I am certain that the removal of duty free will be disastrous for this country.  Due to the fact that Ireland is the only country which does not have a direct land link with its EU partners, I am sure the Government will make every effort to ensure that a derogation <Col N="862" /> is obtained.  We must not fool ourselves, however, because this will be difficult to achieve.  I am glad that Members on all sides have expressed support in this regard and I compliment the Minister and the Taoiseach for placing this matter, which is central to the survival of competitive air services in the short to medium term, at the top of the agenda.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment, in the context of the EU, on bilateral agreements Ireland has entered into with the US and other countries.  I understand that as late as yesterday the European Commission made a number of decisions in respect of bilateral agreements.  I have not been able to establish the degree to which we will be bound by these decisions but it appears that existing bilateral agreements will be honoured, at least in the short-term.  I also note that any member state introducing an &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; policy must put in place a phasing in period of six to seven years.  I welcome the provision that special cases can be made in the event that regions, industries, etc.  in any of the member states are shown to have been detrimentally affected by such a policy.  I urge the Minister to ensure that Ireland avails of the derogation and puts together a comprehensive case.</P>
    <P>I am frequently accused of parochialism on this issue but I could also make my arguments in national terms.  I am surprised that people in Dublin Airport are not putting forward stronger arguments than their counterparts in Shannon and Cork because of the substantial advantages which could be gained.  However, that matter should be dealt with by national aviation policy which, in the past, has not been as clear as it should be or taken proper account economic development in tourism and industry.  In the context of this Bill's enactment, I look forward to the development of an international air transport policy consistent with the country's needs.</P>

      <P>In ainneoin gur oileán í Éire, tríd na céadta bhíomar i gcomhnaí dearfach díograiseach ag iarraidh ceangal agus caidreamh cultúrdha sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta a fhorbairt leis an chuid eile den domhan.  Is féidir a rá gur thosaigh Brendan the Navigator é seo nuair a chuaigh seisean chomh fada le Meiriceá agus ba chéim ar aghaidh eile é bunú Aer Lingus i bhforbairt na gceangal sin leis an Eoraip agus leis na Stáit Aontaithe.</P>
      <P>Direct flights to and from this country ensured we were not dependent on our nearest neighbour. They provided us with the challenge of responding to economic developments and providing an outward looking people.  The foundation of Aer Rianta and the development of the airports ensured that the process was three-way: opening up Ireland to investment and tourism, and, in recent years, immigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aviation has the potential to be the most effective catalyst for economic growth if we allow it to be so, as we have done in the past.  We need to be more aggressive, however, in seeking out new markets and attracting new airlines.  It is generally <Col N="863" /> acknowledged that the Asia-Pacific region is the major economic growth area.  From an Irish point of view this is relevant on two fronts &mdash; increased demands for exports and an increase in foreign travel from this region, both tourism and business related.  This increase has already been felt and while we still have a balance of payments deficient with most countries in Asia, trade and passenger travel in both directions is showing a healthy growth.</P>
    <P>That the world's most profitable airline, Singapore Airlines, is flying the world's most expensive freight aircraft to Dublin suggests growing confidence in the Irish market.  We need to take advantage of new technology.  The latest aircraft, such as the Airbus A-330 and A-340, offer immense advantages to countries like ours.  These aircraft already offer the ability to make a profit carrying only freight, so that even the smallest passenger load is a viable option.</P>
    <P>It is conceded that passenger traffic between Ireland and Asian markets is not sufficient to justify direct passenger services, but this area is growing and we should plan for it.  The visible evidence of Irish holidaymakers in Thailand, of promotional material for Bailey's Irish Cream in Singapore, or the growing links between Irish medical schools and universities in Malaysia, suggests that our country's cultural and educational expansion is becoming firmly rooted in the Far East.</P>
    <P>Within three to four years a new generation of ultra long-haul airliners will bring any part of Asia, Africa or North America within non-stop reach of Dublin, thus further diminishing our peripherality. The importance of this cannot be understated.  It provides us with yet another challenge to ensure that our goods and services will be able to compete with any in Europe.</P>
    <P>In many ways New Zealand is quite similar to Ireland, with a strong reliance on tourism and trade.  It has developed markets in Asia with Taiwan, Korea and Japan.  We could follow this example.  New Zealand has been able to establish, maintain and develop these links largely due to the Boeing 767 aircraft, which could provide opportunities for Ireland also.</P>
    <P>In recommending the development of direct links with the Asia-Pacific region I am conscious not just of a need to facilitate those who wish to market Ireland abroad, but particularly those who wish to make direct flights here.</P>
    <P>The success of the International Financial Services Centre makes it all the more urgent for Ireland to be as accessible as possible for business travellers.  By feeding into major hubs such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Seoul, most areas of the Asia-Pacific region will be directly accessible from Ireland as, indeed, will the hugely important Australian tourist market.  Australia is becoming to us what America was in the 1960s.  Young Irish people who have put down roots there, are for the most part earning good salaries and have reasonable spending power.  Distance is of <Col N="864" /> decreasing importance and, over the next few years, more direct routings and fewer stopover costs will allow Ireland to become even more competitive in attracting passengers on these routes.</P>
    <P>In developing new tourist markets, Bord Fáilte has aggressively pursued the Japanese golfer for whom Ireland offers the dream vacation.  Unlike ourselves, however, the Japanese tend to take short vacations and so a more direct route to Ireland would make the golf courses here more attractive to them.</P>
    <P>As is the case with European travellers flying to Asia-Australia, many Asian-Australian travellers like to take in as much of Europe as possible during their vacations.  Unfortunately, however, Ireland is offered at the tail end of many tours and thus, because of the inevitable overrun in holiday budgets or the sheer exhaustion from travel, we tend to gain little from such tourists.  The availability of a direct link from Asia would allow them visit Ireland first which would maximise revenue potential.</P>
    <P>Many people would point to Heathrow as being the obvious link between Ireland and the rest of the world.  I claim, however, that reliance on travel via Heathrow is a source of major concern. Heathrow is becoming steadily more crowded with terminal, runway and aircraft capacity constraints.  As airlines find they have less difficulty in filling their current capacity, the Irish market may well find itself squeezed out. That poses a challenge to Aer Lingus to ensure that we are not dependent on Heathrow.</P>
    <P>It is already known that there will be no larger aircraft than those currently available until 2001 at the earliest, and it is unlikely that terminal 5 will be opened until the year 2005.  We face a considerable risk, therefore, of our potential being frustrated unless we can take advantage of the newest technology.  We could pass the burden to Amsterdam or to Frankfurt but this only delays the inevitable.  We have much stronger growth which makes new direct flights possible not only to the Far East but also to Canada and different parts of the United States.</P>
    <P>The need to develop new routes outside the European Union is particularly important given the EU's apparent determination to end duty free with potentially serious consequences for Ireland. This issue is one of the most serious facing Irish aviation and the Government must ensure that every opportunity is taken to oppose its abolition.</P>
    <P>The duty on tax free shopping was another of Ireland's major contributions to the development of airports throughout the world.  It started in Ireland 50 years ago and has developed into one of the most successful and dynamic industries of the EU.  The current yearly turnover is over £4.5 billion of which over £100 million is in Ireland. This is important not just in the context of airports and air travel but also in relation to the ports as more than six million people each year enjoy duty and tax free shopping in Irish outlets alone which has a positive effect on revenue and <Col N="865" /> job creation.  It is estimated that duty and tax free shopping directly creates approximately 2,000 jobs in Ireland and is a significant factor in keeping down the cost of air and sea travel.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Dún Laoghaire, which I represent, is one of the beneficiaries of the tourism industry generated and supported by duty and tax free shopping.  Through Dún Laoghaire alone, approximately 10 per cent of the annual passenger turnover is day visitors.  That is between 150,000 and 170,000 passengers per year. Many of those take full advantage of the duty and tax free shopping on the outward and homeward journeys and it is certainly an incentive for some of those travelling.  The money generated for the local economy in the shops and restaurants cannot be underestimated and it makes a valuable contribution in maintaining the thriving town of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The ongoing drive to develop the tourism of the area and to attract visitors to stay in the immediate vicinity rather than travel into Dublin would be hindered by the removal of duty free. Indeed the purchase of the HSS, the fastest of its type in the world, was possible because of the reinvestment of profits from the duty free industry. A country such as ours, which no longer has a shipping line, should do everything it can to encourage the development and upgrading of its sea and air links.  Revenue from sources such as duty free shopping plays a valuable role in this regard.</P>
    <P>From the consumer's point of view duty and tax free shopping should provide a first class international showcase for quality Irish products. They are important export channels opening many new markets for Irish manufacturers at low cost.  All of us have made purchases which perhaps we would not otherwise have made, simply because of the tax free incentive.  This industry which directly generates over 140,000 jobs in the EU and almost 2,000 in Ireland should not be abolished, particularly in a climate where employment and unemployment are constantly to the forefront of public debate.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has an advantage in having a wide network of partner airports and duty free operators around the world, in places such as Bahrain, Hong Kong, Moscow and Kuwait.  It is vital this purchasing power is used to ensure that the effect of the EU policy, if it is enforced, is minimised. The Government should strongly oppose any attempt to end duty free shopping and at least should press for an opt out clause for Ireland.  If all else fails, the Government should at least seek to ensure that passengers whose final destination is outside the EU, for example, a passenger travelling from Dublin to Tokyo <i>via</i> Amsterdam, should be allowed to take advantage of duty free shopping in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The success of the celtic tiger and the promotion of Ireland as a major player in the world economy can be assisted by the continuous development of air navigation routes.  New markets are constantly being developed to which we <Col N="866" /> must have access.  Our growth potential should not be held back by the cost of flying through Heathrow or the risk of being caught in a capacity crunch in that airport.  We must respond to the challenge of developing a niche in new markets, such as the Asia-Pacific market, and investigate the introduction of a service to a major Asian hub.  The increased visibility of Ireland throughout the region will be enhanced.</P>
    <P>The availability of competitively priced direct travel will be crucial in making Ireland an attractive tourist destination and an effective exporter. The Aer Lingus of today could be the Brendan the Navigator of tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Aer Rianta on the management of its portfolio.  I congratulate it on its significant growth which can be seen in the throughput of passengers in our airports and in the capital investment undertaken by the company.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the growth of Aer Rianta one tends to concentrate on the success of its airports. However, I wish to refer to the excellent development of the hotels sector of the company. Many will remember the financial difficulties experienced by the Great Southern hotel group a few years ago.  The group was taken over by Aer Rianta and, having been regenerated and refocused, it has become extremely successful and is making a significant impact in the tourism sector. This shining achievement should not be forgotten and praise should be offered to the personnel involved.  In this context I compliment Derek Keogh, who is due to retire from Aer Rianta, on his innovative, progressive and far-sighted approach in spearheading the massive expansion which took place during his time at the helm.</P>
      <P>I will take the opportunity in the short time available to me to focus on the Cork scene.  In discussing this Bill one must have regard to the opportunities available to Aer Rianta as a stand alone company which must look after its own interests.  One must recognise the impact this will have on the three major international airports under its aegis. Therefore, I will speak for some time on the subject of Cork Airport which has been excellently managed over the years.  One of its significant features is that it has been operated like a family concern by the staff.  It is beautifully designed and the restructuring and additions made to it have enhanced it.  It is a well designed, environmentally friendly, homely, welcoming and efficient airport. I congratulate the staff and management and I wish Barry Roche, the airport general manager, well in his imminent retirement.  I thank him on behalf of the people of Cork for the excellent way in which he has managed the airport and increased passenger numbers from 400,000 in 1987 to 1.3 million this year.  When one considers this is on a par with Shannon, one can see the potential which exists for Cork Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While everyone welcomes Aer Rianta being given autonomy, we in Cork will be wary because <Col N="867" /> there are serious issues involved for us.  There is a line of thought which states this Bill will have major consequences for the development of the airport which is one of the fastest growing airports in the country and has trebled in size in ten years.  Current profits are roughly £2.5 million.  It is alarming for us that those are derived exclusively from duty free sales.  With the abolition of duty free sales, Cork Airport faces a real dilemma in terms of its potential growth and the earmarked investment of £30 million over the next few years.  Where will this airport find funding with the loss of duty free sales?  Shannon receives a £2 million marketing budget each year whereas Cork receives £500,000, although both have the same number of passengers.  Aer Rianta and the Minister should examine this to see if Cork is faring well in terms of a marketing budget, especially in terms of future developments and their implications for the airport.</P>
    <P>While one must commend the Minister and the Government for their efforts to ensure duty free sales remain, any comparison between Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports shows a significant difference in that the first two are involved in long haul business.  They have transatlantic routes and other routes into south east Asia and other faraway destinations.  Therefore, duty free sales will be maintained in those airports.  Cork Airport only caters for domestic or European flights. Effectively, while one is not clearing the slate in Dublin and Shannon the removal of duty free sales will eradicate Cork's profit margin.  It does not auger well for Cork that £500,000 is being taken from that profit and put into a marketing budget.  The economics department in UCC conducted a study which sets out the massive impact which the loss of duty free sales will have on the region in terms of cash turnover and employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the autonomy it gives to Aer Rianta.  However, we in Cork urge the Minister and Aer Rianta to look again at the situation in Cork.  If we cannot retain duty free sales or obtain a derogation then a special case must be made for Cork Airport which does not have transatlantic flights as has Dublin and Shannon. We exhort the Minister to examine this possibility as flights from Cork are to European and internal destinations rather than further afield.  A possible solution is for Aer Rianta to examine its policy over the next two years and instead of taking £2.5 million back into its coffers to enhance its profit margin it should leave the money in Cork to fund necessary capital projects.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Bill, Cork Airport will for the first time face commercial rates between £500,000 and £1 million.  This will further exacerbate the situation.  The Bill will also require Aer Rianta to pay a capital sum to the State on the transfer of assets.  If duty free is removed and commercial rates are imposed in Cork it will result in an operating difficulty for the airport which must be alleviated.  The Minister should look again at the situation involving the transfer <Col N="868" /> of assets and the requirement for Aer Rianta to return funds to the Exchequer.  A derogation should be put in place for Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>I commend Aer Lingus's decision to begin direct flights from Cork to Amsterdam from next year.  There is only one flight from Cork to Dublin on Sunday and this creates difficulties for business people and commuters trying to make connecting flights to European and transatlantic destinations.  It does not suggest the second city is operating properly.  Aer Lingus is providing an appalling service for commuters travelling in and out of Cork.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, for instance, to get from Cork to European cities via Dublin or London until the early afternoon.  A one day trip between European cities for people living in Dublin or Shannon could take Cork commuters two days.  Anybody in business will say that such losses of time cannot be afforded.  It is inefficient, not cost-effective and impacts on the profitability of companies.</P>
    <P>Two out of three industrial jobs in the south-west region are dependent on exports.  Companies need efficient services to get to their marketplace, particularly those in Europe which account for almost half the country's export earnings. Cork's competitiveness in the international market and the further development of industry, commerce and tourism in the south-west region generally is being seriously hampered by a completely inadequate Aer Lingus dominated air service. We, in Cork, feel badly let down.</P>
    <P>The trip to Brussels normally takes four hours and the trip to Frankfurt and Dusseldorf takes six and a half hours and five hours respectively.  As a result of meeting representatives of Aer Lingus on several occasions, whether with the chamber of commerce or other interested groups, we were given a 6.30 a.m. flight from Cork to Dublin. Unfortunately, that flight does not allow business people to make connecting flights to Europe and this is having a serious impact.</P>
    <P>We are also totally dissatisfied with the cost of flights from Cork which are extremely high by international standards.  For instance, an Aer Lingus business class fare from Cork to London is £300 while a comparable Ryanair Cork-London fare is £169.</P>
    <P>Dublin's industrial development is at saturation point while Cork has major land banks available and skilled staff.  We feel Cork should be pinpointed as a prime large-scale project destination. It is important that Cork has the kind of air services which would enhance the prospects of achieving this.</P>
    <P>Two further points are worth making.  First, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts during the term of the last Dáil, and in view of the stricture put on Aer Rianta in this Bill with regard to the borrowing requirement, last year I went to the trouble of looking at the debt in semi-State companies and it is staggering.  It amounts to in excess of £5.5 billion.  That is a cause of concern because almost half of it is guaranteed by the State.  In fact, the overall level of State <Col N="869" /> guarantee to the semi-State sector is in the region of 63 per cent.  My difficulty with this investment and debt relates to the fact that the Exchequer saw fit to establish the National Treasury Management Agency to manage a national debt of about £28 billion.  The agency was able to effect a saving of £35 million in the first year of operations, £75 million in the second and £57 million in the third.</P>
    <P>The experience, expertise and skill in managing money of the people working in the NTMA has reaped great benefits in managing the national debt.  Does it not appear prudent that the State and semi-State bodies should be grouped together under the umbrella of the National Treasury Management Agency?  While this may not be pertinent to the Department of Public Enterprise, the Minister should raise the matter with the Minister for Finance and the Government when considering the management of indebtedness portfolios in the semi-State sector. The National Treasury Management Act, 1992, which set up the agency, provides that the Minister will, as she considers appropriate, consult it on the general approach to borrowings of semi-State bodies.  Given that, is it not strange that the previous Government did not refer this to the NTMA?  I ask this Government to do so to ensure that effective savings can be made, as has been done with the national debt.  I strongly urge the Minister to look carefully at this and to reflect on it with her colleagues to ensure something worthwhile is done.</P>
    <P>All speakers have said that while worker directors are on the main board they are not on the boards of the subsidiaries.  To be parochial again, since Cork is the smallest airport it has never had the opportunity to have a worker director voted on to the board.  While we cannot have a worker director, it is important that a Cork-based director should be on the Aer Rianta board.  I urge the Minister to appoint one.</P>
    <P>The employees' share option has been mentioned by other speakers.  That process has been followed in both Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann.  In terms of an airport's operational efficiency, if workers become more involved, they take a greater interest in the company and feel they have a bigger stake in it.  That will have a massive impact on company morale and on the efficiency and effectiveness of the workforce.  The Minister has indicated she may look at this on Committee Stage.  When we considered the debacle of the Telecom deal in Opposition, we were highly critical of the previous Government's handling of the employee share option.  Now that we are in Government we should provide for it in this Bill.  The Aer Lingus chief executive stated in a report that the employee share option was one of the most meaningful steps it had taken to achieve co-operation and commitment between management and staff.  We have an opportunity to put this in place within Aer Rianta and I strongly urge that we give it favourable consideration.</P>
    <Col N="870" />
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it will give Aer Rianta semi-State status which will allow it to develop and progress with some freedom. However, the element of the Bill which concerns me is the proposed abolition of duty and tax free sales in 1999.  At a time when tourism is increasing it is difficult to imagine doing away with duty and tax free facilities for Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus customers.  Why should we do away with them?  The duty and tax free shops at airports are mini trade fairs which provide a showcase for the best of Irish products.  There is no better way of displaying expert Irish craftsmanship in jewellery, woollens, glass and linen.</P>
      <P>The abolition of duty and tax free sales would threaten directly 200 jobs in Aer Rianta and indirectly 2,000 jobs in Irish industry.  Aer Rianta would lose approximately £30 million net annually. The original decision of the Council of Finance Ministers in 1991 was taken without a clear assessment of the social and economic implications. The EU member states and the Commission should review that decision.</P>
      <P>Holidaymakers will have to dig deeper into their wallets to pay more for their holidays to compensate for the loss of duty and tax free sales. At a time when tourism is promoted as an important European industry, holidaymakers will choose alternative non-European routes and resorts.  Passengers travelling from one EU member state to another account for 70 per cent of EU duty and tax free sales.  Irish duty and tax free sales per head of population are the fourth highest in the EU.</P>
      <P>These sales are highly profitable.  Operators use a portion of the profits to contain the costs of service provision, keeping charges and fares low. Ireland is the only EU member state without a land link to the Continent.  Over the past decade Ireland has experienced growth in tourism and the reduction in access fares has played a key part in initiating and consolidating the tourism drive. The abolition of duty and tax free sales would halt and reverse reductions in access fares and would make future expansion in tourism more difficult.</P>
      <P>Intra-EU duty and tax free sales are a major profit centre for transport operations.  The loss of such sales after 1999 would significantly depress operator profitability.  A recent study shows that the principal Irish operators consider that the loss of intra-EU duty and tax free sales would cut operating profitability by £64 million in 1996 terms.  In response to the ending of duty and tax free sales transport operators have indicated that they would seek to compensate partially for the lost profits by introducing cost effectiveness measures, increasing the range and scale of tax paid retailing, seeking new sources of business outside Ireland and raising customer charges and fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passenger fares and freight rates to and from Ireland would rise as a result of the loss of duty and tax free sales.  Increases in charges and fares would be sizeable.  Aer Rianta estimates that <Col N="871" /> after the introduction of cost effectiveness and rationalisation measures it would need to increase its fares by 50 per cent in order to restore profitability to pre-abolition levels.  Fares on sea routes between Ireland and the UK would increase by up to 20 per cent with smaller increases on routes between Ireland and continental Europe.  Airports, ferries and airlines, all of which will suffer a sharp fall in profitability, would be immediately worse off from the abolition of duty free sales.  Passengers travelling between Ireland and other EU countries would also be worse off as they would face higher fares and would no longer enjoy access to duty free shopping.  Irish exporters to the EU would face higher freight charges for shipping goods to the UK and continental markets because, unlike exporters in other EU states, they would be unable to avoid the increased charges by substituting road or rail deliveries for shipping due to the absence of a land-bridge with Europe.</P>
    <P>Nobody will benefit from the abolition of duty free.  Everybody will lose, including companies, customers and workers.  Why should we agree to this measure?  I strongly urge the Minister to review this issue and rescind the decision.  If it is proceeded with it will be a disaster for workers and holidaymakers.  Also affected will be suppliers and small operators who provide goods to Aer Rianta.  Airports which rely on inter-EU traffic will be particularly vulnerable, including the small regional airports which stand to lose most and where jobs will be lost.  It is estimated that ticket prices will rise, holidays will be more expensive and EU destinations will lose out to third countries as holidaymakers will go to other resorts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am particularly interested in the Bill because I spent nine happy years between 1970-79 working in the air traffic control service in Dublin Airport.  Subsequently I spent six months training in Cork Airport.</P>
      <P>This Bill may not have much significance for my constituency, Laoighis-Offaly, although there is room for the development of a regional airport in the constituency.  Nevertheless, having worked in the business I have maintained an interest in its development.  While dealing with this Bill one must consider the involvement of the major players in the airports, namely, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and the air traffic control service.  Since its foundation Aer Lingus has not only established itself as a safe and reliable airline but has brought pride to the country.  It has made a name for itself as a major pilot training airline as well as in training aircraft mechanics, cabin crew and other personnel. In this process it has earned substantial revenue for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will have no direct impact on the air traffic control services.  Nevertheless, continued investment by Aer Rianta in areas associated <Col N="872" /> with air traffic will ensure continuous increases in air traffic and thereby increases in airport revenue. The air traffic control service has seen tremendous improvements since I worked in it in the 1970s.  Control of air traffic was then dependent on primary radar.  Now the most modern secondary surveillance radar operates at our international airports.  Air traffic control at Dublin Airport is housed in its own complex, with a modern state of the art control centre and a new control tower built during the late 1980s.</P>
    <P>The 1980s also saw change in personnel in the air traffic control service with the intake of the first female air traffic controllers.  The service has gone from strength to strength over the years.  I am proud that the Irish air traffic control personnel have a safety record second to none.  Investment by way of facilities and equipment should continue and every support should be given to the service to maintain its high safety standards.</P>
    <P>There is scope to expand the service and, in so doing, create extra jobs and, by natural extension, extra revenue.  I would like to see the provision of air traffic control off north-west Donegal by the Irish Air Traffic Control Service.  I understand negotiations are proceeding at present, but currently in this region air traffic control is provided procedurally by the UK services.  The Irish radar station at Duncarton could provide radar services. This would mean jobs for the Irish Air Traffic Control Service as well as more revenue and reduced user charges.  The professional standards set by the Irish Air Traffic Control Service will ensure that safe practice in air traffic control is maintained by the Irish Aviation Authority, the semi-State body responsible for air traffic control services in the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, on bringing it before the House.  Airports have come a long way over the past 20 years.  The new terminals are efficient and customer friendly.  In the past ten years particularly there has been a tremendous level of investment which was needed to cater for the increasing numbers travelling.  Passenger numbers in 1970 were of the order of two to three million.  Today they are close to nine million.  Aer Rianta must continue upgrading and developing airports to provide the best level of service.  The Minister recognised this when she said in her introductory speech that one of the major tasks facing Aer Rianta in the medium term will be the financing of airport development.  This Bill, by transferring certain powers to Aer Rianta, will allow Aer Rianta a hands on approach in meeting the demands of the future.</P>
    <P>Support must also continue for Aer Rianta by fighting to safeguard the revenue created by duty free sales.  Any decisions which impact on duty free sales will increase the threat of job losses. Duty free means 1,000 jobs a year or 40 per cent of the revenue coming into Aer Rianta.  The loss of revenue from duty free sales would force Aer Rianta to increase charges elsewhere.  Losses <Col N="873" /> would have to be compensated for by an increase in landing charges which would, in turn, be passed on by the airlines to the public.  In the case of Aer Lingus the loss of revenue would mean an increase in the air ticket cost.  It is important for Aer Rianta that costs be kept down by maintaining all areas of revenue.  Hence the importance of duty free sales.</P>
    <P>I wish Aer Rianta well as it prepares to embark on its own.  However, I would like to see the company address other issues at Dublin Airport.  For instance, competition will have to open up within the airport itself in order to reduce costs which are often passed on to other companies operating on tight budgets within the airport itself.  I refer specifically to security costs to other agencies such as TEAM Aer Lingus, the rates on shops, offices and workshops and car parking costs.  Now is the time for an assessment of how to achieve efficiency in costs of services by Aer Rianta.  I would also like to see infrastructural investment within the airport.  I would like the company examine in time the possibility of an exit traffic route separate from the entrance.  I often wonder about the fact that only one bank offers a service in the airport.  Competition in this area should be allowed and encouraged.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta should allow competition within airports but it will have to continue to make investments, particularly at Dublin Airport.  For example, it should provide more taxiways to serve runway 28 as soon as possible as that would allow high speed turnoffs after landing and reduce separation for landing traffic to three miles rather than the current five mile limit.  This would lead to increased landing efficiency and, by extension, increased airport efficiency.</P>
    <P>Air traffic at Dublin Airport is increasing at the rate of 9 per cent per year.  I understand there is a proposal to have a parallel runway to runway 28 open in the year 2010.  Some people's opinion is that this is too far in the future because latest reports show that significant delays will develop at that rate of traffic increase in the next few years.  It is essential that Aer Rianta caters for increasing air traffic by providing the new runway as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As a former employee of the airport I have a number of concerns about section 32 which refers to pensions and superannuation.  At present, staff in Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta contribute to the Irish aviation and general superannuation scheme for pension and superannuation benefits.  Two thirds of the membership of the scheme are Aer Lingus employees.  These participants are members of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association and general employees and the scheme has been generally beneficial to date, mainly because of the economies of scale which operate.  However, the Bill states that the company may prepare a scheme for the granting of superannuation benefits to or in respect of employees of the company and its subsidiaries.  While I understand any proposed new scheme must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, if such a scheme was <Col N="874" /> proposed and agreed and employees transferred to it, the previous economies of scale would not apply.  The net losers would be the Aer Lingus employees who make up two thirds of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the proposal in section 32 that if a dispute regarding a claim for superannuation benefit under a new scheme arises, it shall be submitted to the Minister who shall refer it in turn to the Minister for Finance for determination by him.  There is a dichotomy in this area; the Bill provides for the transfer of certain functions from the Minister to Aer Rianta but certain responsibilities will be transferred back to the Minister.  The usual position is that pension disputes are referred to trustees of the pension fund.  I have a number of misgivings about the section but overall I am pleased with the Bill which will further the development of our international airports.  I subscribe to the theory that the infrastructural development of the airports will in turn bring about a consistent increase in passenger traffic.  The obvious extension of this is increased revenue.  I wish Aer Rianta well as it progresses on this latest stage of its journey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the three airports run by the commercial semi-State enterprise, regional airports service areas not catered for directly by Aer Rianta.  There is also a handful of airstrips around the country and on the islands which require investment.  The regional airports include those at Kerry, Galway, Knock and Sligo.  A common interest is that if their businesses are successful, it builds up the infrastructural assets of the nation, which is important.  They also need to develop their services as an integral part of the regional economies.  The integration of regional airports in partnership with the three main airports run by Aer Rianta is most important.</P>
      <P>Regional airports face difficulties from the dominance of Aer Rianta in the overall market for landing space in Ireland.  There is a huge need to compete in price sensitive markets but at the same time to build critical mass.  They also have much in common with facilities in Northern Ireland.  The success of each regional airport has been in terms of traffic, volume, range of business and profitability, and individual airports have had to cope with demand.  The business of running airports is not one where success is easily achieved, let alone guaranteed.  It is becoming more difficult to run regional airports because it was decided to establish them privately, and though substantial private capital has funded them, the EU, the Exchequer and local Chambers of Commerce have played key roles at various times in the development of these airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the infrastructural development of each region, business interests have been concerned that there is a well-founded reason for Government to encourage the success of private regional airports.  It is important that these airports be incorporated in the development of Aer Rianta's role.  The success of these airports often depends <Col N="875" /> on State decisions to subsidise capital funding of them; at present they are very underfunded.  The special funding and special tax relief enterprise areas which have been successful on the east coast must be applied to the development of regional airports.  As the three main airports grow, regional airports play a major role in the success of the airport business.  The provision of a special tax relief enterprise area addressed specifically at attracting manufacturing industry and internationally traded services, which have hitherto been established mainly on the east coast and in large cities, is very important.  It would be a valuable response by Government to population losses and unemployment problems of areas served by regional airports.</P>
    <P>The social and economic position of these regional airports depends on greater support being given to them.  A survey of Connacht and Donegal funded by the EU and the Department of Finance in February 1994 spoke of the west being in crisis.  The scale of the problem was so great, and the need for action so urgent, that the resolution of the crisis demanded a major partnership between all concerned.  One indication of the problem related to population loss: the report stated that if current migration trends continued, the region stood to lose 110,000 people, or one fifth of its total population, in the coming 20 years.  It was also pointed out that a further aspect of population loss was the disappearance of large numbers of households and incomes from remote areas where those who remained were old or unmarried.  A high level task force set up by the last Government to examine and advise on this issue had a deadline of two months to report.  It found that among the issues identified in the industrial section was the continued development and creation of industry in the west, ensuring small business industry would form a central part of economic and employment policy in the west. It also recommended the continued promotion of the west through IDA Ireland for mobile investment and the increased development of existing foreign-owned manufacturing and internationally traded projects and their link to major firms in the west.</P>
    <P>This task force recommended that the designated status of the airports for industrial grant purposes be maintained and promoted as appropriate. Its aim should be to attract mobile investment and the existing base of foreign-owned manufacturing and internationally traded projects should continue to be vigorously promoted.  The promotion of airports is important to the development of the country.</P>
    <P>There is a regional airport in Sligo, and its success depends on the tax designated status it is seeking.  That status, the request for capital funding and passenger movement are three crucial criteria for the success of a regional airport.  I hope there will not be any difficulty with the EU's query on the granting of tax designation status for <Col N="876" /> regional airports because it would result in major losses in peripheral areas.</P>
    <P>On the essential air service programme, I believe Aer Lingus has put out to tender a three year contract starting in January.  Aer Lingus operates all three routes at present but it is not clear what will happen when the new contract commences in January.  Ireland Airways was awarded the Sligo route earlier this year but failed to honour this contract.  It is envisaged that at least three airlines will bid for the service but at present there is little clarification on the new contract for Sligo, although it has been stipulated that two flights be provided each day in summer and one in winter.  Kerry has two round trips daily and Galway has been successful in getting a third flight.  Sligo has only one round trip at present, which is a major disadvantage to the growth of Sligo Airport.</P>
    <P>I would like to highlight duty free facilities, the removal of which would be a major loss.  Being in the trade, I know duty free is a major advantage to those travelling aboard by air.  In the European context, it will be difficult to reach the right decision on duty free.  It will take a number of years to evaluate the impact of the removal of duty free.</P>
    <P>Sligo has high levels of unemployment in both urban and rural areas, one of the highest age dependency ratios, a growing number of long-term unemployed, a high level of lone parents and early school leavers.  Continuing migration from rural to urban areas will result in a loss of services.  Tax designation status to areas adjacent to regional airports would create a huge potential for jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government, when in Opposition, promised it would introduce the first regional airports development Bill.  Chartering the future of the regional airports, special tax designation status for Knock Airport to create a north Connacht enterprise zone and a study on extending the status to other regional airports are important for the overall growth of airports.</P>
    <P>Legislation should make it mandatory for the Minister for Public Enterprise to give a seat on the boards of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to nominees of regional airports.  All those involved in the industry should be on the boards of those companies.  Legislation on regional airports would shift the burden of air traffic control to the State because it is a major cost to regional airports. Regional airports, which are privately run, should be exempt from high rates, which are also a major cost factor.</P>
    <P>Recognition should be given to the role of regional airports in industrial development which would ensure a better regional distribution of new jobs.  The development of regional airports should be legally underpinned.  The special business expansion scheme for regional airports should be encouraged because it has huge growth potential.  Regional airports should be placed on a statutory footing and marketing and investor <Col N="877" /> funds should receive special tax status to encourage local investment.</P>
    <P>I would like more competition in regional airports from other airlines.  I do not need to encourage Bord Fáilte to include regional airports in its promotional work.  We should provide incentives so that regional airports and local tourism offices co-operate.  Sligo has only one flight per day at midday, which is unsuitable for those travelling to Dublin and is a major disincentive.  Additional funding should be provided for the development of airports.  Regional airports have a major role to play in the industry and the appointment of nominees to the board of Aer Rianta will bring all the airports together under one body.  In view of the proposal to abolish the duty free industry this move will have huge advantages.</P>
    <P>The capital funding provided by the State to regional airports should be substantially more than 50 per cent.  These airports provide a major public service and in ordinary circumstances operational costs cannot be covered by aviationrelated income.  It will not be possible in the future for regional airports to raise the required matching funding to maintain infrastructure and to provide the necessary facilities if grant aid is not substantially more than 50 per cent.  I agree that regional airports must be run independently and make a profit &mdash; if they are to be successful they must be viable &mdash; but if they are to expand there must be a comprehensive re-evaluation of the level of State funding given to them.</P>
    <P>If, as seems inevitable, duty free is abolished, airports must look at alternative sources of income.  As a retailer I am aware that duty does not apply to all the goods sold in duty free shops at airports.  However, customers have a perception that all the goods sold are duty free.  The duty free industry is a very profitable aspect of Aer Rianta's business and if it is abolished the company must ensure that passengers are made fully aware that there are still advantages to buying goods in its shops.</P>
    <P>The infrastructural development of regional airports is very important.  The designated status must be viewed as an opportunity not only to develop the potential of Sligo regional airport but also to provide much needed job creation which will benefit all of County Sligo and the north west region.  Sligo is the regional capital of the north-west sub-region and its airport services an area of approximately 40 miles, including all of counties Sligo and Leitrim, significant parts of south Donegal, north Roscommon, north Mayo, Cavan and south Fermanagh.  The north west sub-region is one of the most disadvantaged areas and is at the extreme periphery of the EU.  There is a significant disparity between it and other subregions in terms of unemployment, population losses, levels of average income, urban bases and population density.</P>
    <P>The development of the airport is seen as a key factor in seeking to address the social and economic imbalances from which the area suffers. Sligo regional airport already plays a central role <Col N="878" /> in supporting tourism development which is very important.  Many of the major industries which have located in the north-west in recent years have indicated that the availability of a regional airport in close proximity to their plant was a key factor in their choice of an industrial location. This bears out the conclusions of an EU network project report on regional airport development which states that airports assist economic development by providing the infrastructure which enhances transport and communications links to other regions and major areas.  That is particularly important when the region is on the periphery of Europe.  The success of a regional airport is critical for the development and economic success of the whole region.</P>
    <P>Since Sligo regional airport was officially opened in 1983, the board has sought every opportunity to maximise the income of the airport from non-aviation sources with a view to maintaining a viable operation, which is difficult for regional airports since they are run on their ability to make a profit.  Many airports offering only one flight per day simply provide a service and make little profit.  Were it not for the great commitment of the staff of regional airports they would not be as successful.  Legislation should be considered to improve regional airports.  They have developed extraordinarily well in recent years but much more work can be done.  The changes provided for in this Bill, which I welcome, will result in much development of regional airports.</P>
    <P>The EU is questioning the designation of certain areas as disadvantaged.  The designation of areas adjacent to airports has great advantages for the development of those areas.  The Minister should ensure areas, particularly in the west, are so designated.  There is a huge airstrip at Knock regional airport and its success very much depends on industrial development adjacent to the airport.  The introduction of tax free zones would attract industry to those areas and I strongly recommend the Minister considers that matter in future legislation.  The importance of such a development cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development by Aer Rianta of national airports, but it is important a similar effort is put into the development of regional airports to ensure their viability.  With the abolition of duty free sales, which would be a major loss, Aer Rianta should concentrate on developing the many other aspects of retail trade at airports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  The main purpose of the Bill is to grant commercial semi-State status to Aer Rianta.  It is extraordinary the company has operated so successfully for many years without such legislation although its absence has not affected the good work of its management and staff.  The previous speaker spoke about working at the airport.  I worked in the cargo freight section of the airport in the late 1960s and 1970s, probably as a client of Aer Rianta.  At that time <Col N="879" /> Aer Rianta operated incubator or start-up units and many of the companies with which I shared a corridor were assisted by it and are now major players in the private business world.</P>
      <P>I am speaking on the Bill mainly as a Deputy from the north side of Dublin.  I appreciate the employment Dublin Airport and its ancillary businesses have created in that area.  Dublin Airport is the major employer on the north side.  Large numbers of people from middle class areas and local authority estates are managers, blue collar workers, general operatives or caterers at the airport.  We have all shared in the growth of Aer Rianta and other companies at the airport.</P>
      <P>When I worked at the airport it was difficult to know &mdash; perhaps it did not matter to me &mdash; whether a person worked for Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta.  It was in that era the companies were formally divided.  As one specialises in the running of an airline and the other in the running of the airport, there is not the same movement of people from one organisation to the other.  In the 1960s many of those who worked in the cargo section moved to the management side of the airport when promoted.</P>
      <P>Until the mid-1980s Aer Rianta spent a great deal of money on capital investment to build up the airport and since then, through generating its own profits, it has invested approximately £200 million.  The airport facilities are testimony to its great work.  Capital projects undertaken by Aer Rianta, since it started to fund its capital programme, include the new major runway and the Pier 2 extension currently being built.  The company's record speaks for itself.  Some speakers spoke about it as if it did not pay rates or taxes. For many years it has contributed large sums of money to the Exchequer, as well as providing money for investment in the airport.</P>
      <P>We talk a great deal about social exclusion and the fact that big companies usually concentrate on profit, with little concern for other aspects of life.  Aer Rianta has been aware of its social responsibility to the area surrounding the airport. I refer in particular to Ballymun.  Aer Rianta combined with other State agencies, such as the Ballymun partnership, the Ballymun job centre, FÁS and private sector companies, such as AIB, to set up the Skyline Foundation which to date has created 40 to 50 jobs in Ballymun.  Those sustainable jobs are in commercially viable businesses in airport related activities and the agencies are working on other ideas.  They have done and are continuing to do good work in that direction. At present 50 people from Ballymun are engaged not in part-time courses but in full employment in the Greencaps Operation.  The latest commercially based, sustainable enterprise is the flyer bus which brings people from car parks furthest away from the airport to the terminal. The airport has expanded to the extent that some of the car parks are half a mile or more away from the terminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> The efforts of Aer Rianta to combine with other State agencies to create employment for people in the general hinterland of Dublin Airport, such as Ballymun, is noteworthy.  The Bill provides for maintaining Aer Rianta's commercial focus.  I would like to think it would never be dominated by pounds shillings and pence and that it will continue to be conscious of the good work to be done in creating employment, such as that generated through the Skyline Foundation.</P>
    <P>The main concern is that Irish airports may lose their duty free facility.  The revenue generated at Irish airports from duty free sales to inter and intra European travellers represents a far higher percentage of overall duty free revenue than that generated at most other European airports. Nearly 90 per cent of duty free sales at Irish airports are to people travelling to other European states.  We are trying to turn Dublin Airport into a European hub, but we must recognise that in airports in London and other places there are many more passengers travelling to the States and other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>We are an island nation.  I am aware efforts have been made by the Government to change the duty free regulation.  We must avoid being sucked into a Brussels decision on this.  The position here is different because of the nature of our island State and the destination of practically all passengers leaving Dublin Airport is to European capitals.  The position might be different in Shannon where there are more flights to transatlantic destinations.  We must win this fight otherwise we will be in deep trouble.</P>
    <P>Irish airlines would lose considerable revenue and profits from the abolition of duty free sales. Despite all the good work done by Aer Rianta to try to broaden its ancillary services, the only way to offset the considerable loss of revenue that would result from the abolition of duty free sales would be to increase airport charges but that would result in higher air fares.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies may be concerned about airports other than Dublin.  Aer Rianta has shared in the growth of tourism in Dublin in recent years.  Much of that tourism is due to co-operation between those involved in the tourism business &mdash; Aer Rianta, Dublin Tourism, hotels, Aer Lingus and private airlines.  Much of the extra business is due to innovative measures designed by Aer Rianta, in particular helping airlines setting up new routes by offering them huge discounts on landing charges.</P>
    <P>Dublin has become a major destination for weekend trips.  This success may not continue because other European cities are imitating Dublin, which was perhaps not first in the field.  London, Paris, Amsterdam and Edinburgh were primary destinations but for the past few years Dublin has been a preferred destination for weekend trips.  Aer Rianta has facilitated this by initiating innovative charging systems.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies are envious of Dublin's success in tourism.  Some people seem to be hankering back to the Shannon stopover even though passenger <Col N="881" /> figures in Shannon have increased since the change in the stopover policy.  If figures in Dublin are up 10 or 20 per cent and those in Shannon only 3 or 4 per cent, the answer is not to blame the change and grab something Dublin has.  The answer may be for airports and tourism bodies outside Dublin to emulate its success rather than ordering flights arriving at Dublin to go somewhere else.  People will go to a destination they find attractive.  We should be congratulated if the organisations co-operating in Dublin tourism present themselves in an attractive way.  People from Cork, Limerick or wherever should not take from this.</P>
    <P>There is concern about the proposed abolition of duty free sales.  Duty and tax free sales constitute one of the EU's most successful and dynamic industries.  It started in Ireland and Aer Rianta has been to the fore in the business over the years.  More than six million people enjoy duty and tax free shopping at Irish outlets each year and for many a visit to the duty free shop is a very important part of their trip.  Duty and tax free shopping directly generates over 100,000 jobs in the EU and about 2,000 jobs in Ireland.  Duty and tax free sales play a major role in keeping down the cost of air and sea travel.  Without them, airport charges and ticket prices could increase by as much as 50 per cent for all travellers, including visitors to Ireland.  Low cost airlines would probably be the most seriously affected.  If duty and tax free shopping is abolished, the cost of travel to Ireland will increase and this could seriously threaten our tourism business.</P>
    <P>Duty and tax free shops provide a first class international showcase for quality Irish products. They are an important export channel as they open many new markets for Irish manufacturers at a low cost.  I know the Government is trying to persuade Brussels to change its policy in this regard and that EU Transport Ministers would support such a change.  The final decision is with the Council of Finance Ministers.  We cannot abolish duty free shopping because its effect on employment on the north side of Dublin would be considerable.  It is a different ball game for a European country with a land boundary.</P>
    <P>Staff in Aer Rianta should be allowed to buy shares in the company.  That seems to be the trend in Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann.  It would be a shame to pass this legislation without giving the staff in Aer Rianta an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Some speakers criticised Aer Rianta.  The taxpayers helped Aer Rianta to develop and, like all State agencies, it must co-operate with private industry.  However, that does not mean it should hand the results of its hard earned efforts to private industry.  When I worked at the airport, Aer Rianta co-operated with private industry and many people became major players.  However, it is ridiculous to suggest that Aer Rianta should hand over its land.  It has a responsibility to ensure its land bank is sufficient for future development.  If private industry feels obstacles <Col N="882" /> were placed in its way in recent years, that was due to the lack of drainage facilities at the airport, not the non-co-operation of Aer Rianta.  I hope the Government's recent decision to approve in next year's capital programme the money for the new north fringe sewer as well as the opening of the M50 motorway will free up unused land and allow private industry with an interest in general airport ancillary warehousing, custom clearance, etc., to work with Aer Rianta, which will co-operate with private industry in the future, particularly when the new north fringe sewer is in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide for the termination of the present State airport management arrangements and to set up Aer Rianta as a normal commercial State body.  I welcome, in principle, the measures to regularise the current agency position of Aer Rianta and to place it on the same pitch as other semi-State sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta was set up in 1937 and has managed Dublin Airport since its construction in 1940.  It was later responsible for managing Shannon Airport, Cork Airport and other regional airports. The core business of Aer Rianta is the operation and development of the three main airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  However, its successful and progressive involvement in other activities, such as hotel ownership and duty free shopping, has assisted Aer Rianta in its success story to date.</P>
      <P>The success of Dublin Airport has had a tremendous impact on the continuing progress of the economic and social life of the north side of Dublin.  I congratulate all involved on the success of the development to date and their foresight and initiative in planning such facilities.  The record shows their confidence in the potential for development of the national and local economy, in particular their commitment to Dublin's north side.  The clear commitment and level of investment by Aer Rianta and the State is a crucial element of our transport policy.  It has direct importance in strengthening the infrastructure needed for economic development, tourism and industrial export growth.</P>
      <P>Last year, Aer Rianta handled almost 12 million passengers and 146 tonnes of material handling freight at its three airports.  The growth in both passenger and material handling have stretched capacity to the limit at Dublin Airport. One crucial factor that must be given top priority is the need for a direct fast-track rail link from Dublin Airport to the city centre and the existing transport network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, there have been some improvements in the road network to the airport. However, there are still some areas of the north side which do not have the necessary infrastructure to accommodate the escalating traffic demand.  Passenger numbers through Dublin Airport have grown every year, with over nine million passengers last year.  Airport employees also <Col N="883" /> make daily journeys to and from the airport which operates on a 24-hour basis.  Those of us who have visited premier airports in other capital cities will know there is usually a rail link from the airport to an existing transport network.  It is time to prioritise the need for such a link to Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the strategic plan to invest £200 million over the next five years, it is important to ensure the necessary structures and public transport services outside the airport campus receive equal investment.  Bottlenecks and missing links are a feature of the existing infrastructure in the local communities.  Traffic jams and associated traffic problems, such as rat running through residential areas to avoid bottlenecks, are escalating.  They cost us dearly in terms of productivity, the disturbance to residential areas and the cost of traffic calming measures.</P>
    <P>The current buzzword in the area of transport is &ldquo;networks&rdquo;.  We are led to believe that networks are the arteries of today's marketplace. They are also the life blood of competitiveness. In order to support the continuation of the successful development and competitiveness of Dublin Airport we must target the appropriate structures and networks.  One must highlight in that respect the need for a rail link which would not only benefit our generation but also the generations to come.</P>
    <P>Duty free sales is the other issue which has been raised recently in regard to Aer Rianta. Duty free sales represent a vital element of Aer Rianta's business and generate huge cashflow and income.  Its duty free shops represent a great investment over the years and have created good job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta will not be alone in being affected by the banning of duty free sales.  The wider dimension must be considered, including the position of the supply companies.  I have been contacted by many who will be affected if the EU plan for abolishing duty free shopping after June 1999 is approved.  My brother has vividly explained to me the importance of duty free sales to the drinks industry in which he is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined her opposition to the abolition of duty free sales.  I congratulate her for lobbying hard and wide on the issue.  I understand that the Minister for Finance has commissioned a study into the consequences for Ireland of the abolition of intra-community duty free sales and the Taoiseach has recorded his support for the retention of duty free.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  The Taoiseach is due to attend an EU Heads of Government summit within the next few weeks.  He should obtain an agreement to the retention and future of duty free sales.  Ireland should make it clear that it does not wish to participate in their abolition. Most of the speakers in this debate have taken that position.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we could obtain a derogation order.  However, that would leave our <Col N="884" /> position vulnerable.  We should not lose sight of the fact that we are a major player in the EU. Ireland has always been constructive and co-operative on EU matters.  However, like some of our EU partners we have difficulties on this issue. We can surely be constructive and co-operative, but committed to the retention and future of duty free sales.</P>
    <P>We should also not lose sight of the fact that the EU represents the democratically elected Governments of its member states.  I hope the Taoiseach takes up my suggestion on seeking agreement at the forthcoming EU summit to the retention and future of duty free sales.  His position would be strengthened if he had the written support of all our MEPs.  We will closely watch developments in this area.</P>
    <P>There has been great co-operation among the workforce at Aer Lingus for the advancement and development of our national airline.  The development of TEAM Aer Lingus was sold to the workers as a step in the right direction.  Letters of comfort were issued by the then Minister to certain personnel to establish the appropriateness of the development of the company in the overall context of the development of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The workers had to embrace radical and difficult changes initiated by the top management. Most of the workers are still there but the top management has gone with big handshakes. Despite the best efforts of the workers the financial future of the company is of grave concern. They have been let down by successive Governments and left to carry the can through thick and thin.</P>
    <P>The financial problem of Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus has raised its ugly head periodically.  In June 1994 Deputy Quinn, when Minister, said: &ldquo;TEAM Aer Lingus is faced with a major financial crisis which will lead to the company's closure unless steps are taken to rectify the problem immediately&rdquo;.  He went on to use the words &ldquo;the company will not survive unless.  ..&rdquo; This gives us a clear picture of what the employees have had to face.  They have repeatedly been asked to accept change, in the interests of the company, necessitated mainly by decisions over which they had no control.</P>
    <P>This week I was disappointed when the Ceann Comhairle's office disallowed a question I had tabled to the Minister for Public Enterprise about the letters of comfort signed by the then Minister in which certain undertakings were given to the employees of Aer Lingus who transferred to TEAM Aer Lingus.  The Ceann Comhairle's office has decided that it is not a matter for the Dáil.  I cannot understand this.  It is a matter of deep concern to the employees.  I ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to investigate the matter and indicate in greater detail why it is not relevant. Your office should obtain copies of the letters of comfort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I tabled a further question to ask the Minister for Public Enterprise the current financial position of Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus; the current profit or loss per week of these companies; the cumulative debts; and her views on these matters.  The Minister who has approached me about the matter has been more than co-operative.  It was the Ceann Comhairle's office which disallowed the question about the letters of comfort.  I would appreciate your co-operation, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and that of your office in having the matter rectified once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I am taking the opportunity to ask you to investigate the matter and clarify it for me.  I look forward to hearing from you.  The matter of Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus should be revisited with a view to putting in place a clear and unambiguous strategy. Working in co-operation with each other, there is no problem that cannot be overcome by tapping into the spirit and attitude of the workforce, particularly in Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus.  There is no hill we cannot climb.  If the House will excuse the pun, there are few heights we cannot reach.</P>
      <P>What is needed is the announcement of a clear target whereby workers can clearly see the direction in which the company is moving and understand their present status and the positive strengths and future of the company with sound employment prospects and real job opportunities. I look forward to monitoring the continued success of Aer Rianta.  I congratulate the company on its achievements to date, the enhancement of its infrastructure, facilities and services and the continued maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of its airport structures.  Last weekend I travelled abroad for a few days and on passing through Dublin Airport I had an opportunity of observing these very considerable improvements generally.</P>
      <P>As we approach the festive Christmas season, I want to pay special tribute to those involved in perpetuating the spirit of that season at the airport for the many thousands of people who avail of the holiday to travel abroad in addition to the many thousands of our emigrants who return home at that time.  It has always offered a warm traditional welcome to all passing through.  I congratulate them on their continuing work, particularly all those involved in the delivery of Aer Rianta's routine and ancillary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill marks a watershed in the history of Aer Rianta.  I want to express my appreciation of its important work over many years which is so important to us as an island <Col N="886" /> nation.  As a public representative for Dublin North I am extremely aware of its immense importance to that constituency and look forward to its continuance even though it appears, from a reading of the Bill, the company will have to come to terms with some radical changes.</P>
      <P>Before the last general election a considerable number of people employed at Dublin Airport and others generally interested in Aer Rianta inquired whether it was intended the company, or elements within it, would be privatised.  From what the Progressive Democrats were saying in the course of the general election campaign, it appeared that if they had any role in the matter the company would certainly travel down that road very quickly.  When this Government was formed, with a Department of Public Enterprise replacing the former Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, many people employed at Dublin Airport wondered whether this change did not constitute a first step toward Aer Rianta, and similar companies, being privatised.</P>
      <P>Management in particular at Dublin Airport have been eagerly awaiting many changes there, but there is grave disquiet that considerable interest is being paid to private banks on foot of loans and debts incurred by Aer Rianta.  The perception that has arisen from the events to which I have referred and the introduction of this Bill must be addressed.  The Bill must be amended in several ways to ensure this.  For example, the staff of Aer Rianta are seeking representation because the worker-director position does not seem to be in place.  I believe they feel that appointing one or two worker-directors would make little difference because it would be a token recognition of the workers' involvement.  There must be a realistic involvement of staff in this area.  There is also an opportunity to introduce employee shareholding and open it to a significantly large percentage of staff so that their involvement would be meaningful.</P>
      <P>Recent evidence indicates that public service pensioners are extremely unhappy because they believe they have been sidelined in respect of the performance of the Celtic tiger.  I again draw the Minister's attention to the approximately 2,000 Aer Rianta staff who partake in the aviation pensions scheme, the membership of which also includes employees of Aer Lingus.  The Bill does not deal, to any great extent, with their position following its enactment.  I call on the Minister to set in motion a proper ballot of the Aer Rianta staff who partake in that pension scheme to permit them decide if they should be part of the new development which will come into play when the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>The management of Aer Rianta have generally welcomed the Bill.  I hope they do so with their eyes open in respect of future changes involving viability.  Everyone wants to see such changes continue because the derogation that allowed for lower landing fees was put in place on foot of concerns expressed by Ryanair and Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> The staff and management of Aer Rianta have stated that its duty free shops have been extremely important in cushioning the blow from reductions in landing fees.  However, as other Members stated, duty free is under threat.  If that threat is not averted there is a possibility that a serious diminution of Aer Rianta's resources will occur, particularly as it is likely to be obliged to pay rates in future.  This situation must be resolved before the Bill becomes law.  It is too great a factor in Aer Rianta's future operation to be left to the hope, political will, vigour and commitment of the Minister and other members of the Government.  I note that the British airport authority is bracing itself for the changes by sanctioning a 15 per cent increase in landing fees.  The <i>Financial Times</i> reports that the authority hopes to put in place an internal UK duty free operation. In light of our brave talk about fighting to retain duty free &mdash; I hope we succeed in that struggle &mdash; the authority seems to be admitting defeat.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not need to be reminded that in the past Fianna Fáil seemed quite willing to sanction the demise of duty free sales while under the impression that greater benefits would accrue from endorsing the Maastricht Treaty.  It seems now, however, that those benefits will be in the short-term whereas duty free would be a long-term benefit.  It is a bit late to change one's mind on the road to Damascus, but I hope the Pauline conversion will be assisted by a miracle in political terms.  It would be a help if the Taoiseach was to admit he had been wrong when he allowed duty free to be signed away by the EU.</P>
    <P>The Bill should refer to the importance of continuing and improving neighbourly relations between airports and their surrounding hinterlands. The growth in passenger numbers has been a huge factor in increasing profits at airports, but it has also had a negative impact.  People living around Dublin Airport have contacted public representatives on the impact of runway development and noise created by engine testing.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from Aer Rianta which states the company's intention to implement a range of measures which, I hope, will improve the situation. The company has identified a new location for engine run-ups during the more sensitive hours from 8 p.m. to 9 a.m. Aer Rianta is also engaging in direct negotiations with various airlines and overhaul companies to find a more permanent solution.</P>
    <P>During those negotiations I hope the Minister will encourage Aer Rianta to be as interested and active in talking to communities which are close to airports.  Such communities have been seeking recognition but their efforts are often thwarted by legislation passed in this House.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, for example, which came into force before I was elected to the House, does not govern airport noise.  As a result communities living in the vicinity of Dublin Airport require legislation to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> The airport, however, is free to choose to co-operate and, generally, co-operation is completely voluntary.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a private airport such as Farranfore must clear all the hurdles of the planning process by complying with conditions laid down by An Bord Pleanála.  It seems to me that Aer Rianta has not been called to account.  I give it credit for having co-operated voluntarily with communities to some extent, even though the law does not provide that it must do so and that is a huge failing.</P>
    <P>Section 23(1)(c) of the Bill states that the principal objects of the company shall be to provide such facilities, services, accommodation and lands at airports owned or managed by the company for aircraft, passengers, cargo and mail as it considers necessary, The transport requirements of the airport should be included in this section as one of the facilities to be accommodated.  Car parking is a huge money spinner for Dublin Airport, but I wonder whether that is being seen as the overriding factor to put off the day when public transport could be provided, as it is in other cities, to cater for increasing passenger numbers.  I also wonder if the car is being regarded as the primary means of getting people to the airport.</P>
    <P>The bus service to Dublin airport is currently run on a skeleton basis.  As well as servicing growing towns like Swords, the buses must also pick up tourists and other passengers at the airport where, unfortunately, the citizenry is forced to depend on public transport.  Likewise, tourists coming into the airport in the past with bicycles were directed to the motorway to travel to Dublin, which we all know is illegal.  Signs have now been put up in that regard because Aer Rianta's attention has been drawn to the problem.  That type of problem should not arise if we have a rounded transport policy which needs to be included in this Bill.  There is no rail link to the north side, as mentioned earlier.  Aer Rianta could have done more to lobby for that and the Government should have listened more closely to the calls made to include the airport and Swords along that line.</P>
    <P>The other facilities that have been talked about do not explicitly include aircraft maintenance which, particularly with regard to TEAM, will be to the forefront of people's minds in the forthcoming by-election in Dublin North.  I urge the Government to clear up the confusion and address the matter of the broken promises made to employees at TEAM.  The letter of comfort signed by Deputy Seamus Brennan when he was Minister for Tourism and Transport is still in existence.  I know this matter has gone to court and has been the subject of intense debate but that letter gives an assurance to existing Aer Lingus employees working in TEAM that they will be recognised as Aer Lingus employees.  It is time for those commitments to be honoured.</P>
    <P>In the interests of air safety the Minister should <Col N="889" /> address the tendency for employment at TEAM to be increasingly on a short-term contract basis. People with many years of experience now find they are being cast aside in favour of short-term contract employment.  Those with many years of experience and expertise should be at the forefront of aircraft maintenance.  That applies to management as well as people employed on a contract basis.</P>
    <P>The issues raised in the debate so far, whether dealing with duty free, public transport, the rail link, employees' concerns, pensions, etc., pale into insignificance when one reads section 41 which allows the Minister to give a direction in writing to the company requiring it to comply with policy decisions of a general kind made by the Minister in relation to the functions assigned to the company by or under the Act, or to refrain from doing anything to which a function of the company relates, and that the company shall comply with the direction under this section.  That is the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister retains considerable power and she should elaborate further on the way that power is to be exercised.  Will it be in the interests of the employees to require a ballot to be taken when issues arise relating to pensions, terms of employment or contract employment in sensitive areas such as aircraft maintenance?  Will a death knell be sounded when it comes to greater privatisation, and will that be done regardless of whether it is the preferred option or the considered wisdom of the staff and management at Aer Rianta?  Will the Minister clarify that because, as matters stand, section 41 will override any of the issues debated here and we need to know if that section will be used to the extent suggested on a first reading of the Bill?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. It was a wide-ranging debate which included contributions from many Deputies, not just from those who live near airports or who represent constituencies in which airports are located.  The broad and helpful debate demonstrated a degree of consent for the Bill.  Obviously there are matters of conflict to which the last and other speakers, including Government Deputies, alluded.  I had hoped to encourage a free ranging debate in which Members could have their say, as is proper for a Second Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are an island nation and airports and those who run and use them are increasingly important. The days when airports were exotic places and those who travelled by airplane were élitest people are thankfully long gone due to competition, charter flights and &ldquo;bargain&rdquo; flights.  Most citizens now have an opportunity to travel by air so Aer Rianta and its business are important in people's lives.  It has been the objective of the company since its establishment, particularly since Derek Keogh assumed control, to have this legislation passed.  I inherited the legislation from the previous Administration and I was glad to <Col N="890" /> move forward with it.  Members appear to support the measure.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned worker-directors and expressed concern that I might abolish the concept of worker participation in Aer Rianta.  I am strongly in favour of such participation. However, there was concern because there are no explicit provisions relating to worker-directors.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, provides that onethird of the board of directors of Aer Rianta must be worker-directors.  Of a board of nine members, three are elected by the staff under the election procedures in the Act.  Nevertheless, Deputy Stagg, Deputy Gilmore, Deputy Higgins and others voiced concern.  If reassurance is necessary, I am prepared to look at or put forward an appropriate amendment to copperfasten the position of worker-directors on the board.  The term of office of the existing worker-directors is coming to an end and elections are currently taking place to replace them.  The term of office of the new worker-directors will commence from 1 January next.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies suggested that the chief executive be an <i>ex officio</i> board member.  I will reflect on the suggestion.  I do not have a hardline ideological position on it.  It appears to be the correct option for some boards while it is unsuitable for others.  The board is small and I do not favour enlarging it.  Nine members are sufficient.  Deputy Stagg and I argued about numbers of board members on a previous occasion in the context of Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>Members also mentioned that a prohibition on the Minister for Finance from selling or transferring shares was not included in the scheme of the Bill approved by the last Government.  Deputies need not worry that the company could be sold without reference to the House.  That will not happen.  Deputy Stagg and Deputy Higgins suggested the inclusion of a provision to prohibit the transfer of the State airports into a subsidiary company and the sale of that subsidiary.  I will examine the suggestion.  I would not countenance a Minister allowing the directors to sell the State airports leaving only a shell company as a way to circumvent this legislation.  Deputies will be aware of the Department of Finance guidelines on the corporate governance of State bodies. These are being updated and will deal with matters such as that.  Any future Minister should comply with these guidelines.</P>
    <P>Deputies also raised the issue of providing for employee shares in the company.  The Bill does not address this issue or the issue of privatisation.  Its sole purpose is to regularise the status of the company without changing it.  It neither rules out nor promises anything on employee shares.  This is neither the time nor the vehicle to address that issue.  We can examine it at a later date under different legislation.</P>
    <P>Much was said about regional airports.  The main thrust of the Bill is to end the existing <Col N="891" /> arrangement between Aer Rianta and the State airports.  There is little in this Bill about regional airports; what provisions there are relate to safety and security and these apply to all airports.  Questions were asked, especially by Deputies Yates and Gerry Reynolds, about whether Aer Rianta would be directed to take over any of the regional airports.  The answer to that is a categorical &ldquo;no&rdquo; because the regional airports are privately owned and I have no intention of bringing them under State control.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies on both sides of the House spoke of duty free sales and our vigorous commitment to retaining them.  The Taoiseach will attend the Luxembourg summit on employment in two weeks' time and will raise the issue publicly with the other Heads of State.  That will raise the matter to a plane which will give it momentum. Meanwhile, I am working on the issue with my transport colleagues.  While I realise the issue has wider implications, I reaffirm my commitment to it.</P>
    <P>I thank everyone who spoke on the debate.  I am pleased I was able to reintroduce the Bill, although it was mainly the work of the previous Government.  I will be open to amendments and I am also thinking of tabling some myself.  I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last spoke on this subject, I referred to the fact that there were more complaints about local authorities to the Ombudsman in 1996 than previously.  I was surprised by this because one normally expects issues concerning county councillors and council officials to be resolved locally.  However, a good example was given in the report where responsibility for dealing with the flooding of a house in County Galway was in dispute.  The householder concerned did not accept he was responsible for dealing with the problem and thought the council was responsible but it did not accept that.  The Ombudsman acted as referee and recommended the council contribute £3,000 towards relieving the flooding problems in that person's house.  It is interesting that the Ombudsman now receives more complaints regarding local authority matters.  In many ways these are the most important matters because they are local.  There will be an increase in the number of other local authority areas <Col N="892" /> which are brought to the attention of the Ombudsman.  This does not mean that the role of public representatives will be undermined.</P>
      <P>There was a 10 per cent increase in the number of complaints in 1996, bringing the figure to over 3,000.  One could argue that this is a small number in comparison to the number of inquiries received by public representatives.  The Ombudsman is attempting to introduce clinics in various parts of the country.  I welcome the fact that more use will be made of local radio and newspapers to highlight the role of the Ombudsman and the fact that the public can lodge complaints at these offices. This will become more important in the future.</P>
      <P>The report raises issues concerning school transport.  This is topical given the serious accident which occurred yesterday involving a school bus.  The report notes that school transport regulations have not changed since 1966-7.  The Government must look at this in relation to the fall in population.  The Ombudsman has taken up many issues relating to school transport and has recommended a course of action for school boards of management in County Galway who are trying to establish or retain school transport services.</P>
      <P>The issue of overcrowding on school transport will become more important.  This morning's radio report noted that a seat on a school bus is intended to seat two children.  However, in many cases there are three children to a seat.  This can lead to overcrowding and jostling and pupils being suspended from school buses.  This area will have to be examined by the Government.</P>
      <P>Previous reports by the Ombudsman made recommendations concerning social welfare entitlements.  This report notes that 50 per cent of complaints related to this subject.  In particular, there were many complaints concerning the pension entitlements of the self-employed, including those running small businesses and small farms. Some farmers feel discriminated against because they have not been able to make contributions for ten years before reaching 66 years of age.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is working hard on this issue and I hope he will be able to resolve the unfair treatment of these people and allow them to receive pensions on reaching 66 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare issue also involves community care.  That is an area which will be highlighted to a greater extent by the public, public representatives and the Ombudsman's office because, with an ageing population, a greater number of complaints relating to this area are being made to the Ombudsman.  The stark situation regarding the carer's allowance is that, while it is an excellent provision, the means test has unfortunately prevented many people from receiving that payment.  On the other hand, while the maximum payment for those in a nursing home is £120, which is a sizeable payment, many people are not entitled to it because the family of the elderly person must be means tested by the local health board.  While supports exist in <Col N="893" /> schemes, such as the carer's allowance and the nursing home subvention, and of course in the provision of full-time care and attention in hospital, which could be in the order of £300 per week where that is necessary, it appears that the question of value for money may not be addressed.  I do not know whether there is a role here for the Ombudsman, but I favour any system which helps a person to be looked after in the home and that is why I have always felt &mdash; not just because Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are in Government now &mdash; that the carer's allowance should not involve a means test. While the scheme is means tested I hope that the Minister will move, as other Ministers have done in the past, towards a situation where more income will be disregarded to allow a greater uptake of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The home help scheme has been disgracefully implemented by the health boards.  Some health boards pay only £1.40 per hour for home help whereas the rate in my health board is £2.20 for a maximum of nine hours, so that a home helper may receive a maximum payment of £19.80 per week.  That is very little and shows the appalling nature of the home help system.  The Ombudsman, who has been dealing with these kind of issues in the community and home care areas, has seen the number of complaints increase over the years and the Government must address them.  I hope there will be good news in relation to some of these issues in the forthcoming budget on 3 December.  If we cannot resolve all the questions relating to community and home care, at least we will move towards their resolution.</P>
    <P>Various social welfare schemes have also been highlighted in the Ombudsman's report.  I was interested in a recent press statement by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, about the number of existing free schemes for which many qualifying elderly people do not apply.  In particular he referred to the free telephone rental scheme.  This is an excellent scheme.  The Government announced measures to reduce the cost of installing a telephone and provide extra units.  It is my hope, and that of the Minister, that we will be able to encourage more people to apply for the scheme which is particularly important for people living alone.  That scheme, in conjunction with the neighbourhood watch scheme, the community alert scheme and the schemes which provide locks, bolts and pendants to the elderly, is very important.</P>
    <P>While the majority of the complaints in the Ombudsman's report relate to social welfare, that does not mean that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is an unfriendly Department &mdash; on the contrary, it provides an excellent service and we have a fine Minister in Deputy Ahern.  The officials in the Department are excellent and the structure of social welfare offices, employment exchanges and telephone services is useful and important.  I hope they will be used even more, particularly by the elderly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> The Office of the Ombudsman should look into the lack of a national system of medical card appeals.  Each health board has its own practice at present.  We also have two systems of housing repairs for the elderly &mdash; at local authority level and within the health board &mdash; and any duplication should be removed.  There were many complaints about Telecom Éireann and An Post and both bodies are trying to address them.  Rural Deputies are aware of the major problems with having post delivered from Dublin to country areas.  It is difficult for business people who receive post in the late afternoon and are expected to reply within an hour.</P>
    <P>I hope the issues highlighted in the Ombudsman's report are resolved by the Government.  Both the report and this debate have been helpful.  I have great regard for the office and hope we will be in constant touch with the Ombudsman in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate, which every year allows us to have a say about areas to which more attention should be paid, although it is not my intention to cover every area.  I have read the report thoroughly and it shows a 10.5 per cent increase in the numbers contacting the Ombudsman, which shows there are problems in all areas.  The bulk of these problems, involving some 3,414 complaints, relate to the county councils, Departments, etc., whereas there were 645 complaints about the private sector.  The Department of Social Welfare, as it was then called, was a frequent cause of complaint.</P>
      <P>I have criticisms of the Ombudsman related to the agriculture section of the report but I will first deal with the issue of medical cards, mentioned by Deputy Kitt.  A medical card is important to a low income family, particularly if it has small children or its members have health problems. Some small farmers with about 50 to 70 acres receive a small social welfare payment but do not have proper audited accounts.  The Department of Health and Children has given a direction to health boards that they are entitled to make an assessment of their income.  That is wrong and cannot be accepted.  I have dealt with many such cases and I do not criticise the health board officials in my county for this but the Department for giving such a direction.  An assessment may involve a social welfare officer noting that a field contains ten bullocks or 100 ewes and imagining that a huge income derives from them.  Those animals are not income &mdash; they are capital, not profit. There may be £100 profit in each of those bullocks or £50 in each of the ewes but that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases over the past 12 months in view of the serious state of the cattle trade, people depending on suckler herds have made a loss. That is unacceptable.  If we accept it children may be neglected.  A local doctor will charge £14 to £16 and if people do not have the money to pay the GP they may put off visiting the doctor.  They do not want to feel humiliated.  There may also be a charge for medication and people with low <Col N="895" /> incomes unable to afford the charges may avoid visiting the doctor.</P>
    <P>I will contact the Ombudsman on this issue because I have had a number of arguments with the health board about it.  It should not be entitled to make income assessments.  Assessments are simple accounts which should be easy to follow.  However, I have been informed that the health board is not prepared to accept simple accounts of receipted income and expenditure.  A reasonable official should accept such accounts from a client, particularly a client in receipt of a social welfare benefit or allowance because the social welfare official will have examined thoroughly the means of the individual involved before awarding the social welfare payment.  This issue must be examined especially in view of the sudden downturn in farm incomes.  Circumstances were different two or three years ago before the BSE crisis but they have changed dramatically in a short period.</P>
    <P>Complaints about Telecom Éireann usually relate to large telephone bills.  I am aware of the case of a woman who received a telephone bill for £4,500.  I made representations on her behalf and although another bill of such magnitude has not been sent to her she remains in fear of receiving one.  The woman lives on a widow's pension with her son who is a reasonable fellow and denies having made the telephone calls.  There is no reasonable explanation for the large bill.  The Ombudsman has a difficult job because Telecom Éireann claims the bill has been calculated and sent out automatically according to its system.</P>
    <P>This phenomenon needs investigation.  I come across one or two such cases each year and I am sure my experience is shared by many other Deputies.  I would not say Telecom Éireann is unreasonable but customers should have a means of challenging unduly large bills.  People become very nervous when they receive large bills.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman did not have many cases concerning the county councils, which is a credit to the local authorities.  I believe this is because a local authority comprises a body of elected representatives who can sort out problems with the local authority officials.  The low number of complaints is a credit to the councillors and the management of the local authorities.  Many Deputies have experience as councillors and would be aware of the importance of contact with local people.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman provides an important service for many people.  I have never been other than constructive when critical and I criticise the Ombudsman in respect of agriculture which accounted for 310 complaints, a decrease from 400 or 500 complaints last year.  It is disturbing that only 23 complaints were resolved while assistance was provided in 22 complaints, 43 complaints were discontinued and 79 were not upheld.  Over the past three years I have diligently fought to resolve three cases with the Ombudsman but have failed to do so.  As late as <Col N="896" /> yesterday I contacted his office, told him I would be speaking on this matter today and intended to criticise him in relation to resolving these cases.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is an Ombudsman in Europe and that there is ongoing contact between him and our Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman's report says:</P>
    <P>The relationship between the European Ombudsman and national Ombudsman is one which I value and it strengthens the opportunity for Irish citizens, as citizens of Europe, to air their grievances against those community institutions or bodies which are within the European Ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <P>I hope this continues as it is very important.</P>
    <P>One case I raised with the Ombudsman related to a man who applied for premia for approximately 160 ewes.  An inspector of the Department of Agriculture and Food inspected the herd. However, the regulation had changed from the previous year to a situation where if more than 15 per cent of the flock presented were unacceptable to the inspector then the grant was withheld.  It is a serious issue that the grant can be lost for two years.  The man lost his grant because 16 per cent of his flock was unacceptable. Every year the inspector excluded up to 20 ewes from the flock for grant purposes but he did not inform the farmer that the regulation changed to a 15 per cent ceiling.  We fought the case with the Department which refused to give in and then with the Ombudsman who also refused to give in. This raises the issue of proportionality.</P>
    <P>Another case centring on area aid was more serious and involved a father and two sons.  On an annual basis they took a ten acre plot from a neighbour.  In the year in question they took the plot and included it on an area aid map they sent to the Department.  One of the sons had a falling out with the owner of the ten acres who in June refused to allow the son to till the land and gave it to another farmer.  That farmer also included it on his area aid map resulting in the plot appearing on two maps.  The father and two sons did not inform the Department about what happened or did not think to do so and were disallowed £17,000 in grants over a two year period on the basis of the claim being fraudulent.  Penalties should have been imposed but it is unacceptable to do a farmer and his two sons out of £17,000 in any one year.  It is a very serious situation and again proportionality becomes an issue.  I raised this issue with the Ombudsman but failed to resolve it.</P>
    <P>A third case concerned an application for premia for ten month cattle which were sent to the Department with ages, etc., included.  The application was accepted and the grant paid.  An application for premia for the same cattle at 22 months were also made, but the ages were not consistent with the ten months because the farmer did not keep the age but did keep the numbers.</P>

      <P>I informed the House on 30 September 1997 that, following discussions between myself, my officials and Guinness Ireland Group, they notified their proposed take-over of United Beverages Holdings to the Competition Authority on 4 September 1997 seeking clearance of the proposal under the Competition Acts.

This occurred because it had been understood in my Department that the deadline of 3 August could be extended by making a further request for information from the parties.  However, this was queried by the Competition Authority and the Attorney General advised that the original deadline of 3 August was unaffected by the request.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I take full responsibility for the errors that occurred.  However, in the circumstances of this case I am satisfied that the course of action taken by Guinness will have the same effect as the original course I had intended to take.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recollect her own words in a Dáil debate during the famous Judge Dominick Lynch saga when she said that accountability means that a Minister must take charge and exert authority over his or her Department and must avoid doing certain things that are wrong and do other things that are required of them?  She went on to tell us that it is not good enough for a Minister not to know.  A Minister cannot abdicate his or her duty to this House and the public by simply not knowing. Does the Minister recall calling for my resignation and giving me an appalling time in this House because I was not aware of a particular situation in the Department of Justice?  Can she tell the House why she did not practice what she preached and offer her resignation over such a blunder?  Does she accept now that she should have had a full investigation into this blunder, <Col N="898" /> seeing that on 23 July, according to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 17 August, an official reminded her officials and thereby herself that the date for the submission to the Competition Authority was 3 August.  She missed that date.  Does she agree that the referral to the Competition Authority now does not carry the same authority as referring it to the Competition Authority under the Mergers Act and that the Minister has no role, irrespective of what the Competition Authority now says about this merger?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would like information, I will give it to her.  If she just wants to interrupt me I will not be able to give her the information.  I fully accept responsibility.  I have carried out an investigation.  I am quite certain nothing of this kind will happen again.  I further state that these Acts are in place since 1978.  On a number of occasions a second request for information was made.  That second request was always made within the month of notification and the officers in my Department and others were of the view that it was perfectly in order to make a second request and that it would not cause a procedural problem.  They were not aware that there was a procedural difficulty, nor had they any experience of it, until it was drawn to their attention by the parties when they responded on 7 August.  This is why it occurred.  It was a failure to interpret appropriately the legislation.  A second request had been made on a number of occasions previously but always within a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official who advised that a decision had to be made by 3 August was correct.  The decision was made by me before 3 August.  Based on advice, I decided to request further information to give us more time to carry out the investigation. I followed the advice given by the officials that a decision had to be made by 3 August, and I made a decision by then.  My officials were under the impression that making a request for <Col N="899" /> further information was in order.  Obviously, that was not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <P>The merger has been referred voluntarily to the Competition Authority by the companies involved.  The report is now available but there is no role for the Minister.  If the case had been referred under the Mergers Act, 1978, the Minister could have said nothing if the merger was acceptable or made an order not to allow it proceed. However, this cannot be done now because the matter was referred under the Competition Act.  The companies could enter the merger despite a negative report from the Competition Authority. Will the Minister confirm that is the case?</P>

      <P>The outcome can be the same.  If the referral had not been made voluntarily, I could have used other powers to carry out an investigation.  The Deputy is aware of that and I would have exercised those powers.  The Guinness Ireland Group made the referral, albeit voluntarily, after lengthy discussions with me and my officials.  The Competition Authority is dealing urgently with this matter at my request.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested the merger can go ahead.  However, if the companies proceed, they will do so at their peril because the Competition Authority can take them to court to stop it.  The authority raised objections yesterday about the merger because it believes it could lead to anti-competitive practices.  Therefore, the companies would proceed at their peril and I doubt that will happen because the Competition Authority has powers.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm the view among lawyers dealing with competition legislation that a referral under section 4 of the Competition Act does not have the same effect as a referral under the Mergers Act and there is an anomaly in the law?  The Minister's point is not totally accurate because when this merger was referred voluntarily to the Competition Authority, she cannot make an order to stop it proceeding if she is inclined to do so.  I accept the matter is being dealt with by the same authority that would have considered it if it had been referred under the Mergers Act.  However, because it was not referred under that Act, the Minister does not have the power to make an order to stop the merger.  Will she confirm that is the case?  Will the legislation be amended to remove this anomaly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Tánaiste cothrom na féinne, but we will also try to cover the territory as precisely as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to this matter, the Tánaiste will be aware that the trade union movement, and specifically the leadership of larger unions such as SIPTU, regard this as a <i>sine qua non</i> if we are to have further partnership agreements.  The Taoiseach recognised the seriousness of this issue when he went to the SIPTU conference.  It was put on the line by the union's President, Mr. Jimmy Somers, when he stated that the outcome of the discussions of the high-level group will decide whether the trade union movement will continue to participate in social partnership when the present agreement expires.  He went on to say that if the Government and employers are serious about social consensus continuing, both will have to come clean on the issue of trade union recognition.</P>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste accept that trade unionists are fed up, particularly in domestic industry, of having no representation and of people being left in very unfair industrial situations?  This is critical if we are to continue, and it is felt by some people that partnership, with our education system, has been the basis of the success of the Celtic Tiger. If we want that to go on, does the Tánaiste accept that there cannot be any more agreements unless fundamental legislation on this matter is introduced?</P>

      <P>I do not know if he would like me to say he was glamorous.  Notwithstanding the fact that we do not have mandatory recognition of trade unions, 48 per cent of the employee workforce belong to trade unions.  That is a very high proportion; it is only 10 per cent in France. There are a number of ways in which employees establish rights and conditions of work, including rates of remuneration.  One is through arrangements between employer and employee.  Another <Col N="902" /> way is by statute and there is the third option of collective bargaining at either national or firm level.  There is no evidence to suggest that the rights and conditions of employment are better if they are negotiated one way rather than another.</P>
      <P>This is a very complex area and it is appropriate I should await the outcome of the high level group examining the issue.  Although I agree with Deputy Broughan's comments regarding Mr. Somers, Mr. Kevin Duffy, the assistant general secretary of ICTU, said at the same conference that we should not underestimate the difficulties of this matter.  It is a difficult and sensitive issue and one that has to be handled with great care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree that in the European arena generally, under Commissioner Pádraig Flynn and his predecessors, there is strong support for trade union recognition? Commitments have been made recently by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in this regard, and, as in other areas, we should be following European models in this matter.  The European economy has been built on consensus and involving people.  In recent directives Commissioner Flynn has mentioned improving consultation and information.  For example, a colleague of mine in Donegal North East informed me that a company there with 80 workers closed for the summer holidays.  It did not reopen, and nobody was told why.  Such abuse of workers and their families is appalling and can only be rectified by trade union recognition, as happened elsewhere in the European Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept it can only be done by trade union recognition.  Indeed, the Irish experience suggests there are many different models which work very well.  Sometimes volunteerism can work extremely well.  Over 50 per cent of those who work in manufacturing work in foreign companies, the majority of which are not unionised.  They have very good rates of pay and conditions of employment.  It makes sense for corporate Ireland, whether the multinational or indigenous sector, to consult and work in agreement and partnership.  I accept what Deputy Broughan said in that regard.</P>
      <P>The social partnership model established in this economy since the mid-1980s has worked extremely well at national level.  There are huge sensitivities, particularly in the multinational sector, of which the Deputy is probably aware.  That sector is responsible for making a huge contribution to national wealth and employment in this economy, which is one of the reasons we are doing so well in terms of economic growth.  We must consult wisely and carefully before we move forward in this area while taking on board the various views and perspectives.</P>

Does she <Col N="903" /> foresee a situation where she might have to introduce a constitutional referendum to ensure the issue is dealt with given that it is the primary demand?

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU is not threatening to remove Ireland's right to continue its policy of giving industrial grants throughout all parts of Ireland and, therefore, the question of receiving assurances on this does not arise.  While the EU Commission has exclusive competence in relation to the current review of regional aid guidelines, it is conducting this review in consultation with all member states.  We will continue to ensure that Ireland's interest is fully protected in that process.</P>
      <P>The Commission is rightly seeking to introduce a fairer, more transparent and legally balanced State aid regime.  Given that the cohesion countries are reducing their share of state aid it is clear that the ability of wealthier countries to provide higher levels of aid can lead to unfair competitiveness pressures on less well-off member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that discussion is not taking place with Commissioner Van Miert on the industrial grants we provide?  A spokesman for Commissioner Van Miert is quoted as saying that the Commissioner wants to review all concessionary taxes and State subsidies used by member states and that there is a clear indication he is seeking to change Ireland's objective 1 status to objective 2 thereby threatening <Col N="904" /> IDA grants.  Will the Minister say if Commissioner van Miert has tabled proposals on standardising industrial grants?  If not, when does she expect him to do so?  Does the Minister accept we will not be able to give as much grant aid in future as in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I had received assurances from the EU Commission regarding Ireland's right to continue its policy of giving grant aid throughout all parts of Ireland. This policy is not under threat, but what is under threat is the level of grant aid.  I stand over what I said &mdash; it will not be possible in the future to give as much grant aid to all parts of the country as we gave in the past.</P>
      <P>We are involved in delicate discussions with the Commission on a number of issues, for example, the State aids issue and corporation taxes, and I am sure the Deputy appreciates it would be wrong of me to say anything more on the matter at this stage.  However, I am satisfied that we will continue to be able to give grant aid.</P>
      <P>On inward investment, grant aid is a minor factor in so many companies deciding to set up here.  We currently attract 50 per cent of US electronic companies even though we have less than 1 per cent of the EU population.  These companies set up here because of the low corporation tax rates, the skills base of the population, infrastructure and quality of life.  The IDA has reduced the level of grant aid given to corporations in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the current maximum rate of grant given by the IDA to incoming companies is approximately 50 per cent and £11,500 per individual job?  If she and the Minister for Finance give into the idea of reclassifying Ireland as one region or, worse still, reclassifying parts of it, then the maximum grant the IDA will be able to give is 20 per cent or £8,500 per job.  Will the Minister confirm that she will not agree to a reclassification of Ireland whereby the east coast, particularly Dublin, will fail to get grant aid from the IDA on the basis of GNP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that no consideration is being given to reclassifying the country. The figures quoted by her are not accurate as there are exceptions to the rule.  Grant aid of between 57-75 per cent is allowed, depending on the region.  In Údarás na Gaeltachta regions and similar regions the rate is as high as 75 per cent. I assure the Deputy that grant aid is not the only reason companies set up here.  It would be in the national interest if no grants were given throughout the EU as wealthier counties have the resources to outbid us if grant aid is the only factor in attracting industry.  Notwithstanding our recent economic success, we cannot give unlimited resources and it would suit us if no grant aid was given for industrial projects.  Our low corporation tax rates, the skills base of the population <Col N="905" />&mdash; the Government announced major investment in this regard this morning &mdash; and the flexibility of the workforce remain the key factors in attracting so many companies to set up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that there will be no loss of inward investment if IDA grants are reduced to the low level of 20 per cent?  We have benefited greatly from industrial grants and the Government will do no service to the country if it allows this reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would suit us if no grants were given throughout the EU.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that our low corporation tax rates are an incentive to foreign investment here.  Last year the Irish subsidiaries of foreign multinationals paid £700 million in corporation taxes.  If they had located in other countries they would have paid three times that amount.  These are highly profitable and successful companies and the corporation tax rates remain a key factor in their deciding to set up here.  This is why the Government remains committed, as the previous Government was, to reducing the standard rate of corporation tax to a single low rate by 2005 so that it is not seen as a State aid in any sense.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the devastating effect of the increase in large multiples on the retail sector in the UK, with the closure of 8,000 small retail shops in the past three years? The Minister should ensure this order remains in place for a considerable time until the impact of Tesco is realised.  The retail industry is a huge industry involving suppliers, manufacturers and retailers.  I am concerned Tesco will take over the retail market because that would have a devastating effect on all those involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> Since the introduction of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order there has been the lowest rate of increase in food prices since 1947, which proves its effectiveness.  It has ensured rationale in the retail sector.  I welcome competition, which is important, but the opening up of Tesco in Ireland poses a serious threat to the survival of many retailers.  Its commitment to the manufacturing industry should be met.  It is important that company does not use Ireland as a distribution centre, as is the case in the North.  Even though a commitment was given that Tesco would engage Irish companies, it is bringing in stock from the UK.</P>
    <P>A number of Irish companies have been requested to bring their stock to distribution centres from where it is distributed by Tesco lorries. That will have a serious effect on the industry. Will the Minister ensure the order is not rescinded?  Is she aware suppliers have been notified to reduce stock levels?  There is cherry-picking in terms of the range of stock carried and that will have a disastrous effect on small firms.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure Tesco meets its obligations, otherwise there will be a serious threat to the survival of retailers.</P>

      <P>There is much merit in what the Deputy has said.  The order has led to stability in the marketplace.  It prevents predatory pricing and the payment of &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money.  It is interesting, however, that in the years from February 1988 to April 1997 products covered by the order increased by 23.42 per cent whereas in areas not covered by the order products increased by 22.4 per cent.  My predecessor extended the order in 1995 and I await the report of the review group before making a decision on the matter.  I have much sympathy with many of the points made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware the survival of retailers depends on the existence of the order? Regardless of the statistics she has quoted, there is a grave risk that small retailers will close if the order is rescinded.</P>

      <P>We must look after the interests of retailers in rural Ireland, but we must also ensure there is competition and that consumers do not pay too high a price for their goods.  I will take those factors into account when I receive the report of the review group later this year.</P>

      <P>As the review group got an extension of two years, will the Minister give a commitment that she will renew the order if she has not received its report before the second period expires?  Is she aware that an Irish company was asked by Tesco to remove all but 24 of the 100 products on its shelves?  This is contrary to what I believe was the understanding when it was agreed Tesco could operate here.  I can give the Minister details of this later if she wishes.</P>

I have had discussions with Tesco who reiterated to me, orally and in writing, the commitments it gave to my predecessor and I am determined to ensure they are honoured.  We had discussions this week with some of the English multiples on these issues.  I will investigate the matter to which the Deputy referred if she gives me the details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies Stanton, Perry and Naughten on their election and wish them well.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is attending a Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, governs the opening hours of retail establishments. The Act provides for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops but gives the Minister power, by order, to add to the list of exempted businesses or to exempt specified regions from the provisions of the Act.  An order made later that year exempted the entire country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that concerns expressed about the growth of Sunday trading in recent years might be addressed by reintroducing controls under the 1938 Act.  However, the previous Government obtained legal advice to the effect that distinctions between shops for the purposes of Sunday trading on the basis of type or size would be vulnerable to constitutional challenge. For this reason, it took the view, when it included certain provisions on Sunday working in the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, that any difficulties to which the increase in Sunday trading had given rise could, and should, be dealt with as conditions of employment issues.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office, my colleague, Deputy Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, consumer rights and international trade, met representatives of ICTU and IBEC to review the position on Sunday working in the retail sector.  As a result of those discussions, he invited both parties to open discussions with a view to exploring the possibility of an agreement being entered into between employer and employee representatives of the main players in the sector.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> The Minister offered to assist this process in any way he could.  This approach reflects his belief, with which I agree, that partnership should be the cornerstone of any initiative in this area. The social partners are currently considering the proposal.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his good wishes and congratulate him and the Tánaiste on their appointments.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the Bill circulated by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, prior to the election?  What happened to that Bill?  Will it be reintroduced?  Has Government policy changed now that Fianna Fáil has moved to the other side of the House?  Is the Minister of State concerned about the casualisation of the workforce and the increase in part-time workers because of Sunday trading?  Is he aware that studies reveal that such trading is not resulting in more money being spent in shops or in extra jobs?  Is he aware that, if anything, jobs are being lost because of Sunday trading and in the long-term it will lead to an increase in costs?  Does the Minister of State agree it is up to us to protect the weakest in society?  What is the Government's policy on minimum rates of pay, taking into account the number of part-time workers and the casualisation of the workforce?  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said he does not agree with a minimum wage, while the Taoiseach said he does. Who will make the decision on that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising these questions.  I am aware of a Bill circulated by my ministerial colleague, Deputy Kitt, in the past.  I am sure Deputy Stanton's colleagues will tell him that once there is an election and the previous Dáil is terminated all Bills before it die with it.  There has been a change of Government and the Minister of State is on top of this position and has been for a long time.  He is dealing with this matter in a positive and vigorous manner.  I could not agree that jobs have been lost as a result of this position.  Statistics will show they have not been but that there has been a large increase in the number of people at work.  If a detailed analysis on the cost factor was carried out it would be hard if not impossible to prove there has been an increase in costs <i>vis-a -vis</i> production. While a policy on a minimum wage is a connected matter, it must be considered in the context of the totality of the situation.  That is being done by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the wider social issue of Sunday trading, for years Sunday has been regarded as a rest day and a family day.  Is the Minister of State not concerned about the trend that more and more people are working on Sundays?  Greed is propelling that trend.  Once one shop opens other must open to be competitive.  Is the Minister of State concerned about the effect of this trend on smaller shops and businesses in our towns and that thousands of small firms have <Col N="909" /> gone out of business in recent years because of it?  Does he intend to impose any restriction on the large multiples?  Is there a measure to restrict them opening on Christmas Day or Easter Sunday and, if not, has he any proposals for that?</P>

There are proposals, but the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, the Department and the Tánaiste and the Government are trying to achieve consensus, a unity of purpose and a positive and responsible attitude from employer and employee organisations, and the unions, to achieve what society would require, a balanced conclusion so that we can all move forward together.  I am confident that if we continue the dialogue, responsibility will be discharged by all sides and ultimately agreement can be reached.</P>

      <P>I, along with seven other Labour TDs and a Labour Minister, was present last February at a meeting in Wynn's Hotel organised by the MANDATE trade union which led a valiant and courageous fight on behalf of its workers on this matter.  The only non-Labour Party person there who apparently cared about this issue at the time was the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.  He gave a pledge in writing to the secretary of the MANDATE trade union that as soon as his party was returned to Government it would introduce necessary legislation to hold a referendum to curb Sunday trading.  Where is he today?  He is conveniently away on European business.  We have to listen to his excuses on this matter when he gave a commitment on it.  It will be awful if the Opposition has to introduce Private Members' legislation which no doubt would not be accepted by the Government.  Despite the Minister of State having given a commitment to address this matter in Opposition he is reneging on it.  That is an appalling state of affairs and an appalling message to send to the thousands of low paid part-time casual workers who have no choice this coming Sunday but to go to work while the Minister of State or I can choose to go to watch a Gaelic match after we have greeted &mdash; as politicians tend to &mdash; the crowds coming out from Mass.

      <P>The rescinding of the order and Sunday trading are linked.  Is the Minister aware of the devastating effects this will have on the industry and not only retailers?  The multiples will dictate terms to suppliers and there will be huge job losses.  The way to perfect Sunday trading is to have a cut-off area of footage per store.  It is important to give a service, but multiples are giving this service every day, on Bank Holidays and Sundays.  The grocery trade will go down the drain and jobs will be lost.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government includes, as a key priority, the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage.  To give effect to that commitment, I have established a National Minimum Wage Commission.  The membership of the commission <Col N="913" /> represents a mix of experience and expertise of business, industrial relations, employment rights and knowledge of the labour market. I am particularly pleased that Ms Evelyn Owens, who is Chairman of the Labour Court, agreed to chair the commission.  I am satisfied with the composition of the commission and I do not propose any changes in this regard.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the commission are to advise on the best way to implement the commitment having regard to the level and extent of low pay in the economy; to examine the range of possible mechanisms for determining and implementing minimum wages and, in combination with it, to describe and assess the existing minimum wage-fixing machinery and its potential for addressing low pay in the economy at large; to examine measures which will address any adverse impact on employment and competitiveness and in particular as regards small and medium enterprises; to consult with the social partners before the finalisation of its report and to report to the Government by the end of 1997.</P>
    <P>The commission has issued an open invitation for written submissions and it intends to hold oral hearings.  The commission is chaired by Ms Evelyn Owens.  The other members are Ms Rita Ahern, a businesswoman, Ms Carmel Bolger, who is involved in education, Mr. Phil Flynn, representing the trade union movement, and Mr. Peter Malone, representing IBEC's side of the social partnership.  The secretary to the commission is Ms Lorraine Benson from my Department.</P>

      <P>Deputy Perry referred to a report on Tuesday to the effect that the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, seems to have usurped the Minister's role.</P>
      <P>I wondered if, given the pressure which the Government is under, the Taoiseach had decided to reshuffle the Tánaiste and some of the other Progressive Democrats out and to shuffle the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in.</P>

      <P>Why is the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, pontificating on the Tánaiste's portfolio and stating what should be the level of a minimum wage?  Did the Tánaiste complain to the Taoiseach about this and is she taking any steps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a fact there is no direct representative of the trade union movement on the commission? The Tánaiste referred to a former trade unionist and a former business representative.  My understanding is that there is no direct representative <Col N="914" /> on the commission.  Is it a fact that two members of the commission are from the Tánaiste's constituency and were, perhaps, appointed for her own reasons?  Is the commission sufficiently broadly based to enable it to produce the necessary report?</P>
    <P>It has been proven in Europe and the US, which is the most dynamic economy in the world, that a minimum wage works very successfully in creating jobs.  Would the Tánaiste not agree that the issue of low pay and the gender gap, which is referred to in a later question, is particularly relevant to women?  Low skilled workers, particularly women, are paid appalling wages.  Given the progress of the Celtic tiger, we can well afford to have a decent minimum wage for all.</P>

I do not want the Deputy to think I nominated any member of the commission because they are personal friends or because of where they live.  I stand subject to correction if they live in my constituency, but if they do it is accidental.</P>

      <P>It was because we felt this was the most appropriate way to do it.  I had informal consultations with both the trade union movement and the employers' organisation.  The group which was put together is balanced in terms of gender, perspective, experience and expertise.  I suggest it would be helpful if Deputy Broughan made a submission to the commission.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about low pay and the exploitation of workers.  It is true that women and young people are particularly exploited in certain sectors of the workforce.  It may be the case that that happens much more in the black economy than in the legitimate one.  The commission will have to establish the extent of low pay in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that we move in this regard in a sensitive way.  At the moment, 100,000 workers are covered by the existing joint labour committee machinery, through which rates of pay covering 17 categories of workers, ranging from law clerks to caterers and cleaners, have been struck. That machinery has been relatively successful and we must examine its impact.  This is a very complex area, as other countries realised when they <Col N="915" /> sought to legislate for it, and we want to do it appropriately and fairly, recognising that no pay and no work is the greatest discrimination of all. The manner in which the Government has sought to implement the firm commitment in the programme for Government is the most effective way to proceed in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>With half the young people in the workforce in the low wage bracket, there is an urgent need for a reasonable minimum wage. The Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy O'Dea, biased the supposed independence of the commission when he criticised the suggested minimum wage.  How can the Government stand over a Minister of State criticising a minimum wage when there is supposed to be an independent commission deliberating on the issue?  The Taoiseach said one thing, the Minister of State another.  The Government is running around like a headless chicken.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Tánaiste is on record as admiring the low wage and sweatshop economies of south-east Asia, where factory conditions for many workers are often similar to those endured by unfortunate battery hens in factory farms.  Exploitation is rife and, in some instances, conditions approach slave labour.  Has she been converted in the meantime and has she been informed that, outside the black economy, low wages are a major scourge in the Irish economy, a major cause of poverty and suffering in many families and that there is huge exploitation? Will she also agree that a figure of £5 per hour is the lowest that could be contemplated for some level of dignity and comfort in the lives of ordinary people?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not speculate on the appropriate figure. A number of factors have to be taken into account, including experience, age, skill levels and so on.  That is why it is appropriate that the <Col N="916" /> kind of commission I have established, which has the necessary expertise, is in the best position to produce a mechanism for dealing with minimum wages.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Broughan, I did not make a complaint about the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.  I do not have all the tendencies of the former Tánaiste; I do not complain about things, rather I get on with my job.  Deputy O'Dea is entitled to express a view.

      <P>The greatest exploitation of all is having no job, being alienated from society and having no right to contribute and participate.  Our young people want a chance to participate in the economic and social development of this country and I am determined they will get that chance and that they will be rewarded fairly for doing it.</P>
      <P>One of my concerns is that exploitation, in so far as I often see it, is usually associated with the black economy.  That is why it becomes very difficult to deal with it.  The contributory factors include the high levels of taxation on personal income.  This needs to be addressed urgently to ensure everybody who goes out to work is justly rewarded for their efforts and participation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by my socialist colleague.  On the question of a minimum wage, during the campaign the Taoiseach gave a commitment to set the figure at £3 per hour.  Was that not a ludicrous proposal in Irish conditions?  It is a ridiculously low level.  The Economic Policy Institute in Washington in a briefing paper entitled, The Sky Hasn't Fallen, has shown conclusively that young people in particular have benefited enormously as a result of establishing a level below which wages, in sectors <Col N="917" /> in which they are vulnerable such as catering, are not allowed to fall.  The Centre For Economic Performance in the United Kingdom has shown clearly that in the years prior to 1994 when the Thatcherites and the Tories abolished the labour committees there was some protection for workers across a range of industries.  I urge the Minister to move quickly on this matter.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Minister remarked that material goods do not equate with happiness.  Will she agree that a home is a necessary possession for at least a little happiness in people's lives?  Does she realise that this is outside the reach of growing numbers of workers because their wages do not allow them to purchase or rent their own homes?  The question of exploitation should be resolved as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I agree that everybody should have access to adequate housing.  We have one of the highest rates of home ownership which is being put outside people's reach for a number of reasons, not least of which is the failure of some people to rezone lands for residential development.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 57 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The employment summit in Luxembourg later this month reflects the ongoing concern in the European Union at the prevailing level of unemployment affecting 18 million people.  One of the major objectives of the summit is to move beyond the general recommendations agreed at recent European Councils and adopt a strategy based on concrete actions and targets to which the member states will commit.</P>
      <P>The European Commission's proposed employment guidelines are based on a four pillar framework that seeks to promote entrepreneurship, employability, adaptability and equal opportunities.  We are positively disposed towards this framework and the general direction of the policy prescriptions proposed.  They are very much in line with the policies being pursued by the Government.</P>
      <P>The recent labour force survey findings point to the strong growth in job creation in the economy with 41,000 additional people at work in the last year.  This is having a positive impact on unemployment with the Irish unemployment rate less than the European average for the first time in many years.  The Irish unemployment rate is still exceptionally high.  The Government is determined to make further substantial inroads into the number of people unemployed.  The proposals before the employment summit will assist us in this regard.  The progress being made here in increasing employment and reducing unemployment is the envy of some of our European neighbours.</P>
      <P>With regard to the delegation to the summit, this is a matter for the Presidency which I understand has indicated that it should comprise the Taoiseach accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as specified in Article D of the Treaty of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the heart-warming figures he quoted, does the Minister accept that unemployment continues to be an outrageous reality for many thousands of families?  Does he accept that many regions, particularly the north-west in Donegal and Sligo, in addition to the Dublin area, still experience very significant unemployment, including huge pockets of anything between 30 and 60 per cent concentrated in some constituencies?  No doubt he will be aware of the totally unacceptable level of 60 to 70 per cent in several parishes in the constituency of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> Tánaiste, yet after four months in office this Government has not come up with a single proposal to rectify that overall position.</P>
    <P>Given that the long-term unemployed, comprise many individuals who left the education system early and perhaps became involved in vandalism and drugs-related crimes, in addition to those aged 30-plus who did not finish second level or vocational education, what proposals has the Minister to compensate those in greatest need of training?</P>
    <P>While I have reservations about the euro road on which we have embarked &mdash; it appears that this House has locked us into that commitment which is to be announced next spring and about which no doubt the Minister for Finance will have some comments to make &mdash; what proposals has the Minister for the 70 per cent of indigenous industry dependent on exporting to the United Kingdom?  I am thinking of companies like those in my constituency, such as Cadburys and many others, particularly those engaged in the food industry.  What proposals has the Minister to protect such companies over the next four or five years if, as some people fear, the road to the single currency proves to be an extremely rocky, treacherous one?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Broughan covered a vast area in his questions.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that our unemployment levels are exceptionally high and I fully concur with what he said about various pockets of the country, of this city and of my own constituency where this problem manifests itself.  Through the policies adopted to date and initiatives taken in Government which are currently being renewed, along with future proposals, we shall address the position.  There is no question of these levels being allowed to continue.  We are in constant change because of changes taking place within society generally consequent on technological advances and so on.  The Government has many ideas and is prepared to take decisions and make the capital available to put in place structures and provide opportunities to facilitate young people coming into the jobs marketplace. Our proposals will take account of retraining for those already in the marketplace and those who have not yet had an opportunity.</P>
      <P>To claim that the Government has not taken any action or initiative would appear to suggest that Deputy Broughan has not been observing them or listening to the positive announcements made which I have no doubt will prove to be of enormous benefit generally over the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there will be enormous changes on the introduction of the euro.  Some contend it will be a rocky road and others claim it may not be that rocky.  It is eminently desirable that we should be part of an international currency consensus to ensure we can compete without any latent <Col N="920" /> impediments in getting our products to the marketplace, thereby ensuring jobs are created.</P>
    <P>We face major challenges in addressing our high rate of unemployment but we are on the right road.  The commitment of the Government and State agencies, current economic growth and the expected commitment from the European Union summit in the spring will permit us to achieve what we desire, namely, employment for as many people as possible on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State honestly asking us to accept his bona fides about halving unemployment during the next five years, despite the Minister's assertion that by 1999 we will not be able to provide the same type of grants the IDA has been giving to manufacturing industries and internationally traded financial services?  The most significant increase in employment has occurred in these areas and it will slow down in the future because IDA grants cannot be given. Will the Minister of State explain how he can state that the Government will give capital grants to create further jobs if we are to be bound by the European Commission to desist from providing such grants?  How can he square that circle? He is contradicting the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen is misinterpreting our comments.  There is no contradiction on this side of the House and we are as one in our efforts to achieve the goals we set ourselves.  There is a commitment throughout the EU to try to reduce the exceedingly high rate of unemployment in member states.  The Government admits that, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, the rate in Ireland is exceptionally high.  Our comments cannot be interpreted as meaning that the future will be drastic.</P>
      <P>We are public representatives and, regardless of the level at which we serve, from the time we first speak in that role our utterances may prove advantageous or disadvantageous to the country. Proposals exist which, if accepted, may curtail the amount of grants that may be given.  They will be resisted because Ireland has special problems.  We will fight to ensure that we obtain the best possible advantages in respect of investment opportunities and grant facilities so that we continue to attract high tech and mobile industries and create further employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen stated earlier that grants might be terminated.  However, the Minister stated that we may not be able to give the same level of grants.  We will work to achieve a facility which is in the best interests of our country and its economic growth and financial stability. In addition, we will ensure that we continue to create employment.  As an island nation, Ireland has specific problems which the European Union must address.  There is no danger that drastic measures will take effect before the year <Col N="921" /> 2000.  If possible, we will continue to resist and obtain a derogation for Ireland.  We will work in a positive and responsible manner because there is no point in informing the European Union or the international community that we accept this situation as a <i>fait accompli.</i>  We will not accept it as such until we have negotiated to the maximum capacity of our abilities to discharge our obligation on behalf of the people.</P>

      <P>The report of the Information Society Steering Committee, entitled &ldquo;Information Society Ireland: Strategy for Action&rdquo; was launched by the previous Government in March 1997.  That report recommended that the development of a digital park would act as a centre of excellence for the creation, provision and export of content for the information society.</P>
      <P>The feasibility of creating such a park in Ireland is currently being examined by Forfás by way of a commissioned study.  The study will assist in identifying target markets which could be developed via a digital park; identifying ways in which a competitive advantage can be developed for these markets in the park; developing proposals for the establishment of the park through licensing and other means; examining location considerations; and determining the structure and operation of a digital park.</P>

Does the Government propose any further initiatives or tax breaks for second and third level education to encourage the advancement of technology studies?  That would ensure schools and colleges have all technology training available to them.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Owen should make a statement like that because she is an experienced Deputy.  This is an exciting proposal and we are committed to the project.  We hope to be able to replicate it in satellite positions around the country.  We made a historic statement today with the announcement of a commitment to technological investment of £250 million <Col N="923" /> over the next five years at all third level colleges and in various other facets of activity.  Commensurate with that dedicated financing there will be an opportunity for the private sector to make additional investments.  We will also be considering other innovative measures to ensure further moneys will be available in this area.  The Government's commitment is not in doubt and when it makes commitments it is prepared to pay for them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's party leader and colleagues have made statements and decisions in the past, and particularly this year, about various projects and proposals, but no capital was earmarked or made available for them.  The Government is responsible and will ensure that when action plans are put forward capital will be available for them. They cannot be pie in the sky, they must be sustainable.</P>

      <P>I have been keeping in close personal contact with the Seagate company and the IDA in the matter, and I met Seagate senior management on both my recent visits to the United States &mdash; in late August and last week.  I have been assured by the company that this is a postponement of the project to review changes in the market for its products &mdash; data storage discs.  It is important to stress that this is not a cancellation but a mere postponement.</P>

      <P>On 15 October the Tánaiste told me that it was, in fact, a postponement.  She saw the executive vice president of Seagate on Friday, 3 October.  The question now is: when is the company coming to Ireland?  The Minister continues to tell us this is merely a postponement. We were talking earlier about unemployment black spots.  The north side of Cork city in particular is certainly one of those black spots. Unfortunately, my party does not have a parliamentary representative in that city, but there is a crying need for an industry such as this.  Will the <Col N="924" /> Minister give an assurance to the House that Seagate will come to Ireland and will she give the date the company will start up on the site in Ringaskiddy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that is the case. The company has to review its position in the market place and its products.  In the electronics field, as the Deputy knows, products and processes change every 12 to 15 months; it is a fastchanging industry.  The company's representatives have assured me this is merely a postponement and all I can do is accept their word, which I am happy to do.  Our experience with this company in the past has been a good one and its Cork project is very much part of their plans for the future.</P>
      <P>I accept there are high levels of unemployment in Cork as there are in other regions.  The Government is committed to regional development. By the end of this year, particularly between September and December, a record number of new projects will have been announced for Cork.  There are a number of new projects in the pipeline.  Cork is very much at the top of our agenda, as are other provincial cities and towns.  We are determined to have an even spread of development throughout the country.</P>

      <P>If the Minister accepts the word of the vice-president, would it not be important for the people of Cork that she ensure substitute arrangements are put in place with regard to replacement industries if this project does not go ahead?  People's hopes have been raised and now dashed.  Young people in particular about to enter the labour market are upset by this development. Will the Minister give us an assurance today that if this project does not go ahead she will identify a substitute project to replace it?  There are many technology companies on the west coast of America anxious to set up in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In light of her discussions with the vice-president and the fact that these jobs might only be postponed for six months, will the Minister indicate if she sought an assurance that other proposals are in the pipeline which can accept these 1,000 jobs?  For example, has the company prepared a planning application and is there sufficient floor space for these additional jobs?  That would give us some sense of assurance that these jobs have merely been postponed and not cancelled. <Col N="925" /> Did the Minister get any such assurance from the company?</P>

      <P>The company has completed the planning process but it is not proceeding with the construction until they come closer to the time when they need the products on the market.  In relation to Deputy Broughan's question, it would be wrong to look for a substitute for something that is merely postponed.  I assure the Deputy I have plans for many more projects for the Cork region and I hope to be in a position to make announcements in that regard over the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I mentioned cases which were referred to the Ombudsman and about which complaints were made to me.  The final case concerns the payment of ten and 22 month premiums by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The ten month premiums were applied for and paid.  However, when the 22 month premiums were applied for the following year the applicant omitted the birthdays of each beast because he had not retained a record.  Unfortunately, the application was turned down and the Department sought repayment of the moneys previously paid. What happened could be described as a technical error.  That was pointed out to the Ombudsman but he refused to accept it.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Food refused to contact the herd owner for approximately 13 months.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman asked the Department to change the regulations.  Although the Department was aware for 12 months that there had been a mistake and that the ages of the beasts had not been included, it did not contact the herd owner and the Ombudsman refused to take this into consideration.  He contacted the Department and the regulation was changed as a result.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that a fair decision was given by the Ombudsman in this case.  When the Department of Agriculture and Food disallows cases such as the one I outlined it rejects the premiums for one year and, in certain cases, in the second year.  There is an issue of proportionality involved.  The penalty is illegal because it breaches the requirement of proportionality.  It is indisputable that a farmer who makes an innocent mistake or a technical error with no fraudulent intent is not guilty of dishonest conduct and to impose on such a farmer one of the most severe penalties, that is, stopping payment of premiums over a two year period, is out of proportion.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Ombudsman a small leaflet which was included with his report, &ldquo;Public Bodies and the Citizen &mdash; The Ombudsman's Guide to Standards of Best Practice for Public Servants&rdquo;.  It states: &ldquo;Dealing fairly with people means &mdash; treating people in similar circumstances in like manner; accepting that rules and regulations, while important in ensuring fairness, should not be applied so rigidly or inflexibly as to create inequity; .&rdquo;. That is an important statement.  I have outlined the salient facts of three cases to the House and the Ombudsman did not apply that principle to those cases.  The leaflet further states that dealing fairly with people means &ldquo;avoiding penalties which are out of proportion to what is necessary to ensure compliance with the rules&rdquo;.  This is where the issue of proportionality arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman did not follow his own guidelines and allowed the events I have outlined to happen.  I have stopped certain cases being referred to the Ombudsman because I believe <Col N="927" /> applicants were not being given a fair hearing. The Ombudsman may not be aware that all farmers apply for and receive grants of one form or another and, for 60 per cent, the grants make up their entire net income.  A farmer can have his premium suspended for a two year period although it is his entire net income.  That is a serious situation for any affected family.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the situation in respect of the Ombudsman is fair.  He states his independence in the report and I am prepared to accept that.  However, I question whether he is impartial because he seems to side more with Department officials than with complainants.  I have witnessed incidents other than those I have cited where this is the case and have spoken to Deputies who advised people not to send their complaints to him.  The benefit of the doubt in these cases should be given to the complainant, provided nothing fraudulent is involved.  I question whether the benefit of the doubt was given in the cases of which I have practical knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman and his staff must develop the issue of proportionality.  It is a serious situation where a man's net income is removed for two years.  In the three cases I cited, I have no doubt that proportionality was not taken into consideration. It is all very well for the bureaucrats in Brussels to draw up regulations for the payment of premia and grants, but they do not consider the human aspect involved.  We depend on the Ombudsman to act as the buffer between us and the bureaucrats.  I welcome the fact that we now have an Ombudsman in Europe and that there is co-operation between him and our Ombudsman, but they have much work to do.  We do not want to resort to the courts because it can be lengthy and expensive for an individual.  It can take between six months and two years for a case to be heard.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the Ombudsman but I hope I have been constructive.  I have practical knowledge of the agricultural dimension, have cited three cases in which I dealt with the Ombudsman and was not pleased with the direction his staff took.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few Members of the Oireachtas would be a more avid supporter of the concept of the Ombudsman than myself.  I became a member of the International Ombudsman Institute as far back as 1978.  My PhD thesis was based on the spread of the Ombudsman concept internationally. At the same time, there can be few Members in either House who are as disappointed as I at the indicators in this report of the failure of this important public office to make an <Col N="928" /> impact on public administration.  The Office of Ombudsman should be the litmus test of the relationship between the citizen and the State. Reading this and previous reports, it is evident that we need a root and branch examination of the manner in which the office operates and, more importantly, of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act, 1984, and how it can be strengthened.  This is not a criticism of the office holder or his staff, but of this and the other House.  It is also a criticism of successive Governments who have paid lip service to the concept of an Ombudsman but have failed to deliver.</P>
    <P>We have had a fettered Ombudsman since 1984.  The office started with bright hopes in the early 1960s.  If anyone cares to read the hopes and aspirations for that office they could do no better than look at the contribution of former Deputy Fergus O'Brien when he introduced a Private Members' Bill on the office in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>By any objective standards there are alarming indicators that the office has not reached its full potential and it has failed to deliver on the dreams of those who wished to establish it.  There is an alarming decline in its capacity to handle complaints and confidence in the office has been undermined.</P>
    <P>There are two major disappointments in so far as the institution is concerned.  First, the lack of impact of the office on the public.  Second, its lack of impact on political life and the pattern of complaint behaviour.  The lack of public impact of the office is graphically illustrated in the steady decline in the number of complaints within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction recorded in the annual reports.  When the office issued its first report in 1985, there were 5,277 complaints handled.  In 1986 that figure rose to 6,862.  Since the late 1980s there has been a disastrous decline in the number of complaints handled within its jurisdiction.  For example, the 1988 report records that the figure had fallen to 2,800.  By 1990 it was down to 2,700 and in 1995 the office received 2,250 complaints. There are 80 major offices of Ombudsman in the developed nations and I challenge anyone to show a lower rate of complaint than in Ireland. There is something fundamentally wrong and we need to identify the problem.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the final numbers, the figure goes from 5,382 complaints in 1986 to a disastrous 2,180 in 1995.  By any objective standards these are not impressive figures.  The volume of complaints received is declining, as is the volume of complaints handled and finalised.  Why?</P>
    <P>Within the report there is a further alarming indicator.  As part of the strategic management initiative, the Ombudsman undertook a client review and I compliment him on this.  This is reproduced in part in page 8.  During this review, only 37 per cent of those contacted responded, two thirds did not.  Of those who responded, 67 per cent felt happy with the manner in which their complaint was handled.  This is a good percentage. However, it means that one third did not feel happy.  This is far too high a level of discontent. <Col N="929" /> Thirty five per cent who responded indicated that the office was not well publicised. Indeed, the Ombudsman makes this point about the office budget in the report.  We all know that in the past five or ten years the Ombudsman has failed to make the impact, not because of a fault with the incumbents of the office but because the office did not have sufficient money to launch a proactive vigorous campaign of publicity and take the institution to the four corners of the country.</P>
    <P>My second disappointment with the Ombudsman's office and the manner in which it operates at present is more serious, it is the failure to impact on the political culture and cliente lism which has been such a striking negative feature of the Irish political culture since the foundation of the State.  The great hope of the Oireachtas joint committee which was behind the creation of the office of the Ombudsman was that one of the major impacts would be on political life, that the Deputies, Senators, councillors and town commissioners up and down the country would be relieved of the tedium of being highly paid, and in some cases unpaid, messenger boys for the administrative system.  This simply has not happened.  In the ten years since the Ombudsman Act came into effect, the volume of public representatives' constituency work has risen steadily. My research proves this but, more importantly, and perhaps more objectively, reports which have looked at the pay scales in this and the other House have proved this.</P>
    <P>The level of complaint about public administration has also grown over that period; it has not declined as anticipated.  When the Ombudsman's office was set up we all felt that Deputies and public representatives were spending far too much of their time operating the messenger boy function, fixing matters for constituents, and far too little of their time operating as legislators.  Exponents of the office of Ombudsman argued strongly that the creation of a strong independent complaints mechanism would provide citizens with their own advocate and, at the same time, release public representatives to focus on policy rather than on the details of administration. This has not happened.  Councillors, Senators, Deputies and even Ministers are now investing more of their time in minor administrative issues than they did in the early 1980s when the debate on the Ombudsman Act got under way.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the office was created, I pointed out that the Irish system of complaint, the tradition of approaching each and every public representative in an area with administrative complaints, had a profound impact on administrative life and a corrosive impact on political life.  It undermined the confidence in the administrative system and its impartiality, and it also gave rise to the view that just about everything could be fixed.  That view is equally corrosive of politics.</P>
    <P>The situation is now worse than ever.  Ministers' offices are now packed with back-up staff handling constituency work more than ever <Col N="930" /> before in our history, as we know from replies to parliamentary questions delivered over the past five years.  Deputies and Senators are devoting a greater proportion of their time and energy to administrative minutiae.  The public is, if anything, more frustrated with our administration now and more cynical of political life than it has ever been.</P>
    <P>The office of Ombudsman could and should have a major impact on this situation.  If reform is to be effected, the Ombudsman's office should handle an increasing proportion of administrative complaints.  As we have seen, the opposite is the case.  The number of complaints being handled by the Ombudsman's office has shown an alarming decline.  At the same time, the proportion of the time of public representatives spent in the administrative minutiae has shown an equally alarming increase.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the office is suffering from a lack of publicity.  Mr. Kevin Murphy makes this point in his report and, indeed, Mr. Michael Mills also made that point.  It is also clear that it has an extraordinarily restrictive jurisdiction and, to his credit, Mr. Murphy makes this point.  In the past the office suffered budgetary and staffing constraints which were exercised by the very Administration which the Ombudsman was meant to control.</P>
    <P>It has always been my belief that the Ombudsman's office was effectively strangled at birth by administrative hostility.  It was given a uniquely restricted jurisdiction, and I have made this point in several articles.  I once analysed 80 ombudsman Acts and by any objective standard the Irish Act was the worst.  A huge amount of the administration remains outside the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and, uniquely, the office has had areas of administration withdrawn from its jurisdiction.  As the Ombudsman notes, he still cannot examine the activities of the bulk of commercial State-sponsored bodies and is excluded from examining non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  He makes specific reference to FÁS and the vocational education committees, two sectors which have inexplicably been removed from his jurisdiction.  He is confined to examining complaints about administrative matters within the health boards and is excluded from taking a view on clinical mistakes or incompetence. If a patient goes into hospital and has the wrong leg cut off, the Ombudsman can examine how the paperwork was handled but cannot take a view on the clinical judgment.  In 1981 I pointed out, in a critique of the Ombudsman proposals, that this was a bizarre exclusion.  The only country which had such an absolute exclusion was the UK, where the office is even more fettered. Characteristically, Paddy copied the Brits; we did not have enough confidence to write an ombudsman Act based on best practice and copied the worst practice.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman cannot handle a variety of issues within the general administration because the concept of maladministration as defined in <Col N="931" /> the Act is restrictive.  An Ombudsman in a Canadian province told me that the great thing he brought to the office was that he had not read the Act carefully and interpreted it liberally.  The Irish Ombudsman does not have the same capacity because his hands were tied from day one.</P>
    <P>I have said before that there is no reason to fetter this institution and that it would be in all our interests &mdash; above all in the interest of the public and of public administration &mdash; if the Office of the Ombudsman were released from the restrictions in the Act.  A review of the Ombudsman Act, which has been promised by successive Administrations, is now long overdue.  The Act's many defects must be rectified, the jurisdiction of the office must be extended to cover all areas of public administration and all bodies funded by the State should be brought within its purview.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas truly cares for the office, we must immediately re-establish the Joint Committee on Administrative Justice or another committee to oversee public administration and reform and we must completely rewrite the Ombudsman Act to create an office which is better equipped, better funded and more independent in order to fulfil the role of people's advocate better than our current fettered Ombudsman can.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has raised another issue, not mentioned in any contribution here, of which the Minister should take note &mdash; the current proliferation of crypto-ombudsmen.  The term has been scandalously purloined by a variety of public bodies who want to cover themselves in positive PR. The term &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; means a high level public official, statutorily based, whose independence is assured and whose task is defined in law.  The term has been plundered by bankers, financial institutions and more recently by the rogues in the legal fraternity.  The concept of the ombudsman is debased when this happens.  I applaud the fact that these agencies have established complaint agents but they do not have the right to call those self-appointed individuals &ldquo;ombudsmen&rdquo;. They illustrate at least some degree of client-consciousness and a good exercise of public relations but they do damage the concept of ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The actions to be taken are evident.  There should be a complete review of the ombudsman Acts.  Such a review was promised by this Government and the last Government and should be undertaken without delay.  There should be an immediate extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. The concept was approached with fear and trepidation by the administrators who drafted the first Act but they have no reason to fear a truly active Ombudsman.  As was stated in a court judgment in Manitoba, Canada, if an ombudsman casts the light of public scrutiny into the dark recesses of public administration and illustrates that which is good, the administration benefits greatly.  If the ombudsman's light shines <Col N="932" /> on something bad corrective action can be taken and the population as a whole benefits.</P>
    <P>We need to bring forward legislation on administrative procedures &mdash; it is greatly overdue.  Such legislation was first envisaged in 1969 in the report of the public service review group, yet it is still awaited.  We need to speed up the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. Above all else, we need to be less timorous with our public administration.  We must be more adventurous and confident in ourselves.  We have a good public administration and we should have the national self-confidence to recognise that.</P>

      <P>It is a learning experience to listen to Deputy Roche who has a commitment and expertise in public administration which he has brought to bear in the debate.  In the light of the contributions from Deputy Roche and others I hope the Ombudsman will feel more optimistic about having the legislative and financial resources which he will need to fulfil our expectations of his office.  The Ombudsman's report is revealing about how much remains to be done by the Oireachtas and the Department of Finance to enable him to carry out his task.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche referred to the Ombudsman and his office being fettered.  It is up to the legislators, who set up his office with such enthusiasm, to facilitate him to carry out his work on behalf of the public and the public administration.  We have a tendency to set up agencies without following through with the necessary legislative and other resources to allow them to expand and to meet the needs they identify.  Society has not lent itself easily, naturally or culturally to the openness and rigorous examination essential to the Ombudsman's role.  We are timorous and fearful, to the point of paranoia at times, about allowing the public administration to be opened up to public debate.  Indeed, confidentiality starts at Cabinet level.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche indicated that the numbers applying to the Ombudsman seeking to have their cases resolved are low.  The Members of the Oireachtas must take a responsibility for that. Part of the difficulty regarding his office is that politicians have not rushed to support it by passing on work which justifiably falls within its remit. A similar situation developed in the case of the National Social Service Board as it expanded and the Citizens Advice Bureau as it tried to establish a nationwide network.  The culture of politics, with a combination of multi-seat constituencies which result in Deputies competing with each other, means that politician's clinics are crowded and encouraged to be so by those who should be providing the resources the Office of the Ombudsman requires.  We cannot have it both ways.  We must be rigorous.  We are questioning how inadequate some areas of the Ombudsman's remit is but at the same time we should look to ourselves when asking why his office has not developed in the way all of us wish it to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> I was struck by the code of practice issued by the office of the Ombudsman for the public service and the recommendation that it be incorporated in the training of those in the public service. The office has also recommended that it advise public bodies on how best to devise and implement an internal complaints system within individual departments.  Therefore, the terms of reference given to the Ombudsman and the manner in which they are carried out are not lacking on his side but rather on ours.  We should have been endeavouring to do this within these Houses and it should not be part of the Ombudsman's work.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has also engaged market research consultants to carry out a nationwide survey of public awareness of his office.  I hope he will be in a position to both resource and pay for the appropriate type of consultancy and research, to implement any recommendations and that politicians will co-operate with him in this.  Politicians should allow the Office of the Ombudsman to become the centre through which complaints and the justifiable needs and causes of the people can be independently processed.  A dependency culture is being sustained while that office is not used and while political clientelism continues to allow people to believe that their rights are dependent on the good will of somebody in authority.  One of the biggest difficulties the Ombudsman has had is getting the co-operation of other people to allow him to function.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, in introducing the report to the House demonstrated the delay we have caused in providing the corresponding supportive legislation and resources the office of the Ombudsman needs to carry out and expand its role, something we all, at least in theory, want to see happen.  It is outrageous that the Ombudsman's role has been curtailed rather than expanded in areas where he was hitherto allowed to intervene to investigate basic rights and bread and butter issues for people who sought redress through his office.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, has given deadlines within which the legislation should be implemented.  He referred especially to the Public Service Management Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act which were signed into law this year.  The Public Service Management Act requires Departments to prepare and submit to the Minister, no later than March next year, a strategy statement setting out the key objectives, outputs and related high level strategies, including use of resources of the Department.  I listened to the criticisms of Deputy Roche and others in this House.  I would like to think that this legislation will allow the Ombudsman and his office to return in 1998 &mdash; but certainly by 1999 &mdash; with an expanded, strengthened and more independent report than they have been allowed to make up to now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> The Ombudsman and politicians here are concerned by the apparent lack of awareness on the part of citizens, particularly those living in urban areas, of the existence the office of the Ombudsman, its accessibility and role in processing issues. This is highly worrying, particularly as people living in urban centres are among the most disadvantaged and suffer most lack of confidence and lack of knowledge of their rights.  If we did nothing but concentrate on that problem between now and when we receive the next report from the Ombudsman, we would be helping him to do what he was appointed to do &mdash; to be a first rather than a last resource for people who feel powerless and who do not know how or where to process their complaints.</P>
    <P>Unless all of us work towards encouraging people in disadvantaged areas and give them the information it is their right to have, the Ombudsman's office cannot function in the way it was set up to do.  We are providing the resources to enable it to carry out this huge task between now and the next report.  It is not as if the fall in the number of complaints points to a society that does not need this kind of justice and support.  A large number of people do not have the confidence or information to process complaints and this means a great number of cases which never come to the attention of the office of the Ombudsman would probably merit the most urgent attention.</P>
    <P>A major awareness raising point the former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, and the current Ombudsman have made in their reports is that the public service in terms of the governance of the country, must ensure that people get their rights and benefits not by default but because they are entitled to them.  The Ombudsman has continually stressed this important point.  I refer particularly to the area of social welfare benefits in this regard.  Some of the most disadvantaged people who are entitled to benefits are penalised because they are unaware of deadlines and do not understand the bureaucracy involved in making applications.  If people do not apply for benefits in time, they lose out on what is rightfully theirs. People pay to ensure they are fully entitled to benefits when they are in need.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case which encapsulates many of the points I and others are making.  A young woman in my constituency was widowed when her husband, with whom she ran a small business, died in his early forties.  She was trying to hold the business together and look after her four young children and because of the suddenness and trauma of his death, she did not apply in time for a contributory widow's pension to which she and her family were entitled.  She was told she was not entitled to the pension from the date of her husband's death because she did not apply in time.  This was due to the difficulties in her personal life.  She applied for the arrears of the pension but she was told that although arrangements for the payment of arrears had been significantly improved following the Ombudsman's report on <Col N="935" /> arrears of contributory pensions, regrettably the recent change to social welfare legislation entitling contributory based pensioners to back dated arrears for 12 months did not apply to her because it only applied to those who made applications for pensions after 1 January 1997.  She applied for her pension on 23 December 1996.</P>
    <P>The woman and her husband contributed to a pension that was rightfully theirs.  She was penalised because of the special circumstances in which she found herself and her lack of knowledge that she had to apply within a certain time.  The report of the Ombudsman makes the point every year with regard to all benefits and pensions, but particularly contributory pensions, that there should not be deadlines.  If a person has contributed to a pension and is eligible, he or she should receive it.  The former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, made the point that the State cheats people when they do not receive their rights.  The State makes money which does not rightfully belong to it and people are denied their entitlements to which they have contributed.</P>
    <P>These are the areas that the Ombudsman has asked to be rectified again and again.  We must not shoot the messenger, but rather enable the Ombudsman's office to carry out the responsibility we assign to it.  It is unfair of us to criticise the Ombudsman until we have put the legislation in place that allows his office to expand.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, indicated that legislation will be forthcoming and we must take account of what Deputy Roche has said given his examination of ombudsmen's offices here and abroad.  We should look at models for these offices in other more seasoned countries, but we must also review the legislation under which we set up the office.</P>
    <P>I do not expect legislation to meet every need or aspiration.  It is only when laws are implemented that anomalies arise.  However, we must be responsible and amend legislation when they occur.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Cabinet and the Department of Finance to ensure that resources needed to implement legislation which supports the Ombudsman's office will be available.  The Ombudsman and his staff should be congratulated on their work and for highlighting what we have to do.  I pay tribute to the Ombudsman on his election to the executive council of Ombudsmen, which is a high honour.  I hope that when he attends meetings with ombudsmen from all over the world, our Ombudsman holds his head high and can say that his office and staff are allowed to work as forcefully and fully as was envisaged in their founding.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> In his report, the Ombudsman lays down useful principles which he believes public bodies should implement in their dealings with the public.  On page 27, he speaks of dealing impartially with people and avoiding bias because of a person's colour, sex, marital <Col N="936" /> status, ethnic origin, culture, language, etc.  The Department of Justice is in flagrant violation of these principles.</P>
      <P>I was ashamed to hear a black Irishman from Belfast on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; describe what happened when he took a bus over the Border into this State.  Gardaí, on the instruction of the Minister for Justice, came onto the bus and asked only for his passport because his colour is different from that of most citizens of the State.  That is an outrage, and it happens on a weekly basis to Irish people crossing the Border if they are not white. We have been joined by the appropriate Minister of State.  I hope the Minister will convey this matter to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I urge all citizens and residents, North and South, whose colour is other than white and who are being so treated to protest loudly and publicly through the various organisations open to them, including anti-racist organisations and trade unions.  I also urge them to go the Ombudsman after every such incident so that there will be a record of the number of such occurrences and to stop this practice once and for all.</P>

      <P>Last Saturday I stood in St. Patrick's Hall in Dublin Castle awaiting the announcement of the referendum result.  It was a rather strange and even surreal experience.  I was the only Member of the Oireachtas present and initially no journalists were there until a crew from RTE belatedly turned up.  In a sense, it was a fitting conclusion to a debacle &mdash; the referendum on cabinet confidentiality.  It was a dark day for democracy.  If we really care about democracy, we need to analyse the referendum campaign and results in detail.</P>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves.  Some 66,111 votes were spoiled and 11,625 people who voted in the presidential election did not bother to vote in the referendum.  Added together, these figures give us a total of 77,736, which is greater than the margin of victory which was 63,602.  The message is clear.  People were confused and were not adequately informed about this important constitutional amendment.  If they had been informed, I am convinced the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would have come out on top.  As the &ldquo;no&rdquo; argument received publicity in the final few days, more people came to the view that we were including a half-baked measure in the Constitution and that we were, in effect, enshrining secrecy in the Constitution.  The amendment was deeply flawed and we were asked to trust the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach to honour the commitment he gave to the House to revisit this matter. I hope he does so by Easter and that he does not hold the referendum on the same day as that on the Amsterdam Treaty.  This referendum should treat the electorate with more respect and all future referenda should be conducted in a more even-handed and informative way.  Five parties in <Col N="937" /> the House advocated a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote &mdash; the two Coalition parties and the three parties which constituted the Rainbow Government.  It is remarkable that on such important questions there is a very cosy consensus in the House.  At the time of the bail referendum, the same five parties advocated a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  I have no doubt that on the Amsterdam Treaty they will again advocate a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder people have become cynical and disillusioned with politics?  They are deprived of choice and information.  The strategy of the five conservative parties, as I refer to them, is simply to deprive people of information and hope they will go to the ballot box and follow the party line.  Mr. Joe Duffy of RTE relayed an interesting anecdote.  He told us a woman in Swords approached the Taoiseach and asked him to explain what the referendum was about.  He dismissed her by saying, &ldquo;Do not ask any questions as it would take me all night to answer them; simply vote &lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The advertisements placed by the <i>ad hoc</i> commission in the newspapers looked like planning applications and were not user friendly.  The commission should be constituted into a proper commission similar to the one in Canada which operates very effectively.  This would ensure that in future RTE would not follow slavishly the party line and simply allocate time to the largest parties. Such an approach negates democracy and is not what a referendum is about.  Time should be allocated to the parties for and against a proposal on a 50-50 basis.</P>

      <P>In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1 from Deputy Spring on 22 October, the Taoiseach set out the arrangements put in place by the Government to ensure an informed debate took place on the issue of cabinet confidentiality in the context of the referendum on 30 October.  In addition, the statutory requirement set out in section 23 of the Referendum Act, 1994, for the provision of information to voters was implemented.  This House passed the required resolution on 10 September. The requirement relates to the inclusion on the polling information card of a statement for the information of voters which included the text of the proposed constitutional amendment.  Posters containing statements for the information of voters on the proposed amendment to the Constitution were also displayed in all polling stations. In addition, copies of the relevant Bill were provided free of charge at all post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the case of the referenda on divorce and bail, an <i>ad hoc</i> commission comprising the Ombudsman and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad was established on the invitation of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to supervise the production and publication of an information statement setting out concisely the case for and against the proposed constitutional amendment.  The commission was set up <Col N="938" /> to ensure that the production and dissemination of information was carried out by an independent body without reference to the Government.</P>
    <P>The statements, for the information of voters, were published in the national daily and evening newspapers, in the provincial press and the major free sheets during the week before the referendum. The text of the proposed amendment and the two prepared statements were printed in full in these notices.</P>
    <P>As suggested during Question Time on 22 October, the party leaders representing the five biggest parties in the House issued a joint statement on the referendum on 28 October.  In addition, members of the Government and of the parties in Government made speeches and took part in debates on television, radio, the media and elsewhere on the Cabinet confidentiality issue.</P>
    <P>It has already been suggested by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that the holding of referenda with other elections will have to be looked at in the context of the overshadowing of the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality by the presidential election and that the establishment of an independent referendum commission will have to be looked at in the context of holding frequent referenda.  Recommendations made by the all-party commission on the Constitution are being examined in that context.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Last Friday's decision by Mr. Justice McCracken in the High Court to strike down a summons for a road traffic offence because the court clerk had not been properly appointed has led to personal catastrophes in some cases.  I described the potential outcome of the decision as a nightmare in many cases.</P>
      <P>An application was made by a Dublin housewife at Dún Laoghaire District Court for an extension of a barring order against her husband. She had been granted a two month barring order last February and was granted a renewal of it last April for a six month period.  As the barring order was to expire last Tuesday she went before Dún Laoghaire court to seek a further extension of it. Her husband was also before the court on a charge of breaking the previous barring order. The charge against her husband was not proceeded with because of the High Court ruling on District Court clerk appointments.</P>
      <P>While the barring order was extended to February, in the total confusion that ensued and because the husband's breach of the previous order was not dealt with, it was assumed the barring order had not been renewed.  The result was that when the housewife returned to her house her husband had taken possession of the family home, of which he is still in possession, and she had to seek accommodation in a local women's refuge where she remains with her two children and grandchild.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> The decision is also a nightmare for the relatives of the unfortunate waitress who lost her life tragically when the contents of the dessert tray she was carrying at a wedding in a hotel caught fire, causing severe facial burns, and whose case was dismissed this week because of the court clerk ruling.  Apart from the upholding of law and order, there are deep personal traumas involved in the hundreds of cases struck down throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is not here to deal with this matter.  People in general were extremely surprised at his highly indignant reaction when I raised this matter.  I did not point the finger of blame at the Minister and I do not do so today.  That is in marked contrast to the approach adopted by the Minister in Opposition when he blamed Deputy Owen, the then Minister, for every murder, bank robbery and kidnapping. Last night again on the 6.01 News on RTE the Minister spoke in veiled terms about collusion, as if there is a conspiracy.  I merely asked questions about the consequences of the High Court judgment and the need to take corrective action by appeal to the Supreme Court or by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>If the High Court decision stands, all summonses relating to current and pending cases will be invalid and the charges will fall.  Thousands of convictions obtained on foot of documents issued by court clerks not properly appointed would be open to challenge, as would barring orders and licences granted by District Courts.  One can imagine the chaos that would result if each case is challenged individually.  I hope the Supreme Court does not uphold the decision, but it may well do so &mdash; there are many precedents for that. I hope the court deals expeditiously with the appeal.  Is the Minister of State and the Department fully satisfied that the collective signing, in one document, of warrants of appointment of District Court clerks by the Minister last week is procedurally correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister who would like to have taken this debate but is in Templemore today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday last the High Court ruled that District Court clerks on their appointment as such, should be appointed personally by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Up to that ruling the long-standing practice had been that persons appointed as District Court clerks, whether appointed following competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commission or following Civil Service transfer or promotion arrangements, were appointed by an authorised officer of the Department.  As all District Court clerks were appointed in this way action had to be taken to ensure those officers who had been performing the functions of District Court clerks up to last Friday could continue to do so.  Accordingly, on the same day, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform took the measures <Col N="940" /> necessary to appoint District Court clerks and, as is also required, arranged for them to be assigned to District Court areas.  That action enabled the District Courts to continue in operation.  A number of commentators have questioned whether the use of one document to secure these appointments casts doubt on the validity of the appointments. Deputy Higgins is concerned about this matter.  The Minister has been specifically advised by the Attorney General that this is not the case but, to put the matter firmly beyond doubt and argument, he decided to issue each District Court clerk with an individual document appointing him or her as such.  The Attorney General has advised that such action on the part of the Minister does not disturb the appointments made last Friday or any actions pursuant to them.</P>
    <P>This will also have the beneficial effect of providing each District Court clerk with a formal document confirming his or her appointment, which has not been the case up to now.  Persons serving as District Court clerks have instructions not to issue documents, etc., requiring the signature of District Court clerks unless they are satisfied with the documentation in their possession relating to their appointments.</P>
    <P>In regard to the implications for cases pending before the courts, it is a matter for the courts to decide whether cases are properly before them. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not have a function in such matters. The Minister, however, is aware that large numbers of summonses have been struck out or withdrawn and that in certain cases new summonses are being applied for where this is possible.</P>
    <P>In so far as the judgment is concerned, the Minister understands that an appeal is being taken to the Supreme Court and that an early hearing is to be sought.  The Minister accepts that Deputy Higgins prefaced the remarks he made publicly by stating &ldquo;If the Supreme Court rejects the appeal&rdquo;.  Between now and the hearing of the appeal the matter will be carefully examined to see what legislative or other action might be taken if the appeal is not successful.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable disruption in the District Court arising from the decision of the High Court.  The practice the High Court has found to be wrong is a long-standing one which, on legal advice, had been regarded as proper over many years.  The Minister acted promptly to ensure disruption is kept to a minimum and if further action is required, following the appeal to the Supreme Court, it will be taken.</P>

      <P>There is nothing more important or desirable in a satellite town than a third level education facility to accommodate the rapidly increasing teenage population.  The people of the greater Blanchardstown area want the Higher Education Authority to recommend Blanchardstown as a chosen location for a third level college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> A delegation comprising the community council, industrialists, educationalists, other interest groups and myself made a cogent case for such a facility.  We had excellent help from the forward planning department of Fingal County Council which identified in great detail the demographics of Dublin 15 and the wider environs of the west side of Dublin.  This facility is urgently needed. There are six feeder post primary schools and colleges in the greater Blanchardstown area, which includes east Meath, north Kildare, Clondalkin, Lucan and the parts of north county Dublin linked by the motorway.</P>
    <P>The National College for Industrial Relations recommended a campus which could accommodate 1,800 students and submitted its proposal to the Higher Education Authority in a pragmatic and professional manner.  The Minister should urge the steering committee, set up to evaluate the type of campus and curriculum necessary, to submit its proposals.  We must respond to the potential shortage of computer and other technical skills in the workforce.  How better to address this matter than to provide a third level regional college in the greater Blanchardstown area to give those hundreds of post-primary pupils emerging from schools and colleges annually the opportunity to pursue third level education.</P>
    <P>I am not going to nor do I have time to evaluate the comprehensive submission of the National College of Industrial Relations to the appropriate body.  I studied it in detail and it is a most impressive document.  A competent committee was appointed by the Minister to evaluate what is best for the new project in Blanchardstown.  I understand the Taoiseach will inform the House about the publication of the Book of Estimates next Wednesday.  I hope it will include a subheading that will provide for the practical commencement of this project and the appointment of a professional team to deal with it.  The Department of Education and Science and Fingal County Council have agreed on moving the project from a restricted site beside the town centre to a larger site elsewhere.  All the ingredients are there for a third level facility which I hope the Minister will kick-start into action in early 1998 and that it will come on stream as soon as is practical thereafter.</P>
    <P>Lest there by any doubts regarding the legal status of the National College of Industrial Relations, I am informed by the personnel concerned that they do not see that as a problem and that they can amend their memorandum and articles of association to accommodate any concerns the Department of Education and Science might have.  This project is desirable and important.  It would provide young people, particularly from the west side of this county and from city perimeter areas, with an opportunity to pursue third level education.  Previous studies and reports highlighted a lack of opportunity in that regard for pupils emerging from post-primary schools in those areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> This is an opportunity to give heart to teenagers in the greater Blanchardstown area.  A commitment was given by the previous Government in this regard and we undertook to honour it.  I hope the Minister of State can give us positive news that action will be taken and that this project will commence in early 1998.</P>

      <P>I am pleased Deputy Lawlor has raised once again the proposal of the National College of Industrial Relations and I am glad of this opportunity to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>Since its foundation as the Catholic Workers College in 1951 the National College of Industrial Relations has made a tremendous contribution to Irish society through the provision of a wide range of educational programmes.  The college sought to provide a second chance for those who had left the education system at an early age at a time when the importance of life long learning and the need to upgrade skills continuously may not have been recognised to the same degree as today.</P>
      <P>Over the years the college developed into the Workers College, the College of Industrial Relations in 1966 and subsequently the word &ldquo;National&rdquo; was added to its title in view of the growing importance of its work throughout the country.  However, throughout this period of change and development, the college has remained faithful to the original principle of opening up access to learning to the educationally disadvantaged.  Programmes such as Parents in Education and Discovering University have been developed by the National College of Industrial Relations to raise awareness of the value of education and to let the educationally disadvantaged know that they can and should benefit from education.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is committed to the elimination of educational disadvantage.  Our Department is engaged in a multi-faceted approach to the problem and has fostered initiatives in the various sectors, such as the Early Start and Breaking the Cycle programmes, assistance to second level schools and funding for a wide range of adult education programmes.</P>
      <P>The most recent initiative which we announced on 9 October 1997 concerned the establishment of a joint education industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for high technology industries.  One of the aims here will be to attract mature applicants who have been out of the workforce for a while and under-employed or unemployed persons.  This illustrates one of the ways in which the elimination of educational disadvantage can contribute to economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was unique about the NCIR from the time of its establishment was its focus on the provision of education and training for employees and managers to enhance their effectiveness in the workplace.  The various programmes provided, <Col N="943" /> particularly in the areas of industrial relations and personnel management, emphasise the practical application and use of knowledge in business and industry while retaining a strong academic content.</P>
    <P>The importance of taking account of the needs of industry in framing educational policy has been well established and is one of the foundations upon which economic growth has been achieved. The NCIR has, through its links with industry, recognised this fact and has established formal links with the Institute of Personnel Management and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the NCIR has expanded significantly from 600 part-time students in 1990 to almost 3,500, of which 600 are full-time day students.  Off-campus courses, delivered principally through 31 outreach centres nationwide, account for more than half the total enrolments. More than anything else perhaps, it is the bringing of education to the community that symbolises the uniqueness of the NCIR's contribution to education in Ireland and I would like to avail of this opportunity to thank the college for the valuable role it has played in the provision of further and higher education.</P>
    <P>As we approach the turn of the century we face many important challenges.  Chief among these will be the need to invest further in education as a basis for continued economic growth and employment creation.  The decision to establish a new college at Blanchardstown will be one of the pillars of this strategy.  A high level planning group established under the auspices of the Higher Education Authority is preparing a strategic plan for the new institution.</P>
    <P>The original site for the new college, located beside the Blanchardstown shopping centre, proved unsuitable after extensive investigation. Detailed negotiations are currently under way between officials of our Department, the IDA and Fingal County Council concerning the acquisition of a new site comprising approximately 45 acres at Buzzardstown, County Dublin. A price has been agreed for the site and funding which was previously approved has been set aside for the acquisition.  The proposed new site is part of a 230 acre industrial technology park being developed by the IDA and Fingal County Council.</P>
    <P>I understand that the NCIR has submitted a proposal to the high level planning group and I am confident that the proposal will be examined carefully and thoroughly by the group.  A copy of the proposal has also been provided to our Department.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, it would be improper for me to comment on the merit of the proposal in advance of the completion of the group's report, submission of which is due within the next few months.  I assure the Deputy that the group's report will receive careful attention in our Department when received.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Lawlor for his diligence on this project and I assure him and the House of <Col N="944" /> our positive efforts to bring this project to fruition as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter concerns an Irish emigrant who lived and worked in Australia for 33 years.  He taught in a high school there and has fluent Irish which he taught to other emigrants. His ambition was to return to Ireland to teach Irish in the school system.  At his own expense, he returned and successfully pursued the Ceard Teastas i nGaeilge.  In April 1997 he replied to a public advertisement to be admitted to the Teastas i dTeanga na Gaeilge course, which would enable him to teach Irish in the school system here.  On 6 June 1997 he was informed in writing by the Department of Education that he had been accepted on the course and he should attend at Galway Regional Technical College on 1 July for its commencement.</P>
      <P>He returned from Australia and on the first day of the course, after he had attended the introductory lecture and while he was attending the first part, he was called out by a Department of Education official, informed that a mistake had been made and that he should not have been admitted to the course because he did not have Irish or a subject studied through Irish in his primary degree.  I appreciate an oversight can occur in any situation, but it is difficult to accept this was a mere oversight by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>It was clear from the man's application form that he did not have Irish in his primary degree. In addition, when submitting the application, he wrote a covering letter drawing attention to this fact and pointing out that it was the reason he was applying to do the TTG in the first place.  A paragraph in the letter stated:</P>
      <P>Táim cáilithe mar mhúinteoir cheanna féin agus tá BA bainte amach agam.  Ach ni féidir Gaeilge a bheith mar ábhar céime san Austráil. Sin í an fhaidhb agus is é sin freisin an fáth gur dheineas an Cheárd Teastas.</P>
      <P>It was clear the man was drawing attention to the fact he did not have Irish because he could not do a degree in Irish in Australia and that was why he was applying to do the TTG.</P>
      <P>Despite protests from the man the Department held firm and it was not until after I raised the matter in a Dáil question on 14 October that a written explanation was given to him as to why he was taken off the course.  The Minister's reply to my question &mdash; I accept it was unintentional &mdash; was inaccurate.  The Minister stated the man in question was informed of the position immediately prior to the commencement of the course. That was not the case.  As I already explained, he had started the course when he was told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This man has suffered considerable financial loss by returning from Australia to attend this course.  He has also made career decisions based on the fact that he was accepted on the course <Col N="945" /> and had expected to teach Irish in a school here. These decisions are now in shreds and he has been considerably financially disadvantaged as a result.  He is now teaching as an unqualified teacher in a school here at considerable financial loss.  He has been greatly penalised by the decision made by the Department of Education and Science over which he had no control.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to take a personal interest in this case.  I want him to make a decision to allow the man to be admitted to the TTG course in 1998.  I also ask him to have his officials meet the man and make whatever arrangements are necessary to put his teaching career back on track and to recompense him for the financial losses he has incurred.</P>
    <P>The treatment of this man has been scandalous. He was an emigrant who kept alive his knowledge and fluency of the Irish language, who passed it on to other emigrants through teaching and who wanted to come back here in the latter years of his life to teach in a school.  Not only was he confronted by the petty regulations which state that he could not do the course because he did not have Irish in his primary degree, but when he was accepted on the course and came back here at his own expense he was then taken off it.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to take a personal interest in this case and to give whatever direction is necessary to his officials to put this man back on the course for 1998.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised this situation has occurred.  I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising this matter and I will explain the position.  I do not have personal knowledge of the case but from what Deputy Gilmore has said I may know the person, particularly if he is from the west.</P>
      <P>I will briefly explain the purpose of the Teastas i dTeagasc na Gaeilge &mdash; TTG.  The TTG is intended for those wishing to teach the subject Irish in second level schools.  It is regarded as desirable for all teachers of Irish in second level schools and is compulsory for teachers of Irish who are employed by vocational education committees and who do not hold the Higher Diploma in Education.  The TTG course is also open to primary teachers who hold the B.Ed. degree with Irish as a subject of the degree.</P>
      <P>The examination is taken at the end of a course of study of about four weeks duration.  Applicants who wish to teach Irish in second level schools will be admitted to the course only if they have obtained a full BA degree with Irish as one of the subjects in the final year, or if they expect to be awarded such a degree in the current year.</P>
      <P>There is a further provision which is designed to admit existing holders of a full BA degree who do not have Irish in their final year.  Such applicants will be admitted to the TTG course if they have passed a qualifying examination in Irish conducted by a recognised university for purposes of adding Irish to their existing subjects of BA degree level or for purposes of entry to an MA degree programme in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> Prior to 1979 teachers of practical subjects, such as woodwork and metalwork, who did not hold a BA degree were eligible for admission to the TTG.  A teacher who was admitted to the TTG prior to 1979 is still eligible for admission if wishing to update his or her knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>Application to attend the TTG course is made to the Department on a standard application form which outlines the conditions governing acceptance to the course.  The TTG course in 1997 was held between 1 and 25 July in Galway Regional Technical College, and the Department of Education vetted applications for admission to the course.</P>
    <P>In the case at hand, approval to attend the course was given through error on the Department's part.  The applicant was, in fact, written to on 6 June 1997 &mdash; a very important date for Members of this House &mdash; advising that he had been accepted for the TTG course.</P>
    <P>The error was not detected until the inspector in charge of the course carried out a further scrutiny of eligibility on the first day of the course. The practice of further scrutiny on the first day of the course is of long standing.  On occasion, it has led to a small number of applicants being rejected at that stage.  However, this has not caused any difficulty until now as all such candidates had been based in Ireland.  In this case, while the applicant gave an Irish address on his application form, the Department did not advert to the fact that he was living in Australia, although this was also evident from previous correspondence.</P>
    <P>On the first day of the course the inspector in charge informed the applicant that he was ineligible to attend the course as he did not have the requisite qualification.  On the following day another inspector confirmed to him that he was ineligible and again explained the reason for his ineligibility.  Because of the particular nature of the course it was not possible to make an exception and allow the applicant to attend the course.</P>
    <P>This case was the subject of a written parliamentary question by Deputy Gilmore on 14 October 1997.  Following the parliamentary reply the Department wrote to the applicant at his Australian address on 15 October 1997.  Furthermore, on receipt of a communication from another source, a copy of the letter was sent to the applicant at his Irish address on 16 October 1997.  In correspondence with the applicant the Department has fully acknowledged its error and has apologised for the error and the inconvenience caused.  The applicant has also been invited to contact the Department if he needs further clarification or if the Department can be of assistance in any other respect.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to apologise again, on behalf of the Department, for the error and the inconvenience which it has caused, and to extend once again our invitation to the applicant to contact the Department to see if it can be of assistance in any other respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> Finally, I want to confirm that the arrangements for vetting qualifications for entry to the TTG are being reviewed within the Department with a view to eliminating the possibility of such an unfortunate happening in the future.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Mac Giollamóir toisc gur chuir sé an cheist seo os comhair an Tí um thráthnóna.

Principally these were that the order, which froze drink prices outside the Dublin metropolitan area at their November 1996 levels, was intended to be of a temporary nature and statutory controls, which can have uneven and unintended effects, are inconsistent with the thrust of public policy over the past ten years to foster increased and more effective price competition.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs, met IBEC representatives on 4 September 1997 and ICTU representatives on 11 September 1997, to discuss concerns which have been expressed about recent extensions of Sunday working in the retail sector.  In the course of those discussions, a number of possible ways of addressing those concerns were raised, including Sunday trading legislation and the possibility of voluntary Sunday working for shop workers.  The decision to invite the social partners to discussions on these issues reflects Deputy Kitt's belief that partnership should be the cornerstone of any initiative in this area.</P>
      <P>The meetings helped to clarify the positions of the social partners and the Minister of State is hopeful that, with continued good will on both sides, it may be possible to surmount the significant obstacles which stand in the way of progress on this difficult and sensitive issue.  Having listened to and analysed the views expressed at these meetings the Minister wrote to ICTU and IBEC on 9 October, 1997 inviting both parties to open discussions with a view to exploring the possibility of an agreement addressing the issue being entered into between employer and employee repesentatives of the main players in the sector. He offered to assist this process in any way that he could.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 22, 52, 60 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Newspaper Industry reported to my predecessor in June 1996.  One of the recommendations called for the introduction of legislation to outlaw below average marginal cost selling of newspapers.  The recommendation was framed along similar lines to proposals by the national newspapers of Ireland, the umbrella representative group for Irish-owned newspapers.</P>
      <P>The commission was satisfied that there were considerable grounds for supporting the NNI's contention that some UK newspaper publishers were selling newspapers at prices less than their average marginal cost.  However, the commission also recognised that the detection and proof of such selling is complicated.  The complications arise in particular from the difficulty in ascertaining the true extent to which advertising revenue can, with accuracy, be described as being derived from or targeted at the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor clearly stated that any legislative provision in this area would have to be both robust and legally safe.  He indicated further that it would have to prove effective and workable as <Col N="953" /> well as being in compliance with European Union law.  For example, it could and should not discriminate against any newspaper based on specific &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; criteria.</P>
    <P>Quite a considerable amount of legal and economic work was available to my predecessor on this matter.  On assuming office, I requested that this work be brought to a speedy conclusion. Given all the advice received to date by my Department in respect of this recommendation of the Newspaper Commission, I am not convinced that the foregoing requirements can be adequately met.  While I will continue to discuss the matter with the Attorney General, it may not be possible to overcome the variety of difficulties encountered.  In these circumstances, I am not at this stage in a position to proceed with the recommendation in respect of below cost selling.  I should add that I have asked the mergers and review group, chaired by Michael Collins, SC, to advise me on how best to implement other recommendations of the Newspaper Commission on regulation of ownership, merger control, and concentration of media ownership.</P>

    <P>There is tremendous potential for the internationally traded services sector at regional level. There are now more than 40 indigenous companies in the internationally traded services sector in the west region, of which 30 are in the software and computer information technology sectors.  In County Galway, there has been a 75 per cent increase in employment in the indigenous information technology sector where over 20 new indigenous companies, employing approximately <Col N="954" /> 150 people, have been established with state assistance from Forbairt.</P>
    <P>During 1997, two new IDA Ireland assisted projects in the western region were announced in the software sector, Lionbridge Technologies, one of the top international companies in the software localisation industry which will create 100 jobs in Ballina and Multistream Systems International which will create 28 jobs in Ballybrit, Galway.  Employment in IDA Ireland assisted overseas software companies in the western region totalled 545 people in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 27 together.  The statistics used by the Deputies are taken, I presume, from the Forfás <i>Survey of Product and Process Innovation in Irish Industry 1993-1995.</i></P>
      <P>As Deputy Perry's question states, these statistics demonstrate that Ireland's ratio of business expenditure on R &amp; D as a percentage of GDP has doubled since 1986.  I regard this as a healthy development.  In the early 1980s, Ireland's business expenditure on R &amp; D, or BERD, showed Ireland to be in a lagging position &mdash; with a level of investment in R &amp; D similar to other objective one countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain. Our progress over the past ten years has brought us in line with the EU average, on a par with countries such as Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.  However, our current BERD figure of 1.02 per cent must be seen in the context of 1.85 per cent for US, 1.87 per cent for Japan and 2.31 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively for EU front runners, Sweden and Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> This doubling of expenditure reflects an increased and more widespread level of R &amp; D activity at company level.  During the same period the number of R &amp; D performing companies rose from 586 to 900 and the number of companies with their own R &amp; D departments rose from 243 to 480.  All this represents solid progress along a path, which we must continue to travel.  The 1994-99 S &amp; T Sub-Programme set a target to increase BERD to 0.82 per cent by 1999 and this has already been surpassed.</P>
    <P>However, this is not to suggest we should rest on our laurels.  Rather we should continue to stimulate continuous R &amp; D activity in the business sector.  The Mid-Term Review of the Operational Programme for Industry 1994-1999 allocated an additional 39 MECU, or about £28 million, for an in-company research, technology and innovation scheme.  As part of this process, it was necessary to revamp the existing measure 1 scheme, to target and focus our funding more tightly to achieve specific results.  The new scheme will aim to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;increase the number of companies performing research, technology and innovation (RTI) for the first time;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increase the number of companies undertaking significant RTI on an ongoing basis and establishing permanent RTI Departments;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increase the additional RTI activity at company level;</P>
    <P>&mdash;enable firms acting in consortia with other companies or universities (or joint ventures with firms in other countries) to undertake large scale strategic projects which would be beyond the capability of any single firm;</P>
    <P>&mdash;encourage the development of international links by allowing firms greater access to collaborative R &amp; D activities, such as the EUREKA programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;encourage a continuing commitment to innovation in firms by improving the cost competitiveness and business performance of individual companies, particularly SMEs, through innovative improvements both in production and processes.</P>
    <P>I am finalising the details of the new research, technology and innovation scheme, which I will formally launch next Wednesday, 12 November, during our first ever national science week.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of other schemes, operating under the Industry S &amp; T Sub-Programme and funded through OST and these contribute to a greater appreciation of the importance of science and technology and how to better exploit knowledge.  We will continue to review these and other schemes on an ongoing basis to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, it is individual companies which will decide what they will spend on R &amp; D or any other area of their business.  In this <Col N="956" /> regard the overall economic environment created by the Government's sound management of the economy, will have a direct bearing on the various activities of all companies.</P>

      <P>I am of course happy to see employee share ownership programmes facilitated and encouraged as far as possible.  While programmes can have the effect of spreading and increasing investment in enterprise, the main benefit arises out of encouraging employee commitment to the development of enterprise and encourage co-operative management and employee relationships.</P>
      <P>There are at present two main types of European share ownership schemes in operation: approved profit sharing schemes (or APSSs), which have been in operation since 1982 and have involved approximately 100,000 employees.  This year the Finance Act provided for a more flexible form of share ownership &mdash; employee share ownership trust (or ESOTs), which is intended to run in tandem with the APSS and to provide better marketability for employee shareholding in employer companies.  Other forms of share ownership are encouraged by tax relief for employee equity investment, such as the seed capital scheme designed to encourage entrepreneurial activity by employees in business start-ups. Employees can also obtain tax relief for purchase of new shares in their employer company.  Takeup of these schemes is of course a matter for individual companies and their employees.</P>
      <P>Any adjustments to tax based support for employee share ownership will be based on the extent of demand for amendments to the schemes from business or employees and the overall needs of enterprise investment.  Decisions on such adjustments are of course a matter for the Government, and would be considered in light of the overall budget process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The Tipperary inter-agency group, established following the closure of Tambrands and Mass Mutual in Tipperary Town and Schiesser in Carrick-on-Suir, is still in existence.  This group comprises representatives of IDA Ireland, FÁS, Tipperary County Enterprise Board, Forbairt and SFADCo.</P>
      <P>Following the closures of the Tambrands and Mass Mutual facilities, the inter-agency group has succeeded in securing replacement industries for Tipperary Town.  During the past year two project announcements have been made for the town. The Pall corporation, now located in the former Tambrands premises, is currently in start-up phase employing nine people with a potential for significant increase.  The other is continental promotion group located in the former Mass Mutual facility, which at present has 40 people employed and is expected to expand its operation shortly.</P>
      <P>The Tipperary inter-agency group continues to promote Tipperary Town and its environs for overseas mobile investment.</P>
      <P>Advance Factories for industrial development are now provided by the private sector.  A 6,000 sq.  ft.  advance factory is currently being upgraded.  Although in the ownership of the local authority, it will be actively marketed by the various State agencies, including IDA Ireland at international level, to attract additional investment to the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge my appreciation of the work of the Labour Relations Commission, as one of the two major industrial relations agencies.</P>
      <P>In an open economy, such as Ireland, it is essential that enterprise improves and maintains its competitiveness, both in term of efficiency and effectiveness.  Positive industrial relations can make a substantial contribution to the meeting of these competitive challenges.  The Labour Relations Commission is an agency which makes a substantial contribution to the maintenance of positive industrial relations in Irish-based companies and thus it plays an important role in enterprise development.  I am acutely aware that the work of the LRC is broadening and becoming increasingly complex in the face of:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the ongoing change in work practices and organisation required to meet competitive challenges;</P>
      <P>&mdash;expectations by employees of sharing in the benefits of the celtic tiger;</P>
      <P>&mdash;reorganisation and restructuring in an increasing number of organisations, both in the private and public sectors.</P>
      <P>I am determined that the LRC should be properly equipped in terms of resources to enable the commission to continue to contribute to the maintenance and development of positive industrial relations in its client population.  That is why active discussions were initiated with the commission some months ago on its staffing and other resource requirements.  These discussions are taking account of both the immediate and the future requirements of the commission.</P>
      <P>The discussions will be completed without delay and the necessary decisions taken in the light of:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the established need for additional resources;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the central role of the LRC in the maintenance and development of positive industrial relations;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that information technology and communications have major potential for reducing the economic distance between areas all over the globe.  They are, in fact, becoming as important an instrument of economic development as road and rail have been in the past.  Here in Ireland, they do afford, for example, the western part of the country the opportunity to participate in a range of new commercial opportunities such as teleservices, software and distance education-training.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I am delighted to see that the west was so well represented in the recent Telecom Éireann's information age town competition, in which Ennis was the overall winner with Castlebar and Killarney being among the runners up.  Perhaps the most important lesson from the information age town competition is that the enthusiasm and determination is there at local level to embrace the information age.  What is necessary is the organisation and management skills to harness that enthusiasm and focus it on practical initiatives to make the information society part of our daily lives.</P>
      <P>Regional objectives and targets have been developed at an overall level by various regional authorities to ensure that the regions share in industrial growth in all sectors, not just the information technology and communications areas. Key elements of policy which will assist regions, like the west to avail of these opportunities include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the clear mandate given by me to IDA Ireland and Forbairt to facilitate and realise a more balanced regional distribution of investment and employment opportunities,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of a strategy for the teleworking industry, based on the &ldquo;Telefutures&rdquo; Report published last year by Forbairt and Telecom Éireann,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the provision of extra places on courses in skills needed for these sectors,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the encouragement of competition in the telecom infrastructural sector which is expected to accelerate the provision of broadband throughout Ireland,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the conducting by Forbairt of countrywide seminars to stimulate greater awareness of, and encourage more Irish companies to use, <Col N="960" /> the new IT and communications technologies now available, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the 1995 appointment by Forbairt's Regional Office in the west of a project executive to work exclusively on the promotion and development of the international services sector in the region.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully conscious of the need to ensure the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. In this respect, I have spoken to the chief executive officers of both IDA Ireland and Forbairt. I have impressed on them the crucial importance which this Government attaches to making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country.  I am satisfied this message is fully understood and that the industrial development agencies involved are doing all they can to realise a more balanced regional distribution of jobs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29, 70 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the research and analysis which lay behind the White Paper on Human Resource Development, which was published in May this year.  I agree generally with that analysis and I am currently considering the best way to implement the policies and initiatives contained in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>It is vital, if our economy is to be competitive, and if we are to have a skilled workforce in a position to avail of the many new job opportunities coming on stream, that we have training and employment service arrangements that are flexible and able to meet these needs.  It is in this context that any decisions on the future role and structure of FÁS will be taken.  I am currently reviewing a range of options with regard to the development of a national employment service.</P>
      <P>I plan to meet the board of FÁS in the near future to discuss all the relevant issues.  Any decisions taken will be implemented in full consultation with all interested parties.</P>

    <P>In relation to traineeship a programme will be developed when a number of pilot projects in operation are completed.  Traineeship has already proven to be a flexible way to meet emerging skills demands, particularly in the fields of technology and foreign languages.  It is also a mechanism which brings entry-level training very close to the labour market itself &mdash; the programme is finely attuned to the needs of the labour market, with employers involved in curriculum development, <Col N="962" /> determination of standards and the provision of traineeship places.</P>

      <P>I met the promoters of the Auto-Turning Training Centre project for Ballina at the end of September.  In view of the fact that a significant element of public moneys would be required to operate such a centre, FÁS has been carefully considering the proposal in terms of the needs of the Auto-Turning Industry, the extent to which the proposed centre would meet those needs and at what cost in terms of the equipment, materials, staffing, and so on.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the MMDS licensing system rests with my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, Minister for Public Enterprise.  The Director of Telecommunications Regulation also has a policy role; in particular the director has responsibility for the issue of licences and for the making of regulations, subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Enterprise, to provide for new licensing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy has concerns about the compliance of this system with competition rules, it is open to him, or to anyone else who has such concerns, to make a complaint to the Director of Competition Enforcement.  The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, created the position of Director of Competition Enforcement to give effect to the public enforcement provisions contained <Col N="963" /> in that Act.  The director can investigate possible breaches of the competition rules, either on his own initiative or as a result of complaints made to him.  Following such an investigation, he may recommend to the Competition Authority that it institutes proceedings under section 6 of the 1991 Competition Act.</P>
    <P>An individual or firm can also pursue allegations of breaches of competition rules by taking civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991.  The courts are the ultimate arbiter in regard to competition law or indeed commercial law generally.</P>

      <P>Prior to its take-over of the Power Supermarkets chain earlier this year, Tesco gave a number of written undertakings to the Government.  Central commitments given relate to growing the business; maintaining a buying facility in Ireland; ensuring, with the aid of a benchmarking exercise, that the amount purchased from Irish suppliers will be maintained and increased; adopting a developmental approach to fostering new and emerging Irish suppliers; ensuring that, as business requirements in Ireland evolve, there will be ongoing consultation with distributors, and ensuring that any future changes to supply arrangements will include consultation with representative organisations.</P>
      <P>I recently met Tesco's chief executive and his Irish management team to emphasise the critical importance of adhering to these undertakings. Tesco assured me that they would abide, not only by the letter, but also by the spirit of the undertakings they have entered into.  These assurances have subsequently been confirmed to me in writing.</P>
      <P>As regards studies, while my Department has not conducted any studies to date into products being sold by Tesco, the ESRI has been commissioned by Forbairt and Bord Bia, at the invitation of Tesco, to undertake a benchmarking audit of existing supply levels in order to establish the level of Irish manufactured products sourced by the Tesco group.  The results of the first phase of this study should be available later this month. Targets for trade growth between Irish producers and Tesco will be established when the current levels of trade have been determined.</P>
      <P>I will be monitoring closely all aspects of Tesco's operation in Ireland in the interest of domestic suppliers and distributors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 45, 85, 86 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to a comprehensive and detailed reply which I gave to the House on 21 October 1997 in respect of a written question concerning the cost of insurance for young drivers. On that occasion I outlined initiatives being pursued in this area following recommendations contained in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report of October 1996 on insurance costs and other parallel measures being pursued by the Irish Insurance Federation and National Safety Council.  The Deloitte &amp; Touche report is the major report on insurance costs commissioned by my Department in recent years.</P>
      <P>In a reply to a written question on 8 October 1997 I referred to the wide variation of available insurance quotes, as between insurance companies and as between the various categories of driver surveyed, including young drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in my previous reply on 21 October last, the facts as established by Deloitte &amp; <Col N="966" /> Touche in its report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland are that premium rates for young drivers are high in all EU countries relative to rates charged to more mature drivers. The report found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17-24 year old drivers is over twice that for the 36-40 age group.  The report also found that motorists in the 17-24 age group are responsible for over three and a half times the average claims cost in the 36-40 age group.</P>
    <P>An earlier survey undertaken by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1993 found that in the age groups examined, 17-24, 25-30 and 30+, under both comprehensive and non-comprehensive cover in terms of relative claims cost, the 17-24 year old policyholder is a greater risk than those aged 25-30, who in turn are a greater risk than those aged over 30 years.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority report for 1996 indicated that almost 38 per cent of the motorists involved in fatal and personal injury accidents were young drivers and that 40 per cent of the road casualty victims in 1996 were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
    <P>To adhere to statutory solvency requirements insurers must be free to set premiums based on their underwriting experience.  The question of spreading premium rates more evenly across the different risk categories of motorist was, however, considered by Deloitte &amp; Touche who concluded that reducing premiums for young drivers at the expense of increasing premiums for the mature and safer motorist would reduce the incentive for safer driving.  Furthermore, by increasing the young high-risk motorists' pool, it would result in an overall increase in claims costs with consequent higher premiums for all motorists.</P>
    <P>Given the adverse insurance claims and accident statistics in regard to motorists in the 17-24 year age group, it is not surprising that many insurance companies are reluctant to quote for that particular risk although an insurance quote will always be available under the declined cases committee mechanism unless contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>I indicated previously to the House some of the measures and initiatives being undertaken to try to improve the driving standards and accident record of young drivers such as the proposal to introduce a graduated licensing system for learner drivers under examination by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the introduction of insurance discounts to young drivers who have completed a required number of driving lessons and the work of the National Safety Council in producing educational material on road safety for primary and secondary schools. However, I wish to again make it clear that there is no soft option or panacea for reducing motor insurance premiums for young drivers in view of their high risk insurance profile.  The Deloitte &amp; Touche report concluded that an improvement in driving skills and the inculcation of safer driving standards are the key to reducing the relatively <Col N="967" /> high accident rate of the young driver category which should lead to lower insurance premium quotations.</P>

      <P>The administrative and organisational structures of IDA Ireland are primarily matters for that organisation and ones in which I have no direct function.</P>

Recent job announcements for Waterford attest to that fact.</P>

    <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the Government's decision to establish a £250 million education <Col N="968" /> technology investment fund which will be used to develop technology education at all levels ranging from primary schools to advanced research and to promote new areas of activity where emerging needs are identified.</P>
    <P>I have announced the establishment of a new business, education and training partnership to develop national strategies at the highest levels which tackle the issues of skills needs, manpower forecasting and education for industry and business.</P>
    <P>The significant financial provision being provided by the Government, with the new business, education and training partnership, will greatly enhance our ability to provide an adequate skills base to enable us maximise the benefits to Ireland of developments in the high technology and other sectors.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to establish a 25,000 place programme which will pay the going rate for the job.</P>
      <P>Our objective is to work towards the realisation of that aim in a balanced context of reintegrating unemployed persons back into work, supporting disadvantaged individuals and communities and ensuring that the labour market can respond to the needs of our growing economy.  To that end we have made the following progress to date. Some 1,000 Community Employment participants are currently being paid the &ldquo;rate for the job&rdquo;. Between now and the year 2000 this is being extended, on a gradual basis and subject to a minimum of 12 hours per week, to all participants on the Community Employment Part-Time Job Option.  At least 3,000 participants will be paid on a &ldquo;rate for the job&rdquo; basis by September 1998, a further 3,000 by September 1999, with full implementation by September 2000.</P>
      <P>A pilot whole time job programme &ldquo;Job Initiative&rdquo;, paying the rate for the job, is now in place.  The objective of the programme is to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people living in areas where access to the labour market is extremely limited.  Under this pilot programme, funding is being made available for 1,000 full-time jobs in the social economy for the most disadvantaged of the long-term unemployed. Each job can last up to December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to set out a prescriptive basis for realising our overall aim of 25,000 places.  The <Col N="969" /> dynamism of the economy means that the labour market is changing in a very rapid and fundamental way and we have to be equally flexible in our response.  It may be that it would be possible to realise a number of these places through developing the social economy.</P>
    <P>Any further action which I will take in this area will be driven by the need to ensure better opportunities for the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware the director of Consumer Affairs is independent in the performance of his functions, which include the enforcement of an extensive range of consumer protection legislation.</P>
      <P>The function of the director in relation to mortgage intermediaries, which derive from section 116 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1996, is to authorise them and to subject them to general regulation. For the purposes of the Act, a mortgage intermediary means any person, other than a mortgage lender or credit institution, who in return for a commission, payment or consideration of any kind in relation to the credit transaction arranges or offers to arrange the provision of a housing loan by a mortgage lender.</P>
      <P>By definition, the Act, which concerns the granting of credit, was never intended to regulate or safeguard sums of money which may be placed with such intermediaries.  Indeed a mortgage intermediary should not be handling any moneys belonging to consumers.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the director that to date no complaints have been received by him from any consumer claiming to have lost money handed over to the company, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The director has gone on to tell me that, on the basis of the information available to him from the Garda, it appears that the loss of funds by members of the public in this case do not arise from any matters regulated by the Consumer Credit Act but rather from matters proper to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only legal action open to the director would be to seek to prosecute the company for acting as a mortgage intermediary without an authorisation but this would not assist persons <Col N="970" /> who may have lost funds.  Before seeking to prosecute, the director is awaiting the final Garda report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I am reluctant to make any further comments as they could prejudice any potential prosecution by the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Director of Public Prosecutions or any other appropriate authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 62, 63 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The statistical information in relation to the number of first year apprentices registered with FÁS and the number who have completed their course in the years 1994-97 is contained in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of backlogs have arisen in apprenticeship areas due, initially, to industrial action in FÁS and, subsequently, to increased demand for particular apprenticeships. Action to address the backlog is well in hand, and additional staff are being used to address the shortage in the trades of electrician, construction plant fitter, agricultural mechanic and carpentry and joinery.</P>
      <P>On the question of the current shortage of craftpersons in certain trade categories it is generally recognised that such shortages result from the high level of economic activity at present in industry, particularly the construction industry, coupled with insufficient recruitment of apprentices by employers in 1993 and earlier years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cyclical nature of the construction industry, in particular, leads to wide variations in the <Col N="971" /> annual intake of construction apprentices and this, coupled with the four year lead-time of apprentice training, has contributed to periods of shortage or over-supply of craftpersons in construction.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>The number of people registered with FÁS as first year apprentices in each of the years 1994 to 1997 is as follows:</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate earlier this year on the Organisation of Working Time Bill it was indicated on behalf of the then Government that legislation which sought to distinguish between shops on the basis of size for the purpose of banning or regulating the hours of Sunday trading would be open to constitutional challenge on the grounds of invidious discrimination, irrationality or lack of proportionality.  In this context, the question of the possibility of a referendum being held on the issue was raised in some quarters.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, that, while he was involved in numerous meetings &mdash; discussions with the MANDATE trade union over a long period on this issue, his party's approach to the matter was as set out in his letter of 21 May 1997 to the General Secretary of MANDATE, in response to a specific request addressed to all parties by MANDATE prior to the general election, which stated that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If re-elected to Government, we will undertake a consultative process with all the interested parties (owners, managers of retail outlets, both large and small, unions, consumers) with a view to regulating Sunday trading hours through consensus and agreement.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to a priority question earlier, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has, since taking up office met with representatives of both ICTU and IBEC to review the position of Sunday working in the retail sector.  Following such meetings he invited both parties to open discussions with a view to exploring the possibility of an agreement addressing the issue being entered into between employer and employee representatives of the main players in the sector. The reaction of the social partners to this initiative is at present awaited.</P>

      <P>Work permits are granted to employers who wish to employ non-EEA nationals, the EEA comprises the EU, Norway and Iceland, in the State.  The total number of applications for work permits received in 1996 was 4,351.

      <P>The legislation relating to work permits is contained in the Aliens Act, 1935, and the Aliens Orders, 1946 and 1975.  This Act and Orders are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Therefore, there is continuous liaison between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my Department in deciding on applications for work permits.  Before a decision is made on an application for a work permit, confirmation is sought from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the prospective employee, if resident here, is legally resident in the State and is eligible to seek employment.</P>
      <P>Liaision between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding decisions relating to the issue of work permits, takes place as appropriate.

      <Quest>her views on whether the western region lags behind the rest of the country in economic and social development; and if her attention has been drawn to recent research by Forfás which indicates that Ireland could position itself to gain 40,000 jobs in telecommunications based services before the year 2010.</Quest>

      <P>The economic and social development of the western region is clearly an issue that extends well beyond the specific remit of my Department.  I am fully committed to a policy of balanced regional industrial development throughout Ireland, including the west.  All the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department are working towards this goal.</P>
      <P>The estimate of potential for 40,000 jobs was made by the consultants, Analysys Ltd.  for Forfás, on the basis of Ireland gaining an increase in global market share in a range of related sectors such as financial services, software services, distance learning and teleservices generally.  Making this estimate a reality will require the growth and expansion of both indigenous firms and the overseas owned sector.  It will also require sustained investment in both the telecoms infrastructure and in human resources, with particular emphasis on language and software skills.  Putting in place these elements will determine how well we do in developing the sector in the west as well as elsewhere in the State.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives and bodies have already been established to ensure these issues are addressed including the Information Society Commission, the Skills Identification Group and the National Competitiveness Council.</P>

      <P>The competitive position of the Irish economy is determined by a wide range of factors running across the entire spectrum of public policy and comprehends issues such as fiscal policy, competition policy, infrastructure and human resources, as well as the performance of the enterprise sector itself.  In this context, responsibility for monitoring and maintaining the competitive position of the economy cannot be confined to any one Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently established National Competitiveness Council, operating under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department, will play a key role in monitoring and benchmarking Ireland's competitiveness <Col N="976" /> across this broad range of fronts.  The Secretary General of my Department is a member of the council.</P>
    <P>The health and dynamism of the enterprise sector clearly has a critical influence on the overall competitiveness of the economy.  The performance of the enterprise sector is influenced, not only by the actions of individual firms and entrepreneurs, but by public policy decisions in the various spheres previously adverted to.  My Department and its State agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the creation and maintenance of a pro-enterprise environment. Recent work undertaken by Forfás, in the context of its long-term strategy document Shaping our Future is particularly relevant in this respect.</P>

      <P>In November 1995, the EU Commission launched a Communication on Worker Information and Consultation. The communication sought the views of interested parties as to need and the methods for the development of worker information and consultation requirements in EU-based companies who were not subject to the provisions of the European Works Council Directive.</P>
      <P>Following on reactions to its 1995 communication, the Commission, on 4 June 1997, launched first-phase consultations with the European Social Partners under the Agreement on Social Policy.  Under the Agreement the social partners had six weeks to respond to the Commission.</P>
      <P>The Commission has now decided to begin second-phase consultations &mdash; i.e. a request to the European social partners to enter into negotiations on a framework agreement on worker information and consultation in companies not covered by the European Works Council Directive.</P>
      <P>These consultations are being launched by the Commission today &mdash; 6 November, 1997.  In accordance with the Agreement on Social Policy the European Social Partners will have nine months in which to respond to the Commission's request to enter into negotiations.  Should the social partners commence negotiations and reach a framework agreement the Council of Ministers is empowered to give legal effect to that agreement, if it so decides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach is to await the outcome of the <Col N="977" /> developments at EU level that I have already outlined. Worker information and consultation in individual companies can assist competitiveness and the development of more positive management and employee relations.  It is important that companies and their employees are enabled to develop information and consultation arrangements which best suit their needs.  I stress that any legislation in this area, EU or otherwise, should not seek to impose particular models of information and consultation on individual companies.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the enterprise partnership commitments included in Partnership 2000.  Basically, these commitments seek to promote partnership at the level of the enterprise, but do not seek to impose any one model of such partnership.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I informed the House on 30 September that, following discussions with me and my officials, Guinness Ireland Group notified their proposed take-over of United Beverages Holdings to the Compettion Authority on 4 September seeking clearance of the proposal under the Competition Acts.  This means that the proposal is being examined by the Competition Authority as I had originally intended.  The examination will establish whether or not the proposed take-over is anti-competitive and contrary to the Competition Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative course of action became necessary as the original referral by me on 8 August was made out of time.  This occurred because it had been understood in my Department that the deadline of 3 August could be extended by making a further request for information from the parties.  However, this was queried by the Competition Authority and the Attorney General <Col N="978" /> advised that that original deadline of 3 August was unaffected by the request.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I take responsibility for the errors of the type made in my Department.  I am, however, satisfied that the alternative course of action taken by Guinness will have the same effect as if the original course I had intended were taken.  In order to prevent any recurrence of the type of errors in this case, I have issued strict instructions, based on legal advice received in this case, concerning rigid adherence by all concerned to the timescales laid down in the Mergers Acts.</P>

      <P>There are many complex factors to be taken into consideration when an employer decides that redundancies are necessary in an enterprise.  It would be neither practicable nor feasible to introduce legislation imposing conditions about the age distribution of employees who are to be made redundant. However, there is an appeals mechanism to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for any employee who considers that he or she has been unfairly selected for redundancy.  Many employers are able to achieve necessary redundancy on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>I indicated in my reply to a Dáil question on 30 September that I had met the chairman and chief executive officer and other senior executives of Fruit of the Loom Inc., in Chicago on 25 August, to discuss my concern for the Fruit of the Loom operation in Donegal.  The company executives gave me a strong commitment that they would maintain present employment levels in Ireland until at least the end of 1998.  They also indicated that while Fruit of the Loom Inc.  was optimistic about maintaining the level of employment after that, but given the increasing competition in world markets, made it difficult to predict further.  I am fully conscious of the importance of the Irish operation to Donegal and to the north west region and the company has undertaken to keep in close contact with both my Department and IDA Ireland concerning its future plans.</P>

      <P>During my two recent visits to the United States I had discussions with a wide range of companies.  I discussed the potential further for the location of new plants in this country, or the expansion of existing activities. In view of the very strong competition for the attraction of inward investment in Europe and elsewhere, it would be inappropriate to specify the companies involved.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the most balanced regional distribution of employment opportunities.  At my first meeting with both the chief executive officer of the IDA and Forbairt I emphasised the Government's policy in this matter.  Both Cork city and county are being heavily promoted as suitable locations for inward location by the IDA.</P>

      <P>Teleworkers are people who work from home or a local centre and use telecommunications equipment, for example, telephone, fax machine, computer, CDrom, the Internet etc.  for a substantial part of their job.  They may be self-employed, part-time or full-time employees and work for one employer or several clients.  The legal status of a teleworker, in a particular case, is determined by the nature of the contract with the employerclient.</P>
      <P>In general, employment protection legislation applies to employees, that is persons who are employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship, including persons employed on fixed term contracts and persons employed on contracts for a specified purpose.  Thus, teleworkers who fall into the category of employees are covered by labour protection legislation.</P>
      <P>Similarly, persons working under a contract for services, that is, persons who are self-employed, do not come within the scope of labour protection legislation by virtue of the fact that they are not employees.  Thus, teleworkers who are self-employed are not covered by such legislation.</P>
      <P>I should point out that labour laws attempt only to regulate employer-employee relationships and do not regulate self-employment.  The question of whether or not an individual's employment relationship comes within the scope of specific labour law is a matter for the relevant adjudicative body under the relevant Act.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the extension of traditional labour law to cover self-employed persons is warranted at this time.  This matter will be kept under continuing review in the light of any future developments, particularly within the EU.  I should point out that in this country at present all teleworkers, whether self-employed or otherwise, are fully protected in so far as their occupational safety and health is concerned by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and its associated regulations.</P>

      <P>It is generally accepted that worksharing offers a number of advantages for society and the economy through job creation, greater workplace flexibility and more equitable distribution of work.  I would, therefore, strongly encourage all parties to give <Col N="983" /> more attention to the introduction of worksharing taking account of the particular needs/requirements of companies/sectors.</P>
      <P>In January 1997 a package of measures, intended to facilitate greater worksharing in the public service, was announced.  The practical application of these measures is a matter to be discussed and worked out with the appropriate trade unions for each of the various public service organisations.  As regards the Civil Service, discussions are at present taking place between the Department of Finance and the civil service unions on the implementation of these measures which will build on the schemes already in place.</P>
      <P>Worksharing in the private sector is first and foremost a matter for that sector.  The models developed in the public service provide an example of what can be achieved and I would urge the social partners to renew their efforts to conclude a framework agreement on this issue.</P>

This involves not just being cost competitive but also requires a ready supply of skilled labour, efficient and effective public utilities, modern infrastructure, a flexible and responsive education system and a taxation system which rewards enterprise, at both the individual and corporate levels.</P>

    <P>I am aware that various trade union leaders, including the vice president of SIPTU, have been expressing concern for some time about the issue of trade union recognition.  As I informed this House in July last, Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to establish a high level group representative <Col N="984" /> of interested parties, to consider proposals by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning trade union recognition and the right to bargain.  This group was established last July under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.  I am represented on the Group through officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>The issue of union recognition is clearly a complex one and my officials are giving every assistance in the group to the social partners in their endeavours to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions.

      <P>The insurance compensation levy was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in 1983. Levies were paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2 per cent of gross premium income until 31 December 1991.  The rate was reduced to 1 per cent from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992. The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the succesful completion of the administration of Primor plc, formerly known as PMPA Insurance plc.  Some £148 million was collected by way of the levy, which is used to finance the administration of Primor plc.</P>
      <P>The insurance compensation fund, from which payments are made to the administrator of Primor, is maintained and administered by the accountant of the High Court, acting under the control of the President of the High Court.  An abstract of the accounts of the compensation fund for each year is required to be furnished to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment by the accountant and is published in the insurance annual report.</P>
      <P>Finally, I might mention that the compensation fund also received, under separate funding arrangements for the administration of Icarom plc, formerly Insurance Corporation of Ireland, involving the banking sector generally, a sum of £100 million in December 1985.  This sum was for immediate on-lending to Icarom.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The sourcing of products and services by both Irish and foreign-controlled chain stores takes place in a competitive and commercial context where sourcing and supply patterns, and changes in them, are not centrally monitored.  As a consequence, the information sought by the Deputy is not available in any definitive sense.  I am satisfied, however, that Irish suppliers are continuing to supply the stores involved in the recent major acquisition by a UK chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also assure the Deputy that where concerns of Irish suppliers and distributors have been brought to my attention I have taken them up with the relevant interests.  I have impressed on them the importance of allowing Irish suppliers every opportunity to continue and enhance business opportunities with such multiples in the <Col N="986" /> future so as to protect and promote employment here.</P>
    <P>In addition, Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála, development agencies directly under the aegis of my Department, and An Bord Bia, are in regular contact with major retailers about their purchasing requirements with a view to identifying opportunities for Irish suppliers.</P>
    <P>These agencies are working closely together to assist Irish suppliers develop their competitive capability and to ensure that where possible they help Irish companies supply not only Irish stores, but also help companies develop sales in overseas markets.  An Bord Tráchtála, for example, each year match on average 25 buyers from different UK multiples with Irish suppliers in the clothing, giftware, furniture and non-food sectors.</P>
    <P>Forbairt, for its part, is actively involved with both suppliers and buyers to maximise the opportunities for sales and employment growth in Irish companies.</P>

      <P>A critical part of IDA Ireland's remit is to achieve the most equitable spread of development across the regions of the country.  IDA Ireland continues to devote considerable resources, energy and enthusiasm to this task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> The companies supported by IDA Ireland are encouraged to look at many locations across the country during the process of their decision making. IDA Ireland is very conscious of its responsibility to promote and bring new investors to all regional locations including Cork.  To date in 1997, there have been 11 projects announced for the Cork area.  These projects, when fully developed, will create 2,827 jobs which will have a very positive impact on employment levels in the Cork area.  In 1997 to date there have been 70 first time site visits and 56 return visits to Cork by potential overseas investors.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a location in an itinerary for an overseas investor is determined by consideration of a number of factors including: size and nature of the project; level and type of skill requirements; proximity to third level institutions; proximity to port facilities; building requirements; and issues such as natural gas, or high levels of water availability, may also be specific requirements of some individual processes.</P>
    <P>The number of new greenfield manufacturing projects attracted to Ireland in any year is limited, and the ultimate decision on where to locate lies with the potential investors.  It is important for inward investors to feel that IDA Ireland understands their business and needs.  At the same time, realistic efforts are made to influence the choice of location where possible without loss of jobs to the country.</P>

      <P>There are regulations which prohibit the placing of toys on the market unless they are safe.  These are entitled Statutory Instrument No. 32 of 1990 European Communities (Safety of Toys) Regulations which implement Council Directive 88/378/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the member states concerning the safety of toys.</P>
      <P>Toys must carry (i) a CE mark indicating that they conform to the relevant harmonised EC standards and-or that they have been approved by an approved body and (ii) on the toys or on the packaging, the name and address of the manufacturer or his authorised representative established within the Community or the importer of the toys into the Community.</P>
      <P>The person first putting toys on the market must keep available for inspection a dossier giving detailed information about the manufacturestorage of the toys and a description of the means whereby conformity with the legal requirements was established.</P>
      <P>The regulations apply not only to the manufacturer or importer into the European Union but to anyone who supplies toys in the course of business.</P>
      <P>Toys placed on the market prior to the marking of these regulations are covered by Statutory Instrument No. 44 of 1985 which sets out the maximum toxicity and cellulosic levels allowable.</P>
      <P>The regulations are implemented by the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>

      <P>Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the mother and father of a child born in wedlock are its joint guardians, whereas the mother only is the guardian of an infant born out of wedlock, subject to any qualifying court order.  To safeguard the rights of parents as laid down in this Act, the Passport Office normally requires the written witnessed consent of both parents when a passport application is made for a person under 18 years of age, unless one of the parents claims to be the child's sole legal guardian.  The courts have recognised this to be prudent practice.</P>
      <P>The Guardianship of Infants Act gives a parent the right to appoint by deed or will a person to act as guardian of his or her child in the event of the parent's death.  Such a person, known as a testamentary guardian, acts jointly with the surviving parent and is also required to give consent to the issue of a passport to the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case mentioned by the Deputy, where the mother has died and it appears that the surviving parent is a guardian who has deserted his child and is therefore unavailable to give his consent, the Passport Office cannot disregard the guardianship rights which the Act of 1964 has conferred on him.  Neither can it disregard the rights of any testamentary guardian or guardians which the deceased parent may have appointed. To resolve the consent issue in this case the Passport Office would firstly have to establish <Col N="991" /> whether or not the mother had appointed a testamentary guardian.  If one had been appointed and he or she was exercising guardianship rights over the child it would be up to him or her to ask the District Court to dispense with the consent of the absent guardian for the purpose of having a passport issued to the child.  If one had not been appointed, or if the one appointed was not exercising guardianship rights over the child, the Passport Office would advise the child's grandfather to apply to the District Court to appoint him as the child's legal guardian and then to agree to his request to dispense with the need to obtain the consent of all other guardians to the issuing of a passport.</P>
    <P>If the child's parents were not married to each other the mother would have been the child's sole legal guardian prior to her death, subject to any qualifying court order.  In those circumstances the written witnessed consent and a sworn affidavit from the testamentary guardian &mdash; if one was appointed by the mother and, if not, from the child's grandfather &mdash; to the effect that he had sole care and custody of the child and that no other guardian had been appointed by the courts or by operation of law would suffice to enable a passport to be issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of modern telecommunications infrastructure will be driven primarily by the promotion of effective competition in the telecommunications sector.  The liberalisation of access to the telecommunications market is being implemented on a gradual basis which will culminate in open competition from 1 January 2000 subject only to proportional and nondiscriminatory regulatory provisions.  The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation was established on an independent basis from 30 June this year with responsibility for overseeing the regulation of the sector.</P>
      <P>More specifically in relation to infrastructure a key step was taken on 1 July this year, in accordance with the timetable agreed between Ireland and the European Commission for liberalisation of the sector, when the provision and use of telecommunications infrastructure other than the public telecommunications network was liberalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this was to allow operators other than Telecom Éireann establish their own infrastructure or to use networks owned by third parties for the provision of already liberalised telecommunications services.  The only restriction is that operators are not allowed provide voice telephony <Col N="992" /> services which are reserved to Telecom Éireann along with the provision of the public telecommunications network until full liberalisation takes place on 1 January 2000.  The liberalisation of alternative infrastructure on 1 July 1997, was seen as an important, timely and necessary step in preparing the market for full liberalisation.</P>
    <P>It is evident from press reports and from my Department's contacts with the industry that the liberalisation of alternative infrastructure has given a significant impetus to developments in the sector, with companies such as Esat Telecom and TCL already in the process of constructing their own state-of-the-art networks within the Dublin area.  I also understand that CIE and Esat Telecom, British Telecom and the ESB, are involved in discussions concerning possible joint ventures for the provision of national telecommunications infrastructure.  As for Telecom Éireann, I am aware that the company is actively responding to this emerging competition and is investing heavily in the completion of its digital network as well as in the provision of other advanced telecommunications facilities.  I have also asked Telecom Éireann to present to me the options for the upgrading of the Cablelink network in order to provide an open access platform for the provision of internet and multimedia services.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann, on its own initiative, has already taken significant steps to stimulate demand for new services based on high capacity infrastructure.  I am referring to the information town project in Ennis and the recently announced programme agreed in collaboration with my Department and the Department of Education and Science for the provision of internet services to schools.</P>
    <P>My Department recently began the process of recruiting consultants to advise on the design and execution of a competition, the aim of which is to part fund, with the assistance of EU financing, an infrastructure project or projects linked to the development of the information society.  Further details of the competition and criteria for selection of the project or projects will be announced in the coming months.  The selection of the successful project will be carried out by my Department in consultation with the Information Society Commission.</P>
    <P>These measures taken together represent a significant step towards the development of a high quality telecommunications infrastructure in Ireland.</P>

      <P>As part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan, a voluntary early retirement scheme was introduced in 1996 for certain categories of personnel serving in the Permanent Defence Force. One of the aims of the scheme was to reduce the number of personnel in medical category C. Personnel in medical category C are suffering from some ailment or illness but are not below the level of fitness required to continue serving in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>In 1996 personnel in one or more of the following categories who had at least one year's service were eligible to apply: personnel aged 50 and over by 31 December 1996; medical category C personnel; naval personnel who suffer from chronic sea sickness; members of the 46th to 53rd cadet classes and 3rd potential officers course.</P>
      <P>Five hundred personnel were granted voluntary early retirement in 1996.  Of these personnel 338 were in medical category C.</P>
      <P>This year the voluntary early retirement scheme was launched on 12 February 1997 and applications closed on 28 February 1997.  Personnel in one or more of the following categories who had at least one year's service were eligible to apply: medical category C personnel classified as such prior to 1 January 1997; enlisted personnel aged 40 and over by 31 December 1997; officers aged 40 and over by 31 December 1997; technical officers of the ordnance and engineers corps and members of the 46th to 53rd cadet classes and 3rd potential officers course.</P>
      <P>This year 735 personnel were granted voluntary early retirement.  Of these personnel 467 were medical category C.</P>
      <P>Personnel who were medical category E, i.e. personnel who do not meet the required medical standard required to continue serving in the Defence Forces, were not eligible to apply for VER in 1996 or 1997.  In 1996 and again this year the scheme was greatly oversubscribed and priority groups were established.  These groupings were decided upon taking into consideration the requirements to achieve convergence in ranks and corps and to ensure that the taxpayer received value for the considerable amount of money being made available for the VER scheme.  A board was established to evaluate all applications for VER.  The board was made up of commissioned and non commissioned military personnel, a representative from the Department of Defence and a civilian with experience in this area.</P>
      <P>Of the personnel enlisted in 1994 one was granted early retirement under the scheme.  The extent and the details of a voluntary early retirement scheme for next year are under review.  I expect provision to be made in the Estimates to allow over 300 personnel leave the Defence Forces under the VER scheme next year.</P>

      <P>Under EU rules it is permissible for bovine meat products which have been processed in the United Kingdom and which bear a &ldquo;UK&rdquo; stamp to be on sale here provided these products have been manufactured from beef imported into the UK from other countries including in many cases, Irish beef.  A system of traceability has been introduced in the UK to ensure that only non-UK beef is used for export from establishments which are approved by and under the permanent supervision of the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Great Britain and, in the case of Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  Each consignment of bovine meat and meat products imported into Ireland from such establishments in the UK is accompanied by a supplementary certificate signed by an official veterinarian stating that the meat-meat products have been derived from bovine meat which was obtained from animals which were not slaughtered in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Every meat product produced in an approved establishment in a member state of the European Community bears a code number of the establishment of origin.  If the Deputy has any doubt about the authenticity of a particular product on sale here he should provide details of the product and its code number to my Department where it will be fully investigated.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that in May of this year the previous Government announced plans to replace the current corporation tax regime with a single 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax for trading profits and a higher 25 per cent rate for non-trading profits.  Under this decision, the 12.5 per cent rate would apply from the year 2006 to all trading activities, apart from manufacturing and certain activities currently qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  These latter activities would be subject to the 12.5 per cent rate from the year 2011.</P>
      <P>As has been the practice with previous decisions in relation to the 10 per cent corporation tax rate, the Commission was informed of the Government decision shortly after its announcement in May.  This was followed up by a series of briefings with officials of the Competition Directorate of the Commission (DG IV), which is responsible for the implementation of EU State Aid rules.  In the light of the discussions which have taken place to date, I am satisfied the Commission does not have a difficulty from a State Aids viewpoint with the proposal to introduce a common low rate of corporation tax for all sectors of the economy.  The Commission has sought clarification on various aspects of the proposed changeover and this is the subject matter of the present discussions.  However, the particular rate of corporation tax is not an issue in these ongoing discussions.</P>
      <P>As for what the ultimate rate of corporation tax will be &mdash; that is, whether it will be 12.5 per cent or 10 per cent &mdash; the position is, as I have already stated, that this will be decided on by the Government in due course and an announcement will be made in the budget.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 144 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> In March 1997 the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
    <P>These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools.  I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area, including current responses to remedial needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional allocation of special supports which may be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books.  The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents.</P>
      <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contain a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for the successful operation of book rental schemes.  My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book loan rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.  In this context, higher rates of grant are now allocated to all primary schools which operate book rental schemes.</P>
      <P>The report recommended also that a special grant be made to disadvantaged schools which commit themselves to book rental schemes, to help overcome problems of seed capital.  Since 1984 special grants have been provided, on an annual basis, to primary and second level schools which are categorised as disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Remedial teachers have access to the back-up support of the teaching staffs and principals of the schools in which they serve.  They also have access to the support of my Department's Inspectorate and of the school psychological service to assist them in any areas of difficulty which they encounter in the course of their work.</P>
      <P>To the extent that additional resources become available for the development of remedial services, my priority at this stage would be to target such resources on extending the service to areas which currently have no remedial service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An initial survey of the remedial service by my Department's Inspectorate demonstrated a need to reorganise existing provision to achieve a more effective targeting of resources.  It also identified a need to place much greater emphasis on preventative strategies in schools, including early <Col N="1006" /> identification strategies and differentiated teaching.</P>
    <P>In order to address these matters, my Department in consultation with the education partners, is currently undertaking a thorough remedial education study.  The study is focusing on: number of pupils receiving a remedial service; the criteria for inclusion in and withdrawal from remedial classes; the organisation of remedial teaching in schools; the development and implementation of policy on remedal teaching in schools and record keeping and reporting.</P>

      <P>My Department also grant-aids a total of 56 pre-schools for traveller children.  These pre-schools, which have an enrolment of approximately 660 children, are set up and managed by local voluntary bodies.  Grant aid at a rate of 98 per cent is provided in respect of approved tuition costs and towards the cost of transporting the children to the pre-schools.</P>
      <P>I recently announced my intention of holding a national forum on early childhood education. This consultative process will allow all bodies with an interest in the field to put forward their views on how we can best coordinate and support the development of services in this area.  I am currently engaged with senior officials in my Department in pursuing arrangements for the forum.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the forum will provide an important input into policy decisions on the future development of pre-school education services.

      <P>Under the terms of Clause 2 (iii) of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work (PCW), claims for special increases in remuneration may only be processed subject to agreement being reached in relation to changes in structures, work practices, flexibility and change and improved quality of public service.  In the case of nurses in the health sector, payment of special increases were agreed following the conclusion of <Col N="1008" /> negotiations between the parties concerned i.e. The Department of Health/Health Services Employers' Agency and four staff organisations representing nurses in the sector.</P>
      <P>Similarly, claims in the nature of special pay increases for other nursing staff, such as for example those employed in schools and colleges and other educational institutions, also fall to be considered under the terms of clause 2 (iii) of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work (PCW).  The processing of such claims is a matter for negotiation between the employer and staff representative organisations in the relevant institutions.</P>
      <P>A pay claim under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work in respect of staff, including nursing staff, in schools providing special services for children in care is currently being discussed within the normal pay negotiating machinery.  The most recent discussions regarding this matter took place on 8 October 1997.  No agreement was reached on that occasion and the matter will require further consultation between the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Competitiveness and Work provided that a downpayment of 1 per cent could be made pending the outcome of the negotiations on the final claim for a special increase.  Payment of the 1 per cent increase has been implemented.  Other general round increases provided for under the PCW have also been implemented.  However, in relation to the payment of special increases, no further payments may be made in advance of the parties concerned reaching agreement.</P>
