Is it the position of the Government that that matter may not be included?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it was not possible last night for the Whips to finalise the business in order to take this issue today.  I accept it was late in the evening when they finally got the terms of reference.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I would like to try to resolve the outstanding issues at the meeting today.  I heard what the party leaders said here yesterday and on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  It seems to centre mainly around two issues.  I made it clear yesterday the Government believes that in order to deal with this matter expeditiously and efficiently there should be a separate inquiry on the planning matters.  That position stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I have made it very clear in a number of media interviews and in the House yesterday that it was always the Government's intention, and the wish of the Minister, Deputy Burke, that he should be included in the categories of persons covered by the terms of reference as they were drafted.  My legal advice is that he is included in the categories of persons covered by the terms of <Col N="1242" /> reference.  If people believe that should be strengthened I will certainly listen to amendments which would strengthen it.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that the Minister, Deputy Burke, should not be named in the terms of reference for two reasons.  In the case earlier this year of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, he was not named in the terms of reference, although that was the central issue of that tribunal.  It could be argued that if his name had been mentioned the issues in regard to Mr. Haughey would not have been found out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I think the party leaders know, the solicitors who commenced most of the debate surrounding this issue, Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly, wrote to me yesterday about matters which had already been stated to me.  I do not know if any of it is true.  I have already had discussions with Deputy Bruton regarding this matter.  They refer to 52 allegations and say that other politicians are involved.  Rather than let these issues be drip fed out, I believe they should all be included.  However, I would like the party leaders at least to consider agreeing that in the short-term &mdash; from now until Christmas &mdash; the tribunal should deal upfront with, first, the matters relating to the Minister, Deputy Burke; second, the matters outlined in the letter published last week concerning the 726 acres and the deals between Baileys and JMSE; and third, this and any other letters from Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly.  If there are other matters the tribunal can examine them and if not it should not seek them.  That is the agreement I will ask the Chief Whip to seek with the party leaders.</P>
      <P>If there are any other matters which the party leaders would like to discuss with me I will listen to them.  That is a fair way to advance this matter. The timing of the discussions can be discussed with the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday's conduct of business was unsatisfactory given that we received the terms of reference at a late hour last night.  I take it that it is the Minister's wish and intention to appear before the tribunal.  I do not know what other allegations exist and I have no objection to a tribunal with regard to planning matters in Dublin city or county.  However, it is important that we get agreement between the Whips and the party leaders if necessary that the issue of the £30,000 payment, Mr. Gogarty and Mr. Bailey should be brought before the tribunal with the Minister, Deputy Ray Burke.  We need to reach an understanding and clarity on that matter, perhaps here this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he does not want the Minister's name included in the terms of reference.  Would he agree to include explicitly the payment of £30,000 on 12 June 1989 at Briargate, <Col N="1243" /> Swords?  Does the Taoiseach agree that an assurance cannot be given on this matter being prioritised unless it is identified explicitly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply to Deputy Spring is that it is our intention.  In response to Deputy Bruton I want the issue dealt with definitively.  I have given my reasons, which I consider consistent, for not including the name in the terms of reference.  I am advised legally that the other issue needs to be looked at.  I am prepared to examine it but I do not want to specify an innocent party who is not, according to unsubstantiated information, the only party involved.  I have been told that another Member may be involved but I have no information to that effect.  I am told there are 52 allegations among other matters, but I have no reason to believe that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter indicates that allegations concerning the lands which are the subject of the <i>Magill</i> article relate to more than one elected representative.  It says that Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly have 52 allegations concerning planning and rezoning around the country but particularly in Dublin.  It indicates that some of the allegations are frivolous and that in most cases it seems unlikely that criminal proceedings would be likely to ensue.  Nevertheless, most of them appear to have been made in good faith and some seem <i>prima facie</i> to give cause for concern. It says that six have been forwarded to the Garda but that more warrant proper investigation.  It further indicated that several of those making allegations made it clear they needed guarantees which neither the clients nor the solicitors were able to provide before they would put the allegations in writing or in the public domain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recollect that Mr. Ben Dunne's name was mentioned in the terms of reference of the McCracken tribunal and that did not imply any wrongdoing on his part? <Col N="1244" /> Naming an individual in the terms of reference of a tribunal does not imply wrongdoing.

      <P>The Taoiseach wants to know why Deputy Lowry and Mr. Haughey were not included in the terms of reference of the McCracken Tribunal.  That tribunal related specifically to payments to politicians and the inquiry investigated how much, how often and to which politicians Mr. Ben Dunne had made payments. It identified a number of people.</P>

      <P>We now have the Moriarty Tribunal to inquire into matters that arose from the McCracken Tribunal.  The terms of reference we now have relate to a letter from Mr. Bailey to Mr. Gogarty about planning.  There is no reference in it to payments to Deputy Ray Burke or any other politicians.</P>

      <P>That is surely the nub of the issue.  I do not understand why the Taoiseach is putting his Government at risk by refusing a straightforward and simple procedure that would clear this matter up by including the payment by Mr. Gogarty to Deputy Ray Burke in the preliminary process which Mr. Justice Moriarty will be instituting before proceeding with a full public inquiry.  That is the most straightforward way of dealing with this issue, not by establishing a public inquiry which will take, by the Taoiseach's admission, six months at least to conclude its business and which will range across matters that bear perhaps no relationship to the payment by Mr. Gogarty to Deputy Ray Burke.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach feels there are grounds for an inquiry into the planning processes in north Dublin, let us have one, but it should not become a way of fudging the issue of payments to politicians which gave rise to this matter in the first instance.</P>

      <P>In relation to this dilemma, I heard some muttering from Fianna Fáil Ministers while Deputy De Rossa was speaking to the effect that there seem to be allegations from this side of the House that other politicians should be named.  So be it.  Let us amend the terms of reference to include the identity of all recipients of payments made to political parties, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and local authorities by Messrs James Gogarty and Michael Bailey from 1989 to date and the circumstances, considerations and motives thereof.  That would effectively include anybody who received any payments from these <Col N="1246" /> two gentlemen.  If that is acceptable, we might be able to resolve this matter.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I referred to the success of the multi-agency approach in tackling drug barons in the past year. The need for such an approach had been obvious for a long time but the political will may not have been there to pursue it.  Complaints had been made about the failure of the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners to tackle the problem.  I always argued that as the Revenue Commissioners were not afforded Garda protection it was perfectly understandable why they were not prepared to tackle the problem.  The decision to bring all the relevant agencies together under the Criminal Assets Bureau was an obvious and long overdue move.  This move is now beginning to reap rewards and many leading criminals are on the run abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person who regards himself as the prime suspect in the murder of Veronica Guerin is in London awaiting extradition to this country.  That is a good example of the benefits of international co-operation in the fight against drug-related and other crimes.  Drugs are international in so far as <Col N="1251" /> only a small amount are produced in the European Union.  Ireland has a particular responsibility to the rest of Europe in this matter.  Our long coastline and position on the western most fringe of Europe make us a key target for drug importers.  From our shores attempts are made to move drugs into Britain and other parts of Europe.  There is no difference between our fight against drugs and that of the Danes or the Dutch.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate improved co-operation between national police forces across Europe.  Like many others I have stressed the significance of international co-operation in fighting the drugs menace, but there are other areas of crime which do not respect international borders.  The convention cites, in addition to drug trafficking, trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, trade in human beings, motor vehicle crime and related money laundering activities.  To that list other offences, including international pornography and child abuse, could be added.</P>
    <P>It is often said we are living in an information age.  The quick and efficient exchange of information is critical in our fight against crime.  The Bill requires each member state to establish a national unit to facilitate the exchange of information between the respective forces of the union.  Such a unit has been in place here since 1995, but I welcome its upgrading and placement on a formal footing.  Much of the Bill is of a technical nature.  The Garda Síochána Act, 1989 will be amended to ensure the same rights that apply to gardaí here will apply to gardaí working for Europol.  The Data Protection Act, 1988 is also to be amended to ensure the rights of citizens already in place in Ireland will apply to information held by Europol.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 relate to the composition of the Irish Europol unit.  Section 16 assigns responsibility for its staffing to the Garda Commissioner. I call on the Minister for Justice, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to ensure the unit is adequately staffed.  Dedicated and special units were established in the past, but because of a lack of political will sufficient resources were not allocated to enable them perform their functions effectively.  It is not sufficient just to set up a special unit, there must be a clear commitment to provide adequate staffing and funding levels.  I have long been of the view that the establishment of a specialist anti-crime unit is the way forward in regard to policing particular problems.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Criminal Assets Bureau has strengthened my views on this matter, but such units are of little use if they are not adequately staffed.  We might have had greater success against the drug barons if more officers had been employed in specialist anti-drug units earlier than they were.  We should regard as a priority the need to build on the success to date of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  From my contacts with gardaí involved in the fight against drugs <Col N="1252" /> there is great potential for extending the role of a multi-disciplinary unit such as that one.  It would be extremely helpful at a lower level in the hierarchy of criminals to use the expertise of Revenue or Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs when the homes of suspected drug dealers are raided by gardaí.  It is not unusual for the gardaí not to come across evidence in relation to substances that may be found on the premises, but often they may find £30,000 hidden in the home.  It is difficult for the gardaí to act on that.</P>
    <P>If the Garda had access to the Criminal Assets Bureau and its expertise in revenue and social welfare it would be possible to close the net on many of those involved at a lower level in the trade.  Up to recently only a derisory number of gardaí, less than 2 per cent, worked in the Drugs Squad despite the fact that everybody admitted that up to 80 per cent of our crime was drugs related.  That problem has been addressed by means of Operation Dóchas.  It is not enough to have a unit, it must be adequately staffed and its staffing levels must be commensurate with the scale of the problem or crime being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is important in that it ensures the continuation of the multifaceted approach to crime resolution.  The criminal underworld no longer adheres to old demarcation lines and methods and neither can we if we are to be successful. This Bill represents a reasonable start to a European wide campaign against organised crime.  I have no doubt that, in time, we may need to go further.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the Schengen Agreement and the single currency will help make organised crime much more mobile.  Many supporters of the EU and further European integration lament the lack of support among the public for their campaigns. It is in the fight against drugs and their social implications that the Union, if successful, will make a considerable impact.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the rainbow Government made the fight against drugs a key issue during its Presidency of the EU, acknowledging the huge public concern Europewide about the drugs issue.  This Bill is a start.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the remarks made by the Minister for Justice yesterday and last week where he effectively accepted that zero tolerance was nothing more than a convenient election slogan. It would seem, given his tenure in the Department of Justice in the past few months, there is a realisation that the crime issue is extremely complex and requires more than simply hollow election slogans.  The first test of zero tolerance since the House resumed after the general election was in relation to the Ansbacher accounts.  We were told yesterday the Minister would not stand for crime of any kind, particularly in the drugs and fraud areas.  Here we had <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the existence of a slush fund, £38 million stashed away.  All the indications from the McCracken tribunal were that this was a major tax scam.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> It is possible to identify the people involved, to find out exactly who put money into that account and the purpose of that account.  We had an opportunity to do that when agreeing the terms of reference for the Moriarty tribunal.  The Government opposed attempts by the Opposition to include the Ansbacher accounts.  There is no greater evidence that the whole notion of zero tolerance is absolutely and utterly dead so far as the Government is concerned.  If zero tolerance is to mean anything it should have been applied to that obvious area which has come to light where there are serious concerns about a large sum of money which has all the signs of being a major fraud, yet the Government backed down.  It is difficult to take the Minister seriously when he talks about zero tolerance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposals by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to which he referred last evening, I welcome the fact that we will have additional prison spaces but I am concerned the Minister has not indicated the role of the prisons.  If we continue to provide more prison spaces we will never come to terms with the crime problem.  The Minister has made no utterance yet about the rehabilitative role of prisons and what he believes prisons should do for people who have become involved in crime and who have been accused and sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  That is most unfortunate because that whole area needs urgent examination, particularly in relation to the operation of Mountjoy Prison.  I am disappointed at the Minister's response to date in this area.  There is serious overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison.  There is also a serious problem of drug abuse.  More than 60 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy have an addiction problem, yet there is no treatment facility there for those who want to tackle it.  We as a State, and certainly the Minister in the Department of Justice, should regard this as a priority.  The main problem of the majority of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison is that they have a serious addiction problem and we simply ignore that by our refusal to introduce proper treatment facilities which recognise the nature of the problem and the nature of our crime problem, particularly in the Dublin area.  We cannot continue to keep our heads in the sand.  I call on the Minister to introduce the full range of drug treatment facilities and services into Mountjoy Prison as a matter of urgency to start to come to grips with the drugs crime problem, and the Eastern Health Board, as the agency which has responsibility for providing drug treatment in the community, is the obvious agency to do that within Mountjoy.  We have seen how that approach worked successfully in the education area where the vocational education committee provide a service on an agency basis.  It is essential that the Eastern Health Board be brought in to do the same.  We can no longer shirk this responsibility.  Those of us who have been involved in the drugs area and who have examined the question of drug treatment simply cannot understand why this is being ignored by the <Col N="1254" /> Department of Justice.  Unless we tackle that problem at its roots, what we are saying to people is that if they commit a crime they will be given a certain amount of time in Mountjoy, while there they can continue with their habit and that we are not prepared to assist them in any way to beat that habit, and when we let them out on early release they can continue with their lives of crime.  We are not providing any means by which people can break the cycle of drug addiction and criminal activity, and that is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Much progress has been made on the drugs front at community level over the past year or so. That has been mainly as a result of the establishment of local task forces to deal with this problem at community level in a multi-disciplinary way, with communities drawing up locally designed action plans which meet local needs for tackling the problem locally.  That work is extremely worthwhile.  I call on the Minister to restate the Government's commitment to providing the necessary funding at local level.  The Government should not for a moment underestimate the resources which will be necessary to turn the tide on the drugs culture which needs to be tackled on many different fronts.  Housing conditions, lack of educational opportunity, lack of recreational facilities, lack of empowerment at community level, lack of good quality community policing and lack of opportunities generally for people to develop as community leaders are all aspects that need urgent attention.  I hope the Government will restate the commitment already stated by the previous Government to continue to fund this whole area.</P>
    <P>Much work is being done by the task forces. There are two task forces in my constituency, in Finglas and in Ballymun.  I am a member of the local drugs task force in Ballymun and am very aware of the very high quality of the work being done at local level.  However, in trying desperately to do things at local level, communities regularly come up against obstacles over which they have no power or control.  One example is the slowness of the justice system in dealing with anti-social tenants in local authority estates.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of putting in place a special system to fast-track applications.  A large number of eviction orders are pending.  It is very demoralising for communities which are trying desperately to rid their areas of drug dealers when they are informed by Dublin Corporation that it can take six to nine months to have a case heard, that the decision will be appealed and result in a further delay of up to six months.  In the meantime the drug dealers continue to live in the community terrorising their neighbours.  There is a need for the State to step in and support the excellent work being done at community level and provide the strong arm communities need.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is a further step along the way to coming to grips with the international dimension of the drugs problem.  The Minister needs to address quickly the problem in urban <Col N="1255" /> areas.  It is a growing problem in rural areas.  We cannot ignore the strong link between drugs and rising crime levels.  To date, from his utterances in the past three months and from much of what he had to say when in Opposition, the Minister has shown no great appreciation of this.  I would welcome the opportunity to take him to some of the communities in Dublin which have been ravaged by drugs.  Listening to him one would get the impression that the solution lies in the provision of extra prison places and legislation. While there is a need for extra prison places and legislation, many aspects of the problem remain to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on this Bill and the range of issues that come within his portfolio.  He outlined his aims and objectives, his legislative programme and the measures he proposes to take to tackle crime and the drugs problem in particular.  He also outlined what was meant by the concept of zero tolerance Irish style to which I will return later.</P>
      <P>Crime continues to dominate our proceedings. The drugs problem in particular is of major concern to citizens.  There is a view that we are making some progress but citizens still want us to implement vigorously all of the measures necessary to tackle the problem.  I wish the Minister well.  He made a landmark speech.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Deputy Shortall who said that the Minister who comes from Caherciveen has shown no appreciation of the urban dimension of the drugs problem.  He has attended many lively public meetings in north Dublin with which I am familiar, particularly one organised by the inner city organisation, Network.  He is familiar with the urban nature of the drugs problem and just because he is from Cahirciveen does not mean Deputy Shortall should rush to the conclusion that he is not familiar with the problems of drugs in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which enables the establishment of a European police office.  It activates Title VI of the Treaty on European Union and facilitates co-operation in preventing unlawful drug trafficking, trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, trade and traffic in human beings, motor vehicle crime, money laundering activities and related criminal offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of a European police office is another important step and enhances the process of European integration to which this country is totally committed.  It is a process from which we have all benefited in so many different ways.  Next year Ireland will again be asked to demonstrate this ongoing commitment to the ideal of European Union when a referendum will take place on the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty.  I am <Col N="1256" /> confident the outcome of this vote will be a positive one.</P>
    <P>Another gigantic step in European integration is just around the corner in 1999 and concerns EMU and the single currency.  It seems obvious at this stage that businesses and ordinary citizens are not fully aware of what is involved in EMU and the establishment of a single currency.  The Government should do everything possible to highlight this important change, which is less than two years away, including initiating much more debate on what is involved.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys indicate the Oireachtas and the corporate sector are not getting the message of EMU and a single currency across.  It represents a major change in how we operate economically and a high profile national debate is long overdue. We need much more information from various Government Departments and the semi-State sector to highlight exactly will happen in 1999.</P>
    <P>This Bill formalises further the co-operation between police forces of the European Union's member states.  During the lifetime of the last Dáil I was privileged to be part of a delegation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs which visited the European Drugs Unit in the Hague.  I was delighted to have the opportunity to meet members of the Garda Síochána working there.  It was a great pleasure to witness the respect shown to those Irish participants in the European Drugs Unit and the high regard in which they were held.  Their commitment and dedication was obvious and they operated in a very efficient manner, although this is not generally appreciated here at home.  We can be proud of our participation to date in the European Drugs Unit, which has been operating on an informal basis.  As a member state we have been playing a full and active role in that organisation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, in an Irish context, the main benefit of this Bill relates to unlawful drug trafficking and the reduction of the supply of drugs entering the country.  We are a small island nation with an extensive coastline and it is difficult to secure our boundaries against the importation of illegal drugs.  All crime, especially drug trafficking, goes beyond national boundaries.  As the Minister said, national boundaries provide a cover for those involved in illegal drug trafficking. There is no doubt that greater co-operation between member states and other countries outside the European Union will be a major step in reducing the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem is still a major issue for communities in the Dublin area and throughout the country.  Entire neighbourhoods have been and continue to be subjected to intolerable conditions because of the menace of drugs.  It was only with the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin that all of us, particularly the previous Government, took notice of this serious problem and introduced a series of measures to deal with it. One of the most important Bills introduced by <Col N="1257" /> the Minister when he was spokesperson for justice dealt with the confiscation of assets.  We can see the benefits of that legislation now.</P>
    <P>It is difficult not to ask why nothing was done about this problem in the early 1980s when people were dying.  It is also difficult not to come to the conclusion that because it was confined to certain inner city areas nothing needed to be done.  I am delighted that at this late stage society has decided to make this problem its top priority. The fabric of our society has been put at risk by the increasing use of drugs, particularly by young people.  Now that we have started to tackle the problem, I hope we continue to introduce legislation and other measures to put the drug suppliers behind bars.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Shortall that one of the key factors which has awakened Ireland to the drugs problem is the demand from local communities to do something about it so that their children are protected.  I congratulate them on the initiatives they have taken in Dublin and in other urban centres.  These communities have now been brought on board at an official level as local drugs task forces draw up plans to fight the problem.  I was happy to attend the launch last Monday of the north inner city drugs task force and to see their plans to rid their communities of the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>It is marvellous that the members of the community have been officially included.  I am glad they have been asked by the State agencies, Departments and other parties to give their views and play an active role as we will all benefit from their wisdom and experience of the drugs problem. That has been one of the major successes of the past year and will continue to be so when the plans of the various local drug task forces are put into operation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment given in the Programme for Government to adopt a multifaceted approach.  The issue of social inclusion must be placed at the top of the political agenda.  Despite the fact that this Bill deals with the supply of drugs, there is no doubt that understanding the demand for drugs and people's reasons for becoming drug addicts will form a major part of the solution.  Agencies involved in dealing with issues relating to poverty, employment, sport and recreation, training and education must come together to reduce the demand for drugs and rid our communities of this problem.</P>
    <P>The National Drug Strategy Team is in place and, in that context, I welcome the roles that will be played by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid and the Minister of State, Deputy Flood.  They will play a major role in providing young people with worthwhile alternative activities.  The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation will play an important part in dispersing national lottery funds and drawing up general policy to reduce the demand for drugs throughout the community.  Many of the <i>ad hoc</i> voluntary organisations involved in this area have struggled for years to deal with long waiting lists, <Col N="1258" /> etc.  The role they play must be given increased recognition through the provision of financial assistance.</P>
    <P>Operation Dóchas has been successful because gardaí are now actively involved in dealing with the drugs problem.  Community policing is a reality and members of the force are working on the ground to resolve the problem.  However, it took a great deal of time to recognise the value of community policing in the fight against drugs. People want to see gardaí on the beat getting to know the members of the community.  If we did nothing else during the lifetime of this Dáil but beef up the community policing scheme and ensure the continuation of Operation Dóchas, we will have done worthwhile work to improve community life in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to learn of the resignation of Assistant Garda Commissioner, Tom King, whose work was central to this issue and who was never afraid to offer his views, often in a hard-hitting way, on how to deal with the problem of drugs.  I believe his wisdom will be missed by the communities of north Dublin.  I do not know his reasons for resigning; I am sure they are of a personal nature. However, I hope his resignation is not a symptom of a wider problem regarding pay and conditions in the Garda Síochána.  He has done much good work on the drugs problem in the city and I wish him well in the future.</P>
    <P>Estate management has been referred to.  It is a relatively new concept and I welcome the role played by the former Minister of State, Deputy McManus, in coming to grips with it.  For years it was talked about at local authority level but no real commitment was given at managerial level to tackle the issues involved and put people in charge of actively managing their estates.  The concept needs to be developed further.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the role played by Dublin Corporation. In the past year, since the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin, it has appointed estate management officers for many of the flats schemes in the city.  These are very committed people who are getting to know their communities, organising meetings and contributing their knowledge on how to run committees.  I have seen the benefit of this.</P>
    <P>As this Bill has a European dimension, I take this opportunity to commend the work of EURAD, Europe Against Drugs, and the role it has played, albeit at a voluntary level, throughout the member states, in tackling this problem. Gráinne Kelly has addressed various Oireachtas committees in the past and her work is well known.  I commend her and her organisation on the stand they are taking on calls for the legalisation of certain drugs which would be a mistake, judging from the experience of other member states.  The contribution which EURAD has made to the national debate is important on the question of dispensing methadone, which is a practical and urgent response to the problem. However, we also need to look beyond that and <Col N="1259" /> to recognise it is not the ideal solution.  We need to debate how treatment should be administered.</P>
    <P>I was delighted with the Minister's speech last night when he outlined what he considers to be zero tolerance, adapted to Irish needs.  There is no doubt that we cannot import these theories lock, stock and barrel from other countries.  They have to be adapted to our situation.  The Minister clearly demonstrated his commitment to zero tolerance of drug related crime and is responding to the Irish manifestation of this problem.  I have no doubt he is extremely committed to tackling the drugs menace and I wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone in this House recognises that the globalisation of modern crime demands a global response.  We need to respond effectively and flexibly to deal with emerging as well as existing crime.  It is clear that criminals, particularly those involved in drug trafficking, are operating across national boundaries.  We are all familiar with the pattern; the dealer from Crumlin escapes to Malaga or Amsterdam and the overseas trafficker enters Ireland via our coastline.</P>
      <P>The internationalisation of crime and its money making capacity is part of the modern Irish experience and as such this Bill is of great relevance. However, while it covers a wide range of crimes, child abduction has been excluded.  This is surprising as it is a transboundary crime with which we are not unfamiliar.  Because of its extremely distressing nature, there should be a specific reference to it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We have a major terrorism problem and an extensive coastline, but in general we have a reputation of being a good clearing ground for drugs en route to Europe.  We also have an increasing immigrant smuggling problem.  It makes sense, therefore, for us to take a lead in expanding co-operation on crime at EU level, but Europol can only be as good as the resources put into it.  The Minister did not deal comprehensively with the question of resources or staffing. Will he outline his intentions regarding the local unit and the international agency in terms of staffing and resources?  He is well known for his comments about his commitment to fighting crime, but it is by his actions he will be judged. He has made great play of his policy on zero tolerance which has been exposed as a sham.  It was used cynically during the election campaign to play on people's fears, but abandoned when the Government was established.  That is a disturbing feature of the Minister's view of crime.  He misled people on his view.  As soon as he was in a position to put in place a zero tolerance policy, with which many people including the Garda Commissioner did not agree, he failed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a glaring example of his abandonment of such policy.  The source and destination of the proceeds of crime is covered in the Bill and there is a welcome emphasis on money laundering. However, a few weeks ago the House <Col N="1260" /> voted down a proposal from Democratic Left to investigate the £38 million Ansbacher account, the existence of which was revealed by the McCracken tribunal.  We do not know from where that money came or why it was lodged in that account, but we know that an effective bulwark against criminality is to send out a clear message that anyone suspected of using financial institutions or commercial companies for illegal purposes will be fully investigated.  This presented us with an opportunity to investigate money that is hidden away possibly as a tax scam or for even more serious purposes.</P>
    <P>The McCracken tribunal opened a window and the Ansbacher account was revealed, but the Minister closed the shutter rather than accept that the only option in terms of public accountability was to investigate the matter.  The abandonment of the policy of zero tolerance was manifest in the way Deputies from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats voted down an investigation into the Ansbacher accounts.</P>
    <P>We are now debating this Bill and the complex nature of our response to crime at an international level.  Deputies have also spoken about our response at national and local level.  The aim of the response is to protect Europe's citizens from the big bosses of the criminal world.  This is an objective worthy of our support.</P>
    <P>However, in the move to transnational information gathering we must ensure that Europe's citizens are also protected from the big brother of the computer world.  In that context we need to look at some of the provisions of this Bill in terms of protecting individual rights.</P>
    <P>My party will support the Bill.  We welcome its provisions.  We endorse the need to enable police forces in member states to collate and exchange information.  However, aspects of the Bill give rise to concern.  The text of the convention upon which the Bill is based is notable for the number of references to rights of individuals, but it does not refer in an adequate way to any corresponding means of enforcing these rights.  While the convention insists that only lawful data may be held it does not provide for adequate machinery for investigating how or why unlawful data may be entered.</P>
    <P>Under articles 8.1(1) and (2), data can be stored not only on persons suspected of having committed an offence but also on persons who it is believed will commit offences.  This is a potentially wideranging power.  Under article 19, the provision for a right to access by persons to data held on them is problematic.  Access can be refused on wide grounds and in that event the authorities will not even tell the inquirer if they hold data on him or her.  There is a right to have data corrected, but if the inquirer cannot access the data it will be impossible to know whether it needs correcting or not.</P>
    <P>Article 38 provides for compensation for damage caused by legal or factual errors in data held or under processes, for example, in cases of wrongful arrest, harassment, etc.  However, any <Col N="1261" /> claim must be taken under the law of the country where the event occurred.  Laws vary widely across the EU member states and many different legal standards will therefore apply in terms of compensation.  For example, an Irish citizen may be in difficulties in another country where standards are different.</P>
    <P>I am mystified that the terms of the Europol Convention appear to conflict with the Data Protection Act.  Under this Act controllers must rightly respond to a request for access by an individual to information held on him within 21 days. However, under the convention that term is extended to three months.  Will the Minister explain why this is and what it means?</P>
    <P>The position of immigrants and asylum seekers has become tenuous across the EU, including our own society.  It is right that illegal immigrant smuggling is specifically mentioned in the Europol Convention.  It is a transboundary crime which concerns us all.  Those who profit from human misery and who cash in on the illegal transportation of asylum seekers deserve to be punished under law.</P>
    <P>However, at a time when racism and xenophobia are on the increase it is important that the Europol Convention protects immigrants and does not become another brick in the wall of &ldquo;Fortress Europe&rdquo;.  It is a matter of how this information is going to be used.  For example, given the preventative nature of article 8.2 it is conceivable that an immigrant who is a legitimate resident in a EU member state could be caught up in the Europol net on the grounds that at some future date he or she may seek to bring in relatives without sanction.</P>
    <P>There is much concern regarding the issue of asylum seekers.  I am sure Deputies have, like myself, received much correspondence relating to the Refugee Act.  Members of society are inquiring about the implementation of the Act and our position with regard to our international obligations. The debates today in the media and the situation of our emigrants in America remind us that we have international responsibilities and that we cannot close the door or delay processes in a way that creates problems which in turn have an impact in creating further fears and xenophobia.</P>
    <P>One simple measure which the Minister could and should take immediately is to make provision for legal aid for asylum seekers in view of the effective collapse of the Irish Refugee Council's legal service, which is closing down today because it does not have the resources to continue.  The Minister has a responsibility in this regard and he must act to deal with it.  Some time ago he made a welcome decision to employ extra staff to process applications because of the backlog.  However, he should broaden the base of individuals eligible for these positions.  Has he done so yet?  His decision to accept applications from retired gardaí and civil servants was a blunder and the unions rightly challenged it.  We need people of the highest calibre to process applications from asylum seekers. <Col N="1262" /> While many retired gardaí and civil servants have sterling qualities they are not the only people who can take on this task.  To exclude others is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>To be effective at combating crime what happens at international level must be matched by what is happening at local level.  When tackling drug trafficking or organised crime, co-operation on the street is as important, if not more so, than co-operation across nations.  With regard to the drug crisis, especially that affecting Irish urban communities, a failure of trust between gardaí and communities created fertile ground in the past for criminal activities.  The growing recognition by the gardaí that local communities have an important role to play was long overdue.</P>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to the Assistant Garda Commissioner, Tom King, whose record in this regard is inspirational.  I regret that he is leaving the Garda Síochána.  It is important that we know not the personal reasons but the factors that may have led to that decision.  He will be a loss to the force and to the wider community.  His contribution was significant.  His departure should reinforce the message that partnership is the only way forward in the war against drugs.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of the previous Government.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, took a leading role in establishing the structures and the forms of co-operation, leading from the local community level through to involvement by the then Taoiseach, in the fight against drugs.  It was a transforming approach and it transformed the work at local community level.  While the work is not yet finished, it ensured that confidence was instilled in communities who had no confidence that anybody beyond their own members was listening, paying attention and willing to act and contribute to ensure that the menace was overcome.  Certainly in the areas of estate management it will take a long time for satisfactory standards to be put in place, not merely in the case of local authorities but within local communities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the points made by the previous speaker on sport and recreation and the welcome approach adopted by the previous Government to ensure sufficient funding for recreational purposes but we should not lose sight of the fact that many people who succumb to drugs are young. They need more than just the sports field; they need work and a sense of their own value and worth.  They need family connections and a place in society where they can contribute so that at the end of every day they feel that what they have done is of value to them and those around them, not an easy objective.  Many young people remain alienated, outside the economic prosperity many of us have enjoyed.  At the end of the day it is they who are primarily at risk from drug barons who seek to destroy and make money out of them.</P>
    <P>I hope that fight will continue.  In that respect I am very glad the Minister of State at the <Col N="1263" /> Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, has been given responsibility for the Government's drugs strategy.  He has the requisite commitment, interest and experience on the ground, representing the area he does, to ensure progress is made.</P>
    <P>The question of accountability needs to be addressed in this Bill.  The European Convention was not submitted to the European Parliament even though at the time an undertaking was given that the European Parliament would be consulted as part of the process of drawing up the convention, which underlines the lack of democratic control. It is a matter of concern to me that many decisions continue to be taken behind closed doors.  The European Parliament, whose Members are democratically elected and whose debates are conducted openly, does not form an important part of decision-making in many areas, including this one.  It is my understanding that Europol will not be accountable to the European Parliament, as it should be.  An accounting process should be established whereby, at the very least, Europol would have to report and be answerable to the European Parliament whenever changes are proposed in its remit or any of its features or operations have to be dealt with. This would ensure the European Parliament, as the democratic voice of the European Union, would have a say in any such decisions.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about our commitment to this type of international co-operation, we need to set an example in this House.  An annual report from the national unit should be laid before this House so that Members can ascertain precisely the effect of that unit.</P>
    <P>It is an important measure with great potential for good but it also carries certain dangers which need to be acknowledged.  We must at all times protect the innocent as well as seeking out the guilty.  Open democratic accountability is our best insurance to attain that objective.  It will also allow us to ensure that Europol is working effectively to combat crime in all its manifestations and ensure that we deal with issues at international level while at all times ensuring that the system is accountable at local level.</P>

      <P>Thirty years ago it would have been difficult for any Member of this House to envisage the need for a Bill such as this when crime, in so far as it existed, was sporadic, local and disorganised. The laws which then governed our criminal justice system, for the most part, had been formulated in the 18th century carried over unchanged after independence.  They remained unchanged because, by and large, they were adequate to deal with the level of crime which persisted but over the past 30 years that picture has changed utterly. We can no longer describe crime as sporadic, in some areas it has become virtually endemic.  It is no longer possible to describe it as local, it has become national and, in many instances, international. It is no longer possible to describe crime as disorganised.  The greatest criminal damage in this country is caused by organised criminal conspiracies which have transcended national boundaries and have become truly global in their dimensions.</P>
      <P>Many factors contributed to the change which has come about &mdash; industrialisation and economic prosperity having brought with them a fracturing of traditional urban and rural communities. People left the land and small towns and villages in rural areas to flock to the cities.  In turn, the cities expanded by growing into vast, sprawling suburbs.  The sense of extended family and community which for centuries had been a part of Irish life diminished and, in some instances, was lost altogether.</P>
      <P>This social change coincided with the opening up of horizons which occurred in the early 1960s with the arrival of television.  With the benefit of hindsight it is clear that television is a medium of extraordinary influence which could have been used far more wisely than has been the case. There can be no doubt that we have surrendered vast sections of it to crass commercialism while its educational potential has been relegated to a guilty afterthought.  Television exposed people who, in many instances were displaced from their traditional community, to the vision of a lifestyle which was largely illusory.  The quest for that lifestyle and to acquire material possessions have taken a social toll.  It is all the more regrettable that it was into this social cauldron that violence resulting from political unrest in the North of Ireland spilled.  Images of men with guns became commonplace, death by gunshot was no longer something confined to the images of foreign countries contained on the small screen; it had left the realm of the cowboy and Hollywood screen.  It was real, here, happening on the streets on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> Inevitably the thin boundary, if one exists, between political violence and criminal violence dissolved.  Paramilitaries turned to bank robberies to fund their activities and, in some instances, their lifestyles.  People were shot and some died. It became a reality of everyday life in the mid-1970s. There can be no doubt but that Governments throughout the 1970s were well-intentioned so far as crime was concerned.  But with the very considerable advantage of hindsight it is possible to see that the body politic was preoccupied with politically motivated crime to the virtual exclusion of all other categories.  Such law reform as occurred in the criminal justice system in the 1970s was directed almost exclusively at paramilitary crime.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Act, 1976 and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act of that year were firmly focused on paramilitary violence, the amendments applied to the offences of burglary and robbery by the latter Act, though worthwhile, having the appearance of legislative afterthought. While Government and Legislature focused on paramilitaries, the slow trickle of drugs became a flood.  It had been unthinkable that Ireland could succumb to heroin in the same manner as other countries, but the unthinkable became the reality. Heroin found a foothold among the socially excluded, young men and women who appeared to have been beached by the rising tide of prosperity. A generation of young men and women found themselves, through no fault of their own or their families, excluded from mainstream society by reason of educational disadvantage and unemployment.  Many of those addicts have since died.  All have suffered and their families and communities have suffered.</P>
    <P>They were the real victims of the first contacts between criminal elements in Ireland, on the Continent and in the United States of America. These contacts developed for two reasons: the importation of arms and of drugs.  Such criminal laws and resources as were available to the Garda were wholly inadequate to deal with this new international dimension to Irish crime.  In this vacuum, criminal organisations flourished and continued to do so for over a decade.  It is for history to judge how Governments reacted and the verdict of history may well be harsh.  Our task is to assess the nature and extent of crime as it now exists and to perceive the direction in which the problem will grow unless it is curbed.  If we can succeed in severing the links forged between Irish criminals and their continental counterparts, we will succeed in dramatically lessening the incidence of crime in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason I support this Bill.  It recognises the reality of the new Europe and that the partial dismantling of national borders and the creation of a single market has facilitated the potential growth of international crime.  Its passage through the Oireachtas would enable Ireland to ratify the 1995 Europol Convention and its related Protocols.  In the age of information technology, Europol represents a merger between the <Col N="1266" /> best and the brightest in countercriminal intelligence and computers.  It will facilitate the storage, retrieval and analysis of vast quantities of information to the detriment of the criminal.  Brick upon brick, it will play a vital part in crushing criminal empires.  It will result in the availability and collation of information leading to the conviction of international gangsters and the confiscation of their assets.  Each member state will not alone send liaison officers to Europol, but will also establish national units which will be a centralised focus point for the dissemination and retrieval of information.  Information is the key to cracking organised international criminal gangs. Crimefighting in the future will depend on information and innovation.  Our task is twofold: to facilitate the Garda and other European police forces in acquiring the information they need and to provide the necessary innovation to overcome problems which may at first appear insuperable.</P>
    <P>In this, we can point to recent successes.  We have every right to be proud of the initiatives we have taken in the fight against crime.  The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, is a testament to what can occur when a democratic Parliament functions in the manner in which it was intended.  The Act resulted from a Bill introduced by the now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his then position of Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice.  It was accepted by the then Government, which proposed a number of drafting modifications on Committee Stage.  In the past year, the weapon of that Act has been wielded with fierce effectiveness by the officers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It has resulted in the seizure of millions of pounds of assets illicitly obtained in this country and abroad.  The Act recently withstood a constitutional challenge in the High Court where Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness upheld its constitutionality.  The organised criminal gangsters, who for so long believed themselves to be untouchable, have been viciously manhandled in their quest for wealth by the operation of this Act.  It is a testament to what can occur when the people's representatives act with resolve and vision.</P>
    <P>The exact same vision is involved in Europol. The ratification will result in a communal pooling of information on organised crime by police forces in the European Union.  The use of sophisticated computer analysis techniques will enable police forces to broaden their knowledge of the members, associates and <i>modus operandi</i> of international gangs.  Once the convention has been ratified and is in force, Europol will concern itself with specific categories of serious crimes.  Its remit specifically includes illicit drug trafficking, trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, smuggling illegal immigrants, motor vehicle crime, trafficking in human beings and money laundering activities associated with any of these activities.  The initial task of Europol is to collect, collate and disseminate information and intelligence. The time has already arrived when strong consideration must be given to extending the task <Col N="1267" /> of Europol in the operational arena.  International crime requires an international police force capable of conducting transnational surveillance and pursuit.  I am aware this issue is to be dealt with in the Amsterdam Treaty agreed by the member states last June and due to be signed tomorrow, but it will require further action by member states before that can become a reality.  I commend it to the Minister as an objective worthy of active pursuit during his term of office.</P>
    <P>To be effective, a criminal justice policy must be coherent and comprehensive.  It must set policy objectives and spell out how it proposes to go about achieving them.  Fianna Fáil did just that in our policy paper <i>Leading the Fight Against Crime</i>, published last March and significantly in advance of the general election.  Given the ongoing nature of the debate on that policy, it is worthwhile recalling what Fianna Fáil proposed.  We stated:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will encourage a policy of zero tolerance.  This will reflect the following principles: that no crime, no matter how small, is insignificant; certain crimes will not be overlooked because they are not important; tolerance of small crimes creates a climate where big crimes flourish; there is a certain connection between lesser and more serious crimes: and that toleration of lesser crimes or violations sends the wrong signal to the average law-abiding citizen that the Gardaí and the Government are ineffective.</P>
    <P>This is the policy which is being relentlessly criticised. It appears that many who criticise it have not bothered to read it, let alone propose a viable alternative.  The greatest critics of zero tolerance are the advocates of &ldquo;Nero&rdquo; tolerance, those who would fiddle while Rome burns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil do Theachta Hanafin as ucht cúpla nóiméad a thabhairt dom.  Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  I welcome this Bill in the few moments available to me because it is critical for two reasons.  Most of the drugs which come into this country come through European countries. The drug which causes most social destruction in Dublin, heroin, comes largely through Turkey, Europe and British cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and London.  For that reason, it is critical that there be maximum co-operation between the police forces in Europe, Britain and this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason, which is almost a reverse of the first, in that most of our main drug dealers, for a variety of reasons, have moved their bases to Europe, mainly in Amsterdam but also in Manchester and London.  If we are to deal effectively with the supply of drugs in this State we must pursue those main drug dealers and we can only do that with the co-operation of European police forces.  It was a cause of great public disquiet that these people &mdash; who were known by names like &ldquo;the Penguin&rdquo;, whose real name <Col N="1268" /> was George Mitchell, and &ldquo;the Footballer&rdquo;, whose real name was Derek Dunne &mdash; operated openly here.  It is a matter of amazement that these same people can now operate openly from bases in Europe.  One hopes that the measures contained in this Bill and elsewhere will ensure that they are not just defeated on the home front but will be attacked in their new bases in Amsterdam, Manchester and London.  They are now investing in Britain and Europe the millions they have gained from the misery of their victims in Ireland.  If we are to follow those assets, it is essential that there be co-operation with the police forces and states involved.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Criminal Assets Bureau on its recent activities.  The involvement of the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda, the Department of Social Welfare and other sources of expertise was sought by me and others for a number of years in this House.  I could never understand why successive Governments did not take this action much sooner.  The bureau has now been established and is working successfully.  It appears that it is reaching the people who control drug dealing &mdash; those who are not involved directly, but make it possible indirectly.  Drug dealing is a multi-million pound business.  The drug dealers I mentioned and the others who are household names were petty criminals up to four or five years ago. They had no expertise or particular knowledge of high finance, big business or the investment of money.  To launder their money, to invest in a legitimate business and to make their operation work, it was essential that they had the involvement of professional financial and legal expertise. It is my hope &mdash; and there are indications that this is beginning to happen &mdash; that the Criminal Assets Bureau will reach the experts that were and are involved.</P>
    <P>In other countries, because of the lucrative nature of drug dealing, even political and police circles have been corrupted by the wealth available, and it is quite possible that this has also happened here.  None of that could be uncovered without the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I hope it has all the resources it needs to get to the top people.  We thought until now that the drug barons were at the top of the drug business but they are not &mdash; it is the people who make the business work for the drug barons who are at the top.  They have the expertise to launder money and invest it in legitimate businesses.  It is essential to destroy their operations because if we do not, other people will turn into barons.  For every baron who is put behind bars another will take his place.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the communities who have been struggling valiantly against drug pushers in the last few years, particularly in Dublin.  Their work should be built upon and perhaps new structures can be developed to harness the positive energy they have displayed.  These structures could include police/community councils.  It is only through the maximum amount of co-operation between the community and the police that <Col N="1269" /> one can effectively deal with and eradicate drug dealers from these communities.  We must also remember that a drug like heroin is rooted in social disadvantage.  The areas of Dublin where heroin is a major problem are all socially disadvantaged and, unless this House and the various Government Departments address that fundamental issue, we will never root out the horrible problem of heroin addiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgraceful reflection on the procedures of this House that the person who is most competent to speak on this Bill, who has the best knowledge of the drugs problem in Ireland, in particular in Dublin &mdash; that is, Deputy Gregory &mdash; is only allocated five minutes.  It is extraordinary that our procedures are so stifling. We need to hear people who are familiar with what is happening on the streets and that should be borne in mind when legislation is framed and procedures are drawn up.</P>
      <P>The magnitude of this problem is beyond the comprehension of most of us.  It has been a culture shock to discover the extent of the wealth of drug barons, their activities, the assassinations, the ease with which they have escaped, and the number of supposedly respectable people involved in the crime-ridden drug society.  The problem is so huge and intimidating, and there have been so many assassinations in recent years, that people are terrified.  We do not realise the depth and scale of the corruption &mdash; we are only beginning to scratch its surface.</P>
      <P>This legislation, which concerns co-operation with law enforcement agencies throughout the EU, is to be welcomed because it is long overdue. Our system to tackle the problem has been astoundingly slow to come into operation.  Reference has been made to the Criminal Assets Bureau, which has mounted the single most successful operation to combat crime.</P>
      <P>The process was set in motion by the murder of Veronica Guerin.  The machinery started to move after that terrible crime &mdash; the problem was long there and we suspected as much but no one was willing to tackle it.  The buck stops in this House, with the legislators, the Government of the day, the Minister for Justice, and the Garda Síochána. It was rather as if we preferred to feel it did not exist, which is why we are so late in tackling this huge problem.  I have no doubt that Dublin, and perhaps the rest of the country, is a network of gangs and gangsters who have the place carved up and who are operating on the same basis as the Mafia in Italy, the gangsters of old in Chicago or current gangs in New York, Washington and other major cities.  The gangs are organised to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gangland assassinations, a feature of life up to a year ago and which saw 15 people being shot in drug related incidents, have ended because the Garda have taken action.  They are beginning to get to grips with the problem.  Initially the situation was so overwhelming that, like the rest of us, the Garda could not comprehend its vastness. <Col N="1270" /> The evidence of corruption now surfacing is considerable. There are many people in comfortable, senior positions who may well be involved in this corruption.  Some people, when they see hugely wealthy drug barons getting away with almost everything and in a position to order people to be killed at will, may decide it is wiser to stay on the side of the criminal and benefit from ill-gotten gains rather than stand up to the criminal.  There is a serious threat of a breakdown in democracy when such a situation develops.  I do not think I am overstating the case when I say there are business people, solicitors, accountants and people in key positions collaborating with gangsters, drug barons and racketeers.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement made no reference to extradition and I would like the Minister of State to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for whom I have high regard.  Extradition from Canada and South Africa was mentioned in the context of Europe drawing up extradition treaties with these countries, but what is the position regarding extradition from Britain and other member states of the EU?  Some gangsters whose nicknames we know, including the Penguin, the Footballer and the Monk, are living in EU countries such as Britain, Holland and Spain.  Why is it not possible to extradite these people to stand trial for crimes for which the Garda have ample evidence to secure convictions?  Why are there no extradition treaties allowing the return of the godfathers? That is inexplicable.  We know where these people are living.  There are former IRA and INLA members in Amsterdam worth tens or, perhaps, hundreds of millions of pounds co-ordinating the drugs business.  They are supervising and directing the importation of shiploads of drugs into Ireland and other EU countries.  The authorities know where these people live.  Why can they not be brought back to Ireland to stand trial?  I do not understand why this is not possible and neither do the public.  Drugs will continue to be a major problem here until those people are put behind bars for a long time.  They are untouchable under current legislation.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gregory said, when the drug barons leave their network in Ireland is maintained. There are people ready to step into their shoes and take over the activities.  The bosses are abroad but there are plenty of people here to sustain the network.  Why are we not implementing extradition laws?  Do extradition treaties exist and if so why are they not being implemented?</P>
    <P>The magnitude of the problem is such that the Garda were shocked when they began their investigations following the death of Veronica Guerin at the number of gangs, the financial resources and weapons at their disposal and the ruthlessness of their activities.  I wonder whether there are moles in the security services who have undermined the good work of our law enforcement agencies.  Are the attempts to solve the drug and crime problems being undermined by inside information being leaked to the godfathers?  It <Col N="1271" /> would be interesting to know the true story regarding the consignment of cannabis intercepted at Urlingford, County Kilkenny.  How is it that tonnes of cannabis were intercepted while nobody was arrested?  Obviously inside information was being passed on.  A mole tipped them off.  Such activity is much more prevalent than people are prepared to admit.  Gangsters can only be defeated if we have honourable men tackling the problem.  We have many honourable men but there are some dishonourable people in key positions who are tipping off criminals.</P>
    <P>Why should the Garda alone be charged with solving the problem?  Other agencies should be involved.  Al Capone was not arrested on the basis of murder or racketeering.  He was caught and imprisoned because he did not pay his taxes thus bringing his violent career to an end.  He was caught by the revenue agencies, not by the police. Have we the vision to defeat criminals?  We have sufficient resources, but it is a matter of applying them.  The Criminal Assets Bureau, which has been very successful, is one effective manner of challenging crime.  However, we should not become complacent.  Many of the criminal structures established by godfathers who now live outside the country still exist.  Who knows how high collaboration with these people goes?  Does it go as far as the Judiciary?  Probably not, but it may. It does in Italy with the Mafia and in America, so why do we think it is not happening here?  We are too polite, but the problem will not be solved unless the finger is put on the sore spot.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that people like Deputy Gregory do not get a greater opportunity to voice their opinion on these matters as they deal with the public in areas which are drug ridden.  We should have specific crime committees in this House to subpoena people and question them.  We are only at a halfway house and have not brought all the instruments of State into operation, which is what I ask for today.  There should be no complacency. Let us follow up on what has been done to date. I have no criticism of this or the previous Minister who have done an excellent job.</P>
    <P>The magnitude of the crime problem, particularly in relation to drugs, is so great that it is beyond our understanding.  The Minister said the wealth and influence of some of these people is greater than that of some countries.  How about that?  These are Irish people who can kill at will and buy people off.  They are supposed to be legitimate, above board and in positions of influence and trust.  I have no doubt such activities occur everyday.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to other items besides co-operation to deal with the drug problem, which is by far the greatest problem and is very relevant to us at present.  The Minister said Europol has been set up to combat trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances.  That is a matter of considerable significance which should not be underestimated. In the past few days I read in a newspaper that <Col N="1272" /> small nuclear weapons had been stolen in the former Soviet Union.  Perhaps Iraq or Arab terrorists such as Hamas will use them in a city in America.  It was said they were capable of killing up to 100,000 people.  There is a need for Europol to ensure the weaponry, particularly nuclear weapons, of the former Soviet Union are carefully guarded and do not get into the hands of terrorists who would be delighted to kill 100,000 Americans in the one go.  Such weapons will do the maximum damage and it is a frightening thought.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the problem of illegal immigration networks which we are beginning to witness through a flood of refugees into this country. They are called refugees but they are illegal immigrants.  They are coming from countries which have been liberated from communism and from Africa.  They are causing a serious problem and let us not underestimate it or be carried away by the need to give people a fair deal.  We can be overgenerous.  We do not have the capacity to absorb tens of thousands of people from countries in central and eastern Europe and Africa. These people should stay in their own countries and attempt to build them now they have been liberated from communism.  We do not have the resources and should not have to suffer the thievery and crime created as a result of their presence, whether it is social welfare fraud, murder or other serious crimes.</P>
    <P>I have been flooded with letters asking us to implement the Refugee Act.  We can be overgenerous and we must call a halt.  Yesterday in my constituency five people from Romania were intercepted.  They had smuggled themselves across in a container truck.  In England a couple of days ago 48 people who had come across from France in a truck were caught.  We must stem that flow; we cannot allow it to continue unabated.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Europol drugs unit, the EDU, is extending its activities to deal with the paedophile problem, which is huge one worldwide. He referred to a specific case in Belgium last year and earlier this year where a paedophile ring was uncovered.  That paedophile ring echoes much of what I have spoken about.  It was not only ordinary people who were involved but senior police officers, politicians and eminent business people.  In perverted activities such as drugs abuse, profit making or the sexual abuse of youngsters, people at any level may be involved. Proportionately, one would probably find more from the upper than the lower strata of society involved because they have the money, brains, influence and access to corridors of power.  Our society may be riddled with corruption and we may not be as aware as we should be of that, although every day a new case comes to light.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely in favour of drawing up a register of paedophiles, which is being done on the Continent and in Britain, because with modern technology a six year old child can access different codes on the Internet.  It would be great to have a register but if it fell into the wrong hands, the problem could be multiplied.  People in <Col N="1273" /> high places are deeply involved in these activities which gives all the more rise for concern.  I hope this debate will lead to further progress in our attempt to defeat criminals, especially drug barons and their associates, many of whom appear to be respectable members of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím an Bille seo agus an díospóireacht a bhaineann leis.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, traoslaím leis an Aire agus an Aire Stáit as na postanna nua atá acu.  Tá obair fíordheacair agus fíorthábhachtach le déanamh acu insan troid i gcoinne na scéimhleitheoirí de gach sórt.</P>
      <P>As many speakers and Minister have said, the background to the Bill is the problem of organised crime and the massive resources available to these criminals and the manner in which they have deployed these resources.  In setting the background, it is useful to recognise the perception outside the House that politicians have been ineffective and perhaps poorly focused.  There is even a belief in some circles that they have been complicit and more interested in point scoring and grabbing cheap headlines than in dealing with the problems.  A couple of high profile crimes such as the murders of Veronica Guerin and Detective McCabe brought it into sharp focus.  It is time the Oireachtas faced up to the serious implications of this growing perception among the public, law-abiding citizens and those involved in criminality.  It is encouraging to note that the Criminal Assets Bureau, which is such a short time in existence, has been so successful and it proves that no matter how great the problem may seem, if it is addressed it can be dealt with adequately.  This Bill is extremely important as is the programme of action set out by the Minister in his speech.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister intends to provide 1,000 more prison spaces within two years and 12,000 gardaí within five years; that the courts and Prison Service will have agency status; that there will be serious Garda operational initiatives on an ongoing basis and that he has promised a great deal of legislation.  A criminal justice Bill is due this year and a juvenile justice is Bill in the pipeline, in addition to a child pornography Bill, an amendment of the Criminal Insanity Act and enabling legislation referring to international war crimes tribunals and for the ratification of the UN convention on the use of torture.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes very easy to fault the provision of prison spaces.  Whatever action is taken by this Minister, the Government and the agencies at their disposal, it is inevitable that its success will create a need for more prison spaces.  Unless they are provided, the revolving door system, which has allowed criminals to scoff at the Garda, will continue unabated.  I am delighted the Minister is providing extra prison spaces and that he is committing State resources to the fight against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt the Garda has been overextended in many areas and that additional numbers will be very welcome.  It will be interesting to see how the courts and the Prison Service operate <Col N="1274" /> when they have agency status.  I presume that will involve legislation, which will make for an interesting debate in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister also promised extradition treaties with Canada and South Africa.  Deputy Deasy made a very telling point in that it seems some key international drug traffickers are being harboured in countries with which we would previously have understood we had excellent extradition treaties.  There are serious questions about why that is continuing.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a need to review criminal law issues generally.  However, the best possible response from the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to the criticism that he is going soft on zero tolerance is the Bill and the raft of other legislation and other measures which he promised the House yesterday.  His intentions in that regard deserve support rather than begrudgery.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that this Bill has been in the pipeline since December 1991.  It appears to have been ratified at a convention on 26 July 1995. There were subsequent Protocols in July 1996 and June 1997.  However, it is worrying it has taken since December 1991 &mdash; almost six years &mdash; for the intention in relation to Europol to become a reality in terms of legislation.  I do not think this State, which is small in European terms, is particularly to blame.  However, I believe there has been a certain tardiness and laxity in dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>One would wonder whether the entire affair has been treated with the urgency which it warrants at EU level, particularly by certain states.  I note in that regard particularly the German paedophile cases in 1996 and the massive drug smuggling operations which have been known about internationally for several years.  It will be interesting to see how quickly we see some movement arising from the new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty of June 1997.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that it was found politically necessary in 1993 to set up the European Drugs Unit in response to international happenings at that time.  However, it is important to consider the very limited scope of the powers of that operation, which reflected thinking at that time on the battle against crime in Europe.  We wonder if the vision reflected in the Amsterdam Treaty in June and in this legislation and legislation elsewhere in Europe is sufficient to address the reality of the years 1997 to 1999 or if it is merely a late and inadequate response to the problem.</P>
    <P>The vision which the Minister enunciated yesterday of an updated response to international criminal activity is most welcome.  However, will it be adequate in two or four years' time?  Have we a policy unit at EU level which will constantly update, for example, lists of crimes and the various necessary responses?  I know the Minister indicated that articles 2 and 43.3 enable the Justice and Home Affairs Council to expand the list of crimes, but is there an adequate system in place?  Equally importantly, can the council, in <Col N="1275" /> whatever action it takes, call on sufficient resources?</P>
    <P>I make this point in the context of the changing perception and reality of international criminality. One of the key requirements in the EU fight against crime will be the flexibility to respond to crime in the embryo stage rather than when it has become the fully operational monster which it is at this time.</P>
    <P>In that context, it seems extraordinary that Ireland is only the second European state to ratify the convention.  For once, the UK, which is frequently accused of being a bad European, is first in the field.  Another 13 countries have still to deal with this convention, which does not come properly into force until the last state has dealt with it.  We need to be watchful of any tardiness at European level.  This matter is of such importance that it should not be allowed to wait on the back burner while the kind of activities being discussed in the House are continuing apace.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to previous tardiness and Deputy Gregory referred to the speed at which some criminals moved from being involved in small scale activities to being major criminals. Would it not be appropriate to formulate a response which would cut off the development of these people when they are much less powerful? As the Minister said, some of them have at their disposal resources greater than those of some of the countries in which they operate.  It is important that the corruption, white collar crime and other crimes associated with this criminality be pursued, regardless of the importance of the people involved and who might suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there is a changing perception of our role as a small island nation.  Our extensive coastline is exposed to drug trafficking. We need to ask what European resources could or should be deployed to improve surveillance along the coast.  I am reminded of a statement by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to the effect that the Loran C radio navigation system proposed for Ireland and a number of other European countries &mdash; it is very contentious in my county &mdash; would be of use in dealing with drug trafficking.  The former Minister was mistaken in that regard because the system merely serves to pinpoint locations for people who are on the high seas or land and can in no way be used for surveillance of these people.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have mentioned the strong case for addressing the causes of crime. There is reason to be disappointed and worried about the role of education, social services, housing, community policing and other related issues in preventing the growth of crime.  People will believe that politicians are serious about crime when they allocate resources to attack the social conditions which provide an environment conducive to crime, as well as dealing with the results of those conditions.  More often than not, these conditions produce victims of crime more than criminals.  They create a milieu in which criminals <Col N="1276" /> can survive, expand their operations and become more profitable.  Just as Europol will draw together the various countries and agencies in the EU, there must also be a concerted effort in the State to bring together the various arms of Government to formulate an effective long-term plan to address the root causes of many of these problems.</P>
    <P>The smuggling of illegal immigrants was mentioned. A case came to light in the south-east this week and there was a case in Devon, England last week in which a large number of people were involved.  Such activity has many negative effects and among the worst is that it undermines gravely the situation of genuine refugees who ought to be supported and helped by us in escaping the regimes in their own countries.  Many refugees are what might be termed &ldquo;economic refugees&rdquo; and present a problem which we must face, addressing the humanitarian and commonsense elements of the problem.  The problems presented to communities and at national level are considerable and must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The unavailability of Irish labour for certain low paid jobs entices employers to hire illegal immigrants.  They are prepared to work for less and, in some instances, it would appear that despite the number of people unemployed there is nobody available for particular jobs.  With imaginative proposals it should be possible to match the available jobs and some of our unemployed. Ultimately, the cheapest and most effective way to deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in employment in Ireland is by ensuring that available jobs are attractive and give sufficient remuneration to Irish people.  There is not another system or level of policing which can deal with foreigners being taken into the country illegally in sealed containers.  It is foolish to expect a police force to deal with such a traffic.</P>
    <P>The background to the legislation is the level of resources available to organised crime and the ability of criminals to purchase the legal expertise to exploit differences in legal systems to benefit from the recent easing of regulations at national boundaries, and to resort to murder and other tactics of intimidation.  Such activity sets them apart from ordinary people and makes them difficult to tackle.  One must wonder whether the various EU police forces are competent to carry out their roles under Europol in their own countries. There have been disturbing failures in relation to paedophile cases in Belgium in the past.</P>
    <P>The role of the liaison officers will be crucial to the success of the legislation and it is important that sufficient resources will be available to them, the national units under them and the various police forces in the member states.  Liaison with Interpol was mentioned and I presume that will take place at European rather than national level. I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to the various technical aspects raised, such as those related to the data protection legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> With regard to zero tolerance, we should consider whether there are stupid or archaic items of legislation on the Statute Book which create credibility difficulties for the Garda in their implementation.  There would be mixed views on whether the licensing laws, for example, create more trouble than they are worth or whether some traffic matters might best be dealt with by means other than Garda involvement.  Perhaps matters such as gun or dog licensing could be dealt with more effectively without the involvement of police time and resources.  We tend to forget that some items of the volume of legislation passed by this House over the years may impinge on Garda resources.  It might be useful to have an audit of such legislation with a view to freeing up Garda resources to deal with more important matters.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the Minister's commitment to future legislation to take concrete practical action to increase police numbers and prison spaces.  I wish him well in his tasks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and the general welcome given to the Bill.  This is the first occasion on which a Bill concerning a convention drawn up within the structures provided for in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union has been introduced in the Oireachtas.  I am pleased to be associated with the Bill since it marks a new, strengthened statutory approach to law enforcement co-operation between us and our EU partners.</P>
      <P>Today's criminal organisations do not confine their activities to one country and national measures are no longer sufficient on their own to stem the tide of illegal drug trafficking and other forms of pernicious organised crime.  A joint strategy at European level encompassing the exchange of tactical and strategic information on organised criminals is a crucial weapon in the fight against what I would describe as a modern-day scourge.</P>
      <P>The convention has its legal base in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union which establishes the framework for co-operation among the EU member states in the fields of justice and home affairs.  Article K.1 (9) of Title VI lists as one of the areas of common interest</P>
      <P>police co-operation for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs co-operation, in connection with the organisation of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under article K.3.2 the Council may draw up various instruments, not least conventions, which it shall recommend for adoption to the member states in accordance with their constitutional requirements.  I say &ldquo;not least&rdquo; because the various <Col N="1278" /> instruments capable of being drawn up under article K.3.2 conventions are by far the most legally binding on member states.  The same article states that such conventions may stipulate, as the Protocol to the Europol Convention stipulates, that the &ldquo;Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction to interpret their provisions and to rule on any disputes regarding their application&rdquo; thus ensuring uniform interpretation of their provisions.</P>
    <P>Early ratification of the convention by Ireland will send a clear signal to our EU partners of the importance we attach to co-operation in the fight against drugs and organised crime.  It is only fitting that the convention should be ratified by us without delay since successive European Councils have underlined the need to step up the fight against organised crime in this context and, as a practical step in so doing, have ordered the ratification of the convention at the earliest possible date.  In June this year the Amsterdam European Council stressed the key role played by Europol in the fight against organised crime and reiterated the priority it attached to ratification by member states of the convention and its Protocols before the end of 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.  There are no special procedures and there is no special unit in place to deal with inquiries from Independent Members of Dáil Éireann.  Three Independent Members of the Dáil who support the Government have requirements and needs from time to time.  A higher executive officer, attached to the Taoiseach's Office, has been designated as the liaison person for these three Deputies.  The officer also assists the Chief Whip in his dealings with all Independent Deputies in the Dáil as well as fulfilling <Col N="1279" /> other duties in the Taoiseach's Office.  There are no costs involved other than the salary of the officer concerned.</P>

He fulfils many other useful roles in the Whip's office which take up most of his time.  He liaises with other Independent Deputies also.  This is a system I used 15 years ago to good effect when I was Chief Whip for nine months.  If people supporting the Government at any level have issues they wish to raise, I know what is happening as the matter goes through one person.  That is the benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach justify the reason a civil servant has to look after three Independent Deputies who have stated in the House that they will support the Government on certain conditions?  This appears to be a selective exercise as certain individuals get special attention while others are left on their own.  What sort of requirements do individual Deputies have that need to be looked after by a higher executive officer?  If this person is also attached to the Whip's office, is he the official Whip for those three Deputies and will he be reprimanded if one of them does not turn up for a vote?  What is the purpose of his attachment to the Whip's office? Surely the Government Chief Whip has the job of looking after numbers necessary to keep the Government in power.  What sort of penalties will be imposed on this unfortunate civil servant if someone is late for a vote on the Order of Business? Will he be reprimanded by the Taoiseach or the Chief Whip?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met Prime Minister Juncker in Luxembourg on Friday 29 August.  The meeting was a very useful one in that it enabled me to have a full exchange of views on the current European agenda with the President in Office of the European Council.  During the meeting we discussed the Special European Council on Employment, the European Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals and the commitment of the member states of the Union to completing economic and monetary union on time.</P>
      <P>The Special European Council on Employment will be held on 20 and 21 November.  Prime Minister Juncker wrote to all Heads of State in July seeking their personal commitment to the success of the Summit and seeking examples of the best practices in member states for the creation of employment.  I replied to that letter on 1 August 1997 and at our meeting I assured the Prime Minister that Ireland will play a full role in ensuring the Special European Council is a success.  To prepare Ireland's input to the Council, an interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of an official of my Department has been established.</P>
      <P>At my meeting with Prime Minister Juncker I stressed the importance of identifying a number of concrete measures which could be recommended to member states for use in the fight against unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding my travel plans for the period to the end of this year, I will travel to Strasbourg on 9 <Col N="1285" /> October for the second Summit of the Council of Europe where I will address the Council the following day.</P>
    <P>I will attend the Special European Council meeting on Employment in Luxembourg and on the 12 and 13 December I will attend the European Council meeting, also in Luxembourg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach fail to raise the Government's concerns about the proposed abolition of duty free and the effect that would have on employment here with Prime Minister Juncker?  Does his failure to raise that cast some doubt on his ministerial colleague's public demonstrations on that matter in Brussels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the matter and discussed it with Prime Minister Juncker before and during that meeting.  The position on the issue, as outlined to me by Prime Minister Juncker, is that the decision must be reversed at Commission level.  There is strong support for an extension or a change in the position from the transport Ministers but the ECOFIN Ministers have not had the same enthusiasm over the past years.  I urged Prime Minister Juncker, in his position as Chairman of the Council, to attempt to move the issue forward.  The technical position, of which Deputy Bruton would be well aware, is that we would as a country attempt to receive support for this measure from the Commission.  That matter is being pursued and Deputy Bruton would also be aware that a KPMG study is ongoing into aspects of this issue.  I met officials in various Departments and across State agencies on this issue in July.  I intend to raise the issue further in the context of unemployment as there is a reasonable case to be made.  I am aware of the fiscal and tax harmonisation arguments against it but a reasonable case has been put forward by a number of countries on the benefits of duty free continuing into the 21st century.  In spite of the arguments made against it, the issue is worth pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach did not mention the duty free issue in his account of his meeting with Prime Minister Juncker, will he now indicate exactly what was the outcome of the discussions held with Prime Minister Juncker on the abolition of duty free?  What commitments, if any, did he obtain from Prime Minister Juncker on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not seek commitments; I sought to explain the case in terms of a conference on unemployment.  I have known Prime Minister Juncker for a long time and have served with him as a Labour and Finance Minister in my respective briefs over the past ten years.  I discussed a number of issues at the meeting and I believe Prime Minister Juncker has some support for the duty free issue.  However, the existing decision is a difficult one for ECOFIN Ministers to move away from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable lobby is being advanced by the <Col N="1286" /> transport Ministers and by a number of member states to the Commission.  I intend to avail of any opportunities I have to advance those arguments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that Prime Minister Juncker is also Chairman of ECOFIN as well as of the Council of Prime Ministers?  Since the Taoiseach met the Chairman of ECOFIN and failed to get any commitments from him on duty free, would it not be fair to say that very little progress was made at that meeting given that he is the man who has the opportunity to put this issue on the agenda of ECOFIN?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has the capacity to turn every positive into a negative.  At my meeting with Prime Minister Juncker I endeavoured to assist him in his efforts to have a successful employment conference.  As well as outlining all of the considerations in relation to the various employment schemes I believed he should consider, I also took the opportunity to suggest that we should look at the duty free issue.  Deputy Bruton is upset that his original tack that I failed to raise this issue has now been proved false.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty free issue was one of a number of issues in 1992 which was part of a very successful harmonisation package.  Like many other things, it is open to member states to attempt to pursue derogation or change as time passes.  That something was agreed many years ago does not mean one is committed to it forever. That is not the negotiating position I would adopt on these matters.  I assure Deputy Bruton that it was in the context of seeing if we could win support for this.  That support will not be won at ECOFIN alone because this matter is not within its remit.  This is a function of the Commission and it must be changed by the Commission.  I do not believe ECOFIN Ministers will be anxious to reverse this decision unless sufficient pressure is put on them.  That is what I intend to pursue at the meeting in Luxembourg in November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that if he had opposed the decision to abolish duty free facilities in 1992 we would be in a much stronger position now?  Will he inform the House that he will give full support to the Minister for Public <Col N="1287" /> Enterprise who is mounting a campaign at European level on this issue?  On the other issues contained in the questions, will the Taoiseach agree to establish a committee of the House on employment prior to the European summit on employment and will he involve the social partners in that?  Will he consider holding a domestic summit on employment in advance of the European summit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the committees of the House successfully dealt with the issue of unemployment.  I do not know whether any proposals came from those.  The configuration of the committees for the life of this Dáil is subject to debate.  I have an open mind in regard to certain changes and the replacing of some committees with others.  A number of suggestions have been put to me by former committee chairpersons which are currently being examined by the Whips.</P>
      <P>In regard to the 1992 position, that was part of the overall tax harmonisation.  We had a good opportunity last year, when we held the EU Presidency, to get some derogation to enable us move forward on this issue but it did not prove possible at the time.  I understand the reason for that but we must continue to pursue the matter, and that is what I intend to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of establishing a committee of the House with the involvement of the social partners, will the Taoiseach agree that would give a focus to the issue and strengthen his hand and those of the Ministers at European level on the issue of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any proposals or reports emanating from committees of the House are helpful.  The social partners, through their own structures, have an excellent mechanism in the NESF.  They have undertaken beneficial work on behalf of everybody in this House.  Members of this House form part of the NESF and the role they play within the NESF, as constructed in 1993, does not require amendment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled by the Taoiseach's strategy regarding the abolition of duty free concessions.  He wants a long-term derogation for those facilities but surely he should be trying to persuade the powers that be in this area. The abolition of duty free concessions would be a disaster for employment and by referring to derogation the Taoiseach is merely postponing the issue.  That will not have any effect on Ministers who totally object to the abolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey knows that when I raised this issue on a number of occasions in the House last year during Ireland's Presidency the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, tried to move the issue forward but he did not get any support.  We are now at the stage where the EU Transport <Col N="1288" /> Ministers are uniting to bring about a change.  We need to attack the issue on two other fronts &mdash; we must have change at Commission and ECOFIN levels.  As I already stated in reply to Deputy Bruton, it is unlikely that any change will come from ECOFIN in the short-term unless ministerial colleagues can keep up the pressure.  A campaign has been mounted both in this country and across the Community by those involved in duty free. There are probably those within the Commission who believe that campaign is too strong in terms of the amount of work being put into professional studies, preparing reports, etc.  A substantial number of people here are employed directly and indirectly in the duty free sector and it would be worthwhile to obtain some changes in the present policy.  I realise that will not be easy.</P>

      <P>A KPMG study is currently ongoing to identify the number of jobs and the amount of trade in this area.  Similar studies are ongoing in other countries.  While there is no direct commitment, a number of industries have expressed concern over several years that if they lose a substantial part of their business in duty free, which they have built up over many years, it will be impossible to replace.  Clearly there will be job losses if the present policy remains to the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach is probably aware, I had the pleasure of raising this matter at the Council of Transport Ministers when I dealt with marine transport matters in the final days of the previous Government.  I was surprised at the level of support forthcoming from other member states in relation to the retention of duty free facilities.  Will the Taoiseach agree that there is a need for a great deal of lobbying in this respect? The public do not seem to be aware of the effects this decision will have on transport, air and sea fare costs, for example.  Will the Taoiseach consider lobbying our MEPs in a concerted effort to raise this matter at European Parliament level? Will he also consider providing information to the public so that the power of the people could get the message across to those who are adamant that duty free facilities be abolished that it is not the will of the people of Europe?</P>

      <P>There is merit in what Deputy Barrett has said.  The campaign is ongoing.  Criticism of the Minister for Public Enterprise was expressed earlier in the debate for trying to do precisely that.  The Deputy is correct in that it seems as if the Transport Council is moving into a position of unity on the issue.  That is an <Col N="1289" /> important step.  I have already spoken to some MEPs and I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion in regard to talking to all of them.  I attended a conference recently in Galway of my party's group of MEPs, at which all the member states were represented, and I raised this issue.  I will certainly try to make available information to all our MEPs so they can assist in this campaign. Deputy Barrett is correct in regard to mounting a campaign to put pressure on the Commission because ultimately it is from there that change must come.</P>

It is very easy to see from Aer Rianta's accounts the percentage of profits accounted for by the duty free sector. One can imagine the effect the loss of this business would have on the company.  As an island nation the duty free sector is more important to us than to other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>On Friday last, 26 September, I signed the formal order establishing the new tribunal of inquiry consequent on the resolutions passed by this House and the Seanad.  Copies of the order have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  The new tribunal will be officially described as &mdash; Tribunal of Inquiry (Payments to Messrs.  C. J. Haughey and M. Lowry).  The order appoints Mr. Justice Michael Moriarty to be sole member of the tribunal and I would like to thank him for so willingly agreeing to accept this appointment.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the tribunal is independent in carrying out its task.  I understand, however, that the administrative work involved in the setting up of the tribunal is well advanced. This has been greatly assisted by the Government's decision that the administrative team which so capably assisted Mr. Justice McCracken in his work in the Dunnes payments tribunal should remain in place and serve the new tribunal. The fact that the new tribunal will use the same premises in Dublin Castle should also expedite its commencement.  All necessary resources will be provided to enable the tribunal to set about its inquiries and there will be no administrative impediment to it commencing its work.</P>
      <P>In relation to the newspaper report raised by Deputy Rabbitte the position is that I did receive a letter from the individual mentioned.  This was considered by me in the light of the facts as then known to me and in the light of the fact that the individual had not then and, as I understand it, has still not signed a statement of complaint for the Garda.  In these circumstances no action by me was warranted at that time.  In the meantime other matters have come into the public domain, particularly the letter from Mr. Michael Bailey of Bovale Developments to Mr. James Gogarty of Joseph Murphy Structural Engineering Ltd.  and the letter from Messrs.  Donnelly, Neary and</P>
      <P>Donnelly, solicitors, to which I referred earlier today in the House.  These matters give rise to concern as to the operation of the planning process in north County Dublin over a number of years.  It is for this reason that the Government has decided that a new tribunal will be established to investigate all matters relating to the parcels of land referred to in Mr. Bailey's letter and any related matters.  The terms of reference have been the subject of discussion between the Whips and the formal motion will be put down for debate when these discussions are completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in wishing Mr. Justice Moriarty well in the task he has undertaken.  Will the Taoiseach detail whether any additional expertise will be made available to the tribunal, specifically whether any accountancy expertise will be made available to it from a source that would not be conflicted in any way? Does he agree that it has been established over the past 48 hours that there is nothing preventing him reopening the Moriarty tribunal or availing of the mechanism that is there to have included a separate matter and that we have heard expert opinion over the past 24 hours to that effect?  I would be glad to know if the Taoiseach accepts that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of expert opinion or assistance, one of the considerations I had at the start, which was mentioned by a number of eminent legal people, was that it might have been better to have more than one member so that the issue of accountancy and other investigative matters could be looked at.  Following the debate here and having talked to a number of people I decided it was better to have a sole member and that whatever professional taxation or accountancy expertise is necessary should be made available to the inquiry.  I believe the tribunal will require such expertise.</P>
      <P>On the matters related to the tribunal and Mr. Justice Moriarty's role, I am advised that once the terms of reference and the order for a tribunal are set up, it cannot be amended.  It can be stood down and new terms of reference for a tribunal can be drawn up.  If that is done in this case, it would cancel the work we did here three weeks ago.  It is possible to draw up new terms of reference for a tribunal, but as I indicated yesterday I am of the view that it is better to deal with the matters concerning planning separately.  It should not take too long to deal with them, but it could take some time because of other matters that have been in the public domain for some time in regard to their being many other cases.  We have a letter from Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly which might focus on them when those gentlemen and Mr. Gogarty go before the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substance of Deputy Rabbitte's question related to what Mr. Jim Gogarty asked in the letter he sent to me, Deputies Bruton, Spring, De Rossa, Sargent, Joseph Higgins, Broughan and Mr. McDowell, SC.  He was appealing for the terms of reference to be extended to ensure that issues, such as the ones he outlined in the letter, should come within the remit of the tribunal.  At the time I did not see why that should happen because the gentleman concerned, who had been offered immunity and plenty of assistance by the previous Minister for Justice, was not prepared to sign a statement, but now I believe there is more substance to it because the solicitors, who have been involved in this case for some time, seem to indicate there are cases.  As I said yesterday and this morning, I have no knowledge as to whether there is any substance to these matters, but it is <Col N="1295" /> better that they should be dealt with comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The catch all terms will avoid complaints that matters have not been included in the terms of reference.  Deputy Bruton made the point about the position of a tribunal being definite.  In terms of people being involved in planning corruption, the tribunal will focus on that.  I hope there is no substance to these matters, but it is better to put them in a context in which they can be dealt with fully and it is best that is done in the way I outlined.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is important that every allegation in regard to planning involving every county and every political party is thoroughly investigated and will he accept my support for that proposition in every way possible?  Will he further agree that there is an urgency in regard to the allegation in respect of a payment of £30,000 to a serving Minister in the interests of the prosecution of Government business and that matter should be prioritised in any investigation?  In light of that will he agree that for it to be prioritised it must be identified? It is not possible to prioritise within the terms of reference something which has not been identified in them.  Will he agree that it is necessary, whether Deputy Burke is named or not, that the particular transaction concerning him, the payment of £30,000, be identified separately in the terms of reference of the tribunal so that it can be dealt with as a matter of priority in the interests of the functioning of Government?</P>

Those allegations must be comprehensively looked at.  As I stated on radio and in this House yesterday and today, I agree that the matters relevant to Mr. Burke must be dealt with quickly and upfront.  Some of the other matters might take more time to deal with. Deputy Bruton knows what I said this morning about naming somebody.  I do not believe that is fair, appropriate or the usual practice.  The Whips had discussions on the framing of this matter.  We considered it this morning.  I have not had much time, but I have had two separate meetings with the Attorney General to see if we can frame it in such a way that it is clear this issue must be given priority.  I would like it to be dealt with speedily. If we could work on this together I would be prepared to take suggestions.  While Deputy Bruton considers that section 5 is too open we need it to prevent others saying they have information.  If he has any particular proposals or drafts on that issue I would be glad to tie it down.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>the Government policy in relation to the licensing of community deflector rebroadcast television groups; whether the current study being carried out by the regulator into this issue is binding on the Government; and if she will set out the varying responsibilities between herself and the Director of Telecommunication Regulation in this matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The licensing of television deflector operators is a complex issue, as Deputies on the other side know from their deliberations.  The Government recognises the very strong community involvement in the deflector groups throughout the country and the desire of people in those areas to have access to the best possible service, taking account of the technical and economic realities of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislative position is that while I have a policy role in relation to the allocation and use of the radio frequency spectrum, the legal power to issue licences to television deflector operators pursuant to section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, was transferred, with effect from 30 June 1997, to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation appointed under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.  Accordingly it is a legal function of the director in the first instance to address the question of licensing such operators.  Any licensing regulations proposed by the director would be subject to my consent.  I understand also that the director has initiated a consultancy study in relation to this matter with a view to determining <Col N="1297" /> the appropriate course of action.  It would not be appropriate at this stage to speculate as to what the outcome of the study will be or what view the Government will take of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that policy in this area is the prerogative not of any regulator or consultant but of the Government and that if we are to have a dual licensing system for MMDS and for other rebroadcast systems that is entirely a matter for Government?  Surely those who are waiting for such a system to be put in place find the Minister is procrastinating and avoiding the issue.</P>

      <P>The previous Government, of which the Deputy was a Cabinet member, took an informal decision on 25 June &mdash; the day before it went out of office &mdash; and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications indicated that he had decided not to make these regulations. It was a matter for consideration as to how the decision might be announced.  That was one of the last decisions taken by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in stating that three months ago the Government, of which the Deputy was a member, was not able to come to a decision on this highly complex issue.  I put that in context.  That Government brought in the legislation, of which I thoroughly approve, which led to the setting up of the telecommunications regulator.  Ms Doyle came to see me on a courtesy call.  I would be keen to ensure the independence of the regulator should be observed at a distance. Clearly any decision the director will arrive at will be conveyed to me and on a broader policy matter the Government would look at it.  The issue is complex and is ongoing in the courts.  Therefore, my replies will be brief but to the point and containing information.  The regulator is independent. I and anybody else in my job would seek to ensure that independence was preserved.  Ms Doyle said she was undertaking a study which would include all advice &mdash; local, national and international.  I await the results of that study.</P>

I cannot say what the Deputy wishes me to say to his constituents and others.  I am aware of people's desires.  It is proper that they should get reception in an economic and easily accessible way.  I fully share those views in a community sense.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government shares the general concerns which have been expressed about the safety of the nuclear facilities at Sellafield.  We find the threat of a major accident from the facilities and the resulting potential for significant radioactive contamination to Ireland to be unacceptable. Every opportunity open to us continues to be pursued by the State to remove this threat, including the possibility of legal action.  However, the taking of an action against Sellafield by the <Col N="1299" /> State has been and remains a complex and difficult and legal matter.</P>
    <P>As to the County Louth residents' High Court action against BNFL, the Government yesterday took a decision on this matter.  The general terms of the decision are being communicated to the residents today.  I am in the process of making arrangements to follow up with detailed discussions on the Government's decision at a meeting with the residents at their earliest possible convenience.</P>
    <P>Apart from discussing with the residents the nature and terms of the support which will be available I will also explore with the residents how relevant Government Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland can help with expert advice relating to the research and investigations they wish to undertake in order to progress their case.  Such co-operation would be offered without in any way wishing to cut across their independent approach to this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first time I have been across the floor from the Minister and the Minister of State, I congratulate both on their appointments and wish them well.  By now they will have read their briefs and be aware of the work the previous administration did and the amount prepared and ready for the new Government to go ahead with.  The Minister's answer was very familiar. I recognised many of the terms, having used them myself.  I am glad the Government took the decision it did in the knowledge that during the term of office of the last Government Fianna Fáil was extremely strong in insisting that the Government should simply take over the case or fully fund the preparation of the case, but perhaps the Minister of State would give us some detail of the principles involved in yesterday's decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes.  I remind him and the House that these matters are the subject of legal proceedings in which the State is named as a co-defendant.  In view of this it is not considered appropriate to have a detailed discussion on the Government's decision in advance of a meeting on the matter with the plaintiffs.  I am anxious to have that meeting at the earliest possible date, tomorrow if possible.  I have indicated that to the residents and I am awaiting their pleasure to sit down and talk with them in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the answer I have received.  What I am asking is whether, given that the State is still a defendant in the case being taken by the Dundalk residents and that the previous Government was in a position to make moneys available, the Government has decided to make available moneys it previously demanded we make available to the Dundalk <Col N="1300" /> residents in this case?  Has that simple decision been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am reluctant to go into detail, I want to be helpful to the Deputy in his aspiration to elicit information.  I am aware of and recognise the primacy of this House, and I will convey to the residents very positive information in the course of days as to the moneys which will be forthcoming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding this dialogue with the residents' association, it has requested funding not only for legal costs.  To further its case, substantial research into health factors is necessary. Does the Government's decision address that? On the whole issue, what steps is the Minister with responsibility in this area taking to ensure the British Government as well as British Nuclear Fuels Limited will phase out all nuclear discharges into the marine environment at Sellafield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of research and assistance towards research is being fully and directly addressed in our proposals to the residents and I will call on appropriate Government Departments to assist in that research and to give advice with the full intention of being ultra helpful to this County Louth group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is ongoing.  I compliment the previous incumbent of the position I occupy today for his ongoing steps with regard to the matter Deputy Yates has raised.  There has been no letup in the ongoing battle to ensure the safety of the people of this State in terms of the threat from Sellafield.  We are continuing with international conventions, and I have requested a meeting with the UK Environment Minister and received a reply from him just 24 hours ago.  I expect to restate our serious concern and aversion to many aspects of what is happening at Sellafield.  That policy will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on getting positive action in a very short time in office.  Could he inform the House whether the solicitors or spokespersons for the Dundalk residents have now agreed to withdraw the Irish Government as a defendant in the case, given the positive nature of the decision he will convey to them?  Will he re-institute the ministerial committee on Sellafield and the expert group who were most helpful to me during the term of office of the last Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been intensely involved in this issue.  I realise there was a sub-committee <Col N="1301" /> in situ prior to the formation of the present Government.  However, this issue has been discussed on three occasions in the past seven or eight weeks by the Government, which is an indication of how seriously the Government is treating the matter.  I have been given and relish the task of spearheading this case with the full backing and support of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the residents agreed to withdraw the State as a defendant, given the generosity of the decision that has been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter I will discuss with them days, rather than weeks, hence.  The Government is in a rather invidious position in readily and willingly funding this case while simultaneously being in the position of defendant. That is something that will be high on the agenda of discussion at our forthcoming meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The differences in the responsibilities between the old Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the new Department of Public Enterprise are that the natural resources elements of the former Department of Transport, Energy and Communications namely the exploration and mining and petroleum affairs divisions have been transferred to the Department of Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>The reason behind the title and concept of the Department of Public Enterprise is that the former Department of Transport, Energy and Communications had become <i>de facto</i> responsible for most of the larger commercial semi-State companies and for much of the State's involvement in the economy.  It was decided to recognise this explicitly by renaming the Department and establishing it as the Department of Public Enterprise, thus underlining the Governments commitment, as contained in our document, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to have &ldquo;growing, vigorous, healthy companies, serving the public well and giving high quality employment at home and abroad, regardless of any evolution in structure&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>May I take it that all of the functions <i>vis-à-vis</i> overseeing competition in the road transport and haulage sector, for example between Bus Éireann and private bus operators, still reside with the Department?  The Minister has responsibility for ensuring there is a level playing field and fair competition, an onerous and important responsibility separate from public <Col N="1302" /> enterprise.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the development of public enterprise.  We have made it clear that employee shareholding in State companies may be a conduit for raising capital for the further development of the commercial State sector.  In the case of Telecom Éireann, the Government is committed to the conclusion of an employee share ownership plan in the spirit of social partnership and consensus.</P>
      <P>I recently met representatives of KPN-Telia &mdash; the State's strategic partner in Telecom Éireann &mdash; the company and the unions with a view to determining a framework within which the negotiations on an employee shareholding scheme can be restarted.  This framework is now almost in place and I look forward to the recommencement of negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on an acceptable deal within the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details of any scheme are a matter for negotiation between the parties.  From the outset of the strategic alliance process, a shareholding of <Col N="1303" /> up to 5 per cent was earmarked for the employees of Telecom Éireann in return for verified cost reductions and change within the company.</P>
    <P>The Government, in response to the union's proposals to maximise employee shareholding, is open to practical and feasible proposals by the staff to purchase for cash payment to the Exchequer at a fair price shares in excess of 5 per cent when it is satisfied that this will assist the future development of the company and that the conditions relating to the initial 5 per cent are satisfactory.  Any transfer of shares beyond 5 per cent can only be considered with the agreement of the strategic partner.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the share purchase scheme to other State companies will be dealt with on a case by case basis because each company is at a different stage of development and may require a specifically tailored solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The precise figure is 9.9 per cent, they already have 5 per cent.  The Minister is now saying that it is a matter for negotiation and that they will be given shares in excess of 5 per cent. By how much and at what price?  When is it proposed to conclude the negotiations?  During the general election the Minister's party leader wrote to the union concerned &mdash; I have a copy of the letter &mdash; and made a specific commitment.  We would like to know what all of this means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Having met the representatives of Telecom Éireann, I am convinced I can do business with them.  I have met representatives of the unions twice.  I met the outgoing and incoming secretary in July, two weeks after taking office.  With the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and officials of my Department, I met the programme managers and we agreed in principle to the sale of 14.9 per cent of the shares at a fair price.  We have no ideological difficulty with that concept.  I then met the chairman and chief executive and the strategic partner to discuss the matter.  Two weeks ago I had a meeting with Con Scanlon and his adviser, David Grafton, and reached agreement on certain principles.  We also agreed a framework on how we should proceed to negotiations. I am convinced that the Government and I can do satisfactory business with the representatives of the employees in Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

As I understand it, the Minister has agreed to dispose of 14.9 per cent of the shares in Telecom Éireann <Col N="1304" /> in this manner.  As regards the union offer, what is considered to be a fair price?  Is the Minister saying that she has the agreement of the strategic partner to this arrangement whereby the shareholding will rise from 5 per cent to 14.9 per cent? Have the chairman and chief executive of the board of Telecom Éireann communicated assent to what she calls the share ownership plan?</P>

Telecom Éireann, the unions and ourselves will engage separately in an evaluation exercise.  We have arranged a date with the unions.  Their New York advisers will come here to make a presentation to me and my officials, and I presume to Telecom separately, on how they see their bid developing.  I await that.  We are engaged in a process which I hope will lead to agreement.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree the position she is putting forward now is at variance with the position of her party in Opposition when it said that 14.9 per cent of the shares should be made available to the workers free gratis and for nothing?  That was the position put forward by Deputy Séamus Brennan who is now Government Chief Whip.  There was no question of market value being demanded from the work force in Telecom Éireann at that time, although the Minister would seem to be doing that now.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister examined the implications of the decision she outlined to us in principle concerning the membership of the board of Telecom Éireann?  Will the workers' representatives positions be increased?  Will the people who will now have 14.9 per cent of the shares in the company receive additional representation?  What are the implications of that for the strategic partner and for the main shareholder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question the Deputy asked concerned the position as adopted on the floor of the House.  Those matters are on the public record.  The words in the letter, referred to earlier by Deputy Rabbitte, in the name of the then Leader of the Progressive Democrats and current Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the then Leader of the Opposition and now Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, were &ldquo;at a fair price&rdquo; of 14.9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Stagg asked what implications it would have for the worker directors on the board of Telecom and whether there would be an expansion. The Deputy will remember that when the <Col N="1305" /> legislation was being discussed, he and I had a barney because I did not agree with there being two directors and two alternate directors, which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy directly, I have met and talked to the unions about the elections for worker directors that are now going on.  We teased out a legislative point with regard to the interpretation of the Bill in that debate following the Deputy's comments on the Bill in the House, which I thought were helpful.  The further implications for the worker directors would fall to be discussed at the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that during these negotiations the Minister will stick to the principle she enunciated here, that the question of a workers shareholding, of the kind she is talking about, is to be seen as a conduit for raising capital for the company and that the shares will be made available for &ldquo;cash payment to the Exchequer at a fair price&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister see a workers shareholding of this kind as a means of promoting individual incentivisation for workers in Telecom?  Is the Minister worried that &mdash; if on the valuation date of the company, which is just over two years away, there is a workers' shareholding of 14.9 per cent &mdash; the strategic partners will exercise their option to take a further 10 per cent?  One of the methods of carrying out an evaluation of the company, which is an initial public offering, will effectively be ruled out unless at that stage the Government decides it will become a minority shareholder in Telecom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions the Deputy has put to me &mdash; with the exception of that referring to individual incentivisation, to which I will return &mdash; will all arise in the detailed negotiations. I have studied these questions and understand that what the future can hold will depend on the actions we take in the next few months.  I have pondered and reflected upon all the points that have been put to me.  They will clearly form a strong case in our minds when we discuss them.  It is for the negotiations to decide how we can address them now and in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It means I am entering the negotiations with an open mind as to what the employees want, which the Deputy, regretfully, was unable to do.  I have the agreement of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste as per their letter which says &ldquo;at a fair price&rdquo;.  The detail now commences as to how we realise that.  I intend to work on it fully, every step of the way.  However, it would be extremely foolhardy for me to <Col N="1306" /> announce today what will be the result of perhaps three months of intense negotiations.</P>

      <P>We are going into intensive negotiations.  I note that the then partners in Government with the Deputy's party, Deputy de Rossa and Deputy Spring, made great efforts during his trip to Tralee to try to get him to change his mind on his figure of 5 per cent, but he stuck to his guns.  The Deputy is full of principle, but look where it got him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me about individual incentivisation.  If he means that incentives are to be seen as motivating goodwill towards the company and that employees work hard within their company because they get something out of it then, yes, I would regard that as individual incentivisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that in the Minister's formal reply, as distinct from her reply to supplementaries, she said she was prepared to dispose of shares in excess of 5 per cent when it is considered to be in the interests of the company. That, obviously, is the position of the Secretary of the Department.  Can I clarify whether that is what we are talking about?  In other words, as regards the question Deputy Dukes put to the Minister about the valuation date in terms of the right of the partner to opt for 35 per cent of the stakeholding, is that when the Minister will decide to dispose of these shares, however many there are, in excess of 5 per cent?  Or is it before Christmas or when the discussions end?  It is an important question from the viewpoint of the workers, who have been led to believe this will be in their Christmas stockings.</P>
      <P>Can I hear the Minister's philosophical approach to the extension of these kind of share ownership schemes to other companies in the semi-State sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back to the first question and the Christmas stockings, I will proceed with the teams engaged in the negotiations in a studied way.  Our next involvement is in two weeks time when the advisers to Telecom workers will make their case to me.  At this point it would be inappropriate for me to go into what <Col N="1307" /> deliberations I have in mind, but which I have not yet talked through with other people.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to 14.9 per cent &ldquo;at a fair price&rdquo; and that wording is under the names of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and myself.</P>
      <P>With regard to other State companies, of course, there is interest in this.  There is bound to be.  I replied to this point earlier, but that may have been obscured by the previous supplementary questions.  Each State company will demand a different response because they are at different stages of development.  Some have strategic partners, while others do not.  Employee ownership in any semi-State company will be tailored to the specific needs and demands of that company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the rapid progress she has made and I support the line she is adopting.  However, she must ensure that worker directors continue to be workers only and that outside experts are not allowed in under the guise of worker directors.  Staff directors who hold 14.9 per cent of shares should be workers and not agents hired on behalf of workers.  Perhaps the Minister could reassure us that worker directors will always be workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Government provided £51 million to Bord na Móna.  A total of £100 million equity has now been injected into Bord na Móna.  The effect of this financial support from the State is that Bord na Móna has now been placed on a sound financial footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted my colleague is handling this brief because it is in safe hands. Bord na Móna, which suffered 2,500 job losses, means a lot to us in the midlands.</P>
      <P>An earlier proposal suggested that the overall equity would be £110 million.  I appreciate that legislation is required to establish Bord na Móna as a public limited company.  How soon will that legislation be introduced and will it be utilised to amend the cap on the equity to Bord na Móna, which was set at £100 million, so that it receives an extra £9 million or £10 million?  An injection of such equity would mean cheaper fuel for the ESB and it would be important for Bord na Móna.  Is the Minister aware of any plans to introduce the legislation to establish Bord na Móna as a public limited company and, if so, will she ensure that the extra £9 million or £10 million is forthcoming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, last December the commission gave its formal decision as to whether it breached State aids and immediately afterwards the first injection of equity, £49 million, was made.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who also comes from <Col N="1309" /> bog country, decided to make the tranche of £51 million available in September rather than December.  Some £100 million is the maximum that can be paid under the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>I hope the turf development Bill, which is important for Bord na Móna, will be laid before the House during this session.  When I visited Bord na Móna in County Kildare I was struck by the way the board directly reflects the interests which are of great help to it and by the assiduous way the chief executive officer, the chairman and the members of the board attend to their duties after their recent difficult times.  I was glad we were able to make progress on this matter.  The Deputy asked if I will include a provision in the Bill to allow for the payment of the remaining £10 million.  I expect that £10 million will be considered next year but I will see if it can be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>While this equity will put them on a safe financial footing, it will also pose huge challenges for them.  The chairman correctly indicated that two months ago when he published last year's reports. Bord na Móna must be more competitive.  The fact it no longer faces debts will be a great relief but there will be ongoing challenges.  However, I have no doubt it will face them and make good decisions.  I wish it good luck and I will keep a partisan eye on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who comes from the heart of the bog, I welcome the Minister's decision to top up the payment already made. Given that the ESB will be getting cheaper turf for its coal burning stations and the State has agreed to refurbish some midland stations and has removed the crippling debts faced by Bord na Móna through its investment, will it be able to reduce the price of electricity to the consumer? The good morale in Bord na Móna is evident since the removal of that debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that from constituents and others.  The savings accruing to the ESB as a result of this reduction must be seen in the context of the overall cost savings which the ESB is achieving under the cost and competitiveness review.  It is my policy to ensure that the savings achieved by the ESB should be shared by the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the turf development Bill will necessitate restructuring in Bord na Móna.  When the Minister visited the headquarters of that company in Newbridge, did she cast her eye over the peat moss division?  Is she aware that the financial performance of that division is worrying if not difficult, and how does she propose to remedy the matter?  What are the Minister's views on this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was made aware of this problem, studied the relevant data and spoke to the chairman and members of the board about it.  The <Col N="1310" /> forthcoming turf development Bill will lay out a general strategy under subheadings for the four &ldquo;companies&rdquo; within Bord na Móna, which the board will then tackle.  I have no doubt that the board is already attempting to do so with great vigour.  I am struck by the inventiveness and ingenuity of the board in the way it is endeavouring to develop new ideas and make them profitable and viable.  The forthcoming Bill will address the Deputy's concerns.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 47 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>One of the key priorities for the energy sector in the programme for Government, an action programme for the millennium, is to extend natural gas as far as practicable to major towns and cities.  I am fully committed to this policy objective.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis has informed me that the following towns, which currently do not have a natural gas distribution system, are included in the board's present study for the extension of a natural gas supply to them, possibly in 1998: Kinsale, Bandon, Fermoy, Carrick-on-Suir, Navan, Portlaoise, Athy, Ballina/Killaloe and, in north County Wicklow, Kilcoole/Newtownmountkennedy.  Surveys of the load potential for the residential and commercial markets are ongoing for these towns. Should sufficient loads be identified for each extension of the gas network to be economically viable, the project will be included in the Bord Gais programme.  Some other towns may be included in the programme should the extensions to them be identified as economically viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, no dates for the commencement of pipeline construction works on these possible extensions have been scheduled.  In the case of potentially viable extensions, construction would only commence following firm commitments from key loads.  Bord Gais Éireann is also currently arranging gas supplies to the following towns: Mitchelstown, Mallow, Cobh, Annacotty, <Col N="1311" /> Ashbourne, Bettystown, Clane, Kildare, Dunshaughlin and Ratoath.</P>
    <P>On the initiative of the former Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, a proposal for a major extension of the natural gas network to the midlands and west to provide gas to Trim, Mullingar, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Galway, Ennis and Shannon to be supported by Exchequer funding was submitted to Government.  The then Government decided that further inquiries should be made in respect of the EU State aids aspect of the proposal before proceeding further with the project.  Deputy Stagg wrote to the EU Commissioner for Competition in mid-May seeking clearance on the State aid issue.  The Commissioner has since replied requesting that this notification be formalised under Article 93.3 of the EU Treaties.  Having reviewed and updated with Bord Gais the assumptions underlying the proposal, I arranged for the formal notification to be submitted to the European Commission's Competition Directorate on 24 September to allow the Commission to make a full assessment of the proposal and take a formal decision.</P>

Will the Government be giving a full commitment to ensure that this project will be brought on stream as quickly as possible by seeking EU approval for State aid?  Does the Minister envisage that contracts for work in the towns along the route will be put out to tender in the near future?  Athlone, Moate, Mullingar and Ballinasloe would benefit considerably from a residential, industrial and economic viewpoint if the trunk line were laid from Dublin to Galway and south to Limerick.

The Minister will agree that this issue <Col N="1312" /> concerns rural areas obtaining the infrastructure to allow them to develop in the same way as urban areas.  The midlands and the west have suffered in that regard and this project would correct that problem.

      <P>Like Deputy Stagg I am aware of the Minister's interest in this matter.  I would be glad if she could confirm that she is supportive of the effort to extend the pipeline to west County Cork.  The Minister referred to the towns of Kinsale and Bandon, which form the nucleus of the proposal for west County Cork, and I take it she is aware that the proposed pipeline extends as far as the Carberry factory in Ballineen?  The proposal will involve the erection of power plants by two major industries in the area which will involve selling surplus electricity to the ESB.  I hope the Minister will be supportive of efforts to ensure that the surplus can be sold to the ESB at a reasonable price and not at the rock bottom avoidance price which the board tends to offer in such cases.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the domestic front, this Government is taking tough measures to deal with the fight against serious crime in line with the policies set out in our action programme for the millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and my Department are engaged in ongoing consultation with the Garda Commissioner and other interests so that the Government's action programme is realised as quickly as possible.  This will involve a combination of action on the ground and new legislation.  The recently published crime figures show an increasingly effective and efficient force.  The figures for the past year show a drop of two per cent in the number of <Col N="1314" /> indictable offences reported, a continuing fall in the level of armed crimes and an increase in the detection rate.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that tough new legislative measures, in particular the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I instigated last year and the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, as well as the work of the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Garda Bureau for Fraud Investigation, have collectively contributed to the first reduction in the crime level in seven years.  The fight against serious crime is a relentless one, on which this Government has no intention of letting up.  We will ensure that resources are employed in the optimum way in the Garda Síochána to enable the successful implementation of the strategies in the action programme.  We will not hold back in the allocation of necessary resources.</P>
    <P>The House may be aware that earlier this month I formally inaugurated the Garda Air Support Unit.  The establishment of that unit marked the achievement of a tactical objective for the force in meeting head on the challenge of organised and other criminals.  The unit has been equipped with the latest flying aids, a twin-engine helicopter and a fixed wing aircraft, at a cost of £5.5 million, to assist it in implementing strategies to combat organised criminal gangs, drug trafficking and other serious crime incidents which require an immediate airborne response.</P>
    <P>This Government will provide an additional 1,000 prison places in accordance with our action programme so that persons convicted by our courts can at last be expected to serve out their sentences.  Last month I obtained Government approval for the construction of a new 400 place prison in Portlaoise.  My Department has now received submissions from the private sector for a design, building and finance package for the new prison.  The involvement of the private sector in the planning, construction and financing of this facility is a welcome innovation which this Government believes will guarantee that the taxpayer gets the best possible value for money.  I am confident the new prison can be completed within the two year target for the provision of 1,000 extra prison places.</P>
    <P>In addition, work is continuing to proceed as quickly as possible on existing prison building projects &mdash; 55 places at Limerick Prison D block, 137 places at Castlereagh main prison, 400 at the new remand prison at Clover Hill, Wheatfield and 64 places at the new women's prison at Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael spokesperson on justice, equality and law reform, Deputy Jim Higgins, mentioned that a number of community workers could be employed for the cost of keeping a person in prison.  Does the Deputy mean we should not provide the proposed prison places?  I am determined we do not have a revolving door system of justice.  Where people are prosecuted and convicted of crimes under our criminal justice system it is the duty of the Government to provide places to ensure they will serve their sentences. <Col N="1315" /> The provision of additional prison places is a practical example of the operation of the concept of zero tolerance.  It cannot be denied that a criminal justice system which does not ensure that people serve the sentences handed down by the courts is fundamentally flawed.</P>
    <P>On the high operating costs of the prison service as mentioned by the Deputy, on 11 September last, I published the report of the prison service operating cost group.  This effectively acknowledges there are no quick fix measures which can be implemented immediately to reduce costs in the prison service.  It points the way towards achieving this objective by a process of strategic change based on consultation.  The value of the report is that it sets out an agreed analysis of what has become an intractable problem and proposes a logical strategy for addressing it.  I am committed to implementing the report in tandem with the restructuring of the prison service as an independent agency, as recommended by the report of the expert group towards an independent prisons agency, which was published last February.</P>
    <P>Towards this end I will be bringing proposals to Government shortly in regard to the setting up of the teams which are recommended by the report.  I am of course strongly of the view that we must have a multifaceted approach to crime, addressing both the causes of it and the ways of tackling it.  In short, and I do not wish to use a cliché, we must be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime and that is the intention of this Government.</P>
    <P>As a corollary to our prison building programme, I am considering a number of initiatives for the greater use of alternatives to custody in cases where this is appropriate, again with a view to ensuring that taxpayers' money is not wasted. The introduction of legislation for the attachment of earnings in cases of non-payment of fines and debts and the expansion of the community service scheme are just two such initiatives which I stressed in Opposition and which I am now ensuring are receiving active examination.</P>
    <P>Crime of course has great topicality.  There is no shortage of ideas or views on how best to tackle the crime problem.  The ordinary law abiding citizen has as much right to present his or her views on the subject as anybody else.  That is why I announced last week that I had decided to set up a crime forum as soon as possible.  The forum will facilitate an open and public debate involving all sectors of society on the reality of crime, its causes and remedies.  The intention is not that it will be a talking shop or that it will produce a report or paper which will gather dust.  The intention is that the forum will assist the community in contributing to the formation of crime policy and the establishment of a permanent community-based crime council.  Its deliberations will also be taken into account in the drafting of a White Paper on crime which I intend to publish next year.  We have had major Green and White Papers <Col N="1316" /> on various aspects of national policy and the time has surely arrived when we should have a White Paper on crime.</P>
    <P>I want to deal specifically with some of the points raised by Deputies during this debate. Deputy Higgins referred to the broad discretionary language in section 3 and suggested that the Bill should stipulate that there should always be both police and customs personnel in the national unit.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that the national unit should contain personnel from both of these services.  However, similar legislation, notably the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, also used the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in relation to the appointment of personnel from these services to the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I will come back to this on Committee Stage, where I note that Deputy Higgins intends to raise the matter again.</P>
    <P>The importance of interagency co-operation was also stressed by Deputy Shortall.  I agree fully that such co-operation is essential in tackling crime.  If we are to win the battle against ruthless criminals, services need to co-operate with each other and share information and intelligence, both at national and EU levels.  The ratification of the Europol Convention will be an important step in such co-operation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shortall, Gregory, Hanafin and Deasy paid tribute to the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau and I would join with them in their remarks.  I cannot agree with Deputy Shortall, however, when she says that the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, and not the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, is the key to winning the fight against the drug barons.  Without the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I had the privilege of introducing in this House on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party last year when in Opposition, the Criminal Assets Bureau would be completely redundant since the focus of the bureau's work is ultimately the freezing of assets which are of course the proceeds of crime.  It is essential that the work of bodies such as the Criminal Assets Bureau is not hampered in any way for the lack of appropriate legislation.  I am determined that in addition to the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, they will also have a criminal justice Bill so that the fight against organised crime is further enhanced.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus asked that I comment on the fact that child abduction is not listed as one of the crimes which will be within Europol's remit. Europol is being set up to deal with certain forms of international organised crime involving two or more EU member states.  One of the crimes with which Europol will deal from the outset will be trade in human beings.  This includes trade in children for prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation.  Events last year in Belgium bring home to us the horror of these types of crimes and the necessity of harnessing resources at EU level to combat them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, when referring to child abduction, may also have in mind cases where one parent abducts a child from the custody of the other, <Col N="1317" /> what are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;tug of love&rdquo; cases.  Generally these crimes do not involve international criminal organisations and often involve only the parents concerned.  This type of child abduction will not come within Europol's remit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall interestingly said that I seemed to think that the drugs problem can be solved by legislation and extra prison places.  Of course this is by no means the case.  I am fully cognisant of the essential and valuable work which is being done by State agencies to curb the demand for drugs and in particular by local communities in their areas.  As Deputy Haughey has mentioned, I have seen what these communities are doing.  What these communities want as a priority is to prevent their areas from being flooded with illegal drugs.  Measures such as the ratification of the Europol Convention and the enactment of legislation such as the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, and the criminal justice Bill will help to cut off the flow of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins asked that any necessary staff required for the Data Protection Commissioner's office as a result of this Bill be made available. The staffing of that office is of course subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance but I can assure Deputy Higgins that if, following the entry into force of the convention, extra resources are required in that office, I will do what I can to ensure that they are made available.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus expressed concern that the inclusion of illegal immigrant smuggling in Europol's remit could include immigrants who might attempt to bring their relatives into the European Union.  As I have already mentioned in connection with child abduction, Europol will be concerned with international organised crime involving two or more EU member states.  Its focus in connection with immigration will be clandestine networks.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus also referred to an apparent conflict between the Data Protection Act, 1988, and the convention in that, whereas the 1988 Act stipulates a 40 day time limit for data controllers to respond to individuals' requests to exercise their right of access, article 19 of the convention requires Europol to deal with such requests within three months.  I would point out to the Deputy that it is for the purpose of dealing with matters such as this that section 6 states that the Data Protection Act, 1988, shall apply and have effect with any necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus also criticised the lack of accountability to the European Parliament in the context of drawing up the convention and suggested that Europol should submit a report to the parliament.  I draw the Deputy's attention to Article 34 of the convention which obliges the council presidency to forward a special report each year to the European Parliament on the work of Europol.  In addition, Article 34 requires the European Parliament to be consulted in the event that the convention be amended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> Deputy Haughey paid tribute to the members of the Garda Síochána currently serving in the EDU in the Hague and spoke of the high esteem in which they are held.  I take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the work they are doing and the work of the EDU national unit personnel in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate the concept of zero tolerance was unsurprisingly revisited by Deputies Higgins, Shortall and McManus.  I have explained the concept more than adequately on more than one occasion.  However, unsurprisingly, politicians continue to misrepresent and misunderstand its meaning.  It appears there has been a conscious decision by some that political gamesmanship should be engaged in with regard to the meaning of zero tolerance in connection with the laws to which it applies and to those which are exempt.</P>
    <P>Zero tolerance means the enforcement of the laws of the land.  The attempts to trivialise it and to make it mean something which it does not, brings no credit to those who criticise the concept. Our citizens want the Government to take effective action to tackle the crime problem and that is what they will get.</P>
    <P>The prison spaces to accommodate those involved in organised crime, drug dealing, syringe attacks and despicable attacks on the elderly will be provided by the Government.  The laws of the land will be changed where necessary.  In that context the fine-combing of criminal law legislation is continuing and will continue until such time as it is considered that the laws are adequate to meet the threat which society faces today.</P>
    <P>In a few weeks' time it is my intention to introduce to the House a change I repeatedly advocated from the Opposition benches when I proposed that it was time to provide for a minimum jail sentence of ten years without temporary release for any person caught in possession of drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more with a view to supply.  In addition, when these people are released from prison they will not be able to jump on board ocean-going yachts to enjoy the spoils of their evil trade.  They will have no yachts or villas in the Mediterranean because the law I intend to introduce will also provide that the courts may order an inquiry into their assets.  The message is simple: if a person engages in this pernicious trade and is caught then he will be stripped of his freedom and of his assets.  That is what zero tolerance means in the context of drug dealing.  It is difficult to listen to criticism of the concept from those on the Opposition benches who, on three occasions, voted down the proposal in this House.</P>
    <P>As I repeatedly stated, zero tolerance amounts to effective law enforcement.  It is not, and never was, about changing the sanctions which should apply to beggars, buskers, those parked on double yellow lines or errant cyclists.  Rather, it is about enforcing the law of the land.  Where additional sanctions and laws are required, they will be formulated, presented and enforced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> The trivialisation of zero tolerance during the general election campaign by what I then described as the &ldquo;Mars Bar Brigade&rdquo;&mdash; those who advocated during the bail referendum that a person would be refused bail for stealing a Mars Bar &mdash; is something I have criticised in the past. Do these people want the public to believe the emergency response unit, the drugs squad or the Garda air support unit should be deployed on a Saturday afternoon in Grafton Street so that, in a massive show of force, an errant or out of tune busker is arrested, charged and detained?  Everybody knows that is nonsense.</P>
    <P>I want to nail the misconception that laws enacted to deal with a serious, pernicious and dangerous drug problem represent the be-all and end-all of the concept of zero tolerance.  I have said repeatedly that the people who suffer from burglaries, robberies and larcenies do not regard these as trivial crimes.  I aim to have those crimes investigated and, where possible detected and prosecuted.</P>
    <P>For as long as this Government is in office the Garda will be given the requisite manpower, resources and criminal law to enable them provide the community with effective law enforcement. Moreover, the ultimate sanction of a jail sentence to be served in full will be restored as an essential underpinning of the criminal justice system.  Surely that is zero tolerance?</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution Deputy Jim Higgins referred to the document on crime published by my predecessor in May last and quoted from what I had to say about it.  The Deputy knows that while I described the initiative as worthwhile, I also described it as an election selection box because that is what it was.  The ink was hardly dry on election posters when this document appeared, which was the reason I described it as I did.  I could have relegated the document to the bin when I arrived in the Department of Justice, rewritten it and presented a new one but that would have been to engage in petty politicking which no doubt would have been accompanied by a fanfare of publicity to the effect that I was more concerned with the trappings than the substance of my portfolio.  That is not the case.  I shall not go down that road now or in the future.  I assure the House that I will not engage in gesture politics, pretending old wine is new merely because it is contained in a new casket. On the issue of crime the electorate want action and that is precisely what they will get.</P>
    <P>Throughout the summer months I and my officials worked extremely hard formulating the kinds of measures and legislation which I and my Cabinet colleagues believe to be crucial at this time.  As I indicated on a number of occasions in recent weeks, there is now in place a clear plan of action which will be implemented, in marked contrast to the <i>ad hoc</i>, piecemeal, sticking plaster approach, the unfortunate hallmark of the previous administration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> Deputy Shortall proclaimed that zero tolerance was nothing more than a convenient election slogan, that it was dead and, that it was very difficult to take my remarks on this issue seriously.  I suggest to Deputy Shortall and her party that it is very difficult to take her or her party seriously on the issue of crime.</P>
    <P>I said earlier in this debate it was of fundamental importance that prison places be available to incarcerate those found guilty of serious crime deemed by the courts to warrant a prison sentence. I remind the House that, in the absence of the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, the Labour Party cancelled the prison building programme put in place by the previous Fianna Fáilled administration, with the consequence that even today we lack the requisite number of prison places.</P>
    <P>The referendum on bail was the subject matter of Cabinet guerrilla warfare within the rainbow Coalition Government.  They were frog-marched in a wave of public indignation onto the gangplank which led ultimately to the constitutional referendum passed overwhelmingly by the electorate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when Deputy Shortall and the Labour Party contend that zero tolerance is dead, following on the initiatives brought forward by my party in Opposition, and those now proposed by the present Government I am entitled to say that tolerance of crime is dead.  This will be made manifestly clear in coming years.  In the final analysis, when Deputy Shortall and others argue against the concept of zero tolerance &mdash; having looked into their own hearts in relation to their performance &mdash; they should then inform me or the public what level of crime is acceptable or tolerable and which laws now on the Statute Book should be repealed.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government supports the principles of this Bill and, because of the significance of its provisions concerning the welfare of children, it was the decision of the Government it should be brought before the House without delay.  It will be necessary to make some amendments and I will address these matters on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The position of children under our law is of special importance and our constitutional and statutory provisions and administrative policies reflect that.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which the Bill amends, provides that any court, in deciding questions relating to children, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  The law concerning children has been updated and developed on a systematic basis in recent years and we have a body of law comparable with the best in other countries. Important provisions regarding children have been provided for in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1991, and the Child Care Act, 1991.  The 1992 White Paper on Marriage Breakdown, prepared in the Department of Justice, reviewed the law concerning children and the family and made important recommendations for change.  The Domestic Violence Act, 1996, strengthens provision for the protection of children enshrined in legislation of 1981, and the Family Law Act, 1995, and Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996 give powers to the court to make financial, property and pension orders for the benefit of children.</P>
      <P>There has been a wealth of reform in our family laws in the past decade under various Governments. These reforms have meant that many fundamental issues relating to children and the family are now being addressed in one form or another.  The Bill is a continuation of those reforms.  It is about children, especially their welfare. It is a child-centred measure in keeping with commitments given in the Government's <i>Action Programme for the Millennium</i> relating to the support of parents and their children and to a review of the operation of the courts system to further protect children.  The Government has shown its political commitment towards children with the appointment to the new Department of Health and Children of a Minister of State with special responsibility for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objects of the Bill are to update the law on guardianship, custody and access by: allowing a father who has not married the mother of his child to be appointed guardian by agreement with the mother without the need to go to <Col N="1322" /> court as at present; obliging the court, where appropriate, in proceedings concerning custody or upbringing of a child to give consideration to the child's wishes; making it clear that in appropriate cases custody of a child may be granted by the court to a father and mother jointly and allowing certain relatives of a child to apply for access to the child.</P>
    <P>It introduces a comprehensive range of measures, which I would characterise as a &ldquo;charter for children&rdquo;, designed to safeguard the interests of the child by: encouraging alternative disputes resolution mechanisms in guardianship, child custody and access disputes and providing for a system of guardian <i>ad litem</i> and separate legal representation.  It addresses the difficult question of the evidence of children in civil cases by providing for: children giving evidence in certain civil proceedings through a television link; admissibility of hearsay evidence of children in certain civil proceedings subject to safeguards; and for a court to hear the evidence of children under the age of 14 in civil cases without requiring them to take an oath or make an affirmation.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes into account recommendations in the Law Reform Commission's reports on child sexual abuse, on oaths and affirmations, on the rule against hearsay in civil cases and on family courts.  I thank the Law Reform Commission for its enlightened work in those areas.  It is my intention to take on board as far as possible in the legislative work of my Department reports of the Law Reform Commission.  The commission's work is of fundamental importance to law reform and its tremendous work should be acknowledged from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Bill will help put Ireland at the forefront of the international community, in so far as children's rights are concerned, by facilitating ratification of the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights, which Ireland signed in January 1996.  That convention complements the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which was ratified in 1992.  The expressed aim of the European convention is to promote the rights of children in family proceedings affecting them, to grant them procedural rights, and to facilitate the exercise of these rights by ensuring children are informed of them and allowed to participate in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Part I contains standard provisions relating to short title, commencement, collective citation, interpretation and expenses.  The Bill will come into operation one month after the date of its passing, with the exception of section 11 and Part III which are subject to commencement provisions. Commencement orders are required in respect of those provisions to ensure the administrative arrangements necessary for their successful application are in place.  The provisions of section 11, for example, will have an impact on the work of the Probation and Welfare Service and the health boards and these organisations will have to be consulted about the manner in which these new responsibilities can be accommodated. <Col N="1323" /> Similarly, the provisions of Part III may necessitate the installation in courthouses of additional facilities for evidence to be taken by live television link or by means of a video recording, although such facilities are already available for the purposes of criminal proceedings in the Circuit and District Courts in the Four Courts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Part II gives effect to substantial amendments in the law on the guardianship of children.  It does so mainly by amending the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  That Act remains the definitive legislative measure dealing with the rights and duties of parents concerning their children.  It provides that the married parents of a child are jointly the guardians of that child.  In the case of unmarried parents, the mother is sole guardian of the child.  Until the Status of Children Act, 1987, there was no way by which an unmarried father could establish guardianship rights other than by subsequently marrying the mother of the child. The 1987 Act amended the 1964 Act by empowering the court, on the application of an unmarried father, to appoint him to be a guardian of his child jointly with the mother.  It also provides for a special informal court procedure to be used where the mother consents to the appointment of the father as guardian and the father's name is registered as such on the births register. The effect of what is provided for in section 4 is to remove the need to go to court where the father and mother are in agreement on the question of guardianship.</P>
    <P>The House would readily share my view that the law should facilitate as far as possible the sharing of responsibilities of parents in relation to children.  At present some 700 applications are made to the court each year by unmarried fathers who wish to become guardians of their children jointly with the mother.  Of these, some 400 are by agreement and under the new provisions they can become joint guardians of their child through a simple procedure without having to go to court. Some 12,500 children annually are now born to unmarried parents.</P>
    <P>Section 4 repeals and re-enacts section 2 of the 1964 Act.  The main differences between the old section 2 and the new section 2 are that new subsections (1)(c) and (4) have been added.  The effect of these amendments is to extend the definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; to include the father of a non-marital child whose relationship with the mother of the child satisfies conditions specified in subsection (4).  Where these criteria are satisfied the unmarried father can acquire guardianship rights jointly with the mother without having to go to court.  The conditions are that the father and mother have not married each other; that both agree to the appointment of the father as guardian of the child; that they have entered into arrangements regarding the custody of, and as the case may be, access to the child; and that the mother and father have made a statutory declaration <Col N="1324" /> to the effect that they have complied with all these conditions.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 8 make certain consequential technical changes only to the 1964 Act.  Section 7 makes clear that where the father is appointed guardian by virtue of the new procedure he may be removed from that appointment only by the court.</P>
    <P>Section 9 inserts three new sections &mdash; sections 11 A, 11 B and 11 C &mdash; into the 1964 Act.  Section 11 as it stands in that Act empowers the court to give any direction it thinks proper in disputes concerning custody of or access to children.  This includes a power to make orders granting custody of a child to the father and mother jointly in suitable cases.  The perception among some interest groups appears to be that the law does not permit the making of such orders or that the courts too rarely grant such orders.  The new section 11A is intended to allay any such perception and to highlight the discretion that the court already has under section 11 to order joint custody.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not attempt to define joint custody although in practice the term applies to a variety of custody arrangements.  These may range from a situation where a child spends a certain number of nights separately with each parent during the week to a situation where parents, although formally separated, continue to live in the same household and are in a position to operate a less specific joint custody arrangement. Neither is any attempt made in the Bill to draw a line indicating where joint custody ends and sole custody or access begins or to specify a list of criteria which should be used by the court in reaching its decision.  Decisions of this nature are premised on such an array of considerations in an infinite variety of cases that such distinctions serve only to distract from the main issue which is the welfare of the child.  However, l intend to look again at this area of the law to see whether there is scope for strengthening the law any further.</P>
    <P>The new section 11B gives blood relatives of a child or blood relatives of the parents of a child an independent right to apply for access to that child.  The intention is to reflect the fact that continued contact with relatives such as grandparents can often be in the child's best interests.  This circumstance may particularly arise in cases where the ties between the parents of children are broken.  In such cases the court would in making orders continue, by virtue of section 3 of the 1964 Act, to have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  Subsection (2) provides that a party must first apply for the leave of the court to bring an application under section 11B and subsection (3) specifies various matters to be taken into account by the court in deciding whether to grant leave.  These include the wishes of the child's guardian or parents, the applicant's connection with the child and the risk, if any, of the application disrupting the child's life to the extent that the child would be harmed by it.  The purpose of this filter process is to ensure <Col N="1325" /> that clearly unmeritorious or vexatious claims are prevented from proceeding to a full hearing.  The power to make application under this section in the Bill as it stands is confined to blood relatives. I am concerned that this power may be unduly restrictive as regards the class of persons to be covered.  I am giving consideration to the question as to whether the class of persons should be extended and may bring forward an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The new section 11C is a technical amendment which gives legislative backing to a District Court rule which provides that an access order shall not be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal against that order unless the court directs otherwise. I am giving consideration to the question as to whether the Bill should make similar provision in the case of appeals against custody orders and, again, any amendment I may have will be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 11 inserts a new Part IV in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 containing 12 new sections, sections 19 to 30, with which I will now deal.  These new sections are in effect a charter for the rights of children in cases of dispute.  They offer a comprehensive range of provisions which are designed to safeguard the interests of children in guardianship, custody and access proceedings. They bring Ireland to the forefront of modern thinking in these matters and, as I said at the outset, will enable Ireland to be among the first countries to ratify the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, counselling and-or mediation can be of immense benefit in helping couples to sort out their difficulties.  In too many cases immediate resort to the law can affect the prospect of a voluntary settlement.  We must recognise that the courts are and should always be a last resort for the settlement of differences between parents.  Even parents with the widest of differences may have within them the ability to work out their difficulties.  If that is so, they can perhaps move on to a resolution that may be for the betterment of themselves and their children. The reality is that a high proportion of custody and access disputes could be settled on a voluntary basis without ever getting to court.  Part III of the Bill gives legislative backing to that approach, which is urged on states by the 1996 Council of Europe Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the new section 20 requires a solicitor before instituting proceedings on behalf of an applicant under sections 6A, 11 or 11B of the Act to discuss with the applicant the possibility of engaging in counselling or mediation to resolve the dispute.  Where appropriate, the solicitor must also discuss the possibility of a deed or agreement with the other party on the issues in dispute.  Subsection (3) requires the solicitor to certify to the court that he or she has done so at the time of the institution of proceedings and that he or she has provided the names and addresses of persons qualified to give counselling or <Col N="1326" /> mediation to the applicant.  If the documents instituting proceedings are not accompanied by such a certificate the court may adjourn the proceedings for such period as it considers reasonable to enable the solicitor to fulfil these obligations.</P>
    <P>The new section 21 contains provisions in relation to the respondent's solicitor similar to those in the new section 20 about the applicant's solicitor.</P>
    <P>The new section 22 empowers the court to order an adjournment or further adjournment to facilitate attempts by the parties to reach agreement on some or all of the terms of a settlement. Either party may at any time request that the hearing be resumed and the court shall resume the hearing subject to any other power it has to adjourn proceedings.  The new section 23 provides that any oral or written communication between the parties and a third party for the purposes of seeking agreement and any record of such communication is not admissible as evidence in court. This mirrors a similar provision in judicial separation and divorce legislation and is intended to encourage free and frank discussion of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>The new sections 20 to 23 are aimed at facilitating as far as possible a non-adversarial approach to disputes in relation to children and to provide an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  I am happy to note the Incorporated Law Society has drawn up a code of practice which mirrors the provisions for mediation and counselling already contained in our separation and divorce laws and which are proposed in this Bill.  I am encouraged by that code which directs solicitors to appraise clients of the advantages to the family of a constructive and non-adversarial approach to the resolution of the couple's difficulties and advise their clients of the impact of disputes on children and on ensuring that the interests of the children should be of primary concern.</P>
    <P>The new section 24 enables agreements relating to rights of custody and access to a child to be made a rule of court and will enable the enforcement powers of the court to be invoked in respect of any breach of the agreement as if the agreement had been an order of the court.</P>
    <P>The new sections 25 to 28 are concerned with ensuring that where litigation is under way the rights of children are not alone protected but actively promoted.  The new section 25, therefore, requires the court as it thinks appropriate and practicable having regard to the age and understanding of a child to consider the wishes of the child in proceedings in which the welfare of the child is in question.  Children will have insights into their lives that are important for the court to take into account in any decision making.  Furthermore, particularly as a child gets older, failure to make an order which takes account of his or her wishes may, at least in some cases, be very upsetting for the child and therefore counter-productive to the enhancement of the child's welfare. It is important to acknowledge that in many <Col N="1327" /> cases there are real problems in placing weight on the wishes of the child or even in ascertaining the child's wishes.  These are factors which the judge must decide upon when taking into account the unique circumstances of each case.</P>
    <P>The new section 26 extends to the District Court the power in the High Court and Circuit Court to order social reports in proceedings under the 1964 Act from the probation and welfare service, a person nominated by a health board or any other person.  The new section 27 provides that a child to whom custody or access proceedings under sections 6A, 11 or 11B of the 1964 Act relate need not be brought before the court to be present for the hearing unless the court so directs.</P>
    <P>The new section 28 takes into account recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its report on family courts.  It empowers a court to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> in proceedings under sections 6A,11 or 11B of the 1964 Act where the court is satisfied that it is in a child's best interests to do so.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> will be to interview the child, to assess his or her needs, to inform the court of these needs and of the child's views.  Subsection (2) specifies criteria which the court must take into account in deciding whether to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.</i> These include the age and understanding of the child; the content of any social reports which are available on any question affecting the welfare of the child; the wishes of the child and any submissions made to the court by the parties to the proceedings or any other person to whom they relate.  Subsection (3) provides that the person from whom a social report was obtained may, notwithstanding that fact, also be appointed guardian <i>ad litem.</i></P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of the new section 28 empowers the court to order that the guardian <i>ad litem</i> be legally represented where exceptional and grave circumstances exist.  Subsection (5) provides that the costs of such legal representation may be paid by such parties to the proceedings and in such proportions as the court may determine.  The new section 29 provides similarly in relation to the cost of any mediation or counselling services.</P>
    <P>In its report on family courts the Law Reform Commission recommended that the court should of its own motion or upon application to it have power to appoint an independent representative for a child whose welfare is in issue in family proceedings where this appears to the court to be necessary in the interests of the child.  The commission also recommends that the court should have the power in the proceedings which affect a child to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> where the court is satisfied it is in the interest of the child and in the interests of justice to do so.  In making its recommendations the commission took into account similar provisions in child care legislation in other jurisdictions, namely Australia and the UK, requirements which are set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child <Col N="1328" /> which Ireland has ratified and the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights which Ireland has signed and which it will be possible to ratify on the enactment of this Bill. Section 11 provides more specific conditions for the appointment by the court of guardians <i>ad litem</i> than are recommended by the commission. While section 11 does not fully accord with those recommendations, it goes a long way to implement them.</P>
    <P>The new section 30 confers jurisdiction on the Circuit Court or the District Court except where an application is made under the new section 24 in respect of a separation agreement.  This is because jurisdiction in respect of separation and divorce proceedings is vested exclusively in the Circuit Court concurrently with the High Court. Provision is also made to hear applications to have custody and access agreements made a rule of court under the new section 24 together with similar applications in respect of maintenance agreements under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 without the need to initiate separate proceedings under both Acts.  This completes section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 12.  This is a technical provision which provides for the use of modern terminology in the 1964 Act.  It provides that the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; replaces the term &ldquo;infant&rdquo; where it is used in the 1964 Act except for references to &ldquo;infant&rdquo; in the Short and Long Titles of that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 13 makes amendments to section 28(5) of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, and allows for the granting of a civil legal aid certificate by the Legal Aid Board to a guardian <i>ad litem</i> appointed under the 1964 Act where either of the parties to the proceedings is in receipt of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>Section 14 amends section 5 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, to ensure that the enforcement powers which the District Court has at present in relation to breaches of orders made under the 1964 Act extend to orders made under the new section 11B.</P>
    <P>Section 15 amends sections 8 and 8 (a) of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Those sections of the 1976 Act allow maintenance agreements to be made a rule of court in the Circuit Court.  The effect of section 15 is to allow maintenance agreements, other than separation agreements, to be made a rule of court in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the provisions of Part III regarding evidence of children.  Section 19 defines the scope of Part III.  In short, it applies to civil proceedings before any court concerning the welfare of a child provided they have commenced after the commencement of that Part.</P>
    <P>A particular difficulty is how to treat the evidence of children and the hearsay evidence of expert witnesses such as social workers in proceedings involving children.  Over the years the courts have in certain circumstances admitted hearsay evidence of social workers in wardship cases while in others, the evidence of social workers has been treated as expert testimony. <Col N="1329" /> Such decisions have resulted in quite a degree of uncertainty in this area of the law.  The provisions in Part III are designed to eliminate this uncertainty and have already been welcomed by members of the legal and social work professions.</P>
    <P>The changes are intended to provide greater flexibility in receiving the evidence of children in proceedings affecting their future welfare by amending existing provisions in three major respects.  First, it will be possible for children to give evidence in court via a live television link. Secondly, the Bill provides for the admissibility of out of court statements made by children which up to now were excluded by virtue of the rule of law relating to hearsay.  Thirdly, the Bill enables the court to receive the evidence of children under the age of 14 years otherwise than on oath or affirmation.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that children may give evidence in cases concerning their welfare by live television link from in or outside the State with the leave of the court.  This mirrors similar provisions in the criminal law where sexual offences or offences involving violence or threats of violence are concerned.  Subsection (2) provides that this evidence shall be video recorded.  The intention is to remove from the child the burden of having to give evidence a second time should circumstances so require it.  Section 22 provides for the admissibility of such a video recording in evidence, subject to conditions, if for example the case is appealed to the Circuit Court.  Subsection (3) makes clear that a child who knowingly gives false evidence from outside the State by television link shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 21 empowers the court, in cases under section 20 where evidence is being given through a television link, to appoint an intermediary to convey questions to a child witness, if it is satisfied that such is required having regard to the witness's age or mental condition.  The intermediary may adapt the question where appropriate to take account of the stage of development of the child witness and the questions put by the intermediary and the answers by the witness will be heard in the courtroom.  The witness in such a case will not have to see and hear the questioner. The intermediary must be someone who in the court's opinion is competent to act as such.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is an important new provision which provides that statements made by a child which up to now would have been inadmissible as evidence by virtue of the rule relating to hearsay can now be admitted subject to certain conditions. Subsections (2) and (3) contain the safeguards to ensure that the new powers do not offend against the principles of fairness.  Subsection (2) empowers the court to refuse to admit hearsay evidence, in part or in whole, where it is not in the interests of justice to do so.  As a further safeguard, subsection (3) provides that a person proposing to adduce evidence to which this section applies must give notice to the other party to the proceedings of that fact and must also give particulars of or relating to the evidence for the purpose <Col N="1330" /> of enabling the other party to deal with any matter arising from it being hearsay.  Subsection (4) provides that parties may agree among themselves to disapply this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 23 contains provisions regarding the weight to be given to evidence admitted under section 22.  The weight to be given to such evidence will vary according to the circumstances. Subsection (2) lists various factors to which regard may be had including, for example, whether or not the original statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence of the matter stated and whether or not the evidence involves multiple hearsay.</P>
    <P>Section 24 allows evidence to be admitted concerning the credibility of a child who supplies information contained in a statement admitted under section 22.  A common problem at present is that where a child does not appear as a witness there is no mechanism for testing the child's credibility by cross examination.  Section 24 seeks to address this problem by providing that the fact that the child has not been called to give oral evidence does not prevent evidence from being adduced to challenge his or her credibility.  For example, evidence tending to prove that the child had made a contradictory statement after supplying the information shall also be admissible if not already so.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that where a document is admissible in evidence in proceedings to which Part III applies it may be given in evidence by producing an authenticated copy, including a fax copy, of it.  This section also applies to sound recordings and video recordings.  Section 26 is a jurisdictional provision which empowers the court to transfer proceedings to which Part III applies to a Circuit or District Court which has the necessary technical facilities for enabling evidence to be given through a television link or by means of a video recording.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is significant to the extent that it enables the court to receive the evidence of children under the age of 14 years otherwise than on oath or affirmation.  This provision applies to all civil proceedings involving children and not just those to which Part III applies.  At common law the test of competence is whether the child had sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his or her evidence and understood the nature of the oath.  It is now recognised that a child's ability to answer questions about events may be better than both the law and common belief recognises and that even very young children can respond to the demands of testimony when questions are posed in a developmentally appropriate way.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that in the case of children under the age of 14 years there should be no requirement as to the taking of an oath or affirmation and that a judicial test of competence should be substituted.  The test should focus on the cognitive ability of the child rather than his or her moral or religious understanding. The criminal law was subsequently amended to give effect to these recommendations <Col N="1331" /> but no such leeway is allowed in civil cases as was made clear in the Mapp v. Gilhooley, 1991, Supreme Court, IRLM, page 695.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that a child who makes a statement which he or she knows to be false during the course of his or her unsworn evidence shall be dealt with as if he or she was guilty of perjury.  This provision is necessary because the crime of perjury only applies to the giving of false evidence on oath or affirmation.  Subsection (3) ensures that these provisions are also applicable to a person with mental disability who has reached the age of 14 years, reflecting another recommendation of the Law Reform Commission. Finally, subsection (4) provides that the unsworn evidence of a child may corroborate evidence sworn or unsworn that is given by another person.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill.  I am sure its general aims will be supported by all sides of the House and look forward to a good and constructive debate on the issues involved.  This is a very lengthy Bill, dealing with extremely important matters.  I thank the Chair and the Members for their forbearance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which updates the law on guardianship, custody of, and access to, children, and the evidence of children in civil proceedings.  The values of our society can be judged by how we treat our children in all circumstances, including when they are deviant, or seen to be so by society.  The welfare of our children must be of paramount importance as they are the bedrock of our society.</P>
      <P>Society has changed dramatically over the past two decades and family life is not as secure as it once was, which is impacting on children.  This is evidenced in the level of dysfunction in society, including dysfunctional families, the change in the cohesion of society, and the changes in the family and the support of the extended family which was present in rural Ireland up to 20 or 30 years ago. This can be measured by various means.  The general international measures of the breakdown of cohesiveness in society apply in Ireland, such as the increases in alcoholism, drugs misuse, marriage breakdown, the level of indictable crime and so on.</P>
      <P>Family life has changed dramatically.  We all remember when not alone was the family absolutely assured of the support of the father, mother and siblings, but also of the extended local family. The extended family provided outlets and opportunities for children to express their concerns, feelings and difficulties.  That is not available in the unitary families we have nowadays, especially families which have difficulties such as marital problems.  The pressures now put on family life and on people generally have a consequent impact on children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must be concerned and frightened to know that children as young as nine years are now committing suicide.  Under no circumstances <Col N="1332" /> 20 years ago would one see a statistic that anybody under the age of 15 years had attempted suicide or parasuicide or committed suicide. However, now we see statistics every year of children as young as nine years committing suicide. That illustrates the impact society is having and how difficult life is now for children in comparison with previous generations.</P>
    <P>We have responded slowly to what is happening in society.  The Child Care Act, 1991, was the first big legislative response to the changes in society and to the needs of children.  The other Acts which the Minister outlined, including the Children Bill, 1997, introduced by the previous Government, and this Bill are a continuing response to the need to ensure that we, as a State, respond to children's needs and difficulties and that we introduce measures, legislative and otherwise, to ensure children are not exploited, and that those in difficulties are taken care of and receive the help of the State, whether it is from the Departments of Justice, Health or Education.</P>
    <P>We must continue to examine the situation and our response to the growing needs and difficulties of children because they will be the adults who will determine the shape of society in the future. How we prepare them for that and respond to their situation will have a large impact on how they perceive society in the future and what they will pass on to their children and grandchildren.</P>
    <P>This Bill was initially published by the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Taylor, on 25 April 1997.  It recognises the changes in society and facilitates the changed situation, in that there are now relationships between children and guardians, or other significant people in the mother's life.  It allows for access and introduces a sensible approach in allowing a father who is not married to the mother of his child to be appointed guardian of the child by agreement with the mother without needing to go to court.  The less involvement the courts have in the whole area of family life, the better it is for the child and the parents, be they married or unmarried.</P>
    <P>The mother and father must agree to the appointment of the father as a guardian of the child.  They must have entered into an arrangement regarding the custody of and, as the case may be, access to the child.  They must also have made a statutory declaration to that effect.  As matters stand, a father who is not married to the mother of the child must apply to the court to be appointed the child's guardian.  The Bill removes the need to go to court in cases of agreement between the father and mother.</P>
    <P>The Bill does allow, however, that where a father is appointed a guardian he may be removed from the appointment only by the court. It also allows for the custody of a child to be granted by the court to a father and mother jointly, and enables certain relatives of a child to apply for access.  It allows a person who is related to the child, for example, a grandparent, to apply <Col N="1333" /> for an order granting access to the child on such terms and conditions as the court may order.</P>
    <P>It was very sad when grandparents were denied access to their grandchildren.  Grandparents and grandchildren have a very special relationship, perhaps because of the absence of responsibility, which is different to that between a parent and child.  We have seen cases of marriage breakdown where the grandparent, who had no involvement in the difficulties experienced in the marriage, was denied access to the child.  The Bill is highly commendable for that measure in itself.</P>
    <P>In assessing an application, the court must have regard to the applicant's connection with the child, the risk of the application disrupting the child's life to the extent that the child would be harmed by it and, importantly, it must take into account the wishes of the child's guardian.</P>
    <P>With a view to safeguarding the interests of children, the Bill also provides a new emphasis on alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as counselling and mediation.  Deputy McGennis and I discussed these at length in the Seanad during the debate on the divorce legislation, particularly the need for counselling and mediation when family relationships are in difficulties as an alternative to the dispassionate nature of court hearings.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that if a solicitor acts for a party in proceedings concerning the welfare of the child, for example custody or access proceedings, he or she must discuss with the applicant the possibility of engaging in counselling, mediation or effecting a deed or agreement on the question affecting the welfare of the child. Prior to instituting proceedings the solicitor must certify to the court that he or she has complied with this provision.  A certificate signed by the solicitor must indicate that he or she has provided the names and addresses of persons qualified to give counselling or mediation.  If the documents instituting proceedings are not accompanied by a certificate the court may adjourn the proceedings for such a period as it considers reasonable to enable the solicitor to fulfil these obligations.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the evidence of a child may be given by live television link with the court's permission.  The evidence may be video recorded.  It shall be an offence to give false evidence from outside the State by live television link and the offence may be treated as having been committed in the State.  The child need not identify any person during the course of such proceedings if the child has already given evidence that the person was known to him prior to the commencement of the proceedings, unless the court directs otherwise.  This will facilitate children of a young age giving their views, as current arrangements can be intimidating for a child.  It will enable the court to fully consider the child's views and to allow an intermediary to convey questions to the child if required, having regard to the witness's age or mental condition.</P>
    <P>It is natural justice that the person central to the proceedings should be consulted and his or <Col N="1334" /> her views taken into account.  Too often victims in other circumstances, especially in criminal cases, are not consulted and may be ignored when considering issues affecting them.  The video facility will allow the intermediary to speak to the child in a language that the child understands and not the formal legal language of a court.  It humanises the process for the child central to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's report on child sexual abuse recommended that</P>
    <P>A child should have a right to be heard in care proceedings relating to him or her, except where it appears to the court that this would not be in the child's interest.  Provision should be made for the appointment by the Justice of an independent representative for the child, where in the opinion of the Justice, this appears to be necessary in the interest of the child.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the court shall have discretion to admit hearsay evidence in civil cases where the child is too young to give evidence in court or where the court is of the view that the giving of oral evidence by a child is contrary to the welfare of the child.  It empowers the court to refuse to admit such evidence or part of such evidence having regard to all the circumstances, including any risks that admission will result in unfairness to any of the parties to the proceedings. This is in line with the Law Reform Commission's report on the rule against hearsay in civil cases published in September 1988.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows the Court, subject to certain conditions, to hear the evidence of all children under the age of 14 in civil cases without requiring them to take an oath or make an affirmation. The Law Reform Commission's report of 1990, &ldquo;Oaths and Affirmations&rdquo;, stated in its recommendations</P>
    <P>We have already recommended in our Report on Child Sexual Abuse that section 30 of the Children Act, 1908, should be repealed and replaced by a provision enabling the court to hear evidence of children under the age of 14 without requiring them to give evidence on oath . where the court is satisfied that the children are competent to give evidence in accordance with the criteria as to competency proposed in that report.  We have also recommend that, in the case of young persons between the ages of 14 and 17, the same regime as to the giving of sworn evidence should apply as is proposed in this report.  We have also recommended in our Report on Sexual Offences against the Mentally Handicapped that a similar test of competence to give evidence should be adopted in the case of persons with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>These proposals were made in the context of criminal proceedings and it was recommended that they be extended to civil proceedings.  As the law stands a child is not permitted to give evidence in civil cases unless he or she understands <Col N="1335" /> the nature of the oath.  The only criterion in the Bill is that the court is satisfied the child is capable of giving an intelligible account of the relevant events.  This section applies to all civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline his views and proposals with regard to the situation revealed by the Eastern Health Board's working party on child prostitution.  Its work reveals serious circumstances which require urgent attention by the State.  Its report indicates that 57 children &mdash; 32 girls and 25 boys &mdash; were identified as engaged in prostitution in Dublin, the majority operating in the inner city area and most of them soliciting on the streets.  It is a cause for grave concern that three girls were believed to be working in massage parlours.  The working party raised concern about how many more children might be working in massage parlours.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the State to identify the extent of this problem and to deal with it as a matter of urgency.  The report of the working group identified 57 children but indicated that it was unsure how many more children were involved.  It could not give a definitive figure.  A significant finding of the survey was that 46 of the 57 children either had experienced or were experiencing homelessness. This demonstrates clearly the risks faced by children who are out of home for any length of time.  It takes a very short time for a child who is homeless to become immersed in a street culture that can encompass crime, drugs, sexual exploitation and, as this report outlines, prostitution. This is a major problem that is visible on the streets of Dublin.  I am worried it is being treated similarly to the problem of begging children and that the authorities are turning a blind eye to it.  There are very few outreach workers from the agencies responsible working with these children.  The State should take a particular interest in this issue as it is not getting the attention it deserves, and I hope the report ensures the authorities make that happen.</P>
    <P>A study was done by Doctor Noel O'Gorman and Doctor Jim Barnes with 100 boys who came to St. Michael's Assessment Centre in Dublin.  All those assessed were Dubliners under 16 who had committed various offences ranging from truancy to sexual offences.  The psychological findings relating to the 100 boys, who were in trouble when sent to St. Michael's, were interesting: 94 per cent of those surveyed had an IQ which was below average and 62 per cent had a dull normal IQ.  While one quarter of the boys were illiterate, 86 per cent of them were four years behind in their numeracy.  They had self-destructive behaviour and suffered from alcohol abuse, drug abuse and self abuse.  They were aggressive, destructive, typically emotionally immature, dependent on their peers for self-esteem, lacked initiative and had few life goals.  They showed a lack of guilt or remorse for their behaviour and its consequences. Most were followers and not leaders.  The boys <Col N="1336" /> who committed solitary offences showed more evidence of serious emotional disturbance.  All had low self-esteem and poor relations with others.  That kind of empirical evidence is useful in highlighting the problems of prostitution in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The working party of the Eastern Health Board on children in prostitution considered that if 57 individual children can be identified as being involved in prostitution in a small scale survey, it is reasonable to assume the extent of the problem is greater.  The knowledge that 57 children are engaged in prostitution is in itself significantly alarming and I draw attention to the views of the working group that it appears this problem also exists in other urban centres, such as Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  The health boards in those areas should, like the Eastern Health Board, identify the problem so that we know its full extent and not just treat it as a Dublin problem.</P>
    <P>If we claim to be concerned about the welfare of children, to close our eyes to children in prostitution is totally unacceptable and is a very sad reflection on the State.  The Government must deal with this problem urgently.  As the working party stated, it is clear boys and girls are engaged in prostitution.  There is a sexual market for children in Ireland and women and teenagers dress down to look like children to avail of this market. The authorities must deal with the exploitation of children and bring the pimps and, to use an unsuitable term, the customers to justice.  An easy approach is often taken to prostitution.  This is not prostitution: it is paedophilia and the exploitation of mainly homeless children, destroying their future lives.</P>
    <P>The survey established a strong link between children engaged in prostitution and other social ills.  These children often suffer from other social problems such as drug misuse and sexual abuse and have a history of family problems, low self esteem and, in some cases, confused sexual identity. We must hit at the heart of the pimps who organise and groom young children for this evil market.  A vulnerable child in a social setting may be &ldquo;treated by a kind man&rdquo;, as the report states. This child can then be slowly seduced by adult activity such as smoking and drinking in a befriending process that will end in entrapment and sexual abuse in return for material favours. It is clearly unacceptable that children engage in prostitution in what can be described as survival sex when they are destitute or desperate for cash. Some of these children are having sex to live.</P>
    <P>This cannot be tolerated.  I am not blaming the present Minister or any of his predecessors but this has now been exposed and the State must deal with it.  The Minister must immediately initiate an investigation and bring to justice those who abuse children in this terrible fashion.  It is appalling that men can put in an order for a child and arrangements are then made for them to be introduced to the child at an offstreet location in Dublin.  The authorities have not, to my knowledge, <Col N="1337" /> brought any rapist who engages in this activity to justice.  There must be no ambiguity that the sexual exploitation of children through prostitution is a form of paedophilia where the perpetrator is always a child sex offender.  Early detection of children's involvement is essential if they are to avoid entrapment in the activity.  The fact that so many of these children are out of home means, by and large, that they are already known to the relevant voluntary and statutory services.  Because so many of these children experience homelessness, a basic requirement is that there are sufficient numbers of placements to cater for them.</P>
    <P>I support this report's call for the establishment of competent, efficient and sufficient early intervention services aimed at children at risk, and the prevention of their detachment from school, family, community and, ultimately, mainstream society.  The Government must immediately introduce the recommendations outlined by the Eastern Health Board's working party and ensure that specific services are available which are accessible and flexible enough to respond to the diverse needs of these children in a non-stigmatised environment.  They require basic practical help, such as food, shelters and showers.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary for the services to have easy access to other more specialist services such as drug treatment, medical assistance, counselling and child guidance.  As well as being centre-based the services will need to provide outreach services where children can be engaged in their own environment and facilitated to use the available services. Such services should operate night and day seven days a week.  The requirements of boys and girls may differ and separate services may be required by each gender.  Consideration should be given to whether such services could be attached to one or more existing services.  Staff who are working with this group of children need specific skills and specific training should be provided urgently.  A unified approach is required by all the agencies involved with these children to provide awareness among professionals and the public. More formal links must be established between all the voluntary and statutory services to maximise communication and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Further research is required into the extent and nature of the problem and this should be carried out immediately.  Has the Minister plans to do this in view of the Eastern Health Board report? What plans has he to investigate child prostitution in other urban centres?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to welcome the Bill introduced by my Labour Party colleague, former Deputy Mervyn Taylor, in April.  I am glad the Government has decided to proceed with it because it represents a significant step forward in the promotion and protection of children's rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is wide-ranging, detailed and extremely technical even to someone trained in the area of law and I recognise the reasons for that.  The interests of children lie at its heart and <Col N="1338" /> it is an important addition to the corpus of laws already on the Statute Book which deals with children and the family.</P>
    <P>The Bill was the twentieth Bill published by the then Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor.  I pay tribute to him for his tremendous work and initiatives in the area of family law.  That such a large volume of family law reform was enacted during the lifetime of the Department of Equality and Law Reform is an eloquent testimony to the folly of abolishing that Department.  That will have the inevitable and deplorable consequence that equality issues and civil law reform will slip down the Government's scale of priorities.  It is also a comment on the entirely cosmetic nature of the designation of Deputy Cowen as Minister for Health and Children when he has no responsibility for this Bill. Perhaps I am mistaken but as I understand it that Minister will not have any responsibility for the proposed juvenile justice Bill either.  That is merely a comment on the significance of Ministers' titles.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  The main thrust of the measures provided for is to give children a greater say in custody disputes.  As somebody involved in the legal process, I welcome the fact that the Bill seeks to encourage the resolution of such disputes out of court.  That is an admirable objective.  Where it is not possible to reach out of court resolution, the Bill proposes significant improvements which are to be welcomed.  I hope the Minister will study and reflect upon my constructive comments and we will have a good Committee Stage debate.  Improvements could be effected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the main proposals is that a child's natural father would be able to become a guardian by agreement with the child's mother without having to go to court.  The court's power to grant joint custody will be written into law for the first time and this is a significant milestone in the corpus of family law.  The courts will be obliged, in family law cases, to consider the wishes of the children as is appropriate given their age and understanding of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville referred to the fact that for the first time grandparents and other relatives denied access to a child will be allowed to apply for orders giving them appropriate access.  The possibility of having separate representation for children in family cases, with the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> where the court considers this necessary, is a significant improvement.</P>
    <P>The law on children's evidence will be substantially improved by allowing children to give evidence in civil cases by means of a television link. It is very important that the Bill encourages couples in dispute over children to resort to counselling or mediation.  I discern a new emphasis on counselling and mediation as alternatives to court proceedings.  The Bill seeks to encourage parents in dispute over custody and access issues to resolve these without having to resort to court intervention.  It is also significant that a solicitor <Col N="1339" /> will now be obliged, under the Bill, to discuss the possibilities of reconciliation with the parents and to provide them with the names and addresses of people qualified to effect a reconciliation between people who may be experiencing difficulties &mdash; something which is obviously borrowed from the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  That provision is set out in section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A further borrowing from the family law legislation passed in 1989 is evident where an adjournment can be obtained from the court to assist the reconciliation process.  It will not be possible to admit or proffer in evidence any steps which are taken in the interim as that would undermine the reconciliation process which people would undertake. It would also present an obstacle to encouraging that process if various matters discussed outside the court were to be introduced in evidence thereafter.</P>
    <P>Sufficient emphasis has not been placed on the important provision that the District Court will now have wider jurisdiction in dealing with matters such as custody and access and in obtaining social reports on children as outlined by the Minister. Significant measures have been advanced for which there has been widespread and understandable welcome despite the Bill being somewhat technical, complex and complicated.</P>
    <P>No Bill introduced in this House is beyond improvement and we will have the opportunity to discuss possible improvements on Committee Stage.  The Minister might consider on Committee Stage, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 now more than 30 years old and which has been amended at least ten times.  This Bill alone will increase the number of sections in that Act from 18 to 30.  The Minister should use the Committee Stage as an opportunity to consider consolidating the 1964 Act.  Speaking as a lawyer, it is extremely difficult for the legal profession to discern and examine the scope of the Act as amended and extended.  We should always ensure that legislation is consumer and user friendly and not confined to interpretation by lawyers.  We should ensure that ordinary people will have an opportunity to consider legislation and we should not present obstacles to that.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides an ideal opportunity to consolidate an Act which is more than 30 years old. That should be considered.  It might delay the passing of the Bill by a short period but it would be worthwhile for the general public and others involved in this area.  We should consider also the possibility of incorporating the maintenance sections in this Bill in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 rather than in guardianship legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the main changes proposed in the Bill is an improvement in the rights of the natural father.  It is fair to say this proposed improvement has been widely welcomed and has not caused the controversy generated ten years ago.  Society has moved on since then and there is now more scope <Col N="1340" /> to recognise the role of the natural father.  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister might consider further improving the position of the natural father.</P>
    <P>A major change in the Bill is the new rights for grandparents and other relatives to have the possibility of access to children.  The extended family is an important source of support and has a definite role to play in the upbringing of children. I welcome the increased involvement of the extended family as set out under the terms of the Bill.  It must be remembered, however, that the rights of parents are paramount and placed centrally in the Constitution.  Consequently, we must proceed with some caution.  Efforts have been made to strike a balance in this area, bearing in mind the possibility that might exist of the extended family being perceived as attempting to take over the duties and obligations of the nuclear family or the single parent.  One can appreciate the efforts being made to strike that balance in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One important way to proceed might be to amend section 11(2)(a) of the 1964 Act in line with a judgment of the High Court in a case of July 1991, D <i>v.</i> D to expressly provide that, on the application of a parent or guardian, the court could order that the child could have access to a grandparent or relative.  I ask the Minister to give that some consideration as I believe it would be useful in eliminating any doubts in relation to the Act.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the Minister's clarification on whether under this Act the court is entitled to initiate a health board investigation, as is the case under the domestic violence Act.  The Bill introduces the concept of joint custody.  This is a welcome development but, as the Minister indicated in his detailed contribution, this expression is not expressly defined.  He made the point that the whole thrust of the Bill is that the welfare and interests of the child are of paramount importance, and that is the primary consideration, but the Minister might consider introducing new terminology along the lines of the UK children Act, 1989.  That Act spoke in terms of parental responsibility rather than guardianship, and residence orders rather than custody.  These terms have proved useful in reducing conflict and I ask the Minister to consider them on Committee Stage with a view to their incorporation in this major legislation.</P>
    <P>I would also ask whether the Bill might benefit from an amendment to section 11 of the 1964 Act to make express the court's power to order counselling for a child.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces new procedures on evidence, which is welcome.  I appreciate fully the safeguards outlined by the Minister in his contribution on this new area of family law.  It is currently the norm for children not to give evidence in the family courts.  That decision is normally made by the judge who might decide that it is in the best interests of the child not to do so.  I welcome the changes but we must be careful to <Col N="1341" /> ensure that any significant change ushered in by this Bill is not mandatory.  The judge should always have discretion as to whether to hear the child's evidence.  That is important particularly in relation to sections 20 to 22.  I note that section 24 permits evidence to be adduced, where the evidence is admitted, to test the credibility of a child who supplies information in a statement under section 22.</P>
    <P>On the subject of other areas of children's legislation, I would mention the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991.  I ask the Minister to ensure that solicitors involved in these cases make clients fully aware of the relevant services his Department can provide.  The Minister might consider imposing a duty on solicitors in addition to the duties imposed by the new sections 20 to 21 of the 1964 Act as inserted by section 11, to inform clients of the central authority services available.  This should be done without any charge.</P>
    <P>I indicated I would try to be helpful in regard to a number of technical points in the Bill.  I will outline those now for the Minister's consideration. They do not highlight any flaws but they may be helpful in the reading and understanding of the Bill.  That is important particularly from the point of view of the ordinary person, the lay litigant, who has a right of access before the courts and who does not necessarily have to have recourse to legal representation.  That should be the thrust of all our legislation.  We must simplify, codify and consolidate legislation of a technical nature to allow people readily ascertain the rights, obligations and duties imposed under a particular Act.</P>
    <P>Reference to certain Acts is omitted in the citation in section 1(5).  It would be preferable to change the citation to read the &ldquo;Guardianship of Children Acts&rdquo;.  That would be the simple way of dealing with the matter but it would be better to consolidate the Acts.  I suggest also the creation of a collective citation for the various Acts dealing with civil evidence.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; in section 4 deviates from the normal drafting rule that substantive provisions are not buried in a definitions section. It would be better to give the term &ldquo;father&rdquo; its ordinary meaning and deal with the point being made, with which I agree, in a substantive section.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a textual difference in section 8 between the new section 11(6) and section 19(b).  In addition, there is a paragraph alignment error in the new section 11(6) but, more seriously, the whole of section 8 seems misconceived because as far as persons over 18 are concerned, the concept of guardianship does not apply and, therefore, there cannot be any application under section 11.  I suggest the deletion of section 8 or an appropriate amendment thereto. Section 2(4)(c) of the 1964 Act, inserted by section 4, seems unnecessary and also could be deleted.</P>
    <P>As regards the new section 11(c), inserted by section 9, it seems this has now been anticipated <Col N="1342" /> in part by the new District Court rules.  That is welcome.  However, that does not mean it may not be desirable to state the point being made in the primary legislation before the House.  I am not clear why the section applies only to orders under sections 11 and 11B and not to all orders under the Act.  However, I may have misread the section which is extremely technical.</P>
    <P>In accordance with normal drafting procedure the proposed new paragraphs in sections 13 to 17 could be renumbered to correspond with the numbering in the Acts they seek to amend.  This would be clearer than the present format.  On section 17, there should also be a reference to the 1989 Act in section 20(1) of the Child Care Act, which should be updated.</P>
    <P>I am giving the Minister every opportunity to consider these technical matters between now and Committee Stage so that I do not have to put down a plethora of amendments.  It is wrong that section 11 <i>in toto</i> has to await a commencement order before coming into effect as some provisions could come into operation straight away. Section 1(2) could be amended to reflect this.  The aim of the Bill is to ensure that courts have comprehensive powers to deal with family disputes across a range of issues from maintenance to property, custody and access to children.  This marks a very positive development as it applies to the welfare of children in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and my comments have been made in an effort to improve it.  I look forward to teasing out some provisions in further detail on Committee Stage.  We are obliged to look after the welfare of children who are of paramount consideration in the context of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the achievements of the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Taylor.  As my party's spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform in the last Seanad I had an opportunity to work with him and, I hope, to influence some of the legislation he initiated.  Although we did not always agree he accepted some amendments put forward by me and other Senators.  These amendments improved the legislation significantly.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is open to positive suggestions which will have the same effect on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to become engrossed in the detail of a Bill and to lose sight of its primary purpose.  When dealing with legislation, particularly that relating to family law issues, we should always focus on one priority, what is best for children. This excellent Bill will bring up to date a <Col N="1343" /> significant amount of legislation on children, guardianship and court proceedings.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy Penrose's criticism of the decision to amalgamate the Department of Equality and Law Reform, which initiated the legislation originally, with the Department of Justice. Taking this Bill during the first week of the new term shows the Minister's commitment to the equality and law reform aspects of his portfolio. I congratulate the Minister for returning this legislation to the Order Paper and on the legislative programme he has set for his Department for this term and beyond.  There are 36 Bills promised, eight of which, including this Bill, are being given priority.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Law Reform Commission on its work, the framework on which the Bill has been built.  The meticulous and practical way the commission does its work is a credit to the president and commissioners who deserve our thanks.</P>
    <P>While it is important that legislation be subjected to the maximum scrutiny and its implications teased out in detail on Committee Stage, it will be difficult to find any fault with the provisions of this Bill.  We live in a rapidly changing society where the traditional family is no longer the only option.  The Minister referred to statistics which show that 12,500 children are born outside marriage every year.  We regularly praise ourselves on our education system and the highly skilled and educated young people it produces. The necessary corollary of that is the need to allow these people the right to make choices on how they wish to live their lives.  This freedom of choice brings with it new challenges, some of which we are addressing today.</P>
    <P>Many bemused and frustrated people have sent me representations about the requirement on a father to go to court to be appointed guardian of his child in cases where the mother is in agreement. This expensive and complex anachronism will finally be removed under this legislation.  The Minister said that there are approximately 700 applications for this type of custody every year. An increasing number of couples are deciding not to get married and to raise their children as joint guardians.  Why should a father in such circumstances have to go to court to be appointed a guardian?  Under this legislation, which recognises that with rights come responsibilities, commonsense will prevail at last.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Neville and Penrose that the court system, with its adversarial nature, must be a last resort in family law cases, particularly those involving children.  I have repeatedly stressed the need to maximise the use of mediation and counselling services where the parties are encouraged to reach agreement between themselves rather than have solutions imposed on them by the courts.  The legislation will provide a legal requirement to go that route.  The safeguards in the Bill will ensure that mediation and counselling are availed of and that children are not subjected to the trauma of being unnecessarily <Col N="1344" /> involved in court proceedings.  The clarification of the powers of the court to grant guardianship rights to the father and the move towards joint custody are welcome.  I have received representations from fathers who want such an arrangement.  The Bill recognises modern day realities and removes the uncertainties regarding current legislation.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the divorce legislation I argued long and hard in favour of access by blood relatives, particularly grandparents, to children.  I did not succeed on that occasion and am glad this Bill addresses the matter.  Family support is at the core of the relatively stable nature of Irish society.  While times are changing we still tend to have larger than average families and to rely on the extended family for support and assistance during times of crisis.  The legislation will assist and support the tradition in a practical way with appropriate safeguards.  There is nothing sadder than seeing a child suffer due to loss of access to grandparents, aunts, uncles and the extended family because a husband and wife or partners separate.</P>
    <P>On a technical point, either there is some defect in my copy of the Bill or it needs to be amended because Part IV comes before Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two major measures in the legislation. Part IV is entitled &ldquo;Safeguarding Interests of Children&rdquo; and that is the most welcome measure I have seen for some time.  It empowers children by giving them a voice and acknowledging they have an opinion.  It provides a sensible and practical framework for ensuring their voice is heard.  I dealt with the commitments to counselling and mediation, but this part of the Bill goes on to state what I consider to be the most important words in it.  It states &ldquo;the court shall. take into account a child's wishes in the matter.&rdquo;  Lest the Chair think I have become a member of the staff of <i>Magill</i>, for the sake of brevity I have not quoted a rider in the middle of the sentence.  It is wondrous to see that provision in legislation.  It empowers children and acknowledges their view on matters and the court shall take it into account.  I cannot overstate the importance of section 11(25).  The Bill goes on to provide where necessary for the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> to ensure that the child involved can exercise this right in an effective manner.  At last we have recognition of the needs of those who matter most and are most vulnerable. This approach needs to be adopted in other legislation on matters outside the area of children. Does not the same logic apply in regard to demands for representation for victims in rape cases or domestic violence cases?  Similar progress could be made in those areas.</P>
    <P>The final part of the Bill relates to the taking of evidence from children and the use of video links referred to by Deputies Neville and Penrose. It provides for the use of intermediaries and other means to put children at their ease when giving their accounts.  The setting of clear rules <Col N="1345" /> on the admissibility of hearsay evidence strikes a sensible balance between the rights of all parties involved.  It is practical down to earth measures such as this that are at the core of good legislation. Similarly the provisions regarding oaths and affirmations recognise the requirement for a balance of rights based on practical realities.</P>
    <P>Four points are at the core of this legislation. They are the unwed father's right to be recognised as a guardian, particularly where there is agreement, children's rights to have their wishes considered, access rights for grandparents and the extended family and, as referred to by the Minister, the beginning of a charter of rights for children, including the incorporation of counselling, consultation, mediation, legal representation and the giving of evidence.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I hope it will be enacted quickly.  I hope on Committee Stage to play a part in fine-tuning the sections that can be improved.  This is excellent legislation which will bring tangible improvement to the manner in which we deal with these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this important and timely legislation.  Family law has been overhauled in the past few years.  Like other speakers, I pay tribute to the former Minister, Mr. Taylor, for the work he did in introducing so much legislation which was badly needed and long overdue. I believe this was his twentieth Bill and he deserves great credit for the work he did during his term in two Governments.  I also pay tribute to the Minister for the way he speedily brought this Bill before the House and for agreeing to take amendments on Committee Stage if Members raise issues which they and he consider important.</P>
      <P>The Bill is for and about children.  The Government's commitment to children is evident in the appointment of the Minister of State with responsibility for children which is long overdue and welcome.  The main proposals in the Bill are that a child's natural father will be able to become a guardian by agreement with the mother without having to go to court as at present.  This is a good and long overdue measure.  Like other public representatives, I have dealt with cases involving fathers who have not been allowed access to their child or children which has caused great distress.  This is one of the first Bills giving something back to fathers and that is not a bad thing.  Maybe things have gone too much the other way.  If that is the case, men have only themselves to blame because women have highlighted issues relevant to them, put them on the political agenda and in many cases have been successful. If men want to raise issues that are important to them, they should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court's power to grant joint custody is written into law for the first time and the courts will be obliged in family law cases to consider the wishes of children as is appropriate given the child's age and understanding.  For the first time grandparents and other relatives who are denied <Col N="1346" /> access to children will be allowed to apply for orders giving them appropriate access.  This is a very important measure.  I am sure we have all dealt with cases where grandparents, who often were involved in rearing a child, suddenly find that because their child's marriage has broken up they no longer have access to their grandchild. That causes great distress to the grandparents and grandchild.</P>
    <P>We must do everything possible not alone to strengthen the immediate family but also the extended family which is very important for everyone, especially children so that they can feel there is a safety net and security.  Often grandparents bring that security.  Some grandparents might say their grandchildren have too much access to them and they would like to see less of them.  I have dealt with a few cases where access to grandchildren has been suddenly cut off and the grandparents have been more than upset. They were not involved in the break-up of the marriage but no longer have access to their grandchildren whom they love dearly.  The same applies to the grandchildren who suddenly realise that people who are very important to them have disappeared from their lives.  That point was strongly emphasised by AIM in its submission to the Joint Committee on the Family in the last session of the last Dáil.  It considered this important issue should be addressed by providing for it in the Bill and I am pleased it is addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for separate representation for children in family law cases through a guardian where the courts consider it necessary.  It also allows the law on children's evidence to be substantially improved, particularly by allowing children to give evidence in civil cases by TV link. Much of the Bill breaks new ground.  At times in the past insufficient emphasis was placed on the rights of the child.  This Bill is a further step in remedying that defect.</P>
    <P>The debate on the rights of unmarried fathers has often been conducted in terms of the competing rights of fathers and mothers.  What has not been fully recognised is the right of the child to both parents.  The change in the law which is being proposed is sensible and modest and provides that the unmarried father and mother of a child can agree that the father will have guardianship and removes the need to go to court.</P>
    <P>Family disputes are a reality and, unfortunately, will be with us in the future.  Every assistance should be given to couples to resolve their differences by agreement rather than by confrontation. That approach should be reflected in our family laws and in our family services.  It is a thousand times better for children as well as parents to proceed by way of negotiation rather than conflict.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a new emphasis on counselling and mediation as alternatives to court proceedings concerning the custody of and access to children.  Mediation and counselling have been very successful in family breakdowns.  Financial assistance will be required to ensure proper counselling <Col N="1347" /> and mediation services are available.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this point when summing up or on Committee Stage. Mediation and counselling services encourage couples in dispute to think in terms of agreeing the custody of and access to their children without the need for court intervention.  It is much easier for couples to agree on when and how they will have access to the children than for a judge. That a court must say a person is only allowed access to his children at certain times seems to be the worst scenario, but unfortunately it has to be done in some cases.  It is important to have access to mediation and to get the couple to negotiate because they are in a much better position to decide on access to their children.</P>
    <P>Before instituting proceedings a solicitor is obliged to discuss reconciliation possibilities with the parents and to supply them with the names and addresses of persons qualified to help effect a reconciliation between them.  As Deputy Penrose said, this is an important part of the Bill.  We must ensure this is a strong provision and that solicitors are obliged to discuss reconciliation because otherwise they may push for court proceedings when a reconciliation could be brought about if the proper services are available.</P>
    <P>Where the proceedings come before the court an adjournment is possible either to assist reconciliation or agreement on custody or access to the children.  The Bill will allow the District Court, where most custody and access cases are dealt with, to order social reports on children.  It will facilitate the giving of evidence by or on behalf of a child in civil proceedings concerning the welfare of the child and allow children to give evidence in civil proceedings by use of closed circuit television.  The Bill also gives the court discretion to allow hearsay evidence.  The general rule against hearsay evidence provides that a statement, other than one made by a person while giving oral evidence is inadmissible as evidence of the facts stated.  It has also been recognised by our courts that in cases concerning children the rule against hearsay evidence is over strict and that some legislation is warranted, allowing always for the principle of fairness to parties in proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Bill is wide, technical and detailed and is in the interests of children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is good legislation but not great legislation.  I welcome it as far as it goes but it does not go far enough.  The Bill reflects the changes that have occurred in society where family patterns have been dramatically altered.  The majority of Irish households live in a formation other than the traditional unit of two married parents and children.  Some people are cohabiting, some live in single parent households and some live alone.  The formality of relationships has been transformed and that change has worked its way through to the point where it is reflected in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> On the role of the unmarried father, the Bill still falls short of what is desirable.  In recent years social legislation has often struggled after social change and all Governments have been party to playing a game of &ldquo;legislative catch up.&rdquo;  That is not necessarily the best way to approach the issue of unmarried fathers.</P>
    <P>Social change means the form has changed, but the substance of the relationship between a child and its parent is fundamental and is unchangeable. It takes two people to create a child and it takes two parents to rear it.  Yet for too long in legal terms fatherhood has been defined in terms of marriage rather than in terms of parentage. Married fathers are treated differently from unmarried fathers.  That will still be the case when this Bill is passed.  Married fathers, for good or ill, have automatic rights unlike unmarried fathers. At present an unmarried father has to go to court to get even limited recognition of his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In providing for the first time that fathers of children born outside marriage will no longer need to resort to court to seek guardianship or custody or their children, the Bill recognises the changing nature of Irish families and that is welcome. While fathers will no longer have to go through the tortuous courts process, unless an application is contested by the mother, they will still not be automatically accorded joint custody or guardianship.  In effect the Bill accords mothers the primary rights and responsibility for children in non-marital situations.  That is not the best outcome of legislation that is trying to meet a new social context.  We should set down the principle, that joint custody is what should be established and if there are reasons &mdash; and I can think of some in certain circumstances &mdash; where it should not be the norm then obviously decisions have to be made and a mother's right has to be recognised.  We have to move on.  I am concerned this Bill is still about women being left holding the baby for good or ill.  We have to recognise there is a responsibility on two people for the child and it does not end until that child is an adult.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant and welcome developments in recent years has been the campaign by unmarried fathers to seek recognition of their rights and responsibilities.  This campaign has not always been supported or understood but it is a welcome development because it acknowledges the desire of many fathers who are not necessarily in a close relationship with the mother of their child to have a close connection with their child. They represent a commitment which has to be valued and respected.  Too often we see fathers who either walk away from their responsibilities or are pushed away from their children.  In the interests of the child both those actions are wrong.  Both deny the child its birthright to have two parents.  Certainly the way being proposed by the organisation, Parental Equality, is one of shared responsibility.  It is true to the needs of those children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the thrust of the Bill proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe. Like others who have spoken in this debate I wish to pay tribute to the former President, Mary Robinson. It is no exaggeration to say that Mary Robinson transformed the Office of President.  In doing so she became the symbol of much that is positive in Ireland.  She reflected and articulated the aspirations of our people in a way that was challenging and provocative.  Mary Robinson said more than once during her tenure that her capacity to do that job derived in no small measure from the mandate she obtained from the people.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in my mind but that the democratic legitimacy of the office is greatly enhanced by the fact that the people or a majority of them have the opportunity to contribute to the election of the Head of State.  That democratic legitimacy is circumscribed currently by a nomination procedure which is seriously restrictive.  The bald fact is that not everyone can become President. Until this year it had been, in effect, necessary for any prospective President to obtain the support of one of the three biggest political parties in the State.  As a result no previous election had more than three candidates and several had only two. The candidates in contested elections were almost always party politicians, and they were invariably men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Robinson presidency has put an end to all that.  It is clear that many people want to look beyond the political parties to find suitable candidates. This is an entirely good thing.  There are many people in public life outside of party politics who possess all the qualities needed to make a good Head of State.  It is perfectly possible that such a person might obtain a nomination from the political parties.  My own party made it clear from an early stage that we would support the candidature of any suitable person who shared our beliefs and values.  The House will forgive me for saying that we have done well to secure the candidacy of an exceptional person.  That said, it would be invidious and unacceptable if individuals were denied a nomination as a result of the nomination procedure which currently applies. There is a powerful argument for extending the <Col N="1350" /> nomination capacity.  The Bill in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe is a worthwhile contribution to that debate.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in passing to the contribution to the Bill by my colleague, Deputy Howlin.  Deputy Howlin dealt with most of the Bill, but there is one technical point that he did not get the opportunity to deal with, the amendment which deals with the supplemental list of electors.  The current position is that that list is closed when the order for a particular poll is taken.  However, a crazy situation can arise where two polls are held on the same day but the order is made on different days.  Exactly that situation arises at the end of this month when the presidential election and the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality are held on the same day.  The order for the referendum was made just yesterday, while the order for the presidential election was made some time ago.  It is possible that certain individuals may be entitled to vote in one poll and not in the other, despite the fact that the two polls are being held on the same day.  Deputy Howlin's amendment seeks to cure this anomaly by providing that such people be entitled to vote in both polls.  This is a relatively minor matter, and I ask the Minister to see whether anything can be done in the short term.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State announced yesterday evening that the Government intends to re-establish the all-party committee on the Constitution. I was a member of that committee in the last Dáil, and I wish to comment on the way it did or did not work.  Since I have very little time available I will have to be blunt.  The committee should not be re-established unless its terms of reference are radically changed.  There is simply no point in the committee and its members thrashing about in all measure of intellectually stimulating debate if there is no realistic chance that its recommendations will be put to the people.  Two things at least must be done.  The Government, and this House, must decide whether to put a new constitution to the people or to engage in what the previous committee described as a rolling series of amendments.  The previous committee wrestled long and hard with this issue, and I am not entirely convinced that we took the right decision. I do not think that the political will exists to put a series of omnibus amendments to the people. In that context there is, sadly, every likelihood that the committee's work, and the work done previously by the constitutional review group, will simply gather dust on the shelf.</P>
    <P>The practise and tradition in this House is that we amend the Constitution only when we have to.  If this Government is of a different mind, or if this House is of a different mind, we should say so explicitly and change the terms of reference appropriately.  The Government must cease the practice whereby issues which may well be the subject of referenda are explicitly excluded from the terms of reference.  It is especially daft that the previous committee was entitled to debate and make recommendations on every issue under the sun except those which were most likely to be <Col N="1351" /> put to the people.  I am thinking, for example, of the issue of Cabinet confidentiality.  One could be forgiven for thinking that it suits governments of every hue to have a committee available to them which they can use as something of a constitutional dustbin.  That is a temptation we should encourage this Government to avoid.</P>
    <P>It simply is not good enough that the fine work done by the constitutional review group should come to naught.  In the first instance, it is a matter for Government and the House to decide in what way the work can be brought to fruition.  Unless this is done the all-party committee will be working in a vacuum; it is little short of a waste of time, albeit an intellectually stimulating one.  In short, we have to decide whether we are serious about constitutional amendment.  If we are, then an all-party committee is a reasonable and sensible way to proceed; to seek consensus in this House, whether it is available or not, is a good thing on such an important issue.  However, if we are not, we should not delude ourselves and the public and say that we simply are not serious.</P>

      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy McDowell discuss the whole question of constitutional reform.  The Taoiseach has already said that he views this issue as a priority, that he is impressed by the reports issued to date by the committee established by the last Dáil.  I take that as a sign that there is an element of political will in relation to this topic, and I agree that the best method of proceeding is to try to achieve agreement, or the maximum possible agreement, in relation to any possible changes, because the Constitution is our basic charter.  It is or should be the statement of first principles in relation to our parliamentary system, our system of Government and the protection of fundamental rights.  If it is to be a statement of first principles we must endeavour in this House and elsewhere to achieve the maximum degree of agreement possible. It is sometimes impossible to secure complete agreement on principles.</P>
      <P>If I had a comment on the committee established by the last Dáil it is that perhaps we strained too hard to establish maximum agreement on points and did not push forward ideas of our own or have the odd minority or dissenting report on different points.  It seems that if one pushes very hard for agreement one ends up, as happens at the marathon council sessions in Brussels, with some very peculiar conclusion that means little to anybody.  That is a danger in pursuing consensus and agreement at all costs.  I agree with Deputy McDowell also that there is little point in establishing a new committee, although I understand the Taoiseach has indicated it is his wish that a new committee be established, unless there is a clear political will to implement the reports of the committee, especially when they are founded on an agreement between the parties and where the proposal is a rational one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> On the Bill, I must confess to being somewhat surprised at its timing because the chairman of the last all-party committee, when it had completed its second report just before the dissolution of the last Dáil, indicated that the next item of business would be the consideration of the presidency of Ireland.  I took it from that comment that there was all-party agreement on this subject that when the committee was re-established after the general election, the all-party committee would look at the presidency and that a political party would not take a unilateral or stroke approach towards this question by introducing a measure in Private Members' time on the subject.  I was very surprised to discover that our former chairperson of the committee is the Deputy proposing this Bill to amend the Constitution. I do not know whether that is an indication that he intends to serve on the committee which may be established by agreement in coming weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I welcome the fact that he has introduced this Bill because it gives us an opportunity to look at this subject which is topical when two candidates have been nominated by county councils for the office of President. The odd attempt was made in the past to secure a nomination but this is the first occasion on which a local authority has nominated a candidate for the office.  I welcome this and the fact that the two candidates nominated will have their names submitted to the people.  It is welcome that this procedure in the Constitution has been availed of to broaden the choice available to the people.  I must confess that it might have been better from the point of view of the Fianna Fáil interest in the last presidential election if more consideration had been given to the utilisation of this procedure.  I will not, however, trespass for too long on that ground.</P>
      <P>A distinction is drawn in the Constitution &mdash; this is an important point and I presume it was very much in the mind of the principal drafter, Mr. de Valera &mdash; between what I would call the principles of deliberative and direct democracy. Under the principle of direct democracy the people, as a group, make decisions, in keeping with the old Athenian idea of the city gathering in the close and making a direct decision.  Our system is based on the principle of representative democracy.  The Constitution tries to strike a balance between these two principles in various ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1922 Constitution contained a provision for a popular initiative to amend the Constitution. When established in 1926 my party attempted to avail of this procedure but it was eliminated from the Constitution by the predecessor <Col N="1353" /> of the party of the Deputies who have introduced this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of eliminating a certain oath of subjection to His Britannic Majesty as he was then designated in the constitutional documentation.  When the present Constitution was drawn up Mr. de Valera was not so bold as to restore the idea of a popular initiative to change the Constitution.  He decided that before any proposal to amend the Constitution could be submitted to the people both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to give it a solid bill of health.  The principle of deliberative democracy would come into play, an appropriate proposal would have to be formulated which, after due deliberation, would be submitted to the people for their consideration.  A group of citizens cannot unilaterally decide to amend the Constitution, although my party when founded thought that was a good idea.  It was prevented, in a way the Supreme Court would not allow in modern times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people were deprived of an opportunity of pronouncing on it at the time.  I am illustrating the point that there is a distinction between the principles of deliberative and direct democracy.</P>
      <P>Under Article 27 of the Constitution a Bill can be submitted to the people for their decision in a referendum but this provision has never been invoked.  It would require a majority of Senators and one-third of Deputies to petition the President that the will of the people should be ascertained. Again, the principle of deliberative democracy would come into play.  A Bill would have to be formulated and the request would have to come from both Houses of the Oireachtas which would be in conflict before the people would be asked to express their approval or disapproval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same principle comes into play in relation to the President.  It is provided in the Constitution that the initiative in relation to the choice does not rest with the people but with 20 or more Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or four county councils or county boroughs.  The reason for this is clear in the choice Mr. de Valera proposed, with the agreement of the Opposition parties, in 1938 for the first office of President.  Dr. Hyde was agreed as President in 1938 without a vote of the people.  It was envisaged when the Constitution was drawn up that if the different political interests could agree on a candidate, that would be an appropriate candidate because he or she commanded overwhelming confidence and respect among the people.  The principle of deliberative democracy came into play in the selection of President in restricting the nomination procedure to designated classes so that there would <Col N="1354" /> be due deliberation about who should be put forward for the office before the element of popular consultation, through an election, came into play. There can only be popular consultation in relation to the office of President if there is disagreement among the nominators.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that this is an ideal scheme but it is clear, if one looks at the Constitution, that it is a consistent scheme; it is a consistent way of balancing the principles of deliberative and direct democracy.  The principle of direct democracy only comes into play when it has been decided there should be popular consultation.  This strand runs through the Constitution.  One of the reasons for this is that democrats in the 1930s &mdash; there can be no question but that Mr. de Valera was a firm democrat in the 1930s &mdash; were very concerned about the development of autocratic entities in continental Europe, many of which relied on this kind of bogus appeal to direct democracy at the expense of representative institutions.  That is one of the reasons the deliberative element is built into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>A number of commentators have suggested that there are similarities between the provisions of the 1937 Constitution and the provisions of the Weimar Constitution in Germany after the First World War.  It was the late John Kelly who first made the comparison but it has since been taken up by a number of legal commentators and commentators in the popular press.  In his rise to power Hitler contested the presidential election in the Weimar Republic against Field Marshal Hindenburg in the 1920s and received an impressive vote although not elected.  When they looked again at their basic law after the last war one of the reasons the Germans restricted suffrage to the two Houses of Parliament and stopped a popular election of their president was concern about the potential for abuse in an attempt by some charismatic autocratic figure to impose his will on the populace.  The Germans have not alone limited the range of persons who can nominate the president but also the electorate to an electoral college comprising the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament.  That remains the electoral college to this day for their office of president which, like the office of President here, is essentially a symbolic one, a symbol of the state, although the President here has, as we are aware, certain real constitutional powers.  As one commentator said, he or she is a constitutional lán stop in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>We should look at this Bill with some caution because it does not strike the correct balance between those two competing principles.  The proposal is that a group of citizens of not less than 20,000 entitled to vote in a presidential election should be allowed to nominate a candidate. Deputy O'Keeffe made the case that the current constitutional provisions are far too restrictive. The Dáil and the Seanad comprise 226 Members with a potential for 11 nominations, although because of the whip system of party discipline there would probably be three nominations in <Col N="1355" /> practice.  That has been the case since 1937.  I accept that, given the contours of political support in both Houses, it is difficult to get beyond three nominations.</P>
    <P>There are 34 county councils and boroughs and, as we have seen in recent days, it is possible for party members on those authorities to permit other members to put forward a candidate, to whom nobody has an objection, by abstaining. That candidate is then deemed to be nominated by that council and the returning officer receives the sealed resolution of the local authority nominating a given candidate.  The 34 local authorities thus present the possibility of a further eight nominations, so we arrive at a figure of 11 candidates for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy O'Keeffe that if we had 11 candidates running for the office that would be sufficient.  To push it beyond that would resemble United States elections where one must vote for every municipal office and where hundreds of names appear on the ballot papers.  Eleven candidates offer quite a wide choice for the electorate and our present constitutional arrangements permit that number of candidates.</P>
    <P>I agree, however, that the period of time available for local authorities to deliberate on this matter can be somewhat short and that is a problem. The supporters of one candidate referred to 29 September as super Monday in terms similar to the American presidential race.  Given the timing and sequence of different local authority meetings it would be optimistic to assume that up to eight nominations would ensue from those deliberations.</P>
    <P>In the next presidential election a substantial number of candidates will seek nominations from local authorities, assuming the system has not changed, and is that such a bad thing?  Can local authorities not consider the merits of different individuals in a deliberative way?  In that case a number of them will be given an opportunity of contesting the highest office in the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be much confusion about the party whip, but I do not think the whip has any jurisdiction in relation to councils. That was certainly demonstrated in the case of our party where Clare, that ancient stronghold, gave the lead and allowed Mr. Nally to procure his nomination through the device of abstention.</P>
      <P>I see a number of problems relating to the practicalities of allowing 20,000 citizens to name a candidate.  One relates to Article 12.4.3 of the Constitution which states:</P>
      <P>No person and no such Council shall be entitled to subscribe to the nomination of more than one candidate in respect of the same election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> That principle is worked out through the Presidential Elections Act so that, for example, in the case of the Oireachtas the returning officer checks and verifies that no Deputy's name appears on two different nomination papers.  In the case of councils there is a rule that if a council was to submit two nominations, the first nomination lodged is the valid one.  Anyone familiar with local authority practice and the frequency of motions at local authorities would understand that is a possibility.  However, that is circumvented by the Presidential Elections Act which provides that the first nomination is the valid one for the purposes of the Act and the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If you were to extend that principle in this measure you would have to have a provision that no citizen would be entitled to sign more than one candidate's nomination.  After all, if Members of the Oireachtas are limited to nominating only one candidate and councils are also restricted to selecting one, it would be only appropriate to restrict the citizen to nominating one candidate.  Logically, however, it would be difficult to implement that principle in terms of nominations.  The returning officer would have to verify whether 20,000 separate names appearing on a presidential election register did not correspond with the nominations papers of another candidate who had also submitted upwards of 20,000 names.  That is only one type of objection the returning officer would have to deal with in ruling on the nomination and it is a measure of how impractical the proposal is if one looks at the present constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>If you allow that principle to operate, and given an electorate well in excess of one million, you are potentially allowing a very big number of candidates to run in a presidential election.  While not more than three or four nominations may come from the Houses of the Oireachtas and not more than five or six &mdash; let us be optimistic &mdash; may stem from local authorities, I have no doubt that if that provision were enacted into law and 20,000 citizens could name a candidate for the office of President, there would be stalls on Dublin's O'Connell Bridge, in Westport, at the bridge of Athlone, in Limerick and in Patrick's Street in Cork as well.  We would have a great number of candidates running for the office of President on a single transferable vote system.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but on a 70th preference.  I wonder if that is appropriate?  Under the present presidential electoral procedure there is no <Col N="1357" /> deposit.  The screening procedure in relation to nominations is designed to ensure that a frivolous or vexatious candidate does not go forward.  If we are not going to have a deposit, and a deposit seems somewhat inappropriate in a presidential election, why not have some system regarding nominations?  That is what the present constitutional arrangements essentially provide for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the present arrangements are unduly restrictive.  There is scope for some additional number of candidates. One way of addressing the problem would be to allow the nominating bodies listed for Seanad elections to have a role in nominating presidential candidates.  There is a long list of such nominating bodies for the Seanad which are all reputable vocational bodies.  They have a foundation in the Constitution where the qualifications and occupations of different panels are set out in detail. Under statute we already have experience of the Clerk of the Seanad certifying that these bodies are of reputable character, have a defined set of objectives and have a membership.</P>
      <P>We could amend the Constitution to provide, for example, that a certain number, say four like the local authorities, of nominating bodies recognised for vocational purposes for Seanad elections would be free to put forward a candidate. That would allow a proper nomination procedure to exist.</P>
      <P>These bodies have had little influence on Seanad elections because we know the Seanad electorate is very much a political &ldquo;selectorate&rdquo;. The nominating bodies occasionally and rather quaintly put forward a candidate who has no connection with party politics but has an obvious qualification for the particular panel.  That person then suffers the ignominy of procuring two votes in a Seanad election, although through the accident of Seanad electoral legislation it appears to the outside world as 2,000 votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that procedure has curious effects in the Seanad electoral system, it would not be a bad system for nominating presidential candidates. The objection that is being made to the present nominating procedure is that worthy citizens who have no necessary connection with any party are deprived of the opportunity of having their name put forward for the Office of President.  If there <Col N="1358" /> was a certification procedure which rested on the vocational bodies organised in the State, it would give persons in different walks of life an opportunity to put forward such a candidate in a Seanad election.  I canvass that idea as a way of loosening up the nominating procedure while at the same time safeguarding the procedure against the kind of abuse which would take place if Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's proposal was accepted by the House, such as the collection of signatures and the administrative complications which could arise.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's point that this procedure has been brought into operation in other jurisdictions and a designated number of citizens can verify a nomination paper.  We are one of the most political races in the world and, unlike Slovenia or other jurisdictions referred to by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, there will be abuse in this jurisdiction if it is brought in on such a wide-scale basis.</P>

      <P>My alternative proposal is worthy of examination because it is consistent with the spirit of the Constitution in providing for an element of deliberation in the selection of a candidate through these Houses, the councils or the nominating bodies recognised at Seanad elections.  If a group of four nominating bodies was free to put forward a candidate for the office, that would considerably broaden the present arrangement.  It would allow persons outside party politics to put their names forward for the office.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of guff about the fact this is not a political office.  It is not a party political office but it is the highest political office in the land.  We should recognise that in the next few weeks as we go into the presidential election campaign.</P>

      <Col N="1359" /> Other Deputies referred to President Robinson and it would be remiss of me not to praise her for the outstanding work she did.  I was concerned as she approached her resignation to notice the number of commentators who suggested that she had not been a politician and that she had been beyond politics.  President Robinson was a Member of the Upper House for many years and a radical politician who initiated many changes in the State, although she was not a politician who occupied ministerial office.</P>
    <P>This is a political office.  We are talking about politics when considering amendments to the Constitution; we are not talking about a competition which resembles a beauty contest.  We are talking about an arrangement which should reflect the wish of the people to a broad choice but should, at the same time, acknowledge that politics enters the equation.  There is an element of deliberation in deciding who should be President.</P>

Beidh deis ag na daoine iarrathóir a mholadh agus má tá an deis sin ann ní bheidh siad ag gearráin as seo amach.</P>
      <P>This Bill is topical because people are unhappy that they have no choice in the selection of candidates. I do not agree with that view because, as politicians, we represent the people.  The core vote of the two main parties suggests that over half the people have a say, either directly or indirectly, in selecting us.  I accept that the present system leaves the choice in the hands of politicians. As Deputy Lenihan said, it is a political post, although some people think it is a beauty contest.</P>
      <P>This year county councils have created headlines by exercising their right to nominate candidates. They did so more freely this time because of the absence of any other system.  Councillors took this decision seriously because they regarded it as a privilege.  Deputy Lenihan said this would result in more candidates putting their names before county councils in the future. However, that would not happen if there was an alternative system.  Many councillors felt that if individuals wanted to present themselves as candidates for the presidential election, councils should facilitate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes that 20,000 people would be sufficient to nominate a candidate.  Deputy McGrath explained how each person could be given a registered number.  This would mean <Col N="1360" /> people would not have to stand in O'Connell Street or go to Killarney or Tralee to get signatures. If the public demands that a popular candidate should stand before the people, 1,000 people in 20 counties could be asked to sign their nomination papers.  This procedure, which would have to be taken seriously, would give the people an opportunity to nominate someone they wanted.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I congratulate Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for his work as chairman of the all-party committee on the Constitution.  Deputy Lenihan referred to the Seanad elections.  Nominating bodies have the privilege of nominating someone, yet they have no say in the election which is controlled by politicians.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution is 60 years old.  It had as narrow a victory as Kerry had last Sunday when it was first introduced.  It was probably a good Constitution then but time has moved on and we should review it.  I welcome this Bill which will ensure people are not deprived of their rights.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because he would be in the courts every day.  I hope the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Dan Wallace, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will accept this Bill.  Recently, we lost probably the greatest President since the foundation of the State, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and people from County Mayo were disappointed that she was not at Croke Park on Sunday last for the All-Ireland football final.  There are many who believe Mayo lost the final because the Taoiseach replaced Mrs. Robinson, who could not be present to welcome our team.</P>
      <P>As a representative of County Mayo, it would be wrong if I did not congratulate Mary Robinson who was an excellent President, the people's President.  Only one of the current candidates could claim that title.  I compliment Deputy Lenihan who correctly stated that we require someone with political experience who has served in parliament, be that the Dáil or the European Parliament.  Mary Banotti is ably suited and I hope Deputy Lenihan and other members of Fianna Fáil will give her their first preference votes.  I believe she will win the election and become the next &ldquo;people's&rdquo; President.  However, that is another day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed with Fianna Fáil and Deputy Lenihan in particular because they do not want to permit the people to select a candidate.  I see nothing wrong with having 25 candidates in the field.  If a person has £300 he can approach the returning officer and stand for election to the Dáil.  I see nothing wrong with the idea of 1,000 <Col N="1361" /> people nominating a candidate.  Certain political correspondents stated that county councillors would not be able to make a decision to nominate candidates for the presidential election.  I compliment the county councillors who nominated two candidates for the election.  They have done well and shown a certain maturity.  A Whip should not be applied to a county council if it wants to select a candidate to seek election as President.  I compliment Mary Banotti because she was one of the few who stated that she had no objection to county councils using their power.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming election should be held on a Friday.  The recent general election was held on a Friday and the polling booths were open from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. It worked well because students and people who worked away from home could return to their localities to vote.  We have returned to the bad old days.  The Government talks about democracy and giving people an opportunity to vote.  The Minister of State will indicate the postal vote will suffice.  However, the way that system operated last week was a disgrace. Some students only returned to college on Monday and Tuesday of last week and the postal vote closed on Tuesday.  That was wrong.  People should not be deprived of their votes.</P>
    <P>The Government should hold the election on a Friday, even if an Act of the Oireachtas is required to do so.  Legislation was hurriedly introduced in the past when banks and Goodman International were in trouble and a Bill should be laid before the House recommending that the election be held on a Friday.  It is wrong that individuals should be deprived of the chance to vote on Friday.  Even at this late stage the Government should reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and McGrath on introducing this Bill.  There is nothing wrong with individuals putting their names before the people for election.  We live in a democracy and people should have the right to vote and to seek election without depending on the political system to gain a nomination.  If the people are to have a proper choice, they should have the right to nominate candidates.  There is no point in stating the system will be abused. Every person has an RSI number used to facilitate social welfare payments, headage payments, etc.  We are in the age of computers and I see nothing wrong with people being registered to vote by means of their RSI numbers.  This would be a simple system.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will accept this Bill and permit democracy to live on.  I congratulate the candidates for allowing their names to go forward for election as this will ensure we have a contest for the position of President.  For many years the Presidency was decided by the political chiefs.  It was given to the person to whom they felt they owed most, to people who used Áras an Uachta-ráin as a retirement home and claimed a nice pension. That will no longer be the case.  The people will choose from the five excellent candidates in <Col N="1362" /> the field.  I am confident Mary Banotti will be the next President of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is probable substance in Deputy Ring's theory that the absence of Mrs. Robinson led to Mayo's demise in the All-Ireland football final on Sunday last.  It augurs well for Dublin's chances in next year's football championship because I believe the next President will come from Dublin.  Perhaps she can also lend support to the Cork team when it plays.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I commend Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and McGrath for the work they have done in introducing this Bill.  It is heartening to see the speed with which this legislation was published. That arose from a request made at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting at which Mary Banotti sought the party's nomination.  It was made clear the selection process for nomination to seek election to the Presidency required amendment.  Fine Gael, through Deputies O'Keeffe and McGrath, took up that request and this legislation has been brought forward.</P>
      <P>During last night's debate a number of Members asked why the legislation is being introduced at this time.  It is being introduced because the presidential election, for which the people are currently nominating candidates, will take place at the end of the month.  Some of us may not be in the House in 2003 to share our wisdom regarding how the public responded to the nomination process and how it indicated that it was unhappy with that process.  Some of the younger Members may be here at that stage, like myself, however, they will be dependent on the electorate in that regard.  It is important that when an anomaly is perceived we should seek to amend it.</P>
      <P>I will cite an example where lack of action can cause great problems for people.  In 1986, when Fine Gael and Labour were in Government, an amendment to the Nationality and Citizenship Act was introduced to allow people to claim their Irish citizenship under certain conditions.  Those people were obliged to lodge their applications by 31 December 1986.  No assessment was made of the numbers who intended to make such applications. In the event, thousands of people in America, South Africa, Australia and other parts of the world queued to make their applications which were received but not registered by 31 December, as required by law.  In January 1987 the then Government, which was approaching the end of its term of office, was advised that the legislation required a minor amendment to allow the applications to be considered properly.  Following the election in February 1987, that amendment was misplaced when the new Government entered office and made plans to implement its own legislative programme.  It was many years before the amendment was made.  Therefore, people who genuinely wanted to become Irish citizens were denied that right for approximately five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to that example because if something needs to be done it should be done when the need <Col N="1363" /> for action becomes apparent, not in March or April of 2003 when we will be involved in the maelstrom of another presidential election.  At that stage, people will say this matter was discussed seven years ago and ask why something was not done.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has just come into the House.  I hope the Progressive Democrats will convince those on the other side of the House that this Bill is timely and appropriate.  It is necessary to prepare for the next presidential election so people will have a genuine chance to have their voices heard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan raised a number of issues about the mechanics of 20,000 electors signing nomination papers and the verification process. Other countries have found a way to do that without difficulty or scandal.  I was on holidays in Switzerland last year where the preliminary stages of a referendum were being held.  A stall was set up in the marketplace where people could sign the register.  In some cantons, if 10,000 signatures are collected, a referendum can be held. Switzerland is a great country for holding referenda on various issues.  It is not beyond the wisdom of officials in the Department of the Environment and others to devise a system whereby 20,000 signatures can be collected and verified without any difficulty.  In seven years' time, who knows what identification we will be carrying? Perhaps we will have a uniform identity card, which is happening in other European countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan said there could be many candidates.  It is better to have many candidates rather than the situation which pertained in 1938, 1952, 1974, 1976 and 1983.  In these years there was no competition in the Presidential election and the one person whose name was put forward was successful.  This may seem an easy process. Having helped my sister canvass for the nomination of a parliamentary party, there were moments when I thought it would be easier if she did not have to go through it.  However, she went through it, came out the other end and is now a fine candidate for the Presidency.  She was probably strengthened by the preliminary competition.</P>
    <P>Article 12.4.4 states that &ldquo;Former or retiring Presidents may become candidates on their own nomination.&rdquo;  I assume that in seven years' time, if the new President decides she wants to offer another seven years' service, that Article will allow her to become a candidate without going through the nomination procedures.  Our great colleague, John Kelly, in <i>The Irish Constitution</i> says that this Article was interpreted by one President as being an optional facility rather than a direction.  I do not know whether that provision will ever be used again.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember some of the roles of the President.  When the 1937 Constitution was debated in May and June 1937, the then Opposition was apprehensive that the Presidency, as outlined in the draft Constitution, would evolve into a dictatorship.  However, as <Col N="1364" /> John Kelly said, the precedence accorded to the President by Article 12.1 is purely a ceremonial one.  There is no danger that the President will become a dictator.</P>
    <P>The President is the supreme commander of the Defence Forces, which is an important role.  I would like the incoming President &mdash; and I hope it will be Mary Banotti &mdash; to utilise this role to its full potential.  The Army has served us well, particularly in recent years as it has expanded its peacekeeping role throughout the world and worked in areas where outside intervention was needed in the holding of elections to enable people to exercise their democratic right.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the former President, Mary Robinson.  It seems strange to use the term &ldquo;former&rdquo; as she became so much part of our life in her seven years of office.  When I heard someone refer to her as our former President, I realised she was no longer in that position.  She has gone on to represent Ireland in Geneva as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and we wish her well.</P>
    <P>All our Presidents have served the country well, but in the last seven years we became more engaged in the Presidency.  I hope that with the passage of this legislation the people will continue to have faith in, and support, not only the Presidency but also the procedure for the nomination and selection of candidates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Deputies for sharing their time with me and I compliment Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on proposing this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is seven years since we debated the method of presidential nominations.  That debate also coincided with a presidential election.  If the Government does not accept this Bill &mdash; and I ask them to do so or at least admit it for debate on Committee Stage &mdash; it will be another seven years before the issue is debated again, on the eve of another presidential election.</P>
      <P>It is 60 years since the rules governing the nomination of the President were established in the 1937 Constitution.  That was in a different era, 15 years after the foundation of the State, just over a decade after the end of a bitter civil war. It was a time when the relationship between the public and politics and that between the Houses of the Oireachtas was different from now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Brian Lenihan that the Presidency is a political office and there is a great deal of nonsense spoken about the office being apolitical or not having power.  The President has significant powers &mdash; for example the power to dissolve this House, a power which we should reflect on, especially when there is, in effect, a minority Government.  Although the power was not used during the lifetime of the last presidential incumbent and the last Dáil, the fact that the President had the power and indicated her disposition to use it as well as her discretion in exercising it, helped to create the circumstances which resulted in a change of Government in the life of <Col N="1365" /> the last Dáil, without the necessity of a general election.</P>
    <P>The Presidency carries considerable power &mdash; the power to refer Bills to the Supreme Court, in addition to the many persuasive powers and roles so ably developed by President Robinson.  It would be a mistake to think that politics is the exclusive property of the political apparatus.  What has developed in the course of the last seven years is the sense that, of all the political offices, the presidency belongs uniquely to the people.  The people have a sense of ownership of the presidency because it is the only office which is elected directly by the entire electorate.  It is somewhat archaic that a candidate is nominated for the presidency exclusively through the formal representative political process.  The time has now come to extend that and allow groups of individual citizens the right to nominate candidates for the presidency directly.</P>
    <P>I was quite interested to hear Deputy Lenihan speak of a fear of too many candidates.  This has not been a problem, certainly not for the office of President nor, indeed, for any of the other political offices which are elected by the people.  If anything, the era in which we are now entering is one in which there is a shortage of candidates of calibre offering for political office.  The prospect of there being too many candidates is not one which we ought to fear.  We should look at ways and means by which additional candidates can be attracted to stand for the office of President or, indeed, other public offices.</P>
    <P>There is an additional reason that the Government should accept this Bill and allow it proceed to Committee Stage, that is, that it will also give an opportunity to debate some other reforms in relation to the conditions surrounding the nomination for the presidency and the presidency itself.  First, I fail to understand the reason a candidate must be over 35 years of age.  A citizen who is entitled to vote ought to be entitled to be nominated as a candidate for the presidency.  That condition ought to be revisited as we enter a new century.</P>
    <P>A second provision which should be revisited is the term of office of the presidency.  A seven-year term is a long period.  It is interesting that President Robinson, who is acknowledged as having done an excellent job, did not serve a full term and she certainly did not offer to serve a second term.  Fourteen years, the period of two presidential terms, is an excessive period for somebody to serve as President.  Some consideration should be given to reducing the length of the presidential term of office.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this Bill is before the House.  If, for example, the local authorities had not responded to the requests of Mrs. Scallon and Mr. Nally to consider their candidacies for the presidency, there would now be a serious political issue as between the public who want to see a wider nomination process than is currently afforded by the political system and the limitation <Col N="1366" /> of the number of candidates which the political system can offer.  As we enter a new century, the time has come to allow the public a right to nominate a candidate directly.  The kind of practical difficulties about which Deputy Lenihan spoke are easily addressed, particularly due to the availability of information technology the usage of which will inevitably increase.  To some extent the political system has been slow in using the information technology that is available to provide new ways of involving the public in the political process.  This is one practical way in which it can be done and I urge the Government to accept the Bill and to allow for a more free, open and democratic method of nominating candidates for the presidency.</P>

Last March we expressed concern that one route to presidential nomination &mdash; that of local government &mdash; had never been utilised despite the laudable efforts of the authors of the Constitution to extend the nomination process beyond the Oireachtas.  All has changed in the few months since, with first Dana, Rosemary Scallon, and this week Derek Nally, securing the support of four local authorities and thus becoming candidates for the forthcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Members of local authorities who supported the two nominations should be commended for exercising the powers given to them by the Constitution. We now face the prospect of an intriguing and exciting election campaign with a record number of candidates and I wish them well.  I am happy to note that the candidate supported by the two parties in Government, Mary McAleese, is performing well and has wide public support.  Anybody who goes forward for election as President needs stamina and courage.  Given that the outgoing President made such achievements in office people have a high expectation regarding her successor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some might argue that the exercise of this hitherto dormant local authority nomination tool is in itself sufficient to allay the concerns of those of us who have strongly criticised the fact that the selection of candidates has been the preserve of the major political parties for too long.  It is a welcome development and we can expect this nomination <Col N="1367" /> option to be used more frequently in the future.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest the results of an opinion poll published in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  The survey, carried out by MRBI as part of its overall polling on the presidential election, asked respondents whether they favoured any change in the present system of nomination.  Some 20 per cent had no opinion, while the remaining 80 per cent divided fairly evenly.  The figures show a slight majority opposed to any change, at 42 per cent compared to 38 per cent in favour.  However, Deputies will appreciate that a difference of that order is not significant when account is taken of the margin of error in an opinion poll.</P>

      <P>A figure of 38 per cent support is not bad.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  On the basis of these figures, it would be a mistake to assume that public support for a change in the nomination procedure is a foregone conclusion.  The public debate on the issue is at an early stage and very little analysis, if any, of the arguments for and against such a change has been teased out in the media.  If it is the case that public opinion is evenly balanced on the question at this stage, then it is clear that, if we attempt to change the procedures by way of a referendum on a constitutional amendment, the outcome will depend on how the public reacts to the various arguments which have yet to be put before it.  This makes it all the more important that these arguments receive a proper and detailed examination.</P>
      <P>The Government will not oppose giving the Bill a Second Reading.  In this spirit of co-operation, I ask Deputies O'Keeffe and McGrath to agree to refer the Bill to the all-party committee which is to be re-established.  It can then be considered along with other matters concerning the presidency in the Constitution so that we may have a composite set of proposals to consider and eventually put to the people.  This would be a preferable approach, especially as there is plenty of time, rather than going to the people on single issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several other issues relating to the presidency which have also been raised for consideration in recent times, such as the age restriction on candidates, and whether the franchise should be extended to British citizens resident here or to Irish citizens resident abroad.  If we have a number of referenda on these and other single issues we might be responsible for voter fatigue with a consequent low turnout for such very important matters as constitutional change. With regard to the proposal in the Bill that 20,000 signatures would be sufficient to nominate a candidate for the office of presidency, I must suggest that the method of verifying such signatures should be given greater consideration.  The report of the Constitutional Review Group recognised that &ldquo;validation of such nominations would be <Col N="1368" /> difficult&rdquo;.  Contributors to the debate last evening also recognised these difficulties and made some suggestions to overcome them.  In fairness to the returning officer who will have responsibility for deciding on the validity of a nomination paper, Members of this House will have to have regard to the realities of life.  It is easy to contend that a person should quote his or her number on the register of electors but how many people know their number?  How many people know that they have a number on the register of electors?  How can abuse of the system be avoided without creating a whole new layer of bureaucracy?  In addition there is the timescale involved.  It is very easy to argue that computers should be used or that the matter should be &ldquo;prescribed by law&rdquo; but its implementation is not so straightforward.</P>
    <P>I raise these questions not with any intention of being negative &mdash; the Government is very positive with regard to the objective of this Bill, which is to democratise the process for the nominations to the office of presidency &mdash; and certainly not to say we shall not legislate because such would be inconvenient for officials, rather to point out that the matter should be thoroughly examined.  Since the time is available we should be able to get it right.  We politicians, and I include all parties, are often accused of rushing legislation through this House.  This is one occasion when time constraints cannot be pleaded as a reason for rushing this Bill through.  We are prepared to consider at an early date any recommendations the re-established all-party committee will advance on constitutional matters concerning the presidency.</P>
    <P>This debate has been a useful one and, as I explained already, the Government will not oppose the Bill's Second Reading.  The all-party committee represents the appropriate mechanism by which to examine the issue in the detail it warrants.</P>
    <P>I will respond to the specific inquiries of Deputy Howlin and Deputy McDowell with regard to the two polls and the closing date for supplements to the postal voters' list.  Voting by postal voters is an important element in the procedure for the taking of polls.  To enable a supplement to the postal voters' list to be prepared which would be used for the two polls regulations have been made which provide <i>inter alia</i> that the date of the order appointing polling day for the referendum, made yesterday, is the last date for applications for entry in the supplement in respect of both the presidential election and the referendum.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Act, l992, makes special provisions where two or more polls are held on the same date.  Among other things it gives the Minister power, by direction, order or regulation to provide for such matters as he considers necessary whenever two or more polls are held together.  Therefore, he may, by direction, order or regulation, effect such modification of the Acts, orders or regulations relating to an election or referendum to enable both polls be taken together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> I congratulate the two Deputies who proposed the Bill and am glad to be able to report that we will not oppose its Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleagues, Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Paul McGrath, on the publication of this Bill at an early stage in the life of this Dáil.  I welcome the positive comments of the Minister, Deputy O'Donnell.  I am glad the Government is not opposing this Bill and is letting it proceed to Committee Stage where its effective implementation will be examined.  That is good work on the part of the Minister and I congratulate her for it.  I hope it is the spirit which will prevail in this House in the months ahead.  I had the privilege of serving as a Senator in the last Seanad and the co-operation between Government and Opposition on Private Members' Bills was exceptionally useful in ensuring Opposition Members felt they had a relevance and a determination in the legislation of the House.  This is an important night and I congratulate the Government on its actions.</P>
      <P>At a time when involvement in politics is at an all-time low and when it is particularly difficult to get people involved in politics &mdash; every party in this House knows this well &mdash; we should be doing everything in our power to encourage the participation of ordinary people in political activity. Whether it is signing a candidate's nomination paper, getting involved in a political party or taking to the streets about a certain issue, everything should be done by way of legislation and by way of our Constitution to ensure maximum participation. We should not restrict participation in politics by archaic provisions in the Constitution. That is the central idea behind this Bill.  We want to extend the nominating process; we want to get more people involved.  The more this is done, the less cynicism there will be about politics and that is surely something every party and all Members of this and the other House would support.</P>
      <P>I wish to make two brief points.  First, it is archaic that an age bar of 35 should exist for the Presidency and I will say why.  On my first day in the Dáil, I technically could have held the position of Ceann Comhairle.  When the President resigns or vacates office for some reason, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and the President of the High Court form a presidential commission whose function it is to take over the role of the Presidency in the interregnum. I could have been elected as Ceann Comhairle at the age of 21 and could have performed the role and function of President, which is contradictory to the constitutional provision barring my standing for the office of President. The provision is unfair.  It sends out a negative message to young people and something must be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> Secondly, there was talk about changing the day of the election from Thursday to Friday.  I have no great problem with that, but I proposed on another occasion that polling day should be Sunday, as in every other European Union country. We should move speedily towards that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Paul McGrath on excellent work over the past two evenings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">

      <P>This debate has been good for democracy in the manner in which it has been conducted and its outcome is an addition to the democratic system.  I congratulate all those who contributed &mdash; my co-sponsor, Deputy McGrath, the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, Deputies Howlin, McDowell, Lenihan, Browne, Ring, Owen and Gilmore, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and Deputy Hayes.  I acknowledge that the Progressive Democrats, as far back as 1988, were the first to conceive the idea of a people's initiative &mdash; they suggested 30,000 electors should be able to nominate a candidate for the presidency.  I am glad all parties in the House accept the broad principle that a people's initiative is the right approach &mdash; they should have the right to nominate a candidate and that right should not be solely confined to the political or local authority process, the latter of which is dominated by the political process in any event.  I am also glad the Bill will not be opposed and will receive a Second Reading.</P>
      <P>I have little difficulty with the proposal of the Minister, Deputy O'Donnell, except on a technical point.  Procedurally, under Standing Orders, when a Private Members' Bill is accepted it must be referred either to a special committee or a select committee and that is the order the Cheann Comhairle will have to make on the conclusion of these proceedings.  I have the greatest respect for the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution &mdash; why should I not, since I was privileged to chair it for a year and it produced such excellent results?  However, I am not certain whether one can follow that approach procedurally because it is not a select committee within the meaning of Standing Orders.  I will be guided by the officials of the House as to the appropriate next step to further process the Bill on Committee Stage and I hope to receive more input from colleagues as to how the Bill might be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoption of this measure puts us in line with the other democratic countries of Europe.  Last night I mentioned those countries where the people are entitled to nominate a presidential candidate.  My colleague, Deputy Owen, referred to the difficulties in the nomination process of Switzerland, a country I had not mentioned.  She was not speaking of the nomination of the President of Switzerland but of the many referenda which are a feature of the Swiss democratic system. Those proposing a referendum set up stalls on the street and are armed with the register of electors.  This returns us to the point made by <Col N="1371" /> Deputy McGrath &mdash; by connecting the name of the elector to his or her reference number on the register, the nomination process can be properly validated.  There may be other and better ways of doing this but colleagues will have the opportunity on Committee Stage to consider this further.  The advice of the able experts in the Department of the Environment will produce a system which will be as effective and good as those which operate in other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan always makes interesting and provocative contributions but I cannot accept his view that there is a danger of too many candidates being nominated if &mdash; and, I hope, when &mdash; this provision becomes part of our Constitution. There is no danger of a surfeit of democracy. Such a concept is a contradiction in terms. Democracy is about having a number of candidates, and what would it matter if we had seven or eight?  Democracy should encourage as many people as possible, within reason, to become involved.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the presidential election there is no deposit payable.  The £300 deposit helps to clear general election lists of frivolous Dáil aspirants. We do not want people like Screaming Lord Sutch, who brings amusement to UK politics, appearing on our presidential ballot paper. However, there are people who feel that their views are representative of a section of the electorate and who may wish to stand but feel blocked because of the existing nomination process.  I disagree with the views of those people, but they should be encouraged to put themselves before the electorate if they so choose.  This is what democracy is about and it would improve our democratic system.</P>
    <P>The same view was brought to the fore in the second report of the All-party Committee on the Constitution in relation to Seanad elections. There should be provision for direct elections to the Seanad and with the approval of my colleagues on the all-party committee I suggested a means of achieving this.  The same thinking underlines this current proposal and I am delighted that a major step forward is being taken in accepting this Bill.  We will take advice on how to proceed, but we are now over the main hurdle. Deputy McGrath and I will be delighted to listen to suggestions for amendments to the Bill.  Thereafter, we hope it will pass through both Houses and subsequently be presented to the people.</P>
    <P>We need a programme of constitutional reform to address this and many other issues.  It is not wise to have too many proposals thrown at the people at the one time.  I accept there is an expense attached to having too many referenda, particularly ones not associated with other voting occasions.  In the years ahead I hope to see a group of constitutional amendments being put before the people coinciding with local elections, the next general election, which may be sooner than we think, and the next presidential and European Parliament elections.  We should avail <Col N="1372" /> of the opportunity of people going to the polls to present to them a limited number of constitutional amendments put through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues for their reaction to this Bill and in that spirit of co-operation I am sure we will clear the outstanding hurdles and ensure a constitutional referendum is put to the people prior to the next presidential election.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and the Minister for accepting the question. The matter I raise involves a serious assault on an Irish actor, Gerry Browne, at Liverpool's Speke Airport on Tuesday and raises a number of serious issues about the manner in which Irish people are treated at British ports and airports.</P>
      <P>The facts as I understand them are as follows. Gerry Browne arrived at the airport with his business partner, Brendan O'Carroll, on a flight from Dublin on Tuesday morning.  Both were appearing at the Neptune Theatre in the city.  The flight was full of people on their way to attend the Liverpool <i>v.</i> Glasgow Celtic football match that night.  As the passengers disembarked from the flight, they were given disembarkation cards and asked to fill them in.  Anyone travelling to Britain on flights will be familiar with the card.  Gerry Browne completed the card but asked a woman official why he was being asked to fill it in.  He believed at the time that she was a member of the airport staff but it later transpired that she was a police officer.</P>
      <P>According to Gerry Browne, the woman became agitated and began to make abusive remarks about the Irish and referred to the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  According to the account I have been given, the woman tried to grab the card from Gerry Browne and as she did so, her hand struck Gerry Browne in the chest. He pushed her hand away and at that point he was jumped on by three men, who subsequently transpired to be policemen, and they dragged him through the terminal and into a room.  In that room, he was subjected to a serious assault for approximately 15 minutes during which he was held face down on the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Browne was later taken to Belle Vale police station and on the way was threatened with detention for seven days under the Prevention of <Col N="1373" /> Terrorism Act.  He was detained at that station for a further 90 minutes, photographed and fingerprinted.  He has no complaints about his treatment at Belle Vale.  Following his release, he had to seek medical treatment for his injuries and again today he had to return to hospital for further treatment.  Doctors confirmed he had bruising and cuts to the head and about both ears, muscle injuries and a type of whiplash.</P>
    <P>Today he made an official complaint against the police officers involved.  After some initial difficulties, he found a police station that accepted his complaint and when this happened, he stressed he was treated with courtesy.  I understand the matter is now being investigated by the British Police Complaints Authority.  Gerry Browne is well known to me and his family comes from Finglas.  Anyone who knows him will testify that he is a mild mannered individual and the last person who would provoke trouble or violence. He is not a trouble maker or the type of person who is driven by anti-British sentiment.  He is also a well known actor but that is not and should not be a factor in this case.  The issues here are no less or no more serious than they would be had they involved anyone else on that flight.</P>
    <P>I accept that security, sometimes annoying and oppressive, at airports is a fact of life in the modern times in which we live.  However, it is unacceptable that what originated as no more than a minor disagreement should have been escalated by the police into what amounted to a serious assault on an Irish citizen.  I would be shocked and horrified if a British citizen were treated similarly in this country.  In the new and more optimistic political climate created by the ceasefires and opening of all-party talks in Northern Ireland, it is time for the British authorities to look again at the requirement they place on Irish people to fill out these disembarkation cards.  We are familiar with them and they are a source of annoyance to many travellers.  As far as I know, the Irish alone of European nationalities are asked to complete the cards and they are contrary to the EU principle of freedom of movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister should demand an explanation and an apology from the British authorities for the assault on Mr. Browne and an assurance that those responsible will be brought to account.  The Government must ask the British authorities to have the practice of requiring Irish people to fill in disembarkation cards discontinued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I share the feelings of the Deputy with regard to the press reports of this unfortunate incident.  We are concerned particularly at the suggestions of anti-Irish prejudice and behaviour, including an alleged assault by British police officers on Mr. Browne.  There is no record of either Mr. Browne or his friend, Mr. O'Carroll, contacting the embassy in London about this matter. As soon as we became aware of the news-paper <Col N="1374" /> reports today the Embassy informed the Home Office of the Minister's serious concern and asked for an explanation of what occurred.</P>
      <P>According to the Home Office, Mr. Browne was one of a number of passengers on a flight from Dublin who were asked to complete disembarkation cards.  He reluctantly agreed to do so. When a police officer pointed out to him that he had completed part of the card incorrectly, Mr. Browne pushed her away.  I stress this is the account according to the Home Office.  She then arrested him for disorderly conduct and he was taken to Belle Vale police station in Liverpool. While at the police station Mr. Browne apologised for his action, was cautioned and released. He was in custody for about two hours.</P>
      <P>At 12.05 a.m. today Mr. Browne went to Walton Lane police station in Liverpool and made a formal complaint alleging that he had been beaten yesterday by special branch officers.  The allegation has been referred to the disciplinary section of Merseyside police in accordance with standard procedure.  The Police Complaints Authority has also been notified of the complaint. It is for the authority to decide whether to supervise the investigation by the Merseyside police. The Police Complaints Authority is an independent body the function of which is to ensure that complaints such as this from a member of the public about the conduct of a police officer or police officers is dealt with thoroughly and fairly.</P>
      <P>The Home Office has stated that it would not be appropriate for it to comment on the substance of Mr. Browne's complaint or the allegations against the police officers at Speke Airport in view of the fact that these matters are being investigated by the Merseyside police.  The Home Office is aware of the seriousness with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I view this matter.  It has undertaken to inform the Embassy of the outcome of the investigation as soon as it is completed.  However, it is not in a position to say at this stage how long the investigation will take.  The Minister has instructed the Embassy to monitor closely the progress of the investigation and to do everything possible to ensure that it is completed without delay.</P>

      <P>The problem faced by apple growers is due to a severe frost on the nights of 19 and 20 April last.  Unfortunately for the apple growers the spring was mild and the apple trees blossomed three weeks sooner than normal.  The April frost was severe with temperatures as low <Col N="1375" /> as minus eight degrees centigrade recorded.  It resulted in a large proportion of the apple crop being wiped out.  There are a limited number of commercial growers in the counties primarily affected, which are south Kilkenny, Waterford and south Tipperary.  They have suffered huge losses and some of them will not be able to continue in business.  The Minister should provide some form of aid, either EU aid, national aid or both if possible.  It is a very serious situation. There are not many commercial apple growers left in this country and if they are not helped we will have to import more and more apples.  The present situation is bad enough, but it will be very sad if we lose the commercial growers because of the damage inflicted on those two nights.</P>
      <P>The frost on those nights also affected growers in Britain, Belgium, Holland, Germany, France and Italy.  Huge compensation is being paid to growers in France and the other countries will probably also pay compensation.  It is imperative Irish growers get some assistance.  The recent trend has been for farmers and producers to plough up borders and to put in grain or cattle. That trend must stop because we cannot depend on imported apples.</P>
      <P>Catastrophic losses have also been suffered by cereal growers this year, specifically in Wexford, Waterford, Cork, south Kilkenny and south Tipperary. The cause of that problem was 14 to 15 inches of rainfall in those counties during August, when one would expect the weather to be dry and sunny for the harvest to be saved.  However, we had 14 to 15 inches of rain, which is about half the annual rainfall in some years.  Most cereal growers in those areas have suffered huge losses and many have not covered their expenses. Unless they receive significant aid, some will not be able to go back into business.  That is a serious situation, and aid must be provided for them.</P>
      <P>The price of grain has been as low as £72 a ton this year, which is a reduction from £95 to £100 a ton.  With the huge moisture content in the saved grain, some farmers got as little as £35 to £36 a ton.  That is commercial suicide.  Much of the grain had sprouted, particularly moulting barley, and could only be used as feedstuff.</P>
      <P>The Government must assist the people affected.  Teagasc have been asked to carry out a survey with officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  They should know the problems of individual farmers.  I know the Minister met the banks and low interest, long-term loans would be a big help to the people affected.  It would also help if not less than 90 per cent of area aid could be paid to farmers by mid-October and the balance by the end of that month.  Government funds should also be matched by EU funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should bear my points in mind.  The apple growers are more peripheral than the grain producers but we cannot drive farmers out of either area.  There are few farming opportunities with milk restrictions and beef <Col N="1376" /> restrictions because of BSE.  The Minister of State should take a sympathetic view.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this important matter.  This time last year we were looking back on an extremely good harvest with high yields, excellent quality and low moisture levels.  Very good weather conditions in early September ensured that harvesting was completed successfully and national cereal production exceeded 2 million tonnes for the first time since CAP reform in 1992.  Yields generally were at new record levels and moisture content was low.  Unfortunately, weather conditions this year were not as favourable as in previous years and a disastrous spell of bad weather during August created major difficulties.  This weather could not have come at a worse time as the harvest in most areas was well under way and it was unfortunate that our main cereal producing areas in the south and south-east were worst affected by the exceptionally wet weather.</P>
      <P>The Minister Deputy Walsh travelled to Wexford, Waterford and Cork in early September to view the difficulties at first hand and it was quite apparent at that time that some growers could not even go onto the land to harvest and in some cases a significant percentage of the crop was unharvestable.  It was clear the worst hit areas had problems with lodging and sprouting and disease was also evident.  I visited a number of the affected areas in Tipperary, Waterford and South Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The Minister met representatives of the merchants and the lending institutions.  He also had discussions with the farm representatives.  In his talks with the lending institutions he stressed the need for a pragmatic and sympathetic approach by the banks, towards growers who might face financial difficulties as a result of the poor harvest. I am pleased the reaction from the banks was very positive and the Minister was assured they would take a long-term understanding view of growers' financial problems.  The Minister's discussions with the grain merchants also had a positive result and they offered full co-operation with growers in trying to minimise the loss from the harvest.  They also agreed to provide extended credit facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the weather generally was not great throughout the country it appears that a 30 mile band across the south and south-east bore the brunt of the bad weather and this was the area which suffered the most crop damage.  Luckily we got some better weather during the month of September which helped to salvage the bad situation to some extent and harvesting is now practically over apart from in some areas, particularly in the south-east, where a small amount remains to be harvested.  It now seems that while quality has certainly been badly affected with very little milling wheat assembled, yields have kept up remarkably well and the production of some l.9 million <Col N="1377" /> tonnes forecast prior to the bad weather will still be achieved.</P>
    <P>Early information indicates that spring wheat and spring barley are the two cereal crops most affected and that the winter crops were less damaged. However, this was just a preliminary assessment and we felt we needed to get more precise information on the crop damage.  Accordingly, as Deputy Deasy pointed out, Teagasc was asked to undertake a survey of individual farms which have been most severely affected to determine the extent of the damage caused.  This work is now nearly completed and we hope to have an early report on it.  We will then be in a position to make an overall assessment which will give a more precise overview of crop damage.</P>
    <P>It is not only cereal crops which have been affected by the bad weather but other horticultural crops including apples and strawberries which suffered frost damage in May.  Soft fruit, potatoes and other vegetables will also have suffered some damage.  We are also assessing the situation in the horticultural sector and when this is done we will consider what will be the most appropriate line of action to take.</P>
    <P>In a year such as this, I am acutely conscious of the importance of area aid payments to cereal producers.  Under EU regulations, payment of these aids cannot commence until 16 October. The Deputy can take it, we will ensure that payments will be made as quickly as possible after that date.  We hope 9O per cent of all payments will be processed and issued within the week. This should alleviate the cash-flow situation particularly in the worst affected areas of the south and south-east where more than 30 per cent of all the arable payments &mdash; which in the current year will amount to more than £90 million &mdash; will be paid.  It is worth noting these payments are made irrespective of yields or quality and will provide some minimum guaranteed return for all producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House this evening to reply to this matter. It concerns an extremely serious incident which occurred in the Phibsboro area in my constituency yesterday in which a young Spanish student was brutally attacked and badly injured. Two muggers on a motorbike attacked her in an attempt to snatch her handbag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I extend good wishes to the young woman for a full and early recovery and I hope the perpetrators are brought to justice.  My reason for raising this incident is that I believe it is part of a growing trend for this type of criminal to target visitors to this country.  They are being targeted for two reasons &mdash; first, visitors tend to carry money and, second, and more important, the inherent delays in processing crimes of this type. It has become widely known among the criminal community that if they carry out an attack on a visitor they are unlikely to be brought to justice <Col N="1378" /> prior to the visitor leaving the country, thereby greatly reducing the chances of victims giving evidence.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the developments that have taken place in assisting and comforting foreign visitors who have been the victims of such attacks, but action must be taken in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to speed up the processing of these incidents thereby bringing the perpetrators to justice.</P>
    <P>Two approaches could be taken in this regard. Has the Minister given any consideration to a fast tracking system for incidents of this nature to enable them be dealt with as speedily as possible before the victims leave the country?  Alternatively, will he consider introducing a mechanism whereby evidence could be given by deposition to ensure the victim would not be requested to return to this country to give evidence when the case is heard?  Because yesterday's incident, which was extremely serious, is part of a growing trend, this matter needs early attention.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this matter in the House and I join with her in extending good wishes for a speedy recovery to the young lady who was the subject of this unwarranted and disgraceful attack.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the long-standing practice of this House is that the Minister does not comment in detail on individual Garda investigations except where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that the making of statements by the Minister or other Members of the House is deemed appropriate.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputy Shortall and other Deputies will appreciate that I am somewhat constrained by what I can say about this case.  I trust Deputies will also understand that the reason for this is the interests of justice for both the victim and for any person who may be charged in respect of alleged offences so require.</P>
      <P>I can tell the House, however, that the Garda authorities have this afternoon advised me that two individuals have been charged in relation to this incident.  These individuals have today appeared before Dublin District Court and as such the matter is <i>sub judice.</i> The interests of justice for all concerned, as I have indicated, require that I can make no further comment in regard to this particular incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the action I will be taking towards tackling crime in general, I already spelt this out in detail earlier today during the debate on the Europol Bill.  My objective during my term of office is to provide the resources and means and to reform the criminal law to ensure that there is effective law enforcement.  This includes adequate prison spaces to accommodate persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment by the courts.  I want to see the law enforced, all crime, subject to the interests of justice and society, investigated and, where possible, detected and all those responsible for committing crimes prosecuted <Col N="1379" /> in respect of those crimes.  I want every individual sentenced to imprisonment to serve his or her debt to society and to be made an example of to others who might be of like mind.  I will go about this task in a systematic, well-thought out and measured way.  The days of the rubber band and sticking plaster approach to the criminal justice system are over.  The Government is unequivocal in its intentions in this respect.</P>
    <P>I note the points made by Deputy Shortall about the delays in processing certain cases or offences.  Following discussions, the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court sat for some weeks during September.  I am pleased to report that the delays in Circuit Court trials in the Dublin Metropolitan area are at their lowest level for many years.  I wish to express my appreciation to the Judiciary for this.</P>
    <P>I intend in legislation, which I hope to introduce shortly, to replace the system of preliminary examination as it gives rise to unwarranted delays in criminal trials and there is no necessity for it in this day and age.  If an individual believes there is no <i>prima facie</i> case against him or her this argument can be made before the court of trial.  This will inevitably lead to much speedier trials than we have at present.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the points made by Deputy Shortall about attacks on visitors and I will look at whatever means are available to ensure those who attack visitors are no longer under the impression that they will not face the full rigours of the criminal law.  Whatever means or mechanisms are required to ensure that they face the full rigours of the law will be provided.  Under the criminal law, video evidence is allowed in certain sexual assault cases and cases of violence.  I will look at every possible method to ensure that people who attack visitors are no longer under the misguided impression that they will escape justice because their victim has to leave the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I look forward to working in the education area where Ireland Inc., to use a commercial term, has to make a large investment and ensure we get value for money.  This applies to the most needy in our community as well as to the most prosperous.  It is of immense importance and I am pleased to have the opportunity to work in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the issue of the leaving certificate honours English examination because as the Minister will know there is widespread concern about the way those examination papers were corrected.  I will not go so far as to say we are in an era of &ldquo;rubber band and sticking plaster&rdquo; to quote the Minister who has left the House, but there is a widespread feeling among parents and teachers who are directly involved that the attitude of the Department <Col N="1380" /> of Education is that God is in the heaven and all is right with the world, that our system is beyond reproach, we have done it this way for years and who are you to question the system in place.  The reality is this was not a normal year as far as the results are concerned.  No one can disregard the fact that all schools around the country reported that 25 per cent of their students were awarded grades substantially at variance with their previous performance and ability. Equally, it is extraordinary that more than 2,500 students have sought a recheck of their examinations. More than one in ten of those who sat the exam is unhappy with the way it was corrected and is seeking a recheck.</P>
    <P>The Minister, no doubt at the prompting of his Department, consistently refused to accede to the core demands of teachers, students and parents. They were for new examiners to conduct the recheck and for the removal of all marks made on the papers by the first examiner.  People felt that was the minimum necessary to ensure a fair recheck was carried out against the background of widespread concern.  I am disappointed the Minister ploughed ahead with the existing system in the face of this substantial loss of confidence. There is a great onus on him to demonstrate that the recheck has been subjected to random quality assurance checks conducted in an independent way.  An independent panel should be in put in place to do that random quality assurance check.</P>
    <P>There is a generally held fear that examiners, in rechecking, may have followed a rule of thumb of allowing no more than 10 per cent of the rechecked papers to have altered results to give the appearance that this was a normal year.  There is no conviction among the public that this was a normal year.  If the view takes hold that some of the Department's examiners followed that rule of thumb to protect the system, that would seriously undermine confidence.  The Minister will know probably today the results of the recheck and, if he does, he must immediately release information about the discrepancies that have been found. Students should be given separate results for each of their English papers so that they can see where they have fallen below performance.  Is it, as suspected, where more qualitative evaluation was called for in assessing those papers?  If it is, that gives cause for concern about the way those more qualitative evaluations are being conducted.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister, as he has done, to promise a review in the future.  What use will it be to students whose career chances have been scuppered to know that in six or nine months the Minister will come up with some good new ideas?  There is a need to rebuild confidence in the future, but even on foot of a review in the future I am not happy with the Minister's initial response.  He talked of issuing model questions and answers for the future, but the implication of that is he believes hundreds of teachers, students and parents got it wrong in that they were not able to master how questions are set and how answers should be given.  That is a poor start for <Col N="1381" /> the Minister and his Department in approaching the subject of a review.</P>
    <P>There is also genuine concern about whether there is real quality control in the existing system. It is widely believed that the work of individual examiners is not subjected to systematic random checking.  I have heard stories that what happens is that the first 20 papers are corrected by an examiner and he then sends back three papers he selects for assessment by inspectors.  That is the process of checking rather than a random checking of any one of the 270 papers that are given. There is a need to put in place a proper approach to random checking.</P>
    <P>There is also public concern, reinforced by the teachers' unions, that individual examiners are not given enough time to evaluate a subject such as English.  It has been suggested that a mere 30 minutes is given to assess 25 pages of creative writing.  One cannot correct such a subject with an eye focused on the hour glass.  Any serious review must be open, retain this year's papers and rework the correcting to identify how problems arose.  It should have a steering committee on which parents and teachers, including those who have raised legitimate concerns, will be represented to ensure the review is carried out in an independent and realistic manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister should include in a review the junior certificate correcting where there is some concern of a similar nature.  If we are to have a review it should apply to both examinations.  In respect of this year's examination papers the Minister must assure the public they have been independently and randomly rechecked so that parents can be happy that the results can be stood over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Martin) Minister for Education (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for raising this issue on the Adjournment and his kind remarks at the outset. I look forward to working with him for the furtherance of education because I share his view that it is central to the development of the nation.</P>
      <P>English is the subject most often taken at higher level in the leaving certification examinations every year.  This year, 32,402 candidates sat this exam.  The initial marking was done by a group of 124 highly qualified examiners who have considerable experience as examiners of English and teachers of higher level English at leaving certificate.  Following the issuing of results, 2,801 candidates appealed their grade.  The appeals process was carried out by 26 highly experienced and extremely well-qualified appeal examiners whose expertise in this area cannot be surpassed.  They have an average of more than 20 years experience of teaching higher level English between them. The outcome of the process resulted in 365 candidates being awarded an upgrade on their original results.  This represents 13 per cent of appeals in the case of higher level English as opposed to 11 per cent last year and 12 per cent in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My sole concern is that we are fair to candidates and they receive the marks which their papers <Col N="1382" /> deserve.  I am conscious that in previous years there has been a perception that information was released only gradually and under pressure.  I am committed to the principle of absolute transparency with regard to all aspects of the examination process and, to this end, the details of this year's appeals process which I published earlier today at a full press conference, have involved an unprecedented level of transparency and openness.</P>
    <P>Where, during the appeals process, the chief examiner has concerns about the standard of marking of any examiners, he or she can arrange for a full remarking of the relevant scripts.  In the case of the higher level English this year, the unappealed work of one of the 124 assistant examiners was also fully remarked, in the light of the number and nature of successful appeals arising from that examiner's initial marking.  This resulted in 14 upgrades for candidates who had not appealed their original markings.  In other words we have put in place procedures to actively detect and report errors and to correct them.  It is now possible because of technology available to recheck the work of an examiner as part of the appeals process.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the appeals process managed by my Department was conducted rigorously and with complete integrity.  The philosophy was to do justice to the students: if something was wrong to find it out and to correct it.  Appeal candidates can be fully confident their work was fully and fairly remarked and the entire process has ensured justice to all candidates whether or not they submitted appeals.</P>
    <P>In terms of the marks on the papers from the original examiner there is an argument &mdash; and Price Waterhouse in conducting its independent review made the point &mdash; that what the appeals process is about is to determine whether the original marking scheme was applied correctly.  One way of identifying whether it was, is to see how the original examiner marked the paper and whether he or she marked it in accordance with the original marking scheme.  People might assume the appeal examiner might be predetermined to a certain disposition because of the marks on the script, but there is a strong counter argument, which I am convinced of, that the appeal examiner can see where mistakes were made by the original examiner and where marks were not given.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has specifically referred to the concept of independent invigilation as part of the appeals process.  He will agree that any examination appeals mechanism must determine absolutely whether errors occurred in the original marking and ensure that appeal candidates are not more favourably treated than any other candidates. The current appeals system achieves the necessary balance between these two factors.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that a comprehensive and independent review and analysis of the leaving certificate appeals process has been prepared by Price Waterhouse and has <Col N="1383" /> been published.  Its report stressed the absolute need to ensure that nothing is done within the appeals process which would give appeal candidates any advantage over the general body of candidates sitting the examination.  Fresh examiners who were not at the original marking conference, who have no experience of or familiarity with the original marking scheme, would essentially be marking the appeal candidates under a new marking scheme, and that could disadvantage the 30,000 students who did not appeal. Bringing in fresh examiners would be a seismic shift in terms of the objectivity and integrity of the system, and the request to do that is not in any way a minimalist one that should be acceded to.  It would very seriously undermine the integrity of the whole system.</P>
    <P>This standardised marking scheme is used by highly experienced appeal examiners who have been involved in all stages of its development. They are ideally suited to judge whether, at first marking, the scheme was applied properly in the cases being appealed.  They can also assess whether its application is consistent with the standards applied to other candidates sitting the same examination.  Therefore, I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in fairness to all those sitting examinations, there is no realistic way of having appeal candidates' work marked by any person or body external to the examination process itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be as helpful as I can to the Deputy and to be as open as I can about the nuts and bolts of this procedure.  I am firmly committed to ensuring that candidates are given every assurance regarding the integrity of the examination system.  For this reason, I appointed six independent examination commissioners in August.  Their task will be to ensure that, in the case of those who seek their assistance, every procedure within the appeals process has been adhered to without fail.  The transparency of this new layer of redress will be ensured by the publication of the examination commissioners' report within a month of the conclusion of their task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> It is my firm intention that our examination system should operate to the highest international standards.  This will not be achieved by superficial embellishments.  It requires serious and considered thought and analysis, a willingness to identify problems where they exist, and a determination to enhance quality.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I have today announced a series of initiatives to increase the openness of the system and address individual points put to me by teachers and parents.  In addition I have announced the establishment of an expert group which will commission research based upon examples of best international practice, receive submissions and, ultimately, advise me on policy approaches in the examinations and all aspects of their operation.  This group will be independent of the Department and, in its review and research role, will provide a forum for detailed consideration of all aspects of the operation of the examination system.</P>
    <P>I stress again that the examiners are people of the highest integrity.  They are teachers who dedicate their professional lives to the interests of their students and who are always conscious of the fundamental requirement that we must do justice to every student.  They actively seek out errors, and when they find errors they report them.  We should all be grateful to them for the service which they render.</P>
    <P>With my officials, I met the group concerned for a full three hours in my Department, and we went through the nuts and bolts of the entire system with them.  It was pointed out at that meeting that the monitoring that takes place in the original assessment is not at the behest of the individual examiner.  The chief examiner has a system in place where there is random taking of scripts to assess whether the marking scheme is being applied.  There is a very rigorous and detailed system. The marking scheme itself contains 48 pages. It is not a question of the Department saying that everything in the garden is rosy and that we stoutly defend the fortress.  We are open to discussing ongoing improvements to the system. However, the bottom line is that there must be justice for all candidates who sit the examination, and that is a very complex issue and one that cannot be easily resolved by bringing in fresh external examiners.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 October 1997.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the previous Government established a Cabinet drugs committee in October 1996 arising from a report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs.  The purpose of the Cabinet sub-committee was to give overall political leadership in the fight against drugs; to review all trends in the drugs problem; to assess progress in the strategy in dealing with both the supply and demand aspects, and to resolve any policy or organisational difficulties which may have inhibited an effective response to the problem. The committee was chaired by the former Taoiseach and comprised the Ministers for Health, Justice, Environment, Education and the Deputy himself as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>When the present Government came into office, and recognising the links between social exclusion, drug abuse and alienation, I decided that the most strategic way to tackle the problem of social exclusion was to reconstitute the drugs committee into a wider Cabinet committee which would address disadvantage in the broadest sense.  The particular elements I felt were closely linked were the work being done under the Local Development Operational Programme, the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and the National Drugs Strategy.  In order to deal with all of these factors, in a more comprehensive way, and as part of our strategy of crime prevention, the Government decided in July, to establish a Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs, including local development.</P>
      <P>The committee will deal with all the elements of the problem in a holistic way and will build on, and advance, the good work of the Cabinet drugs committee.  With enhanced representation at ministerial level it will be possible to focus action across all Government Departments, agencies and programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 61, 62, 67 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government, under the transport heading, says that key priorities will include resistance to EU plans to abolish duty free shopping after June 1999.</P>
      <P>On my part I am very concerned about the economic and social consequences for Ireland of the scheduled abolition of intra Union duty free sales, in particular the effects on employment and access costs for tourism and trade.  For this reason I am taking an active role in the campaign to raise awareness of the duty free issue.</P>
      <P>At the Duty Free in Europe Conference in Brussels on 24 September 1997 I highlighted the Government's position and I called on the EU Commission to conduct an EU-wide study into the economic and social effects on Europe of ending duty free.</P>
      <P>I believe the results of such a study could pave the way for an open-ended derogation, which can be reviewed as circumstances change.</P>
      <P>At their Council meeting in June this year, Transport Ministers supported the concept of this EU-wide study.  I should point out, however, that reversal of the scheduled abolition is primarily a matter for Finance Ministers and requires a proposal from the EU Commission and unanimous agreement of the Council of Finance Ministers.</P>
      <P>In response to concerns relating to Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports, I should point out that Aer Rianta, which has responsibility for the management and operation of the three State airports on my behalf, is leading a campaign, at industry level, to retain intra EU duty free.  It is also actively pursuing a range of activities to mitigate the loss of revenue in the event that efforts to retain duty free are unsuccessful.  This includes looking at alternative commercial activities at the three airports and examining opportunities overseas to provide additional revenue to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is currently awaiting the report of a study, commissioned by his Department, to establish the <Col N="1388" /> impact of the loss of duty free on Irish employment, transport and Government revenues.  This study is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  The results will be used to inform the debate at national and EU level.  Other member states have undertaken studies in areas particularly relevant to themselves.  However, as I mentioned before, the key, I believe, is to convince the EU Commission to commission an EU-wide study.</P>

      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority is statutorily responsible for regulating aviation safety in Ireland.  The principal statutory responsibilities of the company include ensuring that Irish airspace is used in a safe and efficient manner and regulating all safety aspects of Irish aircraft operations, the operation and maintenance of air navigation and aeronautical communications services and systems and regulating the operation and management of airports.</P>
      <P>My Department has retained responsibility for the investigation of air accidents and incidents occurring in Irish airspace.  Under ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) and EU requirements such investigations must be independent of the regulatory authority.</P>
      <P>A total of 15 accidents and 12 incidents occurred in Ireland in 1996.  None of the accidents involved public transport passenger aircraft and only three of the incidents involved such aircraft. Indeed, there have been no aviation accidents involving public transport passenger aircraft in Ireland in almost 30 years.  Given this situation, and taking account of the rapid growth of airline traffic into and out of Ireland in recent years, I am satisfied that high safety standards are being maintained throughout the industry in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 29 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>I propose to implement the radon grant scheme at the earliest possible date and it is my sincere hope that its early introduction will enable us to take the first steps in assisting householders to deal with this problem.  Accordingly, I have sought funding of £200,000 in the context of my Department's 1998 Estimate submission to finance the scheme in its first year of operation.  A considerable amount of preparatory work on the scheme has already been carried out within my Department and details of the scheme will be announced as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> Turning to the matter of radon in showcaves, I am aware that high levels of radon gas have been found in certain cave environments.  Due to the subterranean origin of radon, underground locations are particularly susceptible to high radon levels.  Because of the possibility that persons working as guides in such caves could incur relatively high radiation doses, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland have in recent years conducted a programme of monitoring in caves.</P>
    <P>The results of this programme indicate that a number of guides may be receiving high radiation doses and the institute have written to a number of cave owners advising them to introduce a programme of monitoring workers.  In addition, the institute have suggested that owners take all measures possible to reduce the exposure to workers.  These measures include increasing ventilation and limiting the hours workers spend in the caves.</P>

      <P>The licensing of television deflector operators is a very complex issue.  The legislative position is that while I have a policy role in relation to the allocation and use of radio frequency spectrum, the legal power to issue licences to television deflector operators pursuant to section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 was transferred, with effect from 30 June, 1997, to the Director of Telecommunications Regulations appointed under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>It is accordingly a legal function of the director in the first instance to address the question of licensing such operators.  Any licensing regulations proposed by the director would be subject to my consent.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the director has initiated a consultancy study in relation to this matter with a view to determining the appropriate course of action.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 31, 43, 45, 48, 58 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>I confirm that the strategy set out in the Final Report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative continues to provide the basis for Government policy in relation to transport in Dublin.  That policy includes the provision of a light railway system for the capital city and the Government is committed to the provision of the core network recommended in the DTI report which includes a line from Tallaght via the city centre to Dundrum and Sandyford and a line from the city centre at Ballymun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the commitment in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium I am, with the Government's agreement, in the process of commissioning an independent <Col N="1392" /> study to assess the option of putting the Dublin light rail system underground in the city centre.</P>
    <P>Invitations to tender for the underground study were invited through advertisements placed in national newspapers and in the EU Official Journal and the final date for receipt of tenders was 22 September last.  The tenders are now being urgently evaluated and I expect to be in a position to announce details of the successful consultants in the near future.  They will begin work at the start of November.  I anticipate that the study will be completed within a period of six months and I can confirm that it will be published.</P>
    <P>The study will be based on a comparative evaluation of two broad options comprising the on-street Tallaght-city centre-Dundrum line proposed by CIE in its formal application for a light railway order and the same line with an underground section in the city centre.  The consultants will be responsible for defining the nature and extent of the underground option or options to be evaluated.  This will permit a thorough evaluation of the on-street and underground options for the city centre in the context of CIE's concrete proposals for a Tallaght &mdash; city centre-Dundrum route.  The study will not consider mass transit options other than light rail as these strategic issues were dealt with in the DTI study.</P>
    <P>As regards the project timetable, it is reasonable to assume that, if the project were to be approved on the basis proposed by CIE in its application for a light railway order, construction could be under way early in 1999 and would take about three years to finish.  On the basis of this timescale it could be possible to complete the project by end 2001.  Under EU Structural Funds regulations expenditure incurred up to end 2000 is eligible for grant assistance.  The Commission may allow an extension, normally for up to a further year.  Such a decision would facilitate the full draw down of EU funds in respect of the project based on an end 2001 completion date.</P>
    <P>A decision to proceed with an underground section in the city centre would necessitate a substantial redesign of CIE's current proposals and would defer completion of the project beyond 2001.  However, it is important to point out that even in these circumstances EU funding allocated to the light rail project under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 would not be lost to Ireland since unused funds could be reallocated to other eligible projects.  The mid-term review of the Community Support Framework provides that a review of the EU funding allocated for the light rail project will take place in Spring 1998 and this can take account of the outcome of the underground study.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed Ballymun line, the position is that the CIE light rail project team has identified strategic options for the route between the city centre and Ballymun.  Further work to provide additional information on these options is now being carried out.  However, the light rail project team's efforts will be concentrated to the north of the inner city pending completion of the <Col N="1393" /> underground study.  The project team hopes to be in a position to initiate the public consultation process in late spring next year when it will be able to take account of the conclusions of the underground study.</P>
    <P>Planning and design of the proposed extension of the Dundrum line to Sandyford is well in hand and the public consultation process will get under way in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the joint Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats policy document for Government Action Plan for the Millennium. This clearly sets out the Government's programme for the State companies.  It states: Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government will take a practical rather than an ideological approach to the future of the State companies, working in the spirit of social partnership and consensus.  We will do whatever is necessary to enable them to be competitive and cost-effective as providers of vital public services to the benefit of the consumer.  Additional capital needs, where they cannot be provided internally, may be provided by means of strategic alliances, which may also enlarge their market, and by long-term pension fund and employee shareholding.  Our aim is to have growing, vigourous, healthy companies serving the public well and giving high quality employment at home and abroad, regardless of any evolution in structure.</P>
      <P>I will be doing everything possible to ensure that the 10 State-sponsored bodies that come under the aegis of my Department develop in line with the commitments in our programme for Government.  In this regard I am very aware that the State companies have to have the necessary flexibilities required by modern companies operating, as they are, in highly competitive markets. The State companies are responsible themselves for their day-to-day operational matters, they have to plan and implement their operations in markets that are showing dramatic change. Indeed such change is having a major impact on these companies and the single biggest factor driving this process of change is competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> In relation to job creation.  I should point out to the House that the major role which State bodies play is in helping to establish and maintain the conditions which support sustainable employment for all who seek it.  While the State bodies in the main do not have a direct role in job creation, they do have a very important indirect role in ensuring that the sectors for which they are responsible provide competitive, efficient and effective services for the Irish economy.  In addition, I must emphasise that employment in the overall economy depends critically on the ability of the commercial State companies to cope with increasing competition, which will become even more severe in the medium to long-term; to operate flexibly in existing and new markets; and to adapt successfully to changing regulatory environments.</P>
    <P>In relation to changing regulatory environments, the Deputy will be aware of the impact in recent years of legislation for the Single Market and liberalisation generally.  My Department plays a dual role in ensuring that the State companies are equipped to handle the full impact of the competition that this will entail, while guaranteeing access for new market entrants to common infrastructure at reasonable and cost-related prices.</P>

While I have welcomed this decision, I would have preferred that discharges from nuclear installations such as Sellafield and THORP would also have been covered by the phase out plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radioactive contamination of the Irish marine environment continues to occur as a consequence of the activities of these installations.  I of course consider that all radioactive discharges should be progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated at the earliest possible date.  There is some evidence that Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, the UK Minister responsible for environmental policy relating to marine discharges from Sellafield, is conscious of the need to make progress on reducing nuclear discharges.  He has recently acknowledged the need to commit all Governments to this aim although he qualified this commitment by stating that there was a need for any agreement <Col N="1395" />&ldquo;to be tempered by what is practicable and to be consistent with the provisions of the existing agreements in this area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In fact the subject of radioactive contamination was discussed at a meeting of the Oslo/Paris Commission on pollution in the North East Atlantic in the first week of September.  As a result of the discussion an Irish/Danish sponsored resolution relating to this subject the UK are to report to the Commission in 1998 on their compliance with the obligations of the OSPAR Consultation.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the OSPAR examination of this subject it is my intention to meet with the UK Minister for the Environment to clarify the direction of UK policy in this area.  I propose at this meeting to reiterate Ireland's concerns about discharges from the UK's nuclear industry and to press for a complete elimination of all radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.</P>

      <P>Statoil carried out an appraisal programme of the Connemara field to determine its commerciality earlier this year.  The appraisal programme which consisted of drilling and testing two wells, one in the primary reservoir and the other in the secondary reservoir, commenced in March.  An important part of the appraisal work was the production of oil during an extended test of the primary reservoir which began on 10 July. The purpose of the test was to obtain data on the reservoir and its production characteristics as an input into the determination of the commerciality of the Field.</P>
      <P>The oil produced on test was sold at a commercial rate and was accordingly the first oil to be commercially produced in Ireland.  The extended well test in the primary reservoir did not live up to expectations.  Flow rates were low and the reservoir pressure fell faster than anticipated.  Even though the second appraisal well indicated that the secondary reservoir was oil bearing it was decided not to test the well.</P>
      <P>In the light of the results from the two wells, Statoil announced early last month that they will not declare the Connemara field commercial. However, Statoil will continue to evaluate the data obtained during the appraisal programme to gain the best possible understanding of the Connemara reservoirs and will use that information to assist in assessing other exploration potential in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> While these results from the Connemara field are disappointing, I have been extremely impressed with the skill, commitment and determination which Statoil have applied to make Connemara commercial.  I remain positive about future exploration prospects in the Porcupine Basin and in our other offshore areas, as I know Statoil do.</P>

      <P>In March 1995, the results of my Department's first alternative energy requirement competition (AER I) were announced.  This competition was designed to secure 75 mw of additional electricity generation capacity from alternative energy sources.  In total the competition resulted in 34 contract offers amounting to 111 mw of capacity, including ten contracts for an additional wind energy capacity of 73 megawatts.  I can confirm that seven of the AER I windfarms, amounting to 46 mw, are on line to be completed before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>My Department's renewable energy strategy sets targets for the securing of additional renewable energy capacity up to the year 2010.  The strategy includes an annual target of 30 mw per annum for wind energy.  The third alternative energy requirement competition which is currently under way, was launched to secure the strategy targets set for the period up to the end of 1999.  AER III aims to secure a total of 100 mw from wind, hydro and biomass/waste.  The competition recognises that Ireland's greatest renewable energy potential is in the area of wind energy and aims to secure the majority of this capacity, 90 mw, from wind.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to announce the successful bidders in early 1998.</P>
      <P>At EU level the THERMIE programme provides financial support for energy demonstration projects, including wind.  All successful Irish renewable energy THERMIE projects qualify for an ESB power purchase agreement of up to 15 years duration.  The first THERMIE supported Irish windfarm was commissioned in Gweedore in County Donegal earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The Irish wind energy sector is expanding rapidly. In 1994, there was one windfarm in Ireland with an installed capacity of 6.45 mw.  As a result of both AER and THERMIE programmes this will have increased to approximately ten windfarms and an installed capacity of 60 mw by the end of 1997.  In addition, this figure is set to increase to approximately 170 mw by the year 2000.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer subvention to CIE in respect of the provision of socially necessary noncommercial public transport services amounts to £105 million in 1997, an increase of just over 5 per cent on the 1996 figure.  The allocation of the subvention between the three subsidiary companies is entirely a matter for the CIE board.  I understand that the board's 1997 allocation to Dublin Bus is £7 million.  The system of public service contracts which I intend to introduce in place of the current global subvention will facilitate a more focused consideration of the standard of service the CIE companies are expected to provide in return for the subsidy they receive from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining the level of subvention to be paid to CIE each year the Government has to <Col N="1400" /> find the right balance between a range of competing demands across all sectors of the economy and no organisation can afford to operate on the basis that the taxpayer has a bottomless purse.  In any event, the ability of the CIE companies to offer a satisfactory service to their customers is not determined solely by the availability of Exchequer subvention.  Management and staff in Dublin Bus have made very real efforts in recent years to improve the range and quality of services available to the public and to improve the efficiency with which those services are delivered. I welcome these efforts which reflect a realistic awareness of the increasingly competitive environment in which CIE must operate if customer loyalty is to be maintained and developed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that comparisons tend to be made between the level of State subsidy paid to Dublin Bus and that which is available to transport operators in other cities in Europe.  Such comparisons can, however, be misleading.  For example, payments from the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs in respect of free travel services provided by the CIE companies are shown as general revenue rather than as State payments, which is what in fact they are.  In any event, I consider that if additional subvention was to be made available to the CIE companies generally, it could only be in respect of new services to be provided by them.  More generally, Deputies will be aware of a range of ongoing and proposed measures under the Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI) to improve public transport services in the city.  These include the introduction of a series of quality bus corridors which are intended to provide fast, frequent, direct, reliable and comfortable bus services in areas of high demand.  Implementation of quality bus corridors is being pursued by Dublin Bus and the local authorities under the aegis of the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) which is also providing the necessary funding.  The DTO is committed to implementing all 11 quality bus corridors recommended by the DTI by the end of 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Internal arrangements for remuneration of staff within the Aer Lingus Group is a day-to-day management responsibility, in which I have no function.</P>
      <P>However, because of the serious nature of the Deputy's questions, I want to put on record the facts as conveyed recently by Aer Lingus to my Department in response to allegations of possible tax irregularities in the group's maintenance subsidiaries. These allegations were made earlier this year to my predecessor and to the Minister of State at the then Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, as a result of which Aer Lingus were requested to submit a report on the matter.</P>
      <P>On foot of this request, Aer Lingus commissioned an investigation and submitted the results to my Department.  On the basis of this report, I am assured by Aer Lingus that the position is as set out in the following paragraphs.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus and its subsidiary companies are complying in all respects with their obligations under the PAYE/PRSI regulations, and no liability to PAYE/PRSI arises for the group from the contracts and practices which were the subject of the investigation.</P>
      <P>TEAM Aer Lingus does not pay wages or salaries for any of its workforce into foreign bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Group maintenance subsidiaries TEAM and Shannon Repair Services have a substantial ongoing need for contract workers which is common in the aviation maintenance industry in Ireland and worldwide due to the seasonality of the business.  The degree of contract labour needed varies throughout the year to cater for the level of resources and skills necessary to meet customer requirements and deadlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This contract labour is sourced from a number of specialist third party companies.  TEAM and SRS pay these third party companies directly on <Col N="1403" /> foot of invoices for work done and not the individual contractors.  It is in relation to the payment methods of such third party companies in respect of contract labour that the question of taxation irregularities has arisen.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have advised me that, as a result of their investigation, arrangements within the remit of these third party companies have been identified which are open to the interpretation that they were designed to facilitate potential evasion of tax.</P>
    <P>While the Aer Lingus Group cannot be responsible for the taxation practices of third party companies with which they do business, nevertheless Aer Lingus is concerned to ensure as far as possible that any commercial arrangements in which the Group engages do not lend themselves to the facilitation of potential evasion of tax.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while TEAM and SRS continue to have a requirement for contract labour, and while Aer Lingus tax advice is that, in relation to contract labour, taxation arrangements are a matter for the third party companies or the individual contractor, discussions have taken place between Aer Lingus and these companies to ensure that Irish tax legislation is complied with in full.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have now confirmed to me that, resulting from these discussions, arrangements have been agreed with the third party suppliers of contract labour, relating to the payment of contractors, which ensure full compliance with Irish tax legislation.</P>

      <P>Over the past few months, my Department has intensified its activities and has become involved in cross-Border checkpoint operations with its counterparts in the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 64 together.  I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that at 20.48 hours on Thursday, 18 September 1997, two discharged ammonia tank wagons and the barrier wagon on an ammonia train from the Irish Fertilizer Industries Ltd.  plant at Marino Point, Cork, became derailed at low speed at Glasnevin Junction.  The derailed barrier wagon, which is filled with water, blocked the parallel track and was subsequently struck by a freight train also travelling at low speed.  While Iarnród Éireann have indicated that the incident was potentially serious, no danger arose to the public, rail staff or the environment.  The local emergency plan was implemented immediately and was stood down later that night at 23.05 hours.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has established a board of inquiry to determine the cause of the derailment and to recommend any remedial action.  The report of the board of inquiry will also be reviewed by my Department's railway inspecting officer who will determine if further safety measures should be taken in the light of the report's findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trains involved in this traffic operate in accordance with specific instructions based on international standards.  CIE have assured me that the tank containers and tankers are very robust, are subjected to regular inspections and are certified fit to convey the substances concerned in accordance with the specifications of the International Union of Railways CIE have also advised me that the information notices and hazardous labels carried are in accordance with international specifications for transport of these products, and that all persons concerned in these operations are given special training.  A scheme for the co-ordination of emergency services and other organisations in the event of an incident or accident involving toxic chemicals or dangerous substances in transit by rail has been drawn up by a committee operating under the aegis of my Department.  The committee is representative of <Col N="1405" /> relevant Government Departments and agencies and of certain manufacturers using dangerous substances.  Emergency procedures are reviewed and tested regularly through exercises involving designated company personnel and the relevant emergency services.</P>
    <P>The safety of rail operations is a matter for the board and management of CIÉ and Iarnród Éireann.  CIÉ have assured me that safety is the prime consideration in the operation of the railway and will not be compromised.  Iarnród Éireann has in the last four years embarked on an ongoing safety programme to enhance the range of safety procedures already in place. Safety on the railway will also benefit from a complementary quality programme which the company is promoting to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations.</P>

      <P>In February 1997 my predecessor Deputy Alan Dukes mandated the board of Aer Lingus to explore the possibilities of entering into a major strategic alliance with or without the transfer of equity and to submit proposals to the shareholder by the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>This mandate was issued in order to allow Aer Lingus the freedom to examine if there are advantages in an appropriate alliance, having regard to trends in the European and global aviation markets.</P>
      <P>In fulfilment of the mandate, Aer Lingus management is currently engaged in a fact finding process.  The results of this process will in the first instance be considered by the Board who will make a submission to me before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>I have already stated that I will, subject to Government approval, publish this document.</P>
      <P>While it is early days yet in the examination process and therefore inappropriate to speculate on any possible future outcome, a positive Government decision on an alliance proposal will only be taken where such an alliance is clearly in the best interests of securing the future of the airline, having regard to the needs of all stake-holders, including staff.</P>
      <P>This approach is entirely consistent with Government policy on the state sector as outlined in the action programme for the millennium.</P>

      <P>The oldest type of reactors in the UK are Magnox reactors and are located mainly on the west coast of Britain.  Of the 11 Magnox power stations throughout the UK three have now been closed.  Calder Hall, now nearly 40 years old, houses the four ageing Magnox reactors on the Sellafield site.  Originally built in 1956, these reactors have exceeded their expected design life by 20 years.  They are inferior to modern reactors and cannot be adapted fully to meet modern safety standards.</P>
      <P>Securing the closure and early decommissioning of the UK's Magnox facilities will remain a priority for this Government.  I will continue to highlight, at every available opportunity, the Government's concerns about the age, safety and reliability of Magnox reactors, such as those at Sellafield and Wylfa.</P>

      <P>I understand that the first such case brought before the US courts was in the state of Florida in 1992.  It eventually came to trial and was dismissed in May 1995 by a federal district court judge.  The case was later abandoned.</P>
      <P>Since that first case I am aware of at least seven later lawsuits in the United States where exposure to mobile phones has been alleged to cause brain tumours.  Of these additional seven cases, one has been dismissed while six have still to be brought to trial.</P>
      <P>Mobile telephones in use in Ireland meet the exposure standards recommended by major health advisery bodies worldwide, including: the International Committee on Non-ionising Radiation Protection, who are advisers to the World Health Organisation on these matters; the American National Standards Institute; the United States National Council for Radiation Protection and Measurements.</P>
      <P>Compliance with international non-ionising radiation emission standards is a condition attached to all telecommunications licences for mobile telephony services issued in Ireland.  The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, who was appointed pursuant to the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, is responsible for ensuring compliance with licence conditions and will arrange for monitoring of non-ionising radiation emissions.</P>
      <P>Concerning studies into the effects of mobile phone radiation I can inform the House that in 1996 a major review of the health issues raised by non-ionising radiation emitted by telecommunications masts was carried out by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that there is no substantive evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to levels of non-ionising radiation at levels at or below those set in 1988 by the International Radiation Protection Association.  The IRPA guidelines are compulsory in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A number of tests carried out by Forbairt confirm that actual emissions from masts in Ireland are well below the limits.  Further research in the area has been proposed recently in a report commissioned by the European Commission and I can confirm that my Department will be monitoring developments to ensure that the most up-to-date standards are applied to emissions in this country.</P>

      <Quest>the consequences arising out of the Mid-Term Review of Structural and Cohesion Funds for her Department; and the alterations, if any, there are to the original Departmental Programme set out for the period 1994 to 1998 in the relevant operational programmes for investments in postal, energy and telecommunications infrastructure.</Quest>

      <P>The mid-term review of the Community Support Framework, 1994-9 was agreed by the CSF monitoring committee on 29 July 1997.  That review has consequences for the two EU-backed Operational Programmes that affect my Department.  The two programmes in question are: the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999 and the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>These two Operational Programmes involve total investment of over £1 billion in airport, public transport, energy and communications infrastructures.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Operational Programme for Transport the changes are twofold: first an additional 10 million ECU of EU aid, about £7.5 million, has been allocated to finance preparatory work on the third Luas line to Ballymun.</P>
      <P>Second, in the case of State airports, 11 million ECU, about £8.4 million, has been withdrawn from the EU allocation for airports.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, changes also occur in two main areas: first, in the area of telecommunications, savings of 12 million ECU, about £9 million, were identified.  From these savings, 10 million ECU, about £7.5 million, have been allocated to develop broad band telecommunications infrastructure.  This allocation recognises the increasing requirements of the evolving information society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> Second, in the area of energy, 3.4 million ECU of EU aid, i.e. about £2.6 million, has been reallocated to develop Combined Heat and Power projects; to support Renewable Energy projects and to provide mains electricity supply to Inis</P>
    <P>Bofin and Clare Island.</P>
    <P>The additional EU aid for the energy related projects will be provided by a reduction in EU aid from the current allocation for energy advice and information, combined with an allocation from the so-called &ldquo;deflator fund&rdquo; for 1996.  The latter fund reflects the upward adjustment to the pool of EU funds, that is made each year to take account of annual inflation.</P>

      <P>The board of ESB was anxious to pay its new chief executive in accordance with the recommendations of the Buckley report.  Both the previous Government and this Government decided to postpone implementation of Buckley.  I advised the chairman of ESB that the chief executive's salary must comply with the Gleeson guidelines.</P>
      <P>I met the chairman on seven occasions between 31 July and 17 September and outlined the Government's position on the Buckley report to him.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 20, the Government is committed to the conclusion of an employee share ownership plan in <Col N="1411" /> Telecom Éireann in the spirit of social partnership and consensus.</P>
      <P>I have recently met with representatives of KPN/Telia &mdash; the State's strategic partner in Telecom Éireann &mdash; the company and the unions with a view to determining a framework within which the negotiations on an employee shareholding scheme can be restarted.  This framework is now almost in place and I look forward to the recommencement of negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on an acceptable deal within the coming months.</P>
      <P>The details of any scheme are a matter for negotiation between the parties.  From the outset for the strategic alliance process, a shareholding of up to five per cent was earmarked for the employees of Telecom Éireann in return for verified cost reductions and change within the company.</P>
      <P>The Government, in response to the union's proposals to maximise employee shareholding, is open to practical and feasible proposals by the staff to purchase for cash payment to the Exchequer at a fair price, shares in excess of five per cent when it is satisfied that this will assist the future development of the company and that the conditions relating to the initial five per cent are satisfactory.  Any transfer of shares beyond five per cent can only be considered with the agreement of the strategic partner.</P>
      <P>The exercise of determining a fair price for the shares in Telecom Éireann require a valuation of the company and this will be one of the first exercises to be undertaken as part of the renewed negotiations.  This valuation will be carried out by professional advisers.</P>

      <P>My Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and Córas Iompair Éireann, is in the process of developing public service contracts to replace the existing global Exchequer subvention paid annually to Córas Iompair Éireann in respect of the provision by it of socially necessary services which do not yield a commercial return.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this new policy is to place the provision of Exchequer support for CIE on a more transparent, closely focused and results oriented basis, in line with best international practice and with EU policy on State support for public transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contracts will mean that the payments made by the Exchequer to Córas Iompair Éireann will be identified with the provision of specific services.  The contracts will, in broad <Col N="1412" /> terms, specify the quantity and quality of services to be provided by CIE.  They will also set out clear performance standards for these services and allow for performance measurement.</P>
    <P>As the details of the contracts are currently the subject of discussions between my Department, the Department of Finance and Córas Iompair Éireann I am not yet in a position to go into detail as to their content.  However, in broad terms, it is proposed that the new public service contracts arrangement will be made up of five contracts dealing with the provision of rail infrastructure; mainline rail passenger and freight services; DART and suburban commuter rail services to and from Dublin; certain bus services outside the Greater Dublin Area; certain bus services in the Greater Dublin Area.</P>
    <P>It is my objective to introduce the contracts for the 1998 financial year and they will be published upon their introduction.</P>

Under the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996 any person had the right to make written submissions to me in relation to the proposed light railway order. The final date for such submissions was 4 July on which date a total number of 87 submissions had been received.</P>
      <P>The submissions received, some of which are supportive of light rail, raised some concerns on such issues as the disruption caused to businesses during construction, effect on personal and commercial property, acquisition of property, restoration of original light rail route through Inchicore-Kilmainham, visual impact, vibration and noise impact and the question of putting light rail underground in the city centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Southern Health Board that O'Connell Court, Windmill Road, Cork provides sheltered housing for older people and according to information available, the property is held on a long-term lease from Cork Corporation.  The original cost of the refurbishment to convert it to a suitable housing facility for older people was mainly financed by grant aid from the Department of the Environment.  I understand the premises is mortgaged to Cork Corporation under a capital grant scheme with the Department of the Environment. It is operated by a company limited by guarantee and has charitable status.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board provides an annual grant of £40,000 under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, towards the costs of providing community based services at the complex.</P>
      <P>As the facility has been in operation since 1989, a number of the occupants are becoming increasingly more dependent.  I understand that the Southern Health Board has been in discussion with the administration of O'Connell Court to ensure that suitable arrangements are made for those residents whose level of dependency requires them to be cared for under the provisions of nursing home legislation.  The possibility of using a portion of O'Connell Court as a nursing home is being explored.</P>
      <P>With regard to funding, it should be noted that financial assistance is not provided from my Department's funds for the setting up of a nursing home, whether by way of grants for new buildings or grants towards the reconstruction of existing buildings.  If, however, a part of the facility were to be registered as a nursing home, residents of the nursing home would be eligible to apply for financial assistance with regard to the payment of fees to the home in accordance with the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, and this would obviously benefit the home financially.  In this connection, the discussions between the board and the administration of O'Connell Court referred to above will include the financial support of existing dependent residents within the parameters of the subvention regulations.</P>

The courses offered by these agencies reflect both the training needs appropriate to a person's disability and labour market opportunities.

      <P>This flat complex was designated for funding under my Department's remedial works scheme.  Dublin Corporation carried out some refurbishment works to 16 flats and replaced windows in the entire complex in 1993-94 but work was discontinued due to anti-social problems in the complex.  While a request was received earlier this year to recommence work, the Corporation subsequently substituted the refurbishment of some 181 flats at Liberty House for which approval issued to go to tender last July.</P>
      <P>To date, the Corporation have been allocated over £65 million in respect of designated estates, including £7 million this year.  The financial requirements of Dublin Corporation and other local authorities to complete work on approval housing schemes and the overall high level of demand by local authorities for funding under the scheme would not allow the recommencement of this project at this stage.  However, the project will be considered in the context of the funding available under the remedial works scheme in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by the Self-Employed Pension Association refers to the requirement that to qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of <Col N="1422" /> a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They may be covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  In this year's Social Welfare Act provision was made that self-employed contributors who entered insurance in 1988, but were already over the age of 56 at that time and who had previously paid social insurance contributions as an employee would now be able to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self-employed social insurance provided that they do not qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
      <P>In 1989 it was estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned. The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance this was estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  A review of these figures indicated that the estimated cost is now £500 million, based on numbers of some 20,000 people qualifying.</P>
      <P>These costings are currently being reviewed in greater detail in the context of the actuarial review of Social Welfare pensions which I launched earlier this week.  Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis. The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced the introduction of new <i>pro-rata</i> pensions so that, in future, people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age contributory pension. From November of this year a yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions will give a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, <Col N="1423" /> while an average of between ten and 14 will give a persion of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person will also need to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  This measure will be of benefit to many self-employed contributors.</P>
    <P>While everything possible has been and will continue to be done to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible I regard the principle of a reasonable record of contributions as essential.  I have asked my Department to examine the issue. As any proposals would have a major cost implication they would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.  The ongoing National Pensions Policy initiative currently being carried out by the Pensions Board and my Department could also be relevant in this regard.  Any person resident in the State can, of course, qualify for an old age non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of a reduced rate retirement pension since his 65th birthday.  He currently receives £126.90 per week, which consists of a personal rate of £75.90 and a qualified adult allowance of £51 in respect of his wife.  In addition, he will be receiving a £5 weekly fuel allowance from mid-October next.</P>
      <P>His rate of pension is determined by his yearly average contribution record.  He has a total of 1,234 reckonable paid and credited contributions recorded over the 28-year period from 1960 to 1988.  No contributions are recorded for the 1974-5, 1981-2 and 1985-6 years and there are a reduced number of contributions recorded in the two years of 1961-2 and 1982-3.  His overall record represents a yearly average of 44 contributions, entitling him to his current personal rate.  He would need a higher yearly average of 48 to entitle him to the maximum personal rate of £78 per week, in addition to his existing qualified adult and fuel allowances.</P>
      <P>The new pro-rata old age contributory pension rules, which come into effect from 21 November 1997, cater for those people who have a low yearly average of between ten and 19 contributions, and who could not qualify for a contributory pension up to now.  As the yearly average of the person concerned is considerably higher than these levels, the new rules are not relevant in his case.</P>
      <P>In addition to his retirement pension, the person concerned is entitled to free travel, free electricity allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance.</P>
      <P>On this basis, according to the Department's records the person concerned is in receipt of his full social welfare entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union, provides that every person holding the nationality of a member state shall have the right to move and to reside freely within the territory of the member states, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect.  The rights of free movement of those engaged in economic activity are conferred by the EEC Treaty itself while secondary European legislation &mdash; i.e. directives adopted by Council &mdash; confers such rights on those who are not, or have not been, economically active.</P>
      <P>The right of free movement are subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.  In addition, the rights conferred by secondary European legislation on non-economically active persons are subject to the conditions that the individuals relying on them must have enough resources to avoid becoming a burden on the social welfare system of the host State, and they must have appropriate health insurance.  The domestic regulations to give effect to the provisions on the rights of free movement and residence are set out in the European Communities (Aliens) Regulations, 1977 (No. 393 of 1977) and the European Communities (Rights of Residential for Non-Economically Active Persons) Regulations, 1997 (No. 57 of 1997).</P>
      <P>The numbers of residence permits issued to nationals of EU member states in each of the last five years is set out in the following tabular statement. The number of applications refused is not readily available.  However, I would emphasise that the exercise of the rights in question is not subject to the issue of a residence permit which is merely a means of proof and not a condition of entitlement to live in an EU member state.  It is the case, therefore, that the numbers of residence permits issued does not necessarily reflect, for example, the numbers of EU nationals exercising their rights to reside here.</P>

      <P>Candle Community Trust has already been advised that it is not possible to provide funding for this project from my Department's 1997 financial allocation which, in fact, is fully committed at this stage.

      <P>My Department has had no contact with the person concerned about the issues raised.  Canadian nationals are not subject <Col N="1429" /> to a visa requirement for the purpose of seeking to enter the State.  It may be that she has experienced difficulties on re-entering the country if she is travelling on a Canadian passport which does not indicate that she has regularised her residency here as required by law.  However, the details supplied in the Deputy's question suggest that the person concerned holds Irish and Canadian citizenship. If that is the case, it is open to the person concerned to apply for an Irish passport for travel purposes.</P>

I understand from them that it is envisaged that with the forthcoming allocation of probationer gardaí on 3 October 1997 two such gardaí will be allocated to the division.  They have also assured me that when additional personnel become available for allocation the needs of the Mayo Garda division including, of course, Westport Garda district will be fully considered in conjunction with the <Col N="1430" /> needs of other Garda districts and divisions throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The position in this case is that the vehicle in question operates a double trip.  As a result, the timetable requires some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for some time in the evenings.  This has always been a feature of the school transport scheme and every effort is made to keep waiting times to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to confirm that since Monday, 22 September, the bus operator has been instructed to bring the students directly to the school premises at Irishtown in New Ross.  I am confident that this will help to alleviate the difficulty.</P>
      <P>With regard to making finance available to provide one large bus on this route, I regret that this is not open to my Department, as substantial extra cost would be involved.</P>
      <P>There are other school transport services operating from the general vicinity of the Listerlin area.  I have asked that they be examined as a matter of priority with a view to improving the level of service for all concerned.</P>

      <P>I understand that the pupils referred to by the Deputy reside in catchment areas in south Kilkenny, from which they travel to Waterford city and under the <Col N="1431" /> present system are not entitled to full transport facilities to the city schools.</P>
      <P>Generally, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre.  Catchment boundaries are determined on educational rather than transport grounds.  Recognised post-primary pupils, who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside, are eligible for transport to that centre.  Eligible pupils who attend a school in an outside centre may be allowed the concession of transport from the catchment boundary of the centre attended, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>The Planning Section of my Department has commenced an examination of the catchment area boundaries in the south Kilkenny area, adjacent to Waterford city.  As soon as this examination is completed, I will contact the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <P>I understand that the nearest school to this family is 0.7 miles distant, and is not overcrowded.  I have been informed that there are, in fact, three primary schools within two miles of this family, whereas Faythe national school is 2.2 miles away.  None of these three schools has a transport service under the school transport scheme, as pupils attend from the immediate vicinity of the schools.</P>
      <P>Since the pupils in question live less than two miles from the nearest school, I regret that they are ineligible for free transport or grant aid under the terms of the school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is not open to my Department to provide free transport or to offer a refund for private transport arrangements to the family in question.</P>

      <P>The revised programme for basis pre-registration <Col N="1432" /> nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994 on a pilot basis by the Western Health Board, the National University of Ireland, Galway and at the University Hospital, Galway. The programme has since been extended to a number of other colleges of nursing in association with local higher education institutions.  The three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and to registration with An Bord Altranais.  The programmes are being funded by the regional health boards.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Department of Health has been engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions, including National University of Ireland, Galway, in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which are open both to nurses who successfully complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualify under the traditional model of education and training. These one year degree programmes offer members of the nursing profession an opportunity to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level.  In the 1996-7 academic year, Dublin City University operated such a one year programme and both Dublin City University and Trinity College Dublin are operating programmes in 1997-8.  As these programmes are provided on a part-time, self-financing basis, the question of funding does not arise.  I understand that the National University of Ireland, Galway is proposing to offer a similar one year degree programme commencing from January 1998 on a full-time basis.  My Department is currently engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Health in relation to this proposed course and I will clarify the position for the Deputy in the light of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The pupils in question are catered for on public scheduled transport and are set down at an established bus-stop on the bus route, approximately half a mile from the school.  From this point, they make their own way to the new Community College in Riverstown, County Cork.</P>
      <P>Post-primary pupils attending centres throughout the country are dropped at central set down points each day and make their own way to their respective schools.  This is a feature of the school transport scheme at post-primary level in urban areas.</P>

      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, there are only five eligible pupils from the Little Island area offering for transport to the new college at Riverstown.  In accordance with the terms of the scheme, it would not be open to my Department to establish a special service for these pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department will review the establishment of a service for the 1998-9 school year, in the event that the numbers of eligible pupils from this area reach the minimum required.</P>
      <P>In the meanwhile, my Department is considering the matter of a remote area grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements for eligible pupils from Little Island.  The Deputy will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>
