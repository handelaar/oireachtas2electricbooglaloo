      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 15 October 1996, in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 1 and 2, I announced the establishment of a high level group to provide a strategic overview of the law offices of the State.  The terms of reference of the group require it to identify the strategic policy issues common to the law offices which necessitate detailed examination and consideration and to make recommendations to Government for action to ensure the legal services provided to the State are structured and managed to provide the highest quality service.</P>
      <P>The group comprises senior managers from the office of the Attorney General, the office of the Chief State Solicitor, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice and the office of the Tánaiste and an international expert in law office management. The Attorney General chairs the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has met on five occasions to date.  I <Col N="622" /> understand it is considering the key organisational and strategic issues identified in the various organisational and strategic reviews in relation to the office of the Attorney General, the office of the Chief State Solicitor and the office of the DPP.  These issues include: the appropriate structures and systems required to provide high quality services; the relationship between the various offices; the relationship between individual offices and Government Departments; the area of claims against the State; and the role of various organisations in relation to prosecutions.  It would be inappropriate for me to refer in any detail to the group's consideration of these issues since they involve close consultation with the relevant offices and individuals.</P>
    <P>The Government has asked the group to report within the next four months.  I look forward to receiving its report, which will be given early and full consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the Deloitte Touche report into the Chief State Solicitor's office, which states that there are no accountable management structures or proper procedures there?  It states that the office is not in a position to meet efficiently or effectively the demands placed on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the subject of a question for next week.  This question concerns the high level group which is looking at strategic issues common to all the offices and the Deputy is asking about a report on a particular office.  I would be happy to answer that question but another Deputy has put a question down on the matter for next week and I do not wish to prejudice the response to that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Taoiseach told me when I asked about the Anthony Duncan extradition case.  He said that the Minister for Justice had a question, which he transferred, tabled on the matter.  I had tabled the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an acceptable answer from a Taoiseach who promised so much.  Why was this report not published?  Why has it been leaked although the Government has had it since November?  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say he will wait another week to answer the question.  My question is about the Chief State Solicitor's office and other offices and therefore I am entitled to an answer today from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A question is tabled and I am happy to answer it.  However, I do not wish to <Col N="623" /> prejudice the rights of a Deputy who has tabled a specific question.  Deputy Harney is asking a separate question.</P>
      <P>The report was received in November and was immediately acted upon.  As a result of the report on the Chief State Solicitor's office, very substantial decisions were taken to invest resources in that office to remedy the specific deficiencies identified in the Chief State Solicitor's office.  For instance, in this year's Estimates there was an increase of 26 per cent in the amount allocated for staff.  There was an increase of 204 per cent allocated under the heading of incidental expenses, which is chiefly to do with staff training and development.  That expenditure was substantially necessary and is now under way.  Third, there was a 100 per cent increase in the allocation for office machinery which is going into the computerisation of the office.  Substantial decisions have been taken to remedy the deficiencies identified in the report and that has been under way for the past two to three months.  I look forward to answering this question in further detail next week when the question that specifically relates to this is tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the life of this Government we have witnessed a litany of administrative errors in the criminal justice system, such as the shredding of the extradition warrant, the breakdown of communication in the Department of Justice, the Department's relationship with the Attorney General's office and the recent report on the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Yesterday saw the report Deputy Harney referred to on the Chief State Solicitor's office.  It has been stated that the office is facing imminent disaster&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Taoiseach is listing everything that has been resolved.  The office does not have an adequate telephone system.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the public can have confidence in the criminal justice system when it reads about so many of these matters every week?  Should we take the Taoiseach's weekend statement literally, when he said that this Government has set most of our people free?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I commissioned the report in question, brought in an international expert to advise on the matter and have now provided hugely increased resources to deal with problems in the Chief State Solicitor's office which were neglected for the eight years that Deputy Bertie Ahern's party was in power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not published because it contained a number of internal administrative matters which affected identifiable individuals. All of the difficulties identified in the report are in the process of being remedied.  There is no problem with publishing the report.</P>

      <P>I have asked a question about the law offices of the State and the Taoiseach has given a flippant answer.  What was the rationale for the office of the Tánaiste being brought into this?  Normally that office would have nothing to do with the law offices of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deloitte Touche report mentions the appointment of extra judges and the extension of the legal calendar as some of the reasons for the delay.  As these measures were introduced by the Government to address problems in the system, would the Taoiseach agree that more foresight should have been shown and such difficulties would not then have arisen?  The Government went ahead with these changes and put pressure on the office without any consideration for the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these matters are to be dealt with in an integrated way.  The Government is obviously taking steps to improve the performance of the courts by providing them with additional resources.  A Courts Bill was approved today in Cabinet which will be introduced in the Seanad as part of the Government's programme for streamlining and improving the courts service. In parallel with that we are taking steps to improve the performance of the Chief State Solicitor's office by unprecedented large increases in resources for training, information technology and staff in that office.  That is to remedy years of neglect of the legal services by previous Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had a very useful working lunch on 15 February with a bipartisan US Congressional delegation led by the chairman, Congressman Ben Gilman.  Our discussions focused primarily on the Northern Ireland situation and on European Union enlargement.</P>
      <P>The delegation made a strong call for a prompt restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  They emphasised the importance of fully inclusive talks in accordance with the terms set out in the Mitchell report.</P>
      <P>For my part, I underscored the Government's determination to make further progress in the Belfast talks.  I also said that progress would be easier to achieve if there was peace and if the talks were fully inclusive, as the Government would wish and indeed has worked unremittingly to bring about.  I stressed that nobody has a veto over such progress &mdash; neither those who are participants nor those who have excluded themselves from participation.  I outlined to the delegation the substantive progress that has been made over the past two years, emphasising the importance of building on that.</P>
      <P>In addition, I pointed to the centrality of forgiveness to the process of building lasting peace. For that to happen, the voices of victims must first be heard.  The Government was pleased therefore to have met on Thursday last relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday who were accompanied by the SDLP Leader, Mr. John Hume.  The Government side was represented by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Social Welfare and myself.</P>
      <P>The delegation made clear that its primary objective is the establishment of the full truth and put forward its view that a full independent inquiry with an international dimension could best achieve that aim.  In response, I outlined the Government's efforts to ensure that the tragic events of Bloody Sunday will not continue to be an unnecessary source of additional grievance for the loved ones of those who died.  Earlier that day I received clarification of the British Government's position arising from a meeting arranged some time previously with ambassador Sutherland. It was made clear that the British Government had not had the chance to scrutinise the evidence presented at the earlier meeting between the relatives and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; that it had not prejudged that evidence; that no options in terms of a response have been ruled out and that if there is evidence that is substantial and new, that will be considered by the British authorities and the appropriate action will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At our meeting with the relatives, the Government side also gave on overview of our work in compiling an assessment of relevant material for <Col N="627" /> transmission to the British Government.  Though much useful work has been done, our assessment may take some time to complete but it will be done as quickly as possible.  The overriding concern here is to gather as much relevant information as can be obtained and subject it all to rigorous examination in the interests of compiling a thorough assessment.  The point was understood and appreciated by the delegation from the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign.</P>

      <P>When meeting the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, did the Taoiseach take the opportunity to reaffirm the Government's strong support for ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith in view of the inspired attempts by British sources to undermine her position?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned his meeting with the British ambassador where she pointed out that the British Government had not had the time to examine the evidence presented to it, that it did not want to prejudice matters and that no options were ruled out.  In our meeting with the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday they expressed their upset with the comments made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when, 24 hours after meeting a delegation and having been handed new evidence, he insulted the memory of those who were murdered and who were, in the words of the British Government and the British Prime Minister, to be considered innocent.  When he met the British ambassador did the Taoiseach express the view of this country that Sir Patrick Mayhew's comments were at best ill-considered and at worst insulting?</P>

      <P>I have already made my views known about the remarks made by the Secretary of State 24 hours after his successful meeting with the Bloody Sunday relatives group.  I expressed my surprise at the words he used and following that I raised the matter with the British ambassador when I met her.  I invited her to provide me with a clarification of the British Government's position.  I am happy this clarification, which I obtained as a result of that initiative, made it clear that the evidence submitted had not been scrutinised by the British Government, that it had not been prejudged, that no options in terms of what the British Government may do in response had been ruled out and that if, following scrutiny, the evidence contained substantial and new material it would be carefully considered by the British authorities and appropriate action would be taken.  I was happy to convey this to the relatives when I met them.</P>

      <P>I admire the Taoiseach's reply and I am grateful that he has put on record the words attributed to him at a private meeting. However, the actions of the Secretary of State are contrary to the words of the ambassador.  Will the Taoiseach ensure there is an international dimension to the new and independent inquiry which is necessary in view of the discredited Widgery tribunal?  The relatives of the victims, the communities in Derry and the rest of Northern Ireland and the nationalist community in this country seek such an inquiry in view of the credibility brought to the peace process by the role played by Senator George Mitchell.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mistaken when he suggests the clarification by the British Government of its position following my meeting with the British ambassador was obtained by me in private.  I conveyed the full content of the meeting to the relatives and also made it public the day I received it.  This clarification is not a private matter but one of public record and has been so since shortly after my meeting with the British Ambassador. The question of an international dimension to any inquiry that might occur would fall to be considered favourably at the appropriate time when all the evidence has been assessed fully and a case established to found such an inquiry, if that is the best course to take.  The view of the relatives is that that should be the course taken.  I listened with care and attention to what they had to say in the matter.</P>

      <P>As I have said to Deputy Harney, it is important that any request that might be made for a particular remedy to the injustice suffered should be seen to be founded, first and foremost, on a thorough and dispassionate examination of the evidence.  On the basis of its being established that there is new evidence, following such a careful study, it would not be in the interests of those concerned if one were to indicate one's view on the matter until the evidence has first been scrutinised.  In the context of the credibility of any request for a particular remedy, <Col N="630" /> it is important to show that one did not jump to conclusions before one had examined the evidence but that one examined the evidence first and then drew the appropriate conclusion, based on the evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not want to jump to conclusions.  The British Prime Minister in a letter to John Hume said he considered that the people who were murdered by various units of the British Army on that day were to be considered innocent. If they were to be considered innocent, what is wrong with prejudging some of the Widgery Tribunal?  It was and is known to have been a cover up and in the words of the British Prime Minister these people were innocent.  Why is it that the Taoiseach and we in this House cannot say they were innocent, demand an inquiry at this stage and assemble the documentation to substantiate a strong case on their behalf?  It is self-evident they were murdered and were innocent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear in the House on a number of occasions that I regard the victims in question as entirely innocent.  I believe they have been the victims of an injustice.  I believe they deserve an apology for that injustice. Their case deserves to be put in the strongest and most effective fashion possible for full vindication. The best way to do it is on the basis of the evidence and in a way that convinces independent minded people, coming to this subject for the first time, that one is justified in the request one is making.  The best way to convince such people is, first, to assemble the evidence, then to make the request, not to make the request before one has assembled and studied the evidence.  It is a question of ensuring that not only is one's case good but it is seen to have been prepared with the appropriate degree of care.  That is the course I am following.  I believe it is the best course in the interests of the relatives and has their approval.</P>

As in the case of all previous agreements, arrangements are provided for looking at special issues which arise.

I take it the Deputy is happy the Government accepted the Labour Court recommendation on nurses' pay and I hope he supports the Government in that matter.  I take it he will equally support us in making the necessary financial arrangements to ensure that claim is met and he would not have wished us to take any other course on nurses' pay.  That matter is being dealt with.  If the Deputy is inviting me to engage in some form of speculation about hypothetical situations, that is not a course I intend to follow.</P>

I presume it was agreed to set a figure for special agreements, as happened in the case of previous programmes.  I am asking the Taoiseach the figure agreed by the Government for special increases in 1997.  I presume the Government did not conclude the agreement without knowing the monetary figure for special arrangements in 1997.  I do not know why the Taoiseach is dealing with matters I did not raise.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the following allocations under the estate improvement programme: Dublin Corporation, £1.25 million; Dublin South County Council, £750,000 and Fingal County Council, £500,000.  Proposals from Cork and Limerick Corporations are being examined in my Department and I hope to make allocations to these authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the new programme is to assist <Col N="636" /> local authorities in tackling environmental and related problems in severely run-down local authority housing estates and flat complexes in certain disadvantaged urban areas.</P>
    <P>The allocations have been made on the basis of the identification by the authorities concerned of the estates to be improved and the nature of the works to be done.  Works eligible for funding under the programme include: measures to upgrade the visual impact of estates, including environmental works leading to a more positive image of an estate; redefinition of site boundaries where appropriate; treatment of common areas to mitigate potential for anti-social activities; creation of defensible space around dwellings; redesign matters such as making some roads culs-de-sac and closing off back lanes which serve no useful function, in order to frustrate criminal activity; measures to establish improved management arrangements in housing estates; necessary works to vacant dwellings which have been vandalised to bring them back quickly into stock for letting; the engagement of consultants to assist local authorities in the formulation of projects; and other measures seen as necessary to improve living conditions for residents and to enhance safety.</P>
    <P>Planning and progressing projects under the programme are the responsibility of the local authorities.  However, in formulating their projects, authorities must adopt an integrated approach which actively involves the community in the projects.  Authorities are also required to set clear objectives for projects and to establish relevant baseline data on the areas concerned to allow objective assessment of the impact of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I must advise the Minister of State of the great disappointment in Dublin Corporation at what it sees as its failure to get its proper share.  The ministerial task force on the drugs issue nominated the 11 worst areas in the country, seven of which were in the Dublin Corporation area with two in South County Dublin, one in Cork and one in Fingal.  On a proportional basis the corporation could have expected to get £1.9 million.  How can the Minister of State explain the very low sum received by the corporation? There has been a perception for years by Dublin public representatives, not just during the term of this Government, of an anti-Dublin bias in the Department of the Environment.  Can we put this allocation down to that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that this scheme has generally been warmly welcomed by Members of this House and community groups.  I remind him that during the recent Second Stage debate on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, Members on both sides welcomed the allocation of £3 million for the <Col N="637" /> estate improvement scheme, which is £3 million more than was ever allocated when Fianna Fáil was in power.  The lion's share of the allocation, £2.5 million of the £3 million, has gone to the greater Dublin area.  It is a difficult task to ensure the allocation is fairly divided and I am happy I have achieved that.  However, that is not to say we cannot keep working to ensure we continue to make progress.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that 7,000 corporation houses were transferred to the county council areas, the bulk of which went to South Dublin County Council.  Those houses suffered a certain amount of neglect by Dublin Corporation over the years.  Difficulties and major social problems were experienced in parts of the greater Dublin area as well as in the corporation area.  I remind the Deputy that this allocation has never been made before and has been warmly welcomed by communities, particularly in the flats complexes in the Dublin Corporation area which, for the first time, can see real commitment in terms of funding to address the serious problems in those areas.  I am sure the Deputy is not too mean spirited to ignore that fact.</P>

      <P>It goes without saying that we all welcome the £3 million.  However, Dublin Corporation feels hard done by because, although it contains seven of the 11 worst areas identified by the ministerial task force, we did not get our fair share.  Yes, it is £3 million which was never given before.  It is to be given over two years, unfortunately. Many people would say that the drugs problem is much worse now than before.  There is a perception that the funding was allocated not on the basis of need but on the basis of where members of the Minister of State's party are hopeful candidates for election.  Perhaps she might like to defuse that perception.  I accept that the money is badly needed.</P>

People elect whom they wish but the deprivation, disadvantage and drugs crisis continue.  This is the first Government to seriously address this issue and allocate resources to it, despite the demands we had five minutes ago to make cutbacks.</P>

Appropriate liaison is being maintained between Departments and agencies whose areas of responsibility are affected.  I have been closely involved with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in assessing relevant waste management implications and I am satisfied that present arrangements for control of rendering and, in particular, of specified risk material, are satisfactory in relation to environmental protection.

All rendering plants which produce meat and bone meal for use in animal foodstuffs are to be upgraded urgently to operate high <Col N="639" /> pressure backed systems, which is happening currently. All specified risk material will be processed into meat and bone meal at a dedicated rendering plant or plants.</P>
      <P>Unlike offal, meat and bone meal can be safely stored without risk to human health or the environment pending destruction.  For the short to medium term, meat and bone meal containing specified risk material will be held in secure storage in Ireland, pending destruction by incineration either here or abroad.  Some 18,000 tonnes of such stocks have been created to date.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is currently exploring the possibility of high temperature incineration either here or abroad.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>his views regarding the deterioration in the quality of drinking water and the contamination of water in certain parts of the country as confirmed by the Environmental Protection Agency report 1991-94, and other reports; and the action, if any, he proposes to take to tackle this.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5170/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent report of the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality in 1995 indicates that overall quality continues to be satisfactory, especially in the public supplies.  Apart from coliforms, compliance levels in respect of strictly health related parameters were close to or above 99 per cent in 1995.  In the case of coliforms, the overall compliance level, 87.5 per cent, was marginally higher than the last report of 1994.  There is no room, however, for complacency about the limited exceedances of drinking water quality parameters identified in the report and I will be asking local authorities to ensure that intensive follow-up measures are taken where exceedances occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department wrote to sanitary authorities in September 1996 reiterating earlier advice that they should carry out risk assessments of water supply sources, with highest priority to be given to groundwater supplies in close proximity to potentially polluting sources.  I have asked sanitary authorities to review their action plans for the protection of water supplies in the light of the findings of these risk assessments.  In addition, my Department will continue to support the development of the integrated training programme for personnel involved in the treatment and supply of drinking water which is being promoted by the <Col N="640" /> Sanitary Services National Training Group.  The quality of drinking water provided by private group schemes raises more serious concerns, and I propose to deal with those in reply to a later question.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Report on Water Quality in Ireland (1991-1994), published in September 1996, covers 13,200 kilometers of river channel and a representative sample of 135 lakes.  The report shows that 71 per cent of river channel and 77 per cent of lakes surveyed were unpolluted.  While the bulk of our rivers and lakes continue to show good quality and are suitable for the requirements of the most sensitive uses such as abstraction for drinking, salmonid fisheries and bathing, both long-term and recent trend analyses in the report indicate two particular developments: first, a further significant reduction in the extent of serious pollution and a slowing down in the rate of increase of moderate pollution and, second, a continuing reduction in unpolluted channel and a distinct trend of increasing levels of slight pollution, mainly through eutrophication.</P>
    <P>The gradual abatement of serious pollution may be attributed to the installation of new or improved waste treatment facilities for point source discharges, particularly from sewage, and in some instances to the cessation of seriously polluting industries.  The main threat to water quality continues to be eutrophication which is largely due to nutrients from agricultural sources and, to a lesser extent, point source discharges from sewage and industry.</P>
    <P>A range of actions is being pursued for the improved management and/or reduction of nutrient losses to waters, particularly phosphorus, with a view to tackling the problem of eutrophication. These actions include the promotion of the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution which I launched jointly with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in July 1996; an amendment, in the Waste Management Act, 1996, of the Water Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1990 &mdash; the Deputy will be familiar with this as she took part in the Committee Stage debate &mdash; allowing local authorities to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans to achieve the correct balance between water quality protection and nutrient requirements for crop production; the launch last December of revised Teagasc recommended application rates for phosphorus fertilisers for grassland; the extension, since September last, of the integrated pollution control licensing system under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 to new intensive agricultural activities in the pig and poultry sectors; the imposition by local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency of controls, as appropriate, in respect of phosphorus discharges from industrial activities; the commissioning by the Environmental Protection Agency of relevant studies as part of the ongoing research and monitoring programme for water quality generally &mdash; the findings of these <Col N="641" /> will be of benefit to local authorities and the agency in the performance of their water pollution control and management functions; the ongoing implementation by my Department, in conjunction with local authorities, of the major programme of capital investment in water protection which will exceed £1.3 billion by 2005; the REPS operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; and, under Partnership 2000, provision will be made by way of improved capital allowances for a targeted and monitored measure to support investment by farmers in necessary pollution control projects.</P>
    <P>To provide better co-ordination for the above actions, and to intensify efforts at protecting vulnerable water quality, my Department is finalising a catchment management strategy.  This will aim to encourage an integrated approach to catchment management based on the co-operation of all economic and other interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister forgotten that for ten days last summer the public water supply in the village of Roundstone was put out of commission because of contamination and that the public water supply in Nenagh was also out of commission for more than six weeks last summer because of industrial pollution?  Does the Minister realise that a recent report confirms there is serious contamination of tap water in a number of group water schemes?  In the light of that and further evidence, does the Minister consider it more important to take action to upgrade water quality and eliminate contamination of drinking water than to abolish water charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will specifically answer the three points made by the Deputy.  In relation to Roundstone, I provided money this year for a first rate water supply which will be in place this year.  In relation to Nenagh, the Deputy will welcome the coming onstream this month of a major water scheme; I travelled to Tipperary within a few days of its coming into operation.  I accelerated that project in recognition of the terrible hardship suffered by Nenagh last year, and approximately £5 million was expended.  Nenagh now has a first rate water supply.  In regard to the third point, the Deputy will be aware I provided £5 million in addition to the normal allocations to upgrade such schemes with particular emphasis on the degree of coliform contamination of such private water supplies.  I have taken effective and speedy action on each of the points raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the number of convictions for litter offences in 1995 and 1996; and if he is satisfied with enforcement in relation to litter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5209/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1996, there were 113 convictions out of a total of 250 prosecutions for offences under the Litter Act, 1982.  In 1995, there were 136 convictions out of a total of 241 prosecutions brought by local authorities.  There was a significant increase between 1995 and 1996 in the number of on-the-spot fines issued by local authorities, which increased from 648 in 1995 to 1,108 in 1996.</P>
      <P>Enforcement against offenders will be greatly facilitated by the expanded range of powers provided by the Litter Pollution Bill which is now at Committee Stage.  The Bill will enable local authorities to take more extensive and effective measures to prevent and control litter, as well as action against offenders.  In future, local authorities will also be able to retain the proceeds from fines imposed by the courts, as well as recover the costs incurred in the investigation, detection and prosecution of offences.  Powers to issue on-the-spot fines will be extended to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am therefore confident that enactment of the Litter Pollution Bill will bring more active and effective enforcement of litter legislation.  I would <Col N="645" /> emphasise, however, that litter prevention and control must also be based on other foundations. The Action Against Litter initiative contains four key elements: improving local authority performance, both in relation to enforcement and service provision; reforming and updating the legislation; promoting public awareness and education; and developing partnerships with commercial and voluntary interests.</P>
    <P>Action Against Litter will continue to target improvements under all of these headings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the £400,000 expended last year on his Action Against Litter initiative was poorly spent as the number of convictions in 1996 was lower than in 1995?  Does he also agree that his strategy is well off the mark in regard to education and that the £325,000 spent on a multi-media campaign does not appear to have had much effect when a recent Irish Business Against Litter survey found that only 10 per cent of participants believed the litter laws are being enforced?  Does he agree that until such time as he gives funding to local authorities to employ litter wardens, this dismal record will not improve?</P>

      <P>On-the-spot fines increased from 648 to 1,108.  I am not complacent about the litter problem.  It is a serious environmental issue that must be resolved.  There are no easy solutions to the problem.  Changing the attitude of the public will not be easy.</P>
      <P>In terms of the expenditure of moneys, the campaign was effective.  We have given every child in primary and second level schools an education pack developed by teacher centres in Dublin. We are starting with a focus on the young because some adults are beyond redemption in this regard.  A total of 40 local authorities have completed their litter abatement plans and I hope the rest will be completed by the end of the year. We have had a debate on the Litter Pollution Bill, the next tranche of legislation to update the existing Act.  The awareness and education campaigns, the discussions I have had with local authorities and the increase in enforcement of the laws will bite at this thorny problem, but I am under no illusion that it can be resolved in a matter of days or weeks.  Fundamental psychological changes are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that as long as he pussyfoots around the problem by spending money on education campaigns and not enforcing the law, we are wasting money?  Does the litter problem cost £20 million per annum? As long as we continue to adopt the softly softly approach as is pursued by the local authorities we <Col N="646" /> will not solve the problem.  If the Minister does not believe 113 convictions out of 250 prosecutions is dismal, I do not know what type of progress he expects to make in solving our litter problem in the coming years.  The sooner the better the Minister recognises that the Government's record in this regard is dismal.  He should give local authorities the necessary back up to tackle the problem.  The lead must come from the top, not PR campaigns.  We must encourage enforcement of the law.  Unless the Minister is willing to use the stick more than the carrot to deal with this problem, it will not be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in the Deputy's suggestion.  The ideal would be to have no convictions, no prosecutions and no litter.  That is the utopia towards which we should work.  When one considers the state of some of our cities, towns and villages, we have a long way to go.  I accept litter is a major environmental issue and have put in place an action plan to deal with the problem.  I am pleased to note the Department of the Environment in Britain recently launched a campaign entitled Taking Action Against Litter. Enforcement is a difficult problem.  The chairpersons and managers of local authorities have told me it is difficult to enforce the law.  It is not like illegal parking where the number of the car can be taken and the person concerned prosecuted.  It is difficult to catch somebody throwing litter on the streets.  We must work out how that can be done and that is why I am introducing new legislation. I am not adopting a softly softly approach to the matter.  It is not a question of merely enforcing the law, we must change attitudes.  A great deal of litter is thrown on our streets between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. and it is not possible for litter wardens to patrol streets during those hours.</P>

      <P>In deference to the wishes of both Opposition parties that the Government would not expend more money, I asked local authorities to recorder their priorities and to make the fight against litter a priority within the resources provided. I hope that will be done to support their litter abatement strategies.  We will also take legislative action under the Litter Pollution Bill, 1996, which will be dealt with by the Select Committee tomorrow.  We will make the owners of fast food outlets, one of the greatest generators of litter, responsible for the vicinity within 100 metres of their premises.  We can take other such <Col N="647" /> action which will not pass the burden to local authorities but to those who should carry it, the polluter.  We can make a great deal of progress on the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  These elements combined will bring about the change everybody in this House requires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change</i> lays down a comprehensive agenda for change, including a new buoyant funding system for local authorities and the assimilation of local authority charges for domestic water and sewerage services into general taxation.  Consequently, all households, urban and rural, connected to a public main will no longer have to pay for a domestic water supply, and rural households served by group water schemes supplied from local authority mains will also benefit substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> I recognise that not all group water schemes can avail of a public water supply and a substantial number of households are served by group water schemes which have their own private supplies. I am concerned that the quality of water in many of these schemes is not up to standard, a point raised earlier.  The recent Environmental Protection Agency report on drinking water quality indicates that 43 per cent of private group supplies suffer some degree of coliform contamination.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the increased vulnerability of water sources to organic pollution and considering that the bulk of the group schemes were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s, I considered it essential that greater resources should be provided to enable these schemes to connect to a good quality public supply or, where this is not feasible, to put in place proper filtration and disinfection facilities.  Accordingly, I announced last month a new multi-annual programme, with funding of £5 million in 1997, to establish a new programme of works aimed at remedying deficiencies in substandard schemes, and allowing local authorities to take over private schemes where members so wish, thus eliminating domestic water charges for the householders concerned. In cases where schemes opt to remain fully private, technical and grant assistance would continue to be available for upgrading works.</P>
    <P>I also announced last month that I was proceeding with arrangements for the devolution from my Department to the local authorities of full responsibility for the administration of group scheme grant applications for new schemes, or upgrading existing ones.  This gives further practical effect to the policy on local government reform and is in keeping with the recommendations of the Devolution Commission, and with the policies outlined by previous Ministers for the Environment.  Under the devolved arrangements, I envisage local authorities will draw up integrated strategic plans which will form the basis of a planned approach to the organisation and management of water supplies in rural areas, with public and private group supplies playing complementary roles.  Such plans would have the quality issue as a first priority but would also deal with otherwise defective supplies and efficiency, conservation and environmental aspects.</P>
    <P>Within this framework, the issue of the running costs of group schemes, and charges to members for domestic supplies, requires further consideration.  Because of the range and complexity of the issues involved, I met representatives of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the Irish Farmers Association and Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association last week.  I also received written submissions from trustees and members of individual group schemes and my Department is in consultation with local authority management. Yesterday I met representatives of group water schemes in County Monaghan.  I am now considering all of the points raised with a view to <Col N="649" /> developing proposals for a planned approach to the development and operation of rural water supplies and I will report to Government in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>A summary of the Minister's reply is that the Government has not made a decision further to his meeting with the Federation of Group Water Schemes.  Given that he spoke about financing local government and the mess he made of this issue, why, when he considered abolishing water charges for urban dwellers, did he not carefully consider all aspects of the question, including rural dwellers on group water schemes?  As late as a week ago, I asked the Minister if he had an idea of the number of group water schemes privately and publicly owned.  He was only able to give me a list of group water schemes in each county and was unable to say which were privately or publicly owned.  That is a measure of the Minister's and the Government's preparation in deciding to abolish water charges and fund local government.</P>
      <P>Will private group water schemes be allowed to continue as such?  Will the Minister provide them with the necessary finance to ensure their continuation because indications given to the Federation of Group Water Schemes last week were that he was in favour of &ldquo;institutionalising&rdquo; private water schemes?  Will he state clearly that he will not forcibly take over private group water schemes?</P>

People are grateful for that fact and they are equally happy whether they live in my rural county of Wexford or in Dublin city.  All group water schemes will receive a public supply.  Approximately 85,000 households will have that domestic component lifted from them and they are happy about that.  There are anomalies because the issue is complex.

      <P>The Roundstone matter will be sorted out this year.  If the Deputy does a check list, he will note the improvements coming on stream.  I made it explicitly clear to the federation that any scheme which wished to remain private could do so.  There should be no ambiguity about this matter because I have made my position clear.  Those who want to be taken over by the local authority should be in a position to do so. Schemes in many counties have been taken over by local authorities because it guarantees a pure and good supply and many others are being absorbed by the regional schemes which are coming on stream.

When this matter was highlighted by this side, the Minister had to back-pedal again and he ran into the current problem.  If that is a well thought out, all encompassing strategy for local government financing, I would not like to see a hastily put together plan.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke at length about the free water people receive.  Will the Minister confirm that £40 million has been collected from motorists for free water and that a further 3 per cent and 6 per cent, of which the Minister for Finance does not appear to be aware, will be used in the coming years to pay for free water?  In his current deliberations of the anomalies he has created, has he considered the position of people who have their own wells, which provide individual supplies, but who must pay a motor taxation increase for water in urban areas?</P>

      <P>How can the Minister justify increases in motor taxation to pay for the loss of revenue from service charges?  How can he justify a position where those charges continue to bear on group schemes which will not benefit from the abolition of service charges?  Most of the individuals involved have cars because people in rural areas cannot manage without them but they must <Col N="654" /> pay increased motor taxation.  Does the Minister understand the double cost which will be involved in the future for people who receive their water supply from group schemes?  The Minister calls his decision major reform but previous attempts by the Labour Party to reform local government created greater chaos.  It is unfortunate the Minister did not give the matter much more thought before making his decision.  It was poorly thought out and the decision cuts across two basic principles, equity and subsidiarity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>The entire package of local government reform measures encompasses much more than the funding mechanism, it covers in a comprehensive way the relationship between councillors and management and the general public, quality service initiatives and so on.  The funding mechanism proposed is fair.  If one is paying £200 per year in car tax, a 3 per cent increase next year will amount to £6.  Is the Deputy suggesting that this is an unbearable burden?  For the first time there will be a ring-fenced buoyant source of funding collected locally to allow local government get on with the job that we all want it to do.  Its merits should be recognised and, because of the year that is in it, people should not attempt to shoot down what is a good scheme. The local authorities, ultimately, will not thank any of us for it.</P>

When domestic rates were abolished Sylvester Barrett included a formula in the legislation to ensure each local authority would receive a sum equal to the amount collected by way of domestic rates.  It was the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who removed that statutory requirement.  We cannot trust the Labour Party when dealing with local government matters. There is chaos in each local authority because of the way the funding mechanism was destroyed by the Tánaiste when Minister for the Environment.

This includes the additional £5 million allocated to upgrade schemes.  I have asked the local authorities to compile an inventory of each scheme throughout the country so that we will know exactly what needs to be done to make a supply of good water available for the first time to many schemes.  We will be as successful in tackling this matter as we were in solving the pothole problem to which we did not pay lipservice, as Deputy O'Hanlon will be aware.

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Ring &mdash; the need to instruct the Western Health Board to appoint a dentist for the Belmullet area, County Mayo, either in a temporary or permanent capacity, in view of the delays in dental treatment for young people in the area; (2) Deputy Lawlor &mdash; the situation facing teachers who devoted part of their career to <Col N="658" /> underdeveloped countries in Africa and are now facing a threat to their full pension entitlements despite previous assurances that their overseas service would be fully recognised for both incremental and pensionable purposes; (3) Deputy Flaherty &mdash; the urgent need to resolve the industrial relations problems in the Department of Education in light of the cancellation of the applied leaving certificate assessments which affected 3,000 students; (4) Deputy Shortall &mdash; the need to put the home help service on a proper footing in order to ensure standardisation of service and rates of pay; (5) Deputy Seán Ryan &mdash; the effects of the phasing out of duty free facilities in 1999 and the need for the Government to reactivate this issue within the EU; (6) Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; the failure of a new sewage treatment plant in Dingle, County Kerry to treat the effluent from local fish processing factories and whether an explanation will be sought from the consultants engaged in planning the scheme; (7) Deputy Nealon &mdash; the impending closure of Geevagh post office, County Sligo without any notification to old age pensioners and other users and the need to retain this service in view of the fact that this area is now participating in a Government pilot scheme, ACE, on public services in rural areas; (8) Deputy de Valera &mdash; the serious situation in County Clare due to the lack of remedial school teachers; (9) Deputy Molloy &mdash; if an investigation has been carried out at Carlow Regional Technical College on part-time teacher and temporary whole-time teacher contracts which have not been reviewed for this academic year resulting in severe loss of monthly income.</P>

      <P>Before I state whether we agree to that, I wish to raise another matter.  Last week I asked the Taoiseach if he would agree to issue the Government document on the deflector system, in response to which he told me to table a question to the relevant Minister, which my colleague, Deputy Brennan, did.  However, the Minister did not place the document in the Library or forward a copy of it to me, as I had requested in <Col N="659" /> the House.  On the basis that the Minister has seen fit to give the document to one of the bodies involved in the south, will the Taoiseach confirm if the report will be given to the Opposition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was given to the body in question in the south following a requirement of the court.  That was binding on the Minister because of that court decision.  The Minister dealt with this matter in an Adjournment debate. If the Deputy wishes to obtain further information, I again invite him to table a question to the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is an issue of great importance which I have declined to press over a number of weeks.  Public meetings on it have been held throughout the country over a long period. The Taoiseach will remember one he attended in Carrigaline in autumn 1994.  This matter has continued to develop since then.  I considered it responsible that we should await the findings and the conclusions of the Government report which has cost the taxpayer a good deal of money.  I do not see any reason an independent report commissioned by the Government and now in the hands of others cannot be given to the politicians elected to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I prefaced my remarks by asking that any extra resources to be put into this area should be devoted first to family and community support services.  The Bill addresses prevention in a serious way.  The provision of family and community support services to those in need and under pressure is one of the most effective ways of ensuring children will not come in contact with the system for which the Bill legislates in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with the juvenile liaison system in my previous work in the youth and community area. It has been the Cinderella of the juvenile justice system to date, not in terms of the effort or interest of the personnel from the Garda Síochána participating in the scheme, but in terms of <Col N="668" /> not having the statutory back-up, the organisational and management support within the Garda and the commitment of the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to juvenile liaison officers in the Garda Síchána who, with little back-up and support, have worked effectively in communities across the country for many years.  I am pleased their role is to be recognised in law and a director of the service is to be established within the Garda.  Giving them the powers to call family conferences and to deal on a statutory basis with parents, guardians and other relatives will strengthen their work.  The resources they require within the Garda Síochána are small, proving that while answers to these kinds of problems depend on resources, they also depend on effective personnel who are interested in their work.</P>
    <P>In the town from where I come, the juvenile liaison officer, who does more than his share of the work he is obliged to do during the week, is also chairman of the board of management of the community training workshop for early school leavers and of the board of management of the local youth services board.  His input is replicated by others in many towns and communities.  The members of the juvenile liaison officers scheme will welcome the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the serious manner in which children's courts are being addressed.  Hitherto, these have been shamefully handled under the 1908 Act.  The provisions regarding the Constitution and the procedures in these courts will make them more friendly, not alone to those who may be tried or brought before them but also to victims who may have to give evidence.  The changes proposed will only have serious effect when the issue of courthouse accommodation is addressed, so resources for these courts should be a priority.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the children's courts is to avoid detention.  Under section 133, imprisonment will be abolished.  I attended a courtroom where a child was sentenced to imprisonment at Mountjoy Prison.  Those in attendance felt a great sense of shame, but the judge considered that to bring the child's case to the attention of the authorities he had no other option but to impose such a sentence. The aim here is to provide effective sanctions outside of a place of detention, while a place of detention will be available as a last resort.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome development from the point of view both of the child charged before the court, and who may be convicted, and the victim of crime.  Without the back-up of legislation, people working in the judicial system in local areas have attempted to implement an unofficial system of fines and compensation to avoid bringing the child formally into the judicial net.  Their purpose has also been to provide the victim, for example of a break-in, burglary or malicious damage, with a feeling of recompense.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the area of fines and compensation.  The safeguards built in to protect <Col N="669" /> families in financial difficulty will be used by the courts.  However, they will also give the victims of crime a sense that their needs and experiences are recognised.  I hope the compensation system will be used to give victims material compensation for damage done, especially where it is not of a serious nature.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the range of community or non-custodial sanctions, where a penalty is imposed on the young offender without sending him to a place of detention.  Judges, gardaí and probation workers have tried to do this through the years. However, the provision of specific powers and the differentiation in types of orders is helpful.  For example, there are probation orders, similar to the orders already provided, and orders allowing the person undergo a period of training or education, a period of intensive supervision and a period of residential supervision.  There is also a provision to allow the court impose an order of care and supervision and orders regarding support for families, which is very welcome because the imposition of a probation order on the child may not be effective in the absence of providing support to the family to deal with what is a very difficult situation.  The provision regarding the restriction of movement is also unfortunately necessary in a small number of cases.</P>
    <P>These innovations are responses to practices that have evolved.  They also take account of the range of sanctions and other penalties in the community which can be effective in penalising children while educating and directing them away from the penal system.  The early introduction of any young person or child to the penal system is a recipe for reoffending and anything that encourages them in another direction is welcome.</P>
    <P>However, the effective implementation of these provisions will require a large increase in the resources available to the probation and welfare service.  In my previous work, I dealt with many probation officers.  They, like the juvenile liaison officers, are strongly committed to their work but over the years they tend to become disillusioned and leave the service because the resources they require to effectively supervise young offenders and ensure they avoid future custodial sentences have not been available.  I urge the Minister of State to back these good provisions with effective targeting of resources to the probation and welfare services.</P>
    <P>The vexed question of child detention schools has come before the courts on many occasions and has involved some high profile cases.  I welcome the organisation of these schools under a single board of management.  The present provision is too fragmented, with insufficient co-ordination and liaison between the various places of detention for young offenders.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill which will prevent a place of detention refusing entry to any child.  It has been suggested that it may be more feasible to provide that the service generally, or the board of management responsible for the service, cannot refuse to accept a child, but that the <Col N="670" /> director of the board would have the power to send the child to a place of detention.  Those working in the juvenile justice area suggest that the director should have the power to send the child to a suitable place of detention.  Will the Minister of State comment on this?</P>
    <P>The provisions are cumbersome and may result in a child falling between two stools.  The detention school would have to take a child referred to it by a court but I would like to know whether the director or the individual school would decide the matter.  In the event of pressure on places in a particular school the process which the head of that school may have to go through to refuse a child may be cumbersome and lead to delays.</P>
    <P>I encourage as much variety as possible in the type of children detention schools to be put in place.  As many as possible should be provided in the communities from which the children come. We can be imaginative in this area.  In the past the Department of Education recognised special schools in conjunction with neighbourhood youth projects.  There are special day care centres which could be used for child offenders without necessarily placing a child in an institution far away from their place of residence, from which they will find it difficult to reintegrate into the community when their time of detention is complete.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his achievement in bringing this legislation before the House.  Last week I listened with interest to Deputy Flood who has experience as a Minister of State in this area.  In the past there were kneejerk reactions by various Governments in response to cases highlighted in the courts.  Judges made examples of cases in order to put pressure on the Government.  The media, social workers and probation workers said the failure of previous Governments to address this issue meant they had to exert pressure to resolve individual cases.  While that might work in individual cases it does not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on deciding that a Minister of State would work in conjunction with three Departments &mdash; Justice, Education and Health.  When the Bill is enacted, I ask the Minister of State to pay attention to its implementation and ensure the co-ordination he has effected between the three Departments will be carried through by their agents so that young people will not experience the fragmentation we have witnessed at legislative and official level.  I would appreciate his comments on the interface between the three Departments in respect of 16 and 18 years olds.  A distinction is being made between the roles of the Departments of Justice and Education as regards responsibility for those up to the age of 16 and 18 years.  Health boards have responsibility for those up to 18 years of age. I ask him to ensure the buck is not passed in respect of 16 to 18 year olds and that the Bill, when enacted, is implemented in a sensible fashion that meets their needs and those of their families and communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this new legislation which updates the 1908 Act.  While it seeks to put many programmes on a statutory basis it could go further.  I will confine my remarks to two areas, one of which is the juvenile liaison officer scheme.</P>
      <P>In my limited experience as a public representative I have come to realise the value of the juvenile liaison officer scheme in County Donegal where there are three juvenile liaison officers.  They deal with approximately 44,000 people under the age of 18 and have an 80 per cent to 90 per cent success rate in that people do not re-offend.  This is a golden opportunity not only to put the juvenile liaison officer scheme on a statutory basis but to increase the resources.  If those under the age of 18 can be introduced to that scheme, which has proved successful, surely a stronger programme would help more children and keep them on the straight and narrow.  Ultimately we are trying to prevent them from getting into serious trouble and keep them out of prison.  If it has worked surely that is the way to proceed.  Other speakers said juvenile liaison officers are often associated with sporting clubs.  In Donegal such officers are involved in many community based activities.  Thus it is easy for them to meet young people and have a positive influence on them.</P>
      <P>A matter that should be examined not only by the Minister of State but by other Departments is the issue of funding for sporting facilities.  Different sporting facilities are required to bring children together.  In most small communities 100 to 200 children of varying age groups are brought together for sports purposes.  Children of varying ages, gender and religious beliefs have no difficulty associating in gaelic games, soccer, swimming or tennis groups and participation in all such activities gives them considerable teamwork experience.  This has a positive impact not only within their own group but in the community.</P>
      <P>When involved in sport young people are occupied and assume a sense of responsibility.  Children may become involved in anti-social behaviour out of boredom.  I ask the Minister to use his influence with other Ministers to get more funding for sporting and recreational facilities for young people as that is the key to keeping them on the straight and narrow.</P>
      <P>Many EU programmes are geared towards social inclusion and trying to stop social exclusion.  To get children playing together on the sports field is a step forward and should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>I wish more money had been made available for social workers.  What happens at the end of the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. working day?  Many parents return from work and children return from school at 5 p.m.  In many health board areas there may not be a facility for social workers after 5 p.m.  In the event of a family problem or a child getting out of control there is no one to call.  Provision should be made for a 24 hour help line.  This is a serious lack in the Bill, particularly when a difficulty arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> The Bill seeks to put various programmes on a statutory basis.  The social workers service and the juvenile liaison officer scheme should be extended.  We are trying to provide for the children of the future and ensure they do not go down the path of prisons and so on.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very welcome legislation and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  I wish to confine my remarks to the section dealing with the Child Care Act, 1991.  I do so because of the level of child neglect in my constituency and in other constituencies, both urban and rural.  We are told that 80 per cent of crime is drugs related.  I wish to deal with the drugs problem in so far as it relates to child neglect.  I have been told that in some areas children as young as one year or 18 months have been left unattended on grass verges during the evening.  I would like this serious matter to be investigated to see how widespread it is.</P>
      <P>In a case I reported to the Eastern Health Board seven children were in care and a three year old child and six month old baby were with the mother.  Following the death of the six month old child in very strange circumstances, the three year old child was taken from the mother, who is due to give birth to another child in April, and put into care.  What measures are in place to protect children who are in serious danger from the moment they are born?  What steps can the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for these children, take to deal with such cases?  These are the matters of concern to me and I hope the Bill deals with them.</P>
      <P>We have heard reports of children who have been locked into houses for many days.  In one case five children, the eldest of whom was ten years, were locked in a house for three days during which time one of the children lost his finger after being hit with a lump hammer.  It was only after the intervention of neighbours that these children were take from the house and given proper care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases children as young as two, three, four and five years witness their parents injecting themselves with heroine.  These children are at risk from a health and welfare point of view.  I am aware of a case where children were taken from their parents who are drug addicts and put into the care of their grandparents who did not want them and dumped them in various places.  I do not want to exaggerate the problem but figures can hide the tragedy behind many problems.  Last January these children were left out in the snow with no proper clothing or food, while one of them did not have his nappy changed for four days.  Even though it was reported, nobody took responsibility for them.  Eventually they were <Col N="673" /> taken in by families who gave them the care to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I wish to give some more examples which will highlight the kind of deprivation which is beginning to develop as a result of neglect of children by parents who are drug addicts.  Following a house fire some days ago a father, who was totally intoxicated, brought his children into the local authority offices.  These children, who were looking after their father, were hungry and had to be fed by local authority personnel.  Will the Minister introduce, in conjunction with the Bill, an emergency service so that the Eastern Health Board can intervene in such cases which unfortunately are becoming more prevalent?  Mechanisms must be put in place immediately to ensure that information is given to the Eastern Health Board as soon as possible.  There must also be immediate intervention by all State agencies, including the Garda who can play a central role in cases where children are at serious risk.  The Garda operates on a 24 hours a day basis and already has a communications system in place.  We need an emergency service which will save, cherish and look after children who are being neglected by drug addicted parents.  Child neglect may not always be related to drugs but the two problems are becoming increasingly related.</P>

      <P>Following the Child Care Act, 1991, the Bill finally repeals the remaining provisions of the 1908 Children Act.  The Child Care Act and the Bill form a comprehensive child protection package. I hope we have learned lessons from the delay in the implementation of the Child Care Act and that this Bill will be backed up with sufficient resources to allow for the swift implementation of all its sections.</P>
      <P>I am delighted at the decision to increase the age of criminal responsibility.  The current age of seven years is the lowest in the European Union &mdash; I am not saying this should colour our thinking or determine how we act but it should be borne in mind &mdash; and reflects a Victorian view of crime and punishment.  I have been told that this age was picked to reflect the determination by the major religion at the time that the age of reason was seven years.  I am sure that religion has changed its mind about this issue in the meantime. I welcome the provision under which there will be a three yearly review of the age limit. Given the changes in society, it is important to review certain provisions at specific times. However, the age limit of ten is still too low.  In this context I welcome the flexibility being provided for in the three yearly review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be extremely difficult to impose an arbitrary cut-off point for criminal responsibility. <Col N="674" /> We all know ten year olds who are mature and are fully aware of the consequences of their actions.  However, we are all equally aware of 12, 13 and 14 year olds whom some seven year olds could take to the fair and back and they would not know they had left the house because they are so immature.</P>
    <P>Rather than simply raising the age of criminal responsibility, I would welcome the establishment of two categories: under the age of 11 years where no responsibility can attach and a separate category of 11 and 12 year olds where criminal responsibility can attach but is rebuttable.  I am sure the Minister of State will look at that required flexibility.  It is notoriously difficult for legislation to reflect individual circumstances. However, such a differentiation can take account of the fact that children do not develop mentally, emotionally or physically at the same rate.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will take these concerns on board and that a compromise can be achieved which reflects the needs of individual children as well as those of society.  This Bill is trying desperately to strike a delicate balance between the rights of the child and the rights of society, which are interlinked.</P>
    <P>I also urge the Minister of State to address the issue of detention.  When we refer to a child within the meaning of this Bill, we are referring to a child between the age of ten and 18 years.  It is quite inappropriate for such juveniles, particularly in the lower age bracket, to be detained in a Garda station under any circumstances, except for the purpose of the initial interview.</P>
    <P>Section 43 states: &ldquo;The member in charge of a Garda Síochána station shall, as far as practicable, ensure that any child while detained in the station shall not associate with an adult who is so detained&rdquo;.  However, most Garda stations do not have the physical accommodation to ensure such separation and children will inevitably end up being held with adult detainees.  A workable alternative could be the establishment of a separate detention facility in the form of closely supervised hostels which would be separate from the detention schools envisaged at the court proceedings.</P>
    <P>We recently held a referendum during which the issue of bail was teased out at some length. In the light of that referendum and the concerns which were raised about the possible grounds under which people may be denied bail, I am amazed by the bail condition detailed in section 55(2) which states: &ldquo;A child shall not be released on bail...if the member in charge has reason to believe that the release of the child would defeat the ends of justice&rdquo;.  This is one of the most sweeping clauses in this legislation.  I would like to see the circumstances under which a juvenile can be denied bail far more circumscribed.  If denied bail, where will ten, 11 and 12 year olds be detained?  I urge the Minister of State to re-examine that section with a view to finding a more palatable solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> We need to catch vulnerable children before they come within the remit of this Bill and into contact with the criminal justice system.  It is unfortunate that when children come into contact with the State it is usually at the final stage rather than at the beginning.  While researching the background of this Bill I came across the following profile of a mugger.  He &mdash; it is normally a male &mdash; is young, almost invariably in his teens or early twenties.  He will tend to come from an area suffering from social disadvantage and poor resources such as schools and recreational facilities. He has a 50 per cent chance of coming from a troubled home where alcohol abuse is a factor. There is a strong likelihood that he is addicted to drugs or alcohol, or both.  There is an 89 per cent chance that he left school before the age of 16 years with no qualifications.  In two out of five cases he has been in contact with the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>That profile was not plucked out of thin air. The Bill goes a long way towards dealing with children in that category.  However, in order to ensure that many do not fit that profile, we need a multi-agency approach to dealing with children. I will save the rest of what I have to say for Committee Stage because I am anxious to allow some time to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  However, I appreciate the Bill and I know it will have a long and fruitful Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lynch for sharing her time with me.  I welcome this very important Bill.  Any analysis of the work of this Dáil will highlight the fact that children's issues were one of the key areas we discussed and for which we legislated, which is important and right. It is, however, outrageous that it has taken so long for this Legislature to respond to the needs of children.  It is disgraceful that the current legislation covering this area dates back to 1908.  That tells us that, until very recently, the rights of children did not receive the sort of legislative attention which they ought to have had, despite how we like to think of ourselves as a child and family centred society.  I am very pleased to be a Member of a Dáil which has paid so much attention to children's rights.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials on bringing this legislation before the Dáil.  Everybody knows that trying to bring three Departments together to produce legislation is a most difficult task.  The fact that responsibility for children is divided between three Departments is one of the factors which has made it almost impossible to bring forward such legislation.  This is very complicated legislation to which I cannot do justice in five minutes but I would like to make a number of points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As somebody with a background in social work, I have a particular interest in this Bill.  I was the first Deputy to call for the establishment of an all party committee on children and I also emphasised the need for a national inspectorate <Col N="676" /> of child care.  I am very pleased that we now have an Oireachtas committee dealing with family issues and a promised national inspectorate of child care.  That is very important because we must view this Bill, and the children to whom it refers, against a very wide background.  We must take into account the disadvantages which they face.  I make no apologies for highlighting that.  It is incredibly important that we have secure facilities, remove these children from danger and take them off the streets.  However, it is equally important that we emphasise, and are aware of, the enormous disadvantages faced by so many of these children.  This was very appropriately highlighted by Deputy Lynch and Deputy Éamon Walsh.</P>
    <P>We need to appoint an ombudsperson for children. No Department likes to have an ombudsperson looking over its shoulder but the Minister of State has put forward this idea.  I would like to hear his views on whether this is practicable.  The value of the ombudsman has been proved in the area of social welfare and it is very satisfactory to see how he has dealt with cases.  I would like to see an ombudsperson for children appointed soon.</P>
    <P>It is probably very difficult to come up with an appropriate title for such schools but is &ldquo;children detention schools&rdquo; the best possible title?  It has a very odd ring to it.  I ask the Minister of State to re-examine that name.</P>
    <P>Family conferences are a well established precedent in social work and I welcome their use in the Bill for children who get into trouble with the law.  However, could the Minister of State consider having these cases conferences initiated not just by the Garda, as is the case in the Bill, but also by other professionals?  That might broaden the scope of the conferences and could be useful.</P>
    <P>Staff working in residential centres have welcomed the Bill but have expressed a number of concerns about it.  Among those concerns is the fact that when a child is admitted to one of these schools there is no contact with the parents for approximately eight weeks.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of allowing some flexibility in that area.</P>
    <P>I agree members of the travelling community should be on the working party established to address the problem of children begging on our streets.  It is important that we have their views on dealing with this complex issue.  We will not do any justice to this problem if we pretend there are easy solutions.  It can be resolved but questions arise in relation to resources.</P>
    <P>The question of parental responsibility is emphasised throughout the Bill but that must be balanced with an understanding that in many cases we are dealing with disadvantaged parents. I welcome the additional resources the Minister has put into child care but I repeat, as I have often said in this House, that when it comes to child care we are coming from a very low base in terms of resources.  We are seeing new problems emerge such as homelessness and young refugee <Col N="677" /> children prostituting themselves on the streets of Dublin.  That is a totally new phenomenon that requires additional resources if it is to be adequately tackled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which raises key issues and puts a structure on the whole area of juvenile justice. We are currently experiencing economic success but we should judge our country's success not just in terms of the economy but the way we treat our children, particularly those most disadvantaged. The Bill will go a long way towards ensuring that we reach out to those children but the Minister will need more resources to continue the job to which he has applied himself to so successfully since taking office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate which, to a large extent, have been of a constructive nature.  The debate has been thoughtful and thought provoking and that illustrates the seriousness with which we all consider the problem of juvenile crime.  I had intended making some general observations on the Bill but, given the number of areas I need to cover and the time available, I will try to do justice to the contributions by concentrating on the points made.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with Deputy O'Donoghue's assertion that the Bill is not innovative.  In setting about reviewing an area of the law as broad as the one covered by the Bill, it must be accepted that one does not completely have a free hand. There are parameters which cannot be wished or legislated away.  That is particularly the case when one is dealing with a complex, pre-existing system such as the juvenile justice system.  We cannot tear down an edifice on which the State relies on a daily basis.  It must be recognised that changing such a system cannot take place in a short space of time; it is a process which must be given time to develop in an organised way.  The flexibility of the provisions in this Bill will allow for that development in accordance with prevailing conditions at any time.  Constitutional and legal constraints are obvious examples.</P>
      <P>During the course of the necessarily lengthy period of preparation of the Bill, a number of juvenile justice models around the world were examined to see if there were worthwhile approaches suitable for adaptation to our circumstances.  The Scottish juvenile justice system is often held up as a model of its kind but the reality is that if it were to be imposed here, it would encounter constitutional problems.  For that reason, a model along the lines of that system was a non-starter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must also accept that there are constraints related to the availability of resources.  The question of resources was raised by most Deputies, including Deputies Haughey and Flaherty.  All of us must recognise that there will not be a limitless fund to meet costs associated with operating a revised juvenile justice system.  That is a fact of life with which we must live.  I recognise, however, that a new juvenile justice system cannot <Col N="678" /> be provided on the cheap and it will demand the application of properly targeted resources if it is to be successful.  My record on bringing the Child Care Act, 1991 fully into operation should allay fears that the implementation of this Bill will be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bree considered the title of the Bill unsuitable for a juvenile justice Bill.  I would not have any problem using a title such as Juvenile Justice Bill if juvenile justice matters only were contained in the Bill, but it has a wider scope including protection provisions and a Part dealing with out of control non-offending children.  The title covers all three aspects of the Bill and is technically necessary.  It also allows us introduce the child pornography provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the age of criminal responsibility.  Deputy O'Donnell wanted to know the reason the age of criminal responsibility could not be raised to 12 years.  Perhaps a number of Deputies have in mind the recommendation some years ago of the Select Committee on Crime.  I assure Deputies that much weight was attached to that recommendation when the proposals before the House were being prepared. Account also had to be taken of the fact that, regardless of the age to which the age of criminal responsibility is raised, there must be a credible alternative for dealing with troublesome youngsters below that age.  The Bill recognises that a five year change in the age of criminal responsibility in one go would place an intolerable burden on those charged with looking after difficult children under that age.  The aim of the Bill does not differ fundamentally from that of the advocates of 12 years; it is simply that the Bill recognises that a staged approach must take place.  I believe Deputy Lynch was prepared to accept that when she raised this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a particular difficulty which may be associated with a rise in the age of criminal responsibility, namely, that children under that age may be used by unscrupulous adults to commit offences.  That is a good point which I will consider before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall stated that 15 is the age of criminal responsibility in Scandinavian countries and that we should move towards that.  I do not have the time to respond in detail on this point but it should be taken into account that fundamentally different legal systems apply in those countries, and it does not follow that what holds in those countries would suit our circumstances. For example, the meaning of the expression &ldquo;the age of criminal responsibility&rdquo; is different in mainland Europe from that in common law countries such as Ireland.  The alternative meaning, as explained by Deputy Flood, simply could not be transferred to the reality of our legal and constitutional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue raised points in relation to curfews, that is, the provision in the Bill for community sanctions which entail placing restrictions on the movement of young offenders.  The <Col N="679" /> Deputy seemed to favour penalising the parents or guardian, as well as the young offender, for breach of a restriction on movement order.  The parents or guardian would know about the existence of the order because the court would be required to send a certified copy of it to them and the judge could make it clear what is expected of them in relation to the performance of the community sanction by their child.  It would be going too far, however, to penalise a parent or guardian where, for example, a child climbs out the window.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell, Haughey, Kenny and Walsh were concerned that the Bill did not sufficiently address the issue of drugs and their impact on the criminality of the young.  The sad reality is that drug abuse underlies crimes committed by many of the young people who are the focus of this Bill.  The Bill is intended to allow for drug-related measures where that is necessary in particular cases, but the way in which it does so is not very obvious because it is not a function of this Bill to focus on specific causes of crime or on social problems.</P>
    <P>The growing problem of drug abuse among young people who are out of home is presenting major new challenges to the child care services, in particular to the staff in residential centres trying to manage their behaviour.  The board is developing new strategies to combat this problem. I will bring the points made by Deputy Walsh to the attention of the Eastern Health Board.  The board's child care and drug services are working on a joint initiative which will include the establishment of treatment services for adolescents in the north and south inner city.  The board is also examining the skills mix of the staff in residential centres to cope with young people who present with serious drug problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked if the new board of management should have a role in the court's decision on which school to send the offender. The court will have available to it in virtually all such cases a probation officer's report and possibly some other report, such as a psychological report, which will offer guidance to the court on the appropriate options in a particular case.  The board's chief executive, as part of his or her case management role, will have the power to transfer the child offender to a more appropriate school should it transpire that the offender is unsuited to the one to which he or she is sent or that the child's needs have changed so that they are more suited to the particular programmes or treatment offered by another school.  Deputy Gallagher suggested that school directors should have the power to allocate children to other detention schools.  I want to avoid differences between directors about appropriate schools for children. For that reason the decision as to which school a child should be transferred to will rest with the board of management.  In practice, the board's chief executive will decide on the transfer in consultation with the directors concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> While on the subject of the children detention schools, Deputy Flood was concerned about a revolving door policy developing if schools were not allowed to refuse admittance.  Such a development would defeat the purpose of what we are trying to achieve with these schools.  Under section 92 a court will be able to defer the implementation of a children detention order until a suitable place becomes available.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donoghue, Broughan, Haughey and Keaveney spoke of the importance of sport in diverting children from involvement in criminal activities.  I strongly endorse that view.  Sporting activities have great potential for giving children at risk of becoming involved in crime a positive and satisfying outlet for their energy and interests.  The crime prevention scope of such activities is invariably undervalued.  They should be given every encouragement.  The family conference provides an opportunity for young offenders to become involved in sporting or other positive activities in their areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell drew attention to the Foster Care Association's concern about the power under section 90 to order the parent or guardian to pay compensation.  Officials of the Departments of Justice and Health met representatives of the Foster Care Association in recent weeks and were able to allay its concerns in this regard. I will introduce amendments to sections 90 and 91 which will exclude foster parents from the scope of both sections.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell, Haughey and Kenny raised the problem of homeless children, in the Eastern Health Board region in particular.  The delivery of services for homeless children is provided for under the framework of the Child Care Act, 1991.  The Eastern Health Board has introduced a wide range of important measures to help tackle this problem.  These are too extensive to outline in detail but they include an emergency short-term residential unit, supported lodgings to maintain young people in their area of home origin, a day project, the funding of St. Vincent's Trust to include out of home young people in the training programmes offered by the trust and the funding of a number of hostels run by voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>Deputies Haughey and Gallagher, in particular, raised the question of the need to provide support to families through the development of parenting skills.  I place great emphasis on the development of such skills.  The development of parenting skills is crucial if we are to be successful in reducing juvenile crime.  Health boards provide a range of services to assist parents and families in difficulty. These include the community mothers programme, the provision of nursery services and family support services.  However, the Government recognises that much more needs to be done in this area and the issue of how best to proceed in the development of parenting programmes has been referred to the Commission on the Family for its consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Deputy O'Donoghue made a point about the need for more research.  He stated that some research had been carried out but that it is very thin on the ground.  I could not agree more with him.  Section 225, which provides that the Minister for Justice may conduct or assist other persons in conducting research, should go some way towards improving matters in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan made a point about the school attendance Bill not being before the House.  I accept that Bill is vital in the context of crime prevention and work on it is at an advanced stage.  I regard nine and ten year olds mitching from school as often the first indication that they are commencing a journey down the slippery slope to a life in crime.  Deputy Flood's point about the school attendance provisions being included in this Bill is taken.  However, they would make it even more unwieldy and could result in the school attendance provisions not receiving the attention they deserve.  Deputies should bear in mind that the Child Care Act, this Bill and the school attendance Bill are designed as a trinity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello felt that provision should be made for removing licences from proprietors of dance halls, discos and pubs who allow drugs to be sold on their premises.  The Deputy will be glad to know the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, recently obtained Government approval for the drafting of the Licensing Bill, 1997, the purpose of which will be to deal with drug abuse in dance halls, pubs and other licensed places of entertainment, as well as to enhance Garda powers in relation to unlicensed dances.  It will do exactly as the Deputy suggested.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donoghue, Haughey, Costello and Kenny referred to the proposed child pornography provisions.  I will introduce these by way of Committee Stage amendments.  While Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan are to be commended for the speed with which they introduced their Bill, we had to await the finalisation of the relevant European Joint Action before we could move our proposals forward.  Our proposals take a different approach to the problem of child pornography from that contained in the Private Members' Bill and would have made it difficult to amend that Bill.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies who spoke, including Deputies O'Donnell, Costello, Haughey, Bree and Fitzgerald, welcomed the provision on begging and Deputy Costello also welcomed the provisions on cruelty and neglect of children.  While not part of the framework on juvenile justice, these provisions offer increased protection to children against being put out to beg or being otherwise abused.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the welcome for the placing of the diversion programme on a statutory basis, as recommended by the Select Committee on Crime.  That will enhance the status of the present scheme and more resources will be attracted to it.  Deputy O'Donnell was concerned about follow-up and <Col N="682" /> assurances required by the victim, particularly in cases of a sexual nature.  I empathise with the Deputy's concern.  The provisions dealing with the diversion programme make it clear that great weight is given to the views of the victim before a child is admitted to the programme.  Less than half of 1 per cent of children involved in cases of a sexual nature are admitted to the programme. Those who are admitted are admitted because the close and intensive supervision they receive is considered the best way of ensuring they will not get into trouble again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flood thought persons such as community leaders should be involved in the family conference.  I agree.  Section 24 permits the JLO to ask any person whom he or she considers to have a knowledge of the child or whose presence would be of benefit to the conference to be present.  Such people would be community leaders, although I am not sure how one would define a community leader.  Persons whose presence would be appropriate would also extend beyond community leaders to others, such as priests, teachers, sports trainers and even neighbours. Any attempt to refer specifically to a particular category of people could inadvertently restrict those categories.</P>
    <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and Deputy Flaherty referred to an ombudsman for children and asked when progress would be made in making such an appointment.  Work is proceeding on preparations for the introduction of an ombudsman for children.  It has been referred to the Cabinet committee on children and I will make every effort to ensure the Government delivers on its commitment to that as quickly as possible. The appointment will add to the protections for children and will be a symbol of our determination and commitment to children's position in society being protected and promoted.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and I look forward to their positive participation when the Bill is examined in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>

Is mó an tairfe atá bainte ag na baill as ó bunaíodh é agus tá siad ag fanacht le fada le Bille mar seo.  Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht an méid oibre a rinne sé féin ag réiteach an Bhille seo chun é a thabhairt os comhair na Dála.</P>
      <P>Tá rudaí áirithe ann áfach nach bhfuilim róshásta leo agus beimid ag déanamh moltaí fúthu sin.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment on his work in bringing this Bill before the House.  I will put aside the pre-electoral political sniping in which the Minister of State indulged over the weekend.  The credit union movement has waited a long time for this legislation.  Not everybody will be 100 per cent happy with the Bill as published, but the Minister of State should be congratulated on introducing such comprehensive legislation in a vitally important area.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement has been one of the outstanding success stories of the economy over the past 40 years.  The movement started in Ireland in 1958 and by the end of the following year there were three credit unions up and running. They had 200 members and total members' savings of £415.  The growth since then has been phenomenal.  There are now more than 530 credit unions with a total membership of more than 1.8 million.  We often think of Irish sporting bodies as large organisations, but the credit union movement puts all of them in the shade.  Total savings in credit unions now amount to a staggering £2 billion and they continue to grow at an impressive rate of 20 per cent per year.  By any standard this represents a tremendous record of achievement in 40 years.</P>
      <P>Equally impressive is the manner in which that success was achieved.  We have a tendency to look to the State to do things for us.  We set up agencies, committees and working parties.  We hand out grants and make tax concessions available. The credit union movement has grown and prospered without any State assistance.  There have been no grants and no help from State agencies. The opposite is the case.  The credit unions, as the employers of 1,500 people, are big contributors to the Exchequer every year and have invested hugely in Government securities.  They have helped the State instead of being helped by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit union movement is characterised by a philosophy of self help and community spirit. We could do with more of that philosophy.  My party leader was taken to task recently by left wing ideologues for suggesting that we should help people to help themselves, as if this was an heretical statement.  Can there be any better example of the way in which people can be helped to help themselves than the success of the credit union movement over the last 40 years? The acceptance of and support for the self help <Col N="684" /> principle in Ireland can be gauged from the fact that in terms of membership as a percentage of total population, Ireland ranks fourth in the world league table of credit unions.</P>
    <P>Local communities in villages, towns and cities pool their resources to help each other.  The credit unions show what could be achieved if we focused less on bureaucracy and more on releasing the tremendous energy and community spirit that is such a positive feature of our life.  The movement is an excellent example of what can be achieved by voluntary effort.  It depends on 12,000 voluntary workers throughout the country and, largely because of this voluntary effort, the unions can offer a cost effective service to their members.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that the credit unions have also played a valuable role in poorer communities by presenting a real and attractive alternative to illegal moneylenders or even legal operators charging extremely high interest rates. Credit unions have helped to maintain the social fabric of many communities by making available small loans at modest cost to enable people to get over short-term financial problems.</P>
    <P>I will deal with some of the problems in the Bill and I will start with the limits it places on loans and deposits.  The Bill proposes a maximum limit of £20,000 on shares and a maximum limit of £20,000 on deposits.  These figures might appear large at first sight but they must be seen in the context of redundancy as a fact of life in modern Ireland.  The Minister of State will be aware we are losing more and more of our traditional labour intensive industries.  Packard Electric in the Minister of State's constituency is an example of this phenomenon.  Large scale redundancies are also becoming common in the semi-State sector. The ESB, for example, is in the process of shedding thousands of jobs as part of its restructuring and rationalisation programme.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the workers being made redundant will have conducted most if not all of their financial business with their local credit unions. However, they will find when lodging their redundancy cheques that they might not be able to deal with the credit union because their investment is too large.  This will force people away from credit unions and into the mainstream financial services sector at precisely the time when, it could be argued, it makes most sense for them to stay with the credit union.</P>
    <P>There is no limit on deposits under existing legislation governing credit unions.  It appears arbitrary in the extreme to impose such limits now.  The Minister of State does not need to be reminded that credit unions operate on a one member, one vote system.  It makes no difference, therefore, in terms of voting control whether an individual owns £50 or £50,000 worth of shares. The Minister of State should consider deleting the upper limit on deposits or increasing the limit to a more realistic figure than the £20,000 proposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> A similar situation arises with regard to limits on loan advances.  The Bill proposes a cap of £20,000 on the amount that can be advanced to an individual.  This cap will impose a severe limitation on the ability of credit unions to satisfy the needs of their members.  The credit union movement deals mainly with small borrowings, the average loan amount being about £2,000.  Nonetheless, there are many cases in which a sum of £20,000 would be unrealistically small.  The credit unions are not keen to take on the banks and building societies in a head to head battle for the home mortgage market.  However, that is not to say there are not areas of the housing market in which the credit unions have a role to play.  Local authority tenants seeking to buy their homes from the council might be more likely to approach a credit union than a mainstream financial institution.  Equally, people seeking to extend their homes would like the option of going to their local credit union.  A sum of £20,000 is not great in terms of the cost of home extensions.</P>
    <P>I might understand the need for this new limit if the credit unions had been guilty of overlending and if there had been an unacceptable level of loan defaults but that has not been the case. When it comes to prudential management of their loan portfolios, the credit unions have a record of which any bank manager would be proud.  In the most recent year for which figures are available the value of loans more than 13 weeks in arrears was just over 3.5 per cent of total loan advances &mdash; a low figure by the standards of commercial banking which hardly gives rise to concern.  As with the cap which the Bill imposes on deposit amounts, this seems to be an arbitrary measure which gives inadequate discretion to credit union managements.  Those managements have shown their ability to use their discretion wisely and we should continue to trust them to do so.</P>
    <P>The £20,000 limit on loans will discriminate against casual workers whose only source of loan finance is the credit union movement.  Casual workers form one of the largest groups in the labour force.  Some have part-time jobs, some are on zero hour contracts and others are on fixed term temporary appointment contracts.  These contracts are becoming increasingly common in foreign owned industries in Ireland, many of which employ the bulk of their workforce indirectly through agencies on nine-month temporary contracts. This means the workers do not have the same rights and privileges as permanent staff. Increasing regulation of the labour market has resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of casual workers and there are up to 200,000 people in various forms of casual employment.</P>
    <P>The mainstream financial services industry does not cater for these people.  If they want to borrow money for a house, a car or a family holiday they would be unlikely to satisfy the lending criteria of the large financial institutions.  For people in casual employment the local credit union is their only bank and the credit union fills this role admirably.  It is incumbent on the <Col N="686" /> Government to make proper provision for casual workers to avail of financial services.  Imposing an arbitrary lending limit of £20,000 on credit unions gravely inhibits their capacity to deal with the needs of casual workers.  It prevents them from offering housing loans to such workers.  As it is, people in this category are forced to depend on the public housing system at great cost to the taxpayer. Why not allow them to help themselves? Why not give them the opportunity to buy their own homes?  Why not lift this arbitrary and unnecessary limit?</P>
    <P>The credit union movement operates on an all-Ireland basis but this Bill will drive a considerable wedge between the credit unions in the two parts of Ireland.  The Minister of State should examine the legislation on credit unions in the UK.  The British legislation recognises there is no sense imposing a single arbitrary limit on all credit unions regardless of their size.  It also allows for a greater exercise of discretion by the management of individual credit unions.  The UK formula allows for an individual loan to be advanced to the value of 1.5 per cent of total paid up shareholdings or up to 20 per cent of a credit union's general reserve.  This is a more realistic arrangement especially when one considers that some credit unions can have total assets of £30 million or more.  The UK limit allows for a maximum limit of £10,000 in the case of smaller credit unions at an early stage of development where the percentage referred to would be so small as to be meaningless. The Minister of State should reconsider the caps he wishes to impose on deposits and loans.  He should consider following the British legislation in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are not many movements which operate on an all-Ireland basis.  The credit unions form one such movement and we should try to achieve as much harmonisation as possible.  Instead, the Minister of State seems intent on putting in place entirely different regulations to those which obtain north of the Border.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State might also consider that the £20,000 limit would place a major constraint on the credit unions' ability to lend to small businesses. The Minister of State's Department is well aware of the difficulties experienced by small firms in securing loan finance from the mainstream financial institutions.  Relaxing the £20,000 limit would be of considerable help in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is an old maxim which tells us &ldquo;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&rdquo; and this applies to the credit union movement.  For the past 40 years the credit unions have been self-regulating.  During that time no credit union secretary absconded with the life savings of its members, no credit union has collapsed due to mismanagement or fraud and no credit union has been implicated in any kind of financial scandal.  Elsewhere in the financial services industry there has been a sad litany of fraud and deception, particularly in relation to financial intermediaries, as far back as the 1970s.  However, we have been slow to take the necessary preventative measures to avoid people losing their savings. <Col N="687" /> By contrast, the credit union movement has been a paragon of virtue &mdash; self-regulated, it has worked extremely well; depositors have not lost money and credit unions have not collapsed due to bad lending.</P>
    <P>The only reason for the closure of any credit union has been the collapse of the common bond. In other words, credit unions based in particular firms have had to close when the firms closed &mdash; Semperit in Dublin is an example with which the Minister of State would be familiar.  In these cases, an orderly transfer of engagements to neighbouring credit unions has always been accomplished in an effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives new powers to the Registrar of Friendly Societies with regard to the regulation of credit unions.  It is my understanding the credit union movement has no difficulty with the overall prudential requirements laid down in the new legislation.  It is important that the registrar and his staff do not become unduly involved in day to day decisions which should remain the preserve of credit union managements.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions has played an important part in the development of the credit union movement over the past 40 years.  The league has also played a key role in ensuring individual credit unions complied with all prudential requirements and new unions had the appropriate management and control systems in place from the day they began operations.  In the past six years total savings in credit unions have trebled.  It is a tribute to the work of the league that the explosion in the credit union movement should have occurred without scandals or shocks to the system.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the league of credit unions is not mentioned in the Bill.  Will the Minister of State explain why?  The Bill should provide for a leading role for the league.  It would be better and more cost effective to let the league continue the job it has been doing so well for so many years rather than hire more civil servants to work in the office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>Several of the more &ldquo;go-ahead&rdquo; credit unions have started to offer a variety of new services. Some of them operate ATMs, some offer foreign exchange services and some sell motor insurance. Section 48 requires credit unions to secure approval from the Registrar of Friendly Societies before offering any new service to their customers. This process could prove to be cumbersome, bureaucratic and unnecessary.  In many cases, these services, such as foreign exchange transactions, do not involve any risk to depositors or shareholders.  Other transactions, such as the sale of motor insurance, are conducted on an agency basis and do not carry any inherent risk. In an era when financial products can be bought in supermarkets, the philosophy upon which section 48 is based seems to be outdated and overcautious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> The Bill does not refer to corporation tax. Until now, credit unions were excluded from the provisions of corporation tax legislation, a reflection in part of the voluntary nature of the movement. This Bill gives rise to uncertainty in that regard.  I am sure it is not this Government's policy to impose corporation tax on credit unions because to do so would amount to imposing a tax on voluntary effort and community spirit.  Perhaps the Minister might use this opportunity to clarify the position on corporation tax.  Will he give an assurance that the credit unions will continue to enjoy the same tax exemptions as before? This is a serious issue for the movement and it is important to dispel any lingering uncertainty about the tax treatment of credit unions.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have not so far been required to comply with EU banking directives.  I understand Brussels is satisfied that credit unions can be exempted from the directives on the basis that they offer their services to their members only and not to non-members.  Nonetheless, it is important to have reassurance in this regard.  The credit union movement has thrived without the need for huge and expensive bureaucracy.  It would be a pity if the EU imposed a heavy compliance burden on the movement at this stage. Accordingly, I ask the Minister to outline the current position and to state if credit unions will continue to be exempted from the European banking directives.</P>
    <P>This country owes a huge debt to the credit union movement.  Credit unions ensured that financial services were available to all sections of the community, regardless of social status or income. They have helped the economies of many towns and villages to thrive by pumping local savings into local investment.  They have harnessed voluntary effort for the common good and applied community spirit to improve the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people.  Were it not for the credit unions, how many families would not have bought a car, extended their house or sent their children to third level education?</P>
    <P>The credit union movement keeps a relatively low public profile.  It does not engage in wholesale political lobbying and it does not run aggressive campaigns like some of the more vociferous interest groups.  Instead, it is content to go about its business.  This debate, however, is important for the future of the credit union movement.  It is one of the few occasions when this House has been asked to look at the needs of the movement to see how best they can be met through new legislation.  We should all take that task seriously.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing this long awaited Bill.  However, I ask him to consider amending it in the ways I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I join Deputy Molloy in welcoming the introduction of this Bill and the work the Minister has done.  This subject has been raised on the Order of Business every week since I became a Deputy in 1992.  I often wondered if the promise to introduce this legislation <Col N="689" /> was like the promise to drain the Shannon. However, I am delighted the Minister has ensured it is not an empty promise and that the work done by the Department, the Irish League of Credit Unions and individual credit unions has resulted in the publication of this Bill.  I regret that Deputy Ned O'Keeffe is not here to continue his contribution to this debate.  I was surprised he did not welcome the Bill, although he suggested ways to amend it.</P>
      <P>I compliment the credit unions on the work they have done to highlight their concerns and the Irish League of Credit Unions on voicing those concerns to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I also commend the league on the lengthy negotiations it had with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Minister and his Department on proposals for this new legislation.  I am sure that process is not yet concluded and I expect that further consultations will take place to ensure the right legislation is put in place.  The Minister said it was unprecedented for a particular group in the financial services sector to have such an input into the drafting of legislation to govern its operation.  I am glad the credit union movement is involved in this process because, as previous speakers said, it is the most widespread community movement in the country and the best people's bank.</P>
      <P>Much discussion has taken place in my party about a third banking force.  I have always argued that the credit union movement is an effective third banking force.  When I joined the queue in my local credit union on the Friday before Christmas, I remarked that 90 per cent of the people there would probably not be welcome inside the door of the bank down the street.  The credit union in Tullamore is the largest in the county, although there are over a dozen smaller credit unions in my constituency which offer equally important services to the community.</P>
      <P>It is a tribute to those who made such an effort over the past 40 years that a movement which started in Germany in the last century and which diversified in so many different ways &mdash; in other European countries some have taken the form of commercial banks which are almost indistinguishable from other banks &mdash; has assumed a particular form which has enabled almost all members of the community to avail of its financial services, whether for First Communion, Confirmation, to buy a car, house or for investment in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the credit unions on providing more services than the traditional savings and loans schemes.  The new services they offer range from foreign exchange transactions to ATMs. One of the most effective and least publicised areas in which the credit unions have become involved is combating money lending in our community. Many credit unions have been doing this for a number of years through local groups such as the St. Vincent de Paul.  The introduction of the money advice and budgeting service on a more widespread basis would not help people to manage their finances and to stay out of the <Col N="690" /> clutches of money lenders without the active cooperation of the credit union movement.  I compliment the credit unions on the time given and effort made by their officers, volunteers and paid officials to ensure the success of this service.  We need legislation which updates the framework for the operation of credit unions, recognises their role and allows them the flexibility to continue to develop their services.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to a number of aspects of this Bill by the volunteer workers in credit unions and the Irish League of Credit Unions and I mention them in the full confidence that the Minister will deal with them in a satisfactory manner either at the conclusion of the Second Stage or on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>I agree that the role of the Irish League of Credit Unions should be given specific recognition in the Bill.  There are concerns that the protection afforded in section 12 by the use of the words &ldquo;credit union&rdquo; may not extend to the league.  Will the Minister consider introducing a new subsection or an amendment which will ensure that the Irish League of Credit Unions comes under the provisions of sections 12(3) and (4)?</P>
    <P>Concerns have also been expressed regarding the provisions for the recognition of a body of credit unions.  The credit union movement would expect that the current membership of the league, which includes members in Northern Ireland, would be recognised in the Bill and that whatever framework is established would make it clear that the league is covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Assurance has also been sought regarding the mutual assistance insurance and other services provided by the league.  Will the Minister confirm that the insurance products provided through the ECU assurance system, the savings protection scheme and the CUMAS/CUNA arrangement against loss due to fraud or dishonesty will continue? They have worked well and offer great security to individual credit unions and their members and it would be unfortunate if there were doubts about the future operation of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the provisions on confidentiality and the powers to inspect books?  Will the monitoring and regulation of affiliates already carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions continue under the Bill?  This monitoring is an example to the wider financial services sector of how a responsible body of volunteers can provide effective self-regulation.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider including a section recognising the Irish League of Credit Unions as it would reassure the league and its members.</P>
    <P>The league has made suggestions regarding section 6(2) which refers to the conditions of registration.  There is merit in specifying a number of the objects for a credit union as mandatory and allowing others to be optional.  Section 6(2) is too loose.  Under section 6(1)(a) a society has to be <Col N="691" /> formed for one or more of the objects specified in subsection (2).  The league has suggested that, in subsection (2), objects (a) to (c) be grouped and be mandatory and that objects (d) to (g) be optional.  There is a lot to commend this argument.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the maximum loan which may be sanctioned by credit unions.  The Bill allows for sufficient flexibility whereby the Minister may vary the limits on shares and deposits without further legislation.  With a minor adjustment we may be able to achieve a broad level of agreement regarding shares and deposits. However, I am concerned that the maximum loan provisions do not allow for this level of flexibility. The average loan sanctioned is small.  As credit unions operate on an individual basis, the supervisors and directors know their members and the whole basis of the movement rests on trust, it is not too much to allow each board of directors to set their own maximum loan limits.  The league has proposed that this figure should be £30,000 or 5 per cent of assets.  Whatever the limits they should be flexible.  Where members have a good track record of savings or where a number of people wish to invest and set up a co-operative, the board should have flexibility to decide on the level of the loan.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given assurances regarding the property rights which will be attached to credit unions.  The movement is concerned that these provisions should not be too restrictive but have a regulating provision whereby the registrar may intervene in cases where abuse is suspected or property is not being used appropriately.  There is no difference between the Minister and the movement on this issue but further clarification can ensure a meeting of minds.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the power of credit unions to offer additional services.  Where a service offered is a principal service there should be a process of regulation through the registrar. However, where a credit union has the initiative to offer a service on an agency basis it should not be restricted from doing so.  Providing a greater range of services on an agency basis has been the hallmark of the development of credit unions over the past number of years.  It would be unfortunate if such initiative was stifled by undue delay in acquiring permission from the registrar.  Offering these services on an agency basis involves no risk to the members.  The risk attaches to the principal which is a foreign exchange or insurance provider and the provisions regarding additional services should be loosened to allow credit unions to continue to expand.</P>
    <P>The restrictions on remuneration in section 68 are advisable but I draw the Minister's attention to a practical consideration.  There is a provision in section 68(1)(c) for the restriction on remuneration to be extended to credit control officers.  In many larger credit unions, members have agreed at their annual general meetings to allow a salaried member of the credit union staff to act in this <Col N="692" /> capacity for practical reasons.  That should not be impeded by this legislation.</P>
    <P>Many concerns have been expressed about the powers of the registrar.  I understand the Minister's and the Department's approach.  After the Tony Taylor affair, people wanted to know why there was not more regulation, so it is understandable that caution would be the order of the day in this regard.  However, the Irish League of Credit Unions could be allowed to effectively continue its role in this regard by the making of some minor changes to the legislation.  The suggestion that the powers of the registrar should be consolidated by a redrafting of the provisions which would be comprehensively laid down in Part VI of the Bill has much to commend itself.</P>
    <P>Some members of credit union boards to whom I have spoken have said there is a penalty in every section.  They are not saying that penalties should not be imposed or that the registrar should not have power, but that the spirit of initiative and enthusiasm which is the hallmark of the credit union movement may be stifled by continuous repetition of powers and regulations.  An accommodation of people's concerns has been achieved before through imaginative drafting of legislation and it could be done for this area.  Similarly, in respect of penalties, some board members are afraid that, if they make a wrong decision, they may end up in court.  That is not going to happen. However, to allay their fears, the subject of penalties could be redrafted and consolidated in Part XI.</P>
    <P>These suggestions are made in a positive fashion and arise from discussions I had with members of credit unions, especially in my constituency, and I expect the Minister to respond to them.  I am happy to support this Bill which is a landmark for the credit union movement.  I am confident that, following its passage, it will not only serve the needs of the credit union movement in the late 1990s but will also provide the type of flexible arrangement to allow for its continued development well into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille agus ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeachas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit.  Bhíomar go léir ag súil leis an mBille seo le fada an lá agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil sé sa Teach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and welcome the Bill.  I am a great supporter of the credit union movement and, having seen its work at first hand, I also support its efforts to develop, to help people and to establish the spirit of self-help in small towns and villages in rural Ireland.  The delay in introducing this Bill has been very frustrating for the movement.  I have met many delegations in my years in politics, but the lobbying by the credit union movement on this was most effective in that it had meetings in every constituency to impress upon elected representatives the urgency of introducing this legislation, so I am glad we are discussing it this evening.  It is a very <Col N="693" /> large Bill of almost 200 sections which is the reason for the delay in its introduction.</P>
    <P>There is concern about the cap of £20,000 on loans.  It has been pointed out to me by the Irish League of Credit Unions that it wishes to have 5 per cent of assets available for loans and even 10 per cent could be made available for that purpose. It is important that this cap be lifted.  Why have a cap?  It must not be forgotten that loans can be had from credit unions for extensions to houses, and for new houses in some instances. When a son or daughter obtains a site for a house from their parents or relations, they often get bridging finance from credit unions and with the help of a local authority loan they sometimes look for a second loan.  This is where I see the real difficulty with the cap of £20,000.  For example, under this legislation, a person who reduces their loan to £19,000 would only be allowed to borrow a further £1,000.  This must be addressed and I hope the Minister of State will find some way of dealing with it.  The same is true of the limit of £20,000 on shares and deposits.</P>
    <P>There may be confusion about the cap because I noticed in an interview the Minister of State gave to the <i>Credit Union Review,</i> a question was asked as to whether one could borrow £20,000 or £40,000.  The point made by the interviewer was that the Bill referred to a £20,000 cap on indebtedness which suggested that, if one had shares of £20,000, one could borrow £40,000 as the net indebtedness would only be £20,000.  The Minister replied that the optimum loan was £20,000 but went on to say that he had committed himself to the Irish League of Credit Unions continuing its involvement and participation in the Bill until it was enacted by this House.  Perhaps the Minister can give more information on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to ask what average working member of a credit union needed to borrow more than £20,000 or had more than that amount to deposit.  The answer has been given by many Deputies.  Deputy Molloy referred to the issue of redundancy.  There is also the matter of people who are afraid to deposit their money with any financial institution.  That should be dealt with by the Government, especially by the Minister for Social Welfare to whom we have put certain proposals relating to the rate of interest assessed by his Department.  That is another issue which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The best example I could give of a credit union and its associated concept of self-help is a comparison with a group water scheme where people come together and work voluntarily to provide a service.  Credit unions are not centralised organisations with a network of branches like a bank or building society.  Many of them are small, local organisations.  One of their great assets is that they can be a source of funding for small business projects and agricultural development.  I live in County Galway where we are honoured to have a Western Development Commission since 1 January this year.  The Minister of State with responsibility for western development, Deputy <Col N="694" /> Carey, has said there will be funding in this year's Estimates for the commission.  There could possibly be £25 million from the Government over seven years.  Indeed, the Minister of State has gone so far as to say that with European and private funding it could be £100 million or £200 million over seven years.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have a major role to play in helping small business projects with the type of funding available from the Western Development Commission.  The maximum loan of £20,000 will also limit the role of credit unions as well as business and agricultural development in the western region.  Every credit union should have a special deposit fund which could be used exclusively for local commercial development.  They are in a better position than other financial institutions to help with that.</P>
    <P>Another source of worry for the credit union movement has been the proposal that they must sell off any property they are not using entirely for themselves.  The Minister of State addressed this issue in his opening statement but he knows there are buildings which provide office accommodation for other agencies and services that are also of value to the community.  It is part of the ethos of credit unions to provide these services for other agencies.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the money advice and budgeting service which are part of the credit union ethos.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, was in Tuam recently to launch the money advice budgeting service, or MABS as it is also known.  The Minister, and local credit union leaders, stressed that the areas of money advice and budgeting and credit unions go hand in hand.  People have got into serious difficulties through borrowing money at high interest rates both from money lenders and financial institutions.  Money was given out too freely in the past.  The money advice and budgeting service is of great benefit.  I hope that this type of budgetary advice will be provided in every credit union area, and what better place to provide it than in a building owned by the credit union?  I hope that important issue will be addressed.  Such property should be available to credit unions, not for speculation or a quick buck but for people to obtain budgetary advice and secure some measure of financial independence.  People in credit unions always say that one of their aims is financial independence through regular savings. In this way credit union members can have fair and affordable access to loans.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed at the possible effects of over-regulation given the Bill's provision for a regulator.  Credit unions are not opposed to prudential regulation but they are not happy that the heavy hand of a regulator could interfere too much with the proceedings of each credit union because they are so different.  Varying systems exist in Northern Ireland and the Republic because different legislation was involved in setting up the credit union movement in both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> Each credit union should be given the opportunity to regulate itself.  I am familiar with credit unions in County Galway that practise self-regulation to an effective degree, and none of their members has lost a penny in 35 years of operation. I do not know if the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, fully understands that.  In his interview with the <i>Credit Union Review,</i> he said: &ldquo;I think it is entirely appropriate and should be only a cause of reassurance that the regulatory system is effective and vigorous&rdquo;.  That is all very well but the Minister of State should also stress that the heavy hand of the regulator will not cause difficulties for or interference with credit unions.</P>
    <P>Credit unions put a great deal back into the community.  I recently attended a meeting of the community games whose organisers gave much credit and praise to the credit unions.  It was unbelievable.  The credit union movement sponsored the games and provided awards for community leaders involved in preparing teams in every parish.  It was a big undertaking and an ideal type of involvement for credit unions which are part of the community as well as being part of the community games network.  Every year credit unions are involved in sponsoring St. Patrick's Day parades.  That is evident in the town of Tuam and I wonder how many towns would not have a parade were it not for the credit union movement's involvement.</P>
    <P>The credit unions, which were introduced in 1958, have been a great success.  There are 531 credit unions at the moment with 1.9 million members.  Savings of almost £2.3 billion have been made, while loans have totalled approximately £1.5 billion. Most significant is the fact that 10,000 volunteers work in credit unions along with 1,500 part-time and full-time workers.  That shows the great respect there is in the community for the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will make the necessary amendments to the Bill to allow the movement to develop.  Credit unions are owned and run by their members whom they exist to serve.  That is a great aim and ideal for the movement to have and it is worthy of support.  I have always been a supporter of the credit union movement and I hope it will prosper in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Legislation to deal with the credit union movement and the enormous growth in that organisation is urgently required.  It has been sought for a long time by all those involved in the management of credit unions.  I congratulate the Minister of State on succeeding in introducing the legislation in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the Credit Union Bill we must focus on the fact that credit unions are unique and separate financial institutions.  We are not speaking on a Bill dealing with the banking industry, building societies or other such financial institutions. <Col N="696" /> We are speaking about the credit union movement which is a voluntary co-operative organisation consisting of local community members helping and assisting each other.  This legislation must enhance and improve the voluntary and community aspect of the credit union movement.</P>

      <P>The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, was accepted by the Minister in a welter of embarrassment.  She could not refuse the Opposition's request that people charged with paedophile offences committed abroad should be tried here.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (No. 2) Bill, 1995, is, perhaps, the greatest example of the Minister's adeptness at plagiarisation.  She went to the Seanad with her Bill so that the reportage of evidence in incest cases could again take place following the judgment of Mr. Justice Carney.  Her Bill failed abysmally to do so and all it provided for was that health board officials could go back to court to hear the evidence.  Unashamedly, she lifted all the essential provisions of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (No.2) Bill, 1995, incorporated into her Bill and said to all and sundry that it was her own.</P>
      <P>When we produced the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996, the Minister soon after, having lifted a poorly watered down version of Part I of the Bill, presented to the House the Drug Trafficking Bill, 1996.

      <P>Bereft of an ideology, a philosophy or a policy of her own, the Minister stated when the Bill was introduced that it would effectively freeze the suspected assets of criminals and that it was law before.  She wrote back in a week to say it was not law before and that it was unconstitutional. An article appeared in a Sunday newspaper to the effect that the Attorney General had advised that the Bill was unconstitutional.  When we sought the advice we were told the advice of the Attorney General is never given to the Opposition.</P>

      <P>In recent months we have heard much talk from Government backbench Deputies on the need for positive measures to be taken to tackle the ongoing crime crisis.  I have watched these Deputies walk through the Níl lobby on occasions when Fianna Fáil put forward constructive anti-crime proposals.  To put it straight, they talk tough but vote soft.  They are lions in their constituencies but lambs in the lobbies. They are in favour of reform but not specific reform.  They claim to want to do something but vote down any specific proposal.  Nowhere has this trend been more evident than in relation to the issue of drugs.  Labour backbench Deputies, for example, clamour on the airwaves for a crackdown on drug distribution.  When a microphone is put in front of them, they talk tough but when a Bill is put in from of them, they vote soft.  They are the guardians of the status quo &mdash; they say change is needed but refuse to specify what change.</P>
      <P>On three occasions in the past 12 months, Fianna Fáil has sought to amend the criminal law to provide for a minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment for persons found in possession of controlled drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more.  This measure was specifically focused on those who deal in substantial quantities of controlled drugs.  It was a measure designed to reflect society's abhorrence of the actions of substantial drug dealers.  It was directed not at addicts or addicts who deal in a small way to feed their addictions, but at substantial importers and drug barons.  On each occasion Fianna Fáil sought to provide a minimum sentence for substantial drug dealers, the perfumed poodles on the Labour backbenches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason substantial drug dealers do not receive a minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment is that Labour Deputies who talk tough with their constituents voted soft when the issue was put to them.  They voted soft not once or twice but three times.  Their reticence to support much needed criminal reform is a measure of the inability of this Government to implement hard-hitting measures against drug pushers.  They voted down the Fianna Fáil proposal and put nothing in its place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> I look forward during the debate to hearing the explanation Deputy Shortall will give to the people of Finglas for voting soft on legislation designed to curb the supply of drugs, which Deputy Upton will offer to the people of Crumlin for his failure to support the minimum ten year sentence for substantial drug dealers and which the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, who has been in the vanguard of the liberal kid-gloves approach to dealing with substantial drugs dealers, will offer the people of Dún Laoghaire in defence of her vote soft policy.  We should be clear.  Either we are or we are not serious about the war against drugs.  We are either determined to introduce legislation to smash drug dealers or we are not.  The record of Fianna Fáil on this issue leaves no doubt that the party is determined to take every step necessary to smash the vice like grip of the drug lords over our cities and towns.</P>

      <P>In June 1996 Fianna Fáil introduced a Private Members' Bill, which is now the Proceeds of Crime Act.  It did so in the face of derision and opposition from the Minister for Justice who, within five days of its publication, described it as unnecessary and unconstitutional, but then as acceptable in principle.  Who or what changed the Minister's mind?  It was blushes in the rainbow coalition because some Government backbenchers knew, if they did not accept the Bill, that they would soon be collecting their last boxes of Oireachtas envelopes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of that Act today represents the single greatest threat to the illicit assets of drug traffickers and dealers.  It was introduced by Fianna Fáil in the teeth of Government opposition which crumbled when it became clear the Taoiseach, whose preferred response to the crime crisis was the offer of a debate, had seriously misread the public's mood and there was a need for urgent legislation from whichever quarter it came.  That will not surprise anybody now in the light of his recent announcement that Fine Gael does not have a policy on any issue, national or local.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1996 Fianna Fáil introduced the Drug Trafficking Bill, which was accepted in principle by the Government and used as the prototype by the Minister when she belatedly introduced her own Bill on the same topic.  We repeatedly sought to introduce legislation to provide for a ten year minimum sentence for substantial drug dealers but this was rejected by the cumulative might of what I describe as the fast fading rainbow.  It is time that parties and <Col N="700" /> Deputies spelled out where they stand on this issue and moved from saying they are in favour of tough measures to stating precisely what tough measures they favour.  I ask for the umpteenth time if the Minister has a policy on crime.  If so, can anybody, including the Minister, state it or must we rely on the person who stands solemnly but solidly and loyally over the photocopier to tell us?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes our citizens have a right to walk their streets, conduct their businesses and live their lives without the fear or threat of violence. We believe this is a constitutional right.  In so far as the courts have recognised the hierarchy of constitutional rights, we believe the right to live without fear of attack is a superior constitutional right.  It is superior to the right to liberty of persons conducting such attacks and the right of persons attempting such attacks.  It is superior to the right to liberty of persons who have armed themselves in contemplation of making such attacks.  Although most reasonable people accept these are superior obligations, they are not met with a superior response in terms of resources from the rainbow coalition Government.  Crime appears to have a relatively low priority.</P>
    <P>Our citizens are entitled to look to the Oireachtas and ask what it has done to protect them from such attacks.  How have we sought to vindicate their right to bodily integrity, to own private property and to travel freely and without fear?  The answer is that nothing has been done other than the plagiarisation of Opposition Bills. The introduction of this Bill is a partial answer to the questions people are rightly posing.  It is an acknowledgement that existing legislation has proved inadequate in acting as a deterrent against the commission of a specific category of crime, robbery.</P>
    <P>This position has not arisen as a result of any indifference or lethargy on the part of the House. Twice in the past 20 years the Oireachtas has considered the crime of robbery.  In 1976 the old offence of robbery, which was contained in section 23 of the Larceny Act, 1916, was replaced by a new modern statutory offence contained in section 5 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, which inserted a new section 23 in the 1916 Act. This new offence was heavily modelled on section 8 of the Theft Act, 1968.  It provided, as did its English counterpart, for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  However, it failed as a deterrent. In particular, it failed to have any noticeable effect on the growing number of offences of robbery which were committed by persons using or wielding offensive weapons.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the Oireachtas again turned its attention to this problem and enacted the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act. Section 9(1) of that Act makes it an offence for a person to have in his possession in any public place any knife or other article which has a blade or is sharply pointed.  Similarly, section 9(5) states that where a person has with him in any public place any article intended by him unlawfully to cause injury <Col N="701" /> to, incapacitate or intimidate any person, either in a particular eventuality or otherwise, he shall be guilty of an offence.  The 1993 Act provided for a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months for an offence under subsection (1) and a sentence not exceeding five years imprisonment for an offence under subsection (5).  Unfortunately, this Act also failed to act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>The number of robberies committed by persons wielding offensive weapons, particularly syringes, has increased dramatically.  The terror of infection, injury and death is now palpable.  It is not acceptable for us to wash our hands and say there is nothing further we can do no more than it is acceptable for the Oireachtas to say it is powerless to deal with this category of crime. There are measures which can and, given the current circumstances, must be taken.  The Bill is a measured response to the persistent wave of syringe robberies affecting the country.  It creates an offence of aggravated robbery and, in so doing, it merely follows the Larceny Act, 1916, as amended.</P>
    <P>Section 23(a) of that Act, which was inserted by section 6 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, created the modern offence of burglary. Section 23(b) of the same Act, which was inserted by section 7 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, created the offence of aggravated burglary.  This Bill seeks to do no more in respect of the offence of robbery than the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, did in respect of the offence of burglary.  It recognises that the offence of robbery can have an aggravated form and it specifies the aggravated form at which the Bill is directed as the same as that identified by the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, the carrying of a weapon of offence.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is intended to deal with the carrying of syringes in the course of robberies, &ldquo;offensive weapon&rdquo; has been defined in a particularly narrow fashion.  An offensive weapon, under section 3(3) of the Bill, is defined as being any syringe or needle, made or adapted for use and intended by the person in possession of it, to intimidate or cause injury or to incapacitate any person.  It is a focused Bill, directed at a particular problem.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to convince any Member of the House that robberies involving syringes now constitute a plague in the community.  It is also unnecessary to convince Members that persons who contemplate perpetrating robberies involving syringes need to be deterred.  However, a measure which will demonstrate our resolve and determination to deal with this problem and act as a deterrent is necessary.  The provisions in the Bill meet both those goals.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a minimum term of imprisonment of five years' for any person who commits the offence of aggravated robbery.  The charge may be preferred only on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Thus, a decision to prefer a charge of aggravated robbery will be taken after an examination of the assembled evidence.  It will not be the case that <Col N="702" /> a person can be arrested for the new offence of aggravated robbery.  A person suspected of committing such an offence can be arrested in respect of the existing offence of robbery and the charge of aggravated robbery may subsequently be brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a minimum sentence of five years imprisonment in respect of a first offence, seven in respect of a second offence and life imprisonment in respect of a third or subsequent offence.  The people are entitled to voice their abhorrence of this form of crime by enacting a minimum sentence.  It is a concept which exists in respect of other offences known to criminal law.  The offence of murder has a mandatory minimum penalty of life imprisonment.  The offence of murder, to which section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990 applies, has a minimum penalty of 40 years' imprisonment set by statute.  The offence of attempting to commit an offence to which section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990 applies has a minimum sentence set by statute of 20 years imprisonment.  Offences under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876 have mandatory minimum penalties of a multiple of the value of the goods unlawfully imported.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of offences have maximum sentences set by the Oireachtas.  There is no reason to believe that, by imposing a maximum sentence in respect of those offences, the Oireachtas has in any way transgressed the separation of powers postulated by the Constitution.  It is clear that there is no constitutional prohibition to minimum sentences being set in accordance with law but what is less clear is whether there is sufficient political will in the House to enact the legislation which we are entitled, as of right, to enact.  It is clear that there is no academic or legislative reason syringe robberies should not be punished by a minimum sentence.  Is there the political will to enact such legislation?</P>
    <P>It is interesting that while there is reference in the rushed press release from the Minister for Justice this evening to the offence outlined, it does not appear to suggest that there will be minimum or mandatory sentencing.  If the Minister proceeds in that manner, she will fail in the objective we have set for her in this legislation.</P>
    <P>If we are not to enact legislation to provide for minimum sentencing in the case of syringe attacks, what must occur before we will do so? Do we have to await the death of some unfortunate person going about their everyday business? Do we have to wait until people who have suffered by this outrageous method of assault contract a serious illness or is the present position acceptable in the eyes of the Government?  If it is the belief of the Government that the present level of syringe robberies represents an unacceptable level of crime and violence, it should clearly say so and let the people know where it stands.  Will we have minimum or mandatory sentencing in respect of syringe attacks?</P>
    <P>The offence created by section 3 of the Bill is <Col N="703" /> similar in nature and in wording to the new offence of possession of prohibited implements provided for in section 28 of the Larceny Act, 1916 by virtue of the Larceny Act, 1990.  It deals with the possession of syringes by persons when not at the place of their abode.  It would not impose a blanket prohibition.  It would make it an offence to possess a syringe in such circumstances without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  In so doing it follows precisely on the wording of section 28 of the Larceny Act, 1990.  A person suspected of committing an offence under section 3 may be arrested in respect of the offence created by section 9(1) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 and would, if charged, be liable to a period of two years imprisonment rather than the 12 months specified in that Act.</P>
    <P>The offence created by section 4 is similar in wording to the offence created by section 27 (a) of the Firearms Act, 1964, as amended and extended.  It is an offence commonly used in respect of persons unlawfully found in possession of firearms.  The inference referred to in the wording of the section may be drawn from the surrounding circumstances.  A person suspected of committing this offence may also be arrested in respect of an offence under section 9 (1) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990.  It is an intermediate offence between that created by section 9 (1) of the 1990 Act and section 9 (5) of the same Act.  Its intended purpose is to deter people from carrying a syringe for a criminal purpose.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has no objection to introducing legislation of this nature.  When the Minister took office we promised that where legislation was needed and she introduced it we would support it.  We also promised that where legislation was necessary and she did not introduce it we would introduce it.  This is a promise we have kept.  The great preponderance of criminal justice legislation enacted by the House during the past two years first saw the light of day as a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge and pay tribute to the Minister's willingness to follow the lead we have set.  This legislation would benefit society.  It should not be voted down on the basis simply that the idea emanated from Fianna Fáil.  It should not be voted down for political reasons or because the Cabinet panicked and rushed the Minister for Justice into bringing forward a non-fatal offences against the person Bill which she says will be published tomorrow.</P>

For that reason I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue for taking the trouble to bring forward this important legislation.</P>
      <P>Irish society should no longer tolerate attacks on innocent law abiding citizens by syringe wielding thugs.  Citizens, who are innocent victims, are fearful of infection from syringes used in attacks. This measure provides for an offence of aggravated robbery, attempted robbery and the possession of a syringe with intent to cause injury or death and for severe sentences.</P>
      <P>Recently a girl was attacked at a banklink machine by a person wielding a syringe with red fluid.  That is the way money is demanded today and one does not know if the fluid in those syringes is infectious.  Prison officers, members of the Garda Síochána and hospital staff are confronted in that manner, one of the most frequent attacks experienced by doctors in their surgeries.  A survey of general practitioners revealed confrontations, which involve the threat and menace of the use of lethal weapons, are the most frequent cause of concern.</P>
      <P>We must crack down on this new form of crime as a matter of urgency.  The use of syringes in attacks is hideous and it is difficult to believe offenders use infected blood in that way.  That crime which is so demeaning to the offender and threatening and menacing to the victim is undermining our civilisation.  It indicates the extraordinary depth to which we have descended in crime and lawlessness in our cities and it must be tackled as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Donoghue's work on this Bill is valuable and necessary, the Government should accept it and, if necessary, table amendments on Committee Stage.  I plead with it not to prevaricate on this issue and delay the introduction of this new offence.  These attacks are widespread.  All Members have a duty to take action and support the measure put forward by Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to ensure immediate action is taken to deal with crime, lawlessness and vandalism. At meetings in my constituency people express fear and tell me how they live in danger of being attacked by people abusing drugs.  Notwithstanding this legislation and the valuable work being done by both sides of the House, especially during the past year, that is the reality. People are still afraid to walk the streets at night. The fear of crime is widespread and people, particularly the elderly, are afraid in their homes at night, and that is a realistic fear.  In the past it was often said that such fear was more in the mind as there was only an occasional outbreak of crime, but it is widespread now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> We must deal in the first instance with the problem of drug abuse and work to tackle that problem is well directed.  Officials in the health boards, members of the Garda Síochána, teachers and local communities have formed project teams to tackle the problem of drug abuse.  That work is helping to reduce the level of crime.  However, while acknowledging those good developments, people are still afraid to walk the streets.  Women and older people, in particular, are afraid to go out at night unless they are accompanied by a number of friends.  We must tackle the problem of crime to ensure people will no longer live in fear.</P>
    <P>People want to see more gardaí on the streets. As a member of a select committee of the House, I and other parliamentarians from the European Union attended a meeting in London last week to discuss pensions and I was struck by the presence of the police on the street in that city.  The police are more visible on the streets in other countries than they are here.  We must work to reduce the level of crime here to ensure that people feel safe to walk the streets during the day or at night.  Attacks are no longer confined to the late hours of night when few people walk the streets.</P>
    <P>The level of crime is a problem and crimes of violence are increasing.  There may have been a slight decrease in the number of crimes committed but more than 100,000 crimes are committed each year.  We all want to see that figure reduced. Crimes of burglary, aggravated robbery, violence and assault are increasing.  Attacks with the use of syringes are one form of assault and aggravated robbery which is increasing and they must be tackled.  Rather than dealing with this problem at some date in the future having considered the possibilities, we must take action now.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue in introducing this valuable measure has given us the opportunity to air this issue and exert pressure to introduce the type change we want, a new offence not currently provided for.  It is extraordinary that so many of these crimes have been committed in recent times and there is no law relating to this offence on the Statute Book.  I appeal to the Minister to join Deputy O'Donoghue in voting support for this Bill tomorrow night, not to delay its introduction and to welcome contributions, like this, from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether the Government intends to put forward its proposals on this matter, both sides of the House must support plans to tackle crime immediately.  This legislation sets out measures to tackle aggravated robbery &mdash; a new crime involving the use of syringes.  One never knows if the fluid in them is infectious.  One can imagine the fear one would experience if attacked by a person using a syringe.  A needle was held to the stomach of the girl who was recently attacked at a cash dispenser and she was forced to hand over the money she had withdrawn from the machine.  We can all imagine how we would feel if our skin was pierced by a syringe <Col N="707" /> and the fluid in it was injected into our systems. It could take years before we would know the outcome of such an attack.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Members to support Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill to put on the Statute Book an offence to tackle the scourge of crime involving the use of syringes.</P>

      <P>While commending Deputy O'Donoghue on having produced this Bill, I must express concern that he is becoming ever more confused.  On the one hand, he produces Bills which he urges the Government to take on board, yet if and when the Government takes on his mostly very flawed Bills, amends them and implements their provisions, he is critical of it for doing so.  As Deputy O'Donoghue becomes ever more embedded in Opposition, he does not know where to turn to find a big stick with which to beat me and, presumably, my successor who will undoubtedly come from this side of the House.  I hope Deputy O'Donoghue will take a little rest now and again and not overly exert himself.</P>
      <P>Equally, I do not want to be offensive to anybody outside this House.  I know that Deputy O'Donoghue receives assistance &mdash; as anybody would in Opposition &mdash; from barristers or solicitors in preparing some of his Bills.  The Deputy claims he has produced a prolific range of Bills. While his party, in Opposition, is very good at producing these types of Bills, it did not during its occupancy of the Department of Justice have such legislation implemented.  It is fair to say Fianna Fáil awaited the comfortable position of being in Opposition before introducing such Bills in the full knowledge that it did not matter whether their content was good, bad or indifferent because it would never have to implement them.</P>
      <P>All of Deputy O'Donoghue's published Bills, in the aggregate, would hardly comprise one complete, decent one.  I do not say that in any offensive way.  Even those Bills of his whose titles I accepted required total amendment because preparatory work had been inadequate, to say the least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously Deputy O'Donoghue is as concerned as all of us at the increasing incidence of criminal attacks by people using syringes. I have already given a commitment to bring forward new proposals to amend and significantly strengthen the law to ensure there is no weakness <Col N="708" /> in the legislative framework for dealing with such attacks.  Every time I announce the heads of a Bill there is an immediate rush by Opposition parties to take up their quills and hastily produce Private Members' Bills that can be published in advance of my more carefully drafted ones.  There is sufficient evidence to illustrate that point.</P>
      <P>In advance of becoming a member of the Cabinet approximately two years ago, I too would probably have manifested some ignorance at the manner in which Bills are produced.  If Deputy O'Donoghue thinks that I or any other Minister for Justice can take a Private Members' Bill, bad and all as is this one, photocopy it, take it to Government, have it approved and its provisions implemented, frankly he is talking through his Kerry hat.  When Deputy O'Donoghue's time comes for possession of a ministerial portfolio, if ever, he will begin to understand that procedure.</P>
      <P>Dealing with criminal assets is not a race or a political game.  Were I to treat this process as such we would end up with sloppy, ineffective legislation. Crime is too serious a problem with which to play political games.  The problem of syringe attacks is very serious.  The electorate expects us to examine our crime problems seriously and conscientiously and to introduce comprehensive, well thought out legislation, which is precisely what I am doing.</P>
      <P>During my contribution I will point out the shortcomings of Deputy O'Donoghue's short but hastily produced Bill.  I do not do so to be little his efforts but rather to emphasise that one must take time and get criminal legislation right.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Opposition parties have been inspired to produce Bills because of my record in this respect.  Since taking up office as Minister for Justice I have introduced no fewer than 13 Bills, most of which have been passed.  Others are in the course of passage through these Houses. Many of these Bills are very substantive.  Among these are the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 which allows for seven-day detention and questioning of drug traffickers and restricts the right to silence in such cases; the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 which introduced important changes to improve the overall functioning of our courts, including the appointing of additional judges to the Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit and District Courts; and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill expected to be enacted soon which is intended to achieve savings in costs and Garda time through changes in procedure in criminal cases.  The Criminal Law Bill, now before the Seanad, will simplify procedures of arrest and eliminate outdated concepts of misdemeanours and felonies.  In addition I signed the commencement order for the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 inherited by me without such commencement order, thus implementing its anti money laundering provisions in addition to bringing in regulations under that Act to deal with the seizure of imports and exports of cash associated with drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> I agreed to accept and substantially amend a number of Private Members' Bills and contributed fully to the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, and the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, introduced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am at present working on a full range of legislative reform proposals, in particular that required to enable the new courts service to be established.  This is being dealt with as a matter of priority and will be published as soon as possible. The Government has brought the heads of a Bill to establish the courts service &mdash; sketched in the third report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission &mdash; to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security for examination and discussion.</P>
    <P>In addition, legislation is being prepared on bail following the successful outcome of the November referendum.  Among Bills I hope to introduce in coming months is a Licensing (Drugs) Bill to deal with drug abuse in dance halls, public houses and unlicensed outdoor premises, one Deputy O'Donoghue overlooked.  There is also a Bill to enable Ireland to ratify the Europol Convention and a Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned only some of my legislative achievements since taking office.  Lest there remain any doubt as to my capacity to produce legislation I might point to an interesting statistic given recently in response to a parliamentary question &mdash; I and my Department produced eight Bills in 1996 alone whereas the comparative figure for 1993 was four.  I ask Deputy O'Donoghue to look back on the performance of my predecessors, all Fianna Fáil, and be careful that, in criticising me, he is not unwittingly criticising his former colleagues, such as Commissioner Flynn, Deputies Gerry Collins and Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, the last of whom has now embarked on a new career.</P>
    <P>Today the Government approved for publication tomorrow the text of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, 1997 which provides for a range of new offences to deal with criminal conduct involving syringes and, most importantly, for a range of penalties to reflect the seriousness of these offences.  Deputies will be afforded an opportunity to fully examine and debate its provisions.  Later I will furnish the House with some information on these proposals. Members will appreciate I could not possibly accept the well-intentioned but clearly inadequate provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>If good intentions constituted the only criteria for effective legislation I would not hesitate to accept this Bill.  I have no doubt that Deputy O'Donoghue and all other Members of this House are unanimous in their total abhorrence of this type of crime.  We share a sense of sadness at seeing our society invaded by this mindless viciousness and are all equally determined to ensure that our law is given the requisite teeth to tackle it.  However, I must part company with Deputy O'Donoghue in terms of the extent and <Col N="710" /> sharpness of the requisite teeth.  This is not a problem which lends itself to a quick &ldquo;fill the gap&rdquo; solution; that just will not do.  Increasingly our citizens are being threatened, in fear of their lives, by drug-crazed or other opportunist criminals.</P>
    <P>While the gardaí endeavour to protect the community, increasingly they find themselves threatened in the most mindless and vindictive way.  I can tell this House that the gardaí are well aware that the favourite pastime of the criminal is to leave a syringe positioned, perhaps in a squad car, in such a way that some unsuspecting garda may have his or her life threatened as he or she performs the most basic of tasks.  Similarly, prison officers know only too well the insidious threat that an easily concealed syringe can cause while they are going about their duties and particularly in their efforts to treat prisoners with the humanity and respect human beings deserve.</P>
    <P>The basic flaw in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill is that it fails to understand the nature and extent of the problem.  His 'cops and robbers' approach is too one-dimensional for this problem because it assumes that robbery is always the only motive. In this type of attack, robbery may or may not be the motive.  There may be no motive other than hopelessness, hate, aggression, revenge or, dare I say it in a world where such a concept is rarely admitted, evil.  We need a clearly thought out and comprehensive approach if we are to ensure that the law protects the innocent from the dangerous people who resort to these activities.  What is required is the most careful and thorough examination of the problem.  That is not manifest in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the Bill does or, more appropriately, does not do.  What it does not even attempt to do is tackle the range of criminal conduct in which use of a syringe may arise.  The Deputy instead limits himself in the main to robbery related offences.  Three offences are created, the offence of aggravated robbery or the threat of such robbery, possession of a syringe and possession of a syringe with intent to commit aggravated robbery.</P>
    <P>The first of these offences is contained in section 3.  Subsections (1) and (2) create the offence of aggravated robbery.  The structure of this provision would create interesting possibilities for defence lawyers because the element of intent is not a constituent of the offence but rather part of the definition of offensive weapon. However, leaving aside such legal oddities and the litigation problems they would present, the basic problem with this section is that it is far too limited and applies only where robbery is a motive.  Robbery is often present in offences of this kind but as I already indicated, this phenomenon of attacks often goes far beyond simple robbery. The criminal who uses a syringe to evade arrest by a member of the Garda Síochána or to engineer an escape from a prison officer need not fear Deputy O'Donoghue's new offences.  Safe <Col N="711" /> also are those who abandon or place syringes where they are likely to injure or present a threat.</P>
    <P>It is much to the Deputy's credit that he does not have a criminal mind; if he had he would have been more creative and understood how criminals exploit all the possibilities which the fear evoked by a syringe can present.  A more street-wise look at this problem would show that one does not even have to have a syringe to evoke these fears, a blood filled container would do. Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill does nothing to criminalise behaviour where the fear of contaminated blood is exploited.</P>
    <P>Similarly and amazingly, the Deputy does not seek to establish an offence of actually wounding a person with a syringe or putting blood onto them.  I am rather surprised the Deputy would not see that those who threaten people with a syringe would also not be shy about using it.  I consider the absence of an offence of wounding a serious omission from this Bill but a still more serious omission exists.  Unfortunately those who use syringes or blood to threaten others may be armed with a most deadly weapon.  If the syringe is contaminated and it is used to wound a person or if contaminated blood is used in an attack and is put on the person of the victim, then the behaviour is tantamount to attempted murder and I consider that no legislation aimed at dealing with this problem can be complete unless it recognises this reality and seeks to ensure that the law is clear on how serious a crime this is and that this behaviour is punishable by the maximum criminal sanction, life imprisonment.  However, Deputy O'Donoghue' Bill is devoid of any provision of this nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking again at what Deputy O'Donoghue provides in section 3, I am somewhat surprised at his approach to penalties. Clearly he does not trust the Judiciary to weigh up the circumstances of each case and ensure the punishment fits the crime.  The Deputy provides for a minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment. Does he intend that a judge would have no discretion when a person is guilty of aggravated robbery no matter what the circumstances of the individual case but to impose a five year sentence? Would he not accept that a judge could impose a lesser sentence where, for example, the offender has undertaken a drug treatment programme where there are clear signs of rehabilitation or the potential thereof?  It is because no two cases are ever identical that the law, with the exception of murder, has always provided for maximum rather than minimum penalties.</P>

      <P>More intriguing still is Deputy O'Donoghue's provision that punishment should be &ldquo;not greater&rdquo; than life imprisonment.  This is puzzling.  Is the Deputy not aware that we no longer have the death penalty on our Statute Book, or should we read this to mean that he intends to bring it back?  This is a clear indication of the haste and lack of care with which the Bill was thrown together.</P>
      <P>As I have said already, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, 1997 which, along with dealing with the general law of assault, serious assault, etc., contains my comprehensive proposals to deal with criminal conduct involving syringes, has been approved by Government and is in the printers as I speak.  While, unfortunately, Deputies do not yet have the text of my Bill I would like to give the House an idea of what it contains.  However, I will first clear up a misconception which might exist.  I suspect it is in Deputy O'Donoghue's best interests to brief people behind the scenes that this is the first time a law has been introduced to deal with syringes. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's legislation will be more specific.  A law currently exists to criminalise the use of syringes in attacks against people.  Existing law provides a number of possibilities to bring charges against persons who engage in this type of behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not to say I am satisfied that existing law is adequate and I am changing it for that reason.  Because of the increasing incidence of this type of crime I carried out a review of existing law by reference to the types of incidents which were increasingly happening in our society. The figures were misquoted in a recent <i>Evening Herald</i> article so, because Deputy Woods raised the matter and in the interest of clarity, I will put them on the record of the House.  In 1995 there were 497 syringe attacks and 17 attacks with needles.  In 1996 that rose to 1,228 syringe attacks and 24 attacks with needles.  The problem is growing and the Government's legislation is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to cater for the range of criminal conduct which we are now experiencing I have provided three sections in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill to deal with syringe and related attacks.  I have covered all the issues Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill fails to cover, such as injuring another by piercing the skin of that other with a syringe or threatening to do so with the intention of causing the other person to believe that he or she may become infected with disease, and spraying or pouring or putting onto another person blood or any fluid or substance resembling blood or threatening to do so with the intention <Col N="713" /> of causing the other person to believe that he or she may become infected with disease.</P>
    <P>One has to bear in mind that a person who suffers such an attack, which we all abhor, may be put through extreme mental torture, particularly if that person is wounded with a syringe and must spend a period of anguish while waiting to find out if he or she has been contaminated with a life threatening disease.  I propose to make that offence punishable by a maximum of ten years' imprisonment. Both of these offences, of piercing and pouring blood on somebody, are tantamount to attempted murder and this crime will be punishable by life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the issue of somebody carrying blood in a container or possessing a syringe. I have ensured the Garda will have the necessary powers to stop, question and search any person suspected of carrying a syringe.  I have also given the Garda power to seize any syringe.  These sections were missing from Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill.  I will provide the Garda with important powers of arrest without warrant in circumstances where the suspect does not co-operate with the Garda.</P>
    <P>There are also other conditions which will be dealt with when the Bill is debated but all of the issues Deputy O'Donoghue failed to cover in his legislation are in the Government's Bill.  I am satisfied the proposals I will put forward in the Bill tomorrow are capable of providing an effective law to deal with the criminal use of syringes. I did not need Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill to be published.</P>

      <P>Everybody will agree that with the passage of time and the increased sophistication of criminal methods, there is an ongoing need to update legislation.  Criminal law has to be amended and extended to meet the threat, and nobody is more conscious of that than the Minister for Justice.  Looking at Deputy O'Donoghue on the monitor, I might have been watching a play on television, such was the grief and hurt he portrayed in presenting this Bill.  This is clearly the political opportunism for which he is famous. He borrows his phrases from the Listowel Writers' Week and more power to him; there are some very inspiring people there.  However, this is the serious business of Parliament.  Attempting to politicise the debate is to reverse what should be done to update the law.</P>

      <P>Crime has been escalating for five to seven years.  The legislation the Minister is to publish tomorrow will deal with that problem.  The number of crimes against the individual has increased dramatically in the last ten years and citizens feel vulnerable.  My nephew was attacked twice with a syringe while standing at a bus stop in the city centre.</P>

      <P>The Minister is interested in the progress of Operation Dóchas.  The inner city is the area worst affected by drug addiction and syringe <Col N="716" /> attacks.  Two weeks ago <i>The Star</i> reported that Garda patrol units face cutbacks and that Garda numbers have been drastically reduced in the notorious drugs blackspot in Kilmainham, where vigilantes and dealers have inflicted horrific beatings.  It went on to report that rank and file gardaí in the district, which covers Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House and Basin Street, were to consider industrial action amidst claims that regular patrol units had been cut by 50 per cent, with anti-drugs vigilantes proving more successful than the under-resourced gardaí in the district. The report went on to state that heroin dealers had returned to Fatima Mansions and when a reporter from the paper visited the complex they were openly dealing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eric Byrne and I attended a meeting yesterday afternoon at Dolphin House and were told that the problem in the locality was as bad as ever.  Something is very wrong and the Minister should contact the Assistant Commissioner, Tom King.  While he is determined and is doing his best, he must be given the necessary resources, otherwise he cannot do the job.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to enact the legislation allowing Garda inspectors to process cases in court, rather than taking gardaí off the streets to do so or expending large sums of money on overtime which could be better spent on recruiting more gardaí.  The message we hear daily is that we need more gardaí on the beat.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand some of our laws.  A District Court judge recently stated that the maximum fine that can be imposed on an adult man for soliciting children is £250.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Delays in the office of the DPP in processing prosecutions is another area of frustration for the gardaí.  For example, the process of ascertaining the purity of drugs found on individuals delays their prosecution.</P>
      <P>There is also public frustration at what is perceived to be the reluctance of the Judiciary to implement the spirit of legislation passed by this House.  This makes it necessary for the House to pass laws providing for minimum sentences which the Judiciary seems to dislike.  It often appears that members of the Judiciary act as if they are removed from the suffering endured by victims of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to rectifying this problem, we must provide more prison spaces.  Those convicted of non violent crimes should be sent to open prisons where remission would be automatically cancelled if they absconded.  This would leave more prison spaces available to deal with the kind of criminal who some months ago threatened to attack a person with a syringe and robbed him outside the Bank of Ireland branch on Westmoreland Street.  The victim was given enough money <Col N="717" /> by the robber to commute home to Celbridge and warned not to report the incident to the Garda. He was threatened and intimidated.</P>
    <P>The Minister's promise of legislation in this area and the publication of this Bill is too much of a coincidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be more tolerant of those of us who have not been Ministers. Incidents on the streets involving syringes are terrifying and many of them are not reported. It is not always wealthy people who are robbed. Frequently teenagers are robbed of their £5 or £10.  People are absolutely terrified that this is being allowed happen.  We must ask where the <Col N="718" /> syringes are coming from and the reason for their availability.  I think the State may be handing them out at drug centres or perhaps they are being stolen from hospitals.</P>
      <P>I agree with the necessity for the Bill, whether introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue or the Minister. There is a huge problem that we have to tackle.  If people are breaking into casualty departments and stealing syringes or if they are handed out at drug centres we need to close that loophole.  Somebody said it is as bad as being attacked with a gun or a knife but it is worse.  If one is attacked with a knife or some other type of weapon, the wound is visible and one has an idea how long it will take to heal.  The physical wound caused by a syringe may be small, but the fear, the trauma and the psychological effect can last for many months.</P>
      <P>The political matter may be between Deputy O'Donoghue and the Minister but it seems as if the Minister has only just produced the Bill. Given the personalised slagging which took place earlier between Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue must be getting to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Government has been engaged in extraordinary profligacy during the past few months.  The State has not witnessed anything like it since the latter days of Mr. Haughey's administration in 1981.  This morning I attended a primary school in my constituency in <Col N="719" /> one of the most deprived districts in the city where the pupil-teacher ratio is 33:1 for the children of fifth class.  The teacher was able to say with confidence and certainty that a number of persons in that class would soon graduate to becoming hardened criminals.  Given the squalor in some parts of the city and the Government's caving in day in day out to well-heeled lobbies, and the histrionics of the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, one has to appeal through the Minister to the Taoiseach to dissolve the Dáil soon in the interests of everybody.</P>
      <P>I congratulate our spokesperson on bringing forward 11 Bills since we had the misfortune to find ourselves on this side of the House in November 1994.  That is not a bad tribute to the quality of official Fianna Fáil thinking on this subject. I avail of this opportunity, as the Dáil draws to a close, to congratulate our spokesperson on the volume of work he has done.  I congratulate also Deputy O'Dea on bringing forward a measure on criminal injuries compensation, a subject close to my heart.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a number of criticisms of the Bill.  There is a need in legislation of this type to draw a balance.  We have to measure out carefully the respective rights of suspects and the investigating authorities and the precise functions of the courts.  That must be spelled out clearly in legislation.  The Minister will agree we do not have the enormous resources which she has at her disposal, in terms of parliamentary draftsmanship and legal assistance.  Our spokesperson has to put together on a voluntary basis a support group of advisers who direct and advise him on these matters. The quality of Fianna Fáil thinking on this subject has been of a high order.  I accept the Minister's point that we would have to examine any legislation in this area with great care and have regard to the report prepared by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been introduced for an additional reason which relates to the heroin problem in this city.  We have an enormous heroin problem in Dublin and the phenomenon of syringe attacks is simply a symptom of the problem.</P>
      <P>I get depressed when I hear official announcements applauding a great cannabis seizure here or there.  As a controlled drug under our legislative code, cannabis must be seized.  The real problem, however, is the huge quantity of heroin available in the city.  Some progress has been made but in terms of seizures the public want much more progress and dramatic action.  There are constraints on any Minister and any police force but this is a subject of enormous public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The district where I visited a primary school has upwards of 200 juvenile heroin abusers in one parish.  That is a disaster.  That problem is being addressed by the Government in various ways but so far as it falls within the Minister's remit there are two aspects to it.  The question is whether all that can be done is being done in terms of gathering <Col N="720" /> the necessary information and arranging the necessary seizures.  I am under no illusion that that costs money, but it is an investment the people want made by our investigative authorities. The other aspect concerns the actual enforcement of the legislation on the ground.  I regret to say to the Minister &mdash; this is not something I would ever wish to contribute to as a Deputy &mdash; there is a lack of public confidence in the reaction time of the investigative authorities in the affected areas.  I appreciate it is difficult to transmit a directive from headquarters to ground level.  That is a problem and public confidence has to be won.  I suggest a confidential hotline in relation to drugs information which would be widely advertised in these districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a confidential line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but perhaps it could be advertised extensively.  It is important that information is conveyed in a clear manner to the residents that such a facility is in existence. Often such information may be circulated through the news media which may not be read or studied in the districts concerned.</P>
      <P>On the issue of prisons policy, unless there is an effective deterrent and the prison building programme is expedited and every option is examined &mdash; if necessary, certain options associated with the private sector &mdash; with a view to ensuring that as many people as possible meet the mandate of the courts and that court sentences are implemented, there will be lack of public confidence in the entire system and a feeling of despair about whether the system is operating in a practical way.  I congratulate our spokesperson for bringing forward the Bill as it affords us an opportunity to put those concerns to the Minister. The public will indict not only the Minister but the whole political establishment if a clear response is not devised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I said we must not fail to recognise the difference between credit unions and other financial institutions.  The legislation is designed to cater for an updated and modern credit union movement.  There has been a strong demand for the introduction of the legislation but it is important to remember that we are dealing with a non-profit making voluntary organisation and not a bank or building society.  The legislation must mark the difference between credit unions and other financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of credit unions has increased significantly since the establishment of the first credit <Col N="721" /> union in 1958.  There are now approximately 430 credit unions, while the money on deposit amounts to approximately £2 billion.  Since 1958 only one Act has been introduced to deal with the structure of credit unions, namely, the Credit Union Act, 1966.  The introduction of this legislation is, therefore, timely.</P>
    <P>The legislation will ensure that the benefits which have accrued to local communities from the establishment of credit unions will continue. Credit unions have enabled thousands of people who would not have taken out a loan with a bank or building society to secure finance to buy cars, televisions, videos, etc.  This type of co-operative spirit and investment of local money in communities is unique to credit unions.  This is why it is important for the legislation to mark the clear distinction between credit unions and other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement has given local communities a great sense of empowerment.  The appointment of local directors, the involvement of local people and the investment of money locally is very important from the point of view of community development.  I hope the contact between local enterprise boards, community groups, etc. and credit unions can be further developed in the future.  The extension of the maximum lending period will enable credit unions to offer loans to small enterprises and industrialists and will enable local interest groups, enterprise boards and companies to obtain funding to develop.  This is a natural follow on from the present position.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the limits being imposed on deposits, shares, loans, etc. However, if the credit union movement is to retain its separate identity and not become another bank, some limit must be set.  This will enable the movement to grow and expand, while retaining its distinctive features.  The limits proposed by the Minister are reasonable and will enable credit unions to maintain and develop their essential services.  The Minister discussed these matters with the Irish League of Credit Unions and he is willing to take on board suggestions made by it and other interested parties, including Deputies.  His proposals are reasonable and while concern has been expressed about the limits it is important that credit unions maintain their status as local non-profit making voluntary institutions.  The extension of the maximum loan period will give credit unions the option to offer loans for commercial development, an option it did not previously enjoy.  The Minister deserves praise for introducing this change.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in recent years in the funding invested in credit unions and in the number of people working voluntarily in the movement.  There has also been increased liaison between the credit union movement and voluntary organisations.  I welcome the close cooperation between credit unions and rural organisations, particularly farming groups.  This has brought more people into contact with credit <Col N="722" /> unions and ensured a new source of funding.  The future of credit unions lies in developing new and close associations with the various sectors of society.  Up until the 1980s most investors in credit unions came from one sector of society.  This has changed and credit unions now deal with people from many areas in society.  This will enable the movement to grow and prosper.  The legislation will enable credit unions to attract more investors, thereby increasing the amount on deposit.</P>
    <P>Because of the increases in investment and borrowings, it is important to put in place proper supervisory arrangements under which lenders and borrowers are fully protected.  The Minister of State's approach in the legislation is quite proper and not over the top.  He is simply ensuring that people can invest in credit unions in the knowledge that their money is absolutely safe and can seek loans in the knowledge that their applications will be dealt with properly.  Any financial institution, large or small, needs to have such rules.  If we want to see the credit union movement grow, we will have to have certain guidelines and regulations to protect the consumer. This legislation does that without hindering the development of the credit union movement in any way.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important Bill which will help ensure the continuing growth of a financial institution which is of growing importance to local and rural communities.  I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing forward this legislation which has been long sought, particularly by those involved in the credit union movement.  I am sure the Minister of State will listen to constructive amendments.</P>
    <P>Many people are interested in this legislation. The Minister of State has listened to the Irish League of Credit Unions and I hope he will continue to do so.  With some credit unions having greatly increased in size, the legislative demands and requirements of credit unions can vary dramatically.  It is not a question of every credit union requiring the same results from this legislation. In my constituency there is a huge difference between the one or two very big credit unions and those which are focused on small villages and rural parishes.  When I spoke to members of the credit union movement I sensed differences in their responses to the Bill.  When we meet groups such as the Irish League of Credit Unions we must remember that the needs and requests of small credit unions may be quite radically different from those of larger ones.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State will listen to all the arguments and take on board what is necessary in order to allow the credit union movement to develop and expand.  The organisation has been tremendously beneficial to hundreds of thousands of people over the past 40 years and can continue that excellent work in the years ahead.  This legislative framework is warranted and I hope the Bill will be passed over the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this very important Bill. Having waited for a long time and having seen so many deadlines come and go, many people could have been forgiven for thinking that the Credit Union Bill would never materialise.  However, it arrived just before Christmas.  I express my thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>It is a lengthy, detailed and complicated document and, like most legislation, it does not make for easy reading.  It runs to 145 pages and includes 14 Parts, 188 sections and five Schedules.  It is also a weighty Bill in terms of its significance as it is the first consolidating legislation for credit unions since the State was founded.  It repeals all the existing Acts dealing with credit unions, which date from 1893 to 1978.  When passed, it will have major implications for the future of the credit union movement.</P>
      <P>Overall, the Bill offers some welcome improvements which the credit union movement has been seeking for years.  Its highlights include provision for more flexibility on withdrawing shares and deposits, for allowing people under 16 years to join credit unions, for loans to be made for periods longer than five years, for credit unions to participate in savings protection schemes for statutory fraud or dishonesty insurance, and to allow credit unions to provide additional services.</P>
      <P>Many meetings have taken place about this legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, attended a special meeting of the credit union movement in Limerick.  At that meeting a motion, requesting the meeting to instruct the board of the Irish League of Credit Unions to convey to the Minister of State that the Bill as published is unacceptable and to engage in negotiations with him with a view to securing amendments in line with the views expressed by the movement, was passed.</P>
      <P>The Bill has given rise to a great deal of discussion among credit unions and their members. The Minister of State described it as a state of the art Bill.  That view is not shared by many members of the credit union movement.  It merely erodes the influence of credit unions and the voluntary concept established over many years.  It also erodes the worthwhile provisions of the 1966 Act.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement has a tremendous national profile.  There are approximately 432 credit unions here with in the region of 1.6 million members.  Savings through credit unions amount to almost £2 billion and loans to approximately £1.5 billion.  There are approximately 600,000 borrowers and 10,200 volunteers working in credit unions.  The credit union movement operates on a voluntary basis.  It employs approximately 172 full-time and 583 part-time employees.  This legislation attacks the ethos of that organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have witnessed what credit unions mean to a local community in my home town of Tralee, especially at Christmas time where they have counteracted the money lenders who, for many <Col N="724" /> years, created havoc for families who were not in a position to make repayments after the Christmas period.  Credit unions have lifted communities out of poverty and unemployment and made life easier for poorer families, many of whom are now excellent members of the credit union movement.  They have given hope and dignity to people whose futures were very bleak.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear parochial, but I must refer to Tralee Credit Union, one of the most successful credit unions in the country.  It developed, not due to a marketing campaign, but because of the service it provided to its members.  It is owned and run by its members and sets out to serve their needs.  Kerry has a total of 12 credit unions with in excess of 55,000 members, all of which are most innovative in terms of new services, but they will be undermined by this legislation.  The Tralee Credit Union issues travellers cheques and foreign currency.  It also has schemes including safety deposits boxes and start your own business loans, among many others.  The credit union movement in Kerry is community based and promotes many projects in the area.  There is a strong commitment to the co-operative movement within the credit unions in Kerry.</P>
    <P>In national terms most people's lives have been improved by credit unions.  Approximately half the country's population, 1.5 million people, are members and it is important that we cater for them.  We can be proud of what the credit union movement has achieved.  It is the most successful co-operative movement in the country.  It has enabled many people to become self-reliant and has created a community spirit among our people. The co-operative concept is strong throughout the Minister area.</P>
    <P>One has to be pleased that people can be motivated by something other than material gain. Credit unions do not make profits; they are owned and operated by the members for their own benefit.  Anybody who wishes to join can do so.  They are fundamentally different from other financial institutions and levelling the playing pitch should not impact adversely on the credit union ideal.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill has two main purposes, to provide for the development of credit unions and for increased regulation of the movement.  In the past, each credit union regulated its own affairs. We tend to go overboard with regulations.  If we over-regulate credit unions we will destroy the voluntary concept that has developed in the credit union movement over many years.  Who will give up their free time to work in credit unions if they are subject to regulation by faceless people in Dublin who have little interest in their local area?</P>
    <P>How can the Minister of State claim the Bill provides for the development of credit unions when they will be restricted in what they can do for their members?  The Bill restricts the amount of savings a member can have with a credit union, but there is no reason for such a restriction. <Col N="725" /> Under current legislation people may save as much as they like with a credit union.  The proposed restriction is not a new development.  The Bill also restricts to £20,000 the amount a credit union may lend &mdash; up to now the only restriction was the provision relating to 10 per cent of assets. Is that development?  In this day and age £20,000 is considered a very small loan.  Many credit unions have been developed, one of which in the Dublin area grants substantially higher loans than that provided for in the Bill.  How can we regulate for what was done in the past?  A sum of £20,000 would not buy a car in some cases or fund an extension to a home.  This restriction will retard the development of credit unions.</P>
    <P>Up to now credit unions could invest in property to benefit their community, but under the Bill they will be unable to buy property or invest funds over and above 0.25 per cent of surplus funds in the social and cultural aspects of the community.  That is not development.  I appreciate the Minister intends to bring forward amendments and I urge him to apply commonsense in doing so.</P>
    <P>The limit on loans should be based on the size of credit unions and members should have the right to decide what they wish to do with surpluses. Credit unions should be allowed lend money based on their membership and asset value.  This Bill is modelled on the operations of the Central Bank which controls the banking system. The Minister of State said he received several submissions, but it seems as if he only met people from banks or other financial institutions, otherwise somebody in his Department favours the banking system.  The banking ethos is evident throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>Recent press reports outlined the results of the privatisation of a building society.  I support privatisation and believe in the free market, but people should not be allowed earn in excess of £500,000 per year.  Those people claim they deserve large salaries because the company is successful under their management, but it is difficult for people on low incomes to accept that statement. Many of the people on such high salaries have shares in the equity market which has grown over the years.</P>
    <P>We must curb the granting of such large increases in salaries, which is evident not only in the financial area but in all sectors of industry.  It is not good for society to see a small number of people getting such large salaries to the annoyance of people who work hard and receive a mere 3 per cent or 4 per cent increase each year.  We must legislate to prohibit the practice of granting large increases in salaries because it has a bad influence on the community.  On the other hand, credit unions, which are voluntary organisations, are being greatly restricted by the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the work of the credit union movement over the past 40 years, particularly its philosophy which is being eroded to some degree by the Bill.  It brings the credit <Col N="726" /> union movement into the era of political correctness, and the House is aware of my views on that heinous philosophy.  I also appreciate the people who have worked in credit unions over many years.</P>
      <P>When I had the honour of being Minister for Defence, I received an excellent submission from PDFORRA.  That is a terrible name for an association and should be changed; &ldquo;other ranks&rdquo; is evocative of another era.  The submission outlined that the Defence Forces did not have a credit union.  I am pleased to say that, before I ceased to be Minister, I approved the setting up of a credit union in the Defence Forces.  I humbly submit that is one monument to my period as a Minister in that Government.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement should be allowed to develop unhindered.  I accept it may have to be regulated although I do not necessarily agree with the limits.  I do not suggest the people who operate credit unions do not do so with honour, dignity and responsibility, but in circumstances where large sums of money flow into this exceptional movement, some of the Minister's proposals should be operated.</P>
      <P>I do not want to diminish the philosophy of the credit union movement which means a great deal to our party.  The credit union movement gave hope to people who did not have any hope.  It gave dignity to the community and encapsulated the original philosophy of sinn féin, we ourselves. The credit unions got on with the business of what they regarded as being in the best interests of the financial needs of their community.  That was part of credit union philosophy in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Credit unions were then established in the cities where the wretched moneylenders operated. If credit unions did nothing else they diminished the influence of moneylenders on communities in our inner cities, and that is to their eternal credit. I acknowledge moneylenders continue to operate in our cities and are an appendage communities can well do without, but part of the philosophy of the credit union movement, which I hope will continue, is to ensure that people who are tempted to use the services of moneylenders go to their local credit unions instead where they are treated with respect and their dignity is recognised. That is important in the context of the way the credit union movement operates.</P>
      <P>As far as the continuance of the movement is concerned, I hope it realises the aims and objectives of its original founders and is not diminished in any way as a direct result of this legislation.  I have not examined the Bill in great detail, mainly because it is a long, complex document, but I heard representatives of the credit union movement address the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. They made an extremely impressive presentation during the course of that meeting which highlighted once again what the credit union movement has done for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> Credit unions are operated on a voluntary basis by people who identify problems in their community and offer solutions.  Many problems have been resolved by the credit union movement.  It is to its eternal credit that it has survived over many years with leadership from dedicated men and women who offer their services on a voluntary basis.  I cannot give them enough praise.  This is the type of philosophy this country should adopt, irrespective of the political party in power. The philosophy that was responsible for setting up the credit union movement is as relevant today as it was decades ago.</P>
    <P>I hope the credit union movement will not be brought into the era of political correctness as a result of this legislation.  I would like an assurance that the flexibility or the philosophy of the credit union movement will not be interfered with or circumscribed by the legislation.  While I realise the Minister of State must act on the advice available to him, the credit union movement is concerned with some aspects of the Bill.  I understand he met members of the movement and gave them some assurances which I hope are reflected in his response to this debate.</P>

      <P>It is a credit to the Minister of State that Fianna Fáil supports the Bill</P>
      <P>The credit union movement has been the greatest phenomenon in my lifetime.  Its success could not have been foreseen.  It swept like a forest fire throughout the nation and opened doors of opportunity for thousands of people which were previously closed and bolted by the traditional banks.  The working class, who have benefited most from the credit union movement, were not wanted across the threshold of banks until the advent of the credit union movement.  Thousands of people in towns, cities and rural communities have benefited.  It is a people's movement that has not as yet been infiltrated by the vultures of the financial world.  Profits are distributed among the people.  Many elderly people in remote country areas who mistrusted insurance companies and traditional banks joined credit unions because of the ground swell of support for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> The credit union movement has been the greatest success story in the 80 year history of the State.  It has opened a new avenue of opportunity for working class people.  The entire country has benefited.  It has allowed parents borrow for their children's benefit, from confirmation to university fees.  It has enabled hundreds of young people to go to university and face the future with increased hope.  Families can also borrow for cars, holidays, weddings, funerals and many other occasions.  It has had greatest impact on the farming community, particularly small farmers, who have borrowed for stock, plant, machinery and to cover lean times.</P>
    <P>Staggering advances have been made in communities as a result of credit unions.  Dundalk was one of the first towns to affiliate to the Irish League of Credit Unions and its savings has reached millions of pounds.  There are 1,700 members in the Ravensdale-Bellurgan Credit Union, with savings in excess of £1 million.  Savings in the Cooley Credit Union are in excess of £3 million.  There is not a family in those parishes who has not benefited from the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the upgrading of the 1958 Bill.  This has also been welcomed by the Irish League of Credit Unions and I compliment the Minister of State on his willingness to meet representatives of the league.  Not every Minister is willing to liaise with vested interests.  There is no Minister more suited to the role of liaison than the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  The league is seeking more liaison with the Minister and some compromises.  It accepts that regulation is necessary and basically welcomes the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has countered with telling effect the awful parasites who live in our midst, those whom Deputy Andrews called &ldquo;wretched moneylenders&rdquo;. Those people &mdash; if one could call them people &mdash; are the greatest parasites in our society. They are vultures who should be stamped out.  I look forward to the introduction of legislation to stamp out that type of vermin.  The credit union has countered their presence in our midst and has been a great source of relief to hundreds, possibly thousands, of people who have been caught in the grip of these wretched parasites.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the Bill which most concerns the League of Credit Unions is the cap on deposits and loans of £20,000.  There may be financial reasons for this which have passed over my head but £20,000, while it is a lot of money to some, is not a huge amount.  Thousands of people have gone to credit unions to buy and build houses and to build extensions to houses.  There should be no cap because credit unions have been run in an exemplary way.  It is remarkable that over the years no hint of scandal has been associated with the credit union movement, unlike the banks and the insurance industry.  Credit unions have a purer input because they are community inspired and involve the community.  Rather than us regulating them and creating standards by which they should abide, perhaps they should monitor <Col N="729" /> us.  If the State was run as well as the credit union movement, we would learn a lot.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill and hope he will accept a couple of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  The Opposition, in particular, has demanded that the Credit Union Bill, 1996, be brought before the House quickly, although it had seven and half years to do so but did not.  That is all the more reason to congratulate the Minister for introducing this detailed legislation which will involve much debate on Committee Stage and which has been welcomed by the credit union movement.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the development and regulation of credit unions.  There are £2 billion on deposit in 434 credit unions, a remarkable achievement, and no money has been lost to any member, a point to which Deputy McGahon referred.  The credit union allows for sickness by giving people time to repay.  If one of its members dies their debt is cleared, a major burden their family does not have to face.  Few other institutions would do that unless the member had taken out expensive insurance.  Hundreds and thousands of people depend on the credit union for finance because they would not get credit elsewhere.  More importantly, they get credit at a reasonable rate which they can afford.</P>
      <P>The credit union provided £100,000, as a local contribution, to an enterprise centre in Clones, a town which has suffered more than any other in the past 25 years.  No other body would give that amount of money to allow it to draw down European funds.  That group, with the support of the majority of its members, provided much needed seed fund to make the development work.  In Ballybay the credit union is building a new structure not only for itself, but it is providing state of the art accommodation for a health centre.  That would not have happened without the credit union.  Although small towns like Ballybay are often forgotten by Government, it was not forgotten by the committee of the credit union.</P>
      <P>There are important issues covered in the Bill. Long-term loans are welcome, particularly for contract workers who cannot get funds from banks or building societies because they are not able to show P60s but they are known by their local credit union committee and can get money which they would not otherwise get.  I came across a case where a man was given no option but to buy a lorry.  He had driven a lorry for a company for some time but it suddenly decided to contract out the work.  He, like many others, was able to go to his credit union and borrow almost £30,000.  That is the reason I question the need for the £20,000 limit.  Not many people need to borrow over £5,000 or £10,000 so if only a few people who cannot get money elsewhere need over £20,000, there is no need for this regulation. I hope we will be able to reach a compromise on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> I know of a community group which was able to set up a small enterprise.  It was not in a position to get funding from a banking institution but was able to get it from its friendly credit union.  I understand seven valuable jobs have been created.  We often spend a lot of money going abroad to attract foreign investors but in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan such jobs are important.  I hope the Minister will find an opt out clause for these community groups when it comes to the £20,000 cap.</P>
    <P>There is a worry in the credit union movement about over-regulation &mdash; for example, those whom credit unions decide should sign cheques. I have been told by those involved in credit unions that the legislation states cheques should be signed by a director, which would cause a serious problem.  The directors and committee of a credit union know their staff.  Given the credit unions record in self-regulation over the years, this is a matter around which we should find a way.  While I realise we are now dealing with substantial amounts of money compared to when credit unions were set up, their record has been good.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement depends on voluntary personnel and the committee structures which have worked well in the past and must be encouraged.  These people do not take large profits or hundreds and thousands of pounds in salaries. Unlike many banks, credit unions do not remove the umbrella when it starts to rain.  They are prepared to sit down with those who have over-borrowed or who face difficulties to try to find a way around the problem.</P>
    <P>Many groups of workers depend on credit unions &mdash; Deputy Andrews mentioned one earlier &mdash; to look after their savings.  Small farmers, to whom Deputy McGahon referred, caught in the 1980s when they found themselves paying up to 22 to 23 per cent to banks now realise the benefit of the credit union.  It was unheard of 20 years ago for farmers to use the credit union but they use it now.</P>
    <P>However, many people other than workers and farmers who live in poor quality accommodation depend on the credit union for money to replace windows, doors, etc.  As Deputy McGahon said, they also use it to meet the cost of communions, weddings and other events.  The credit union has a proud record and the legislation is long overdue. In the main it is a good Bill, which was demanded by the Opposition and the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>The ability of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and his staff will enable the small changes I mentioned earlier to be made.  These will ensure the Bill is a historic step forward and brings credit unions into the next century so they continue to serve the people.  The credit union movement operates across the Border and just ten days ago Mr. John Hume, MP, opened a new credit union office in the village of Iniskeen.  Credit unions serve both sides of the Border and they are moving forward dramatically in my county.  A <Col N="731" /> new credit union office will be built in the coming months in Monaghan town and work has already commenced in Ballybay.  A new office has been built in Cootehill which helped to build new houses beside it.  The record of the credit unions is fantastic.  I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill which will be a new beginning for credit unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The Bill has been a long time in gestation. It has been anticipated by many individuals for many years but it finally became a reality just before Christmas.  It is the first legislation specifically devoted to credit unions for over 30 years. The purpose of the Bill is to provide a statutory framework for the development and growth of the credit union movement and to enable credit unions to provide an enhanced range of services to their members.</P>
      <P>Given that credit unions are so widespread, it is difficult to believe that they were unknown 40 years ago and that the first credit union was only formed in 1958.  By the following year, there were three credit unions, comprising just 200 members with a sum of £415 in membership holdings.  The Credit Union Act, 1966, which remains the principal legislation governing credit unions, covered the organisation, operation and supervision of credit unions.  However, there has been no legislation of substance since then.</P>
      <P>The 1966 Act allowed credit unions to borrow and to make loans available to their members.  It attached certain conditions to the making of loans.  It dealt with the powers, functions, duties and constitution of the credit union board of directors and its supervisory committee and established the manner in which they reported to the credit union's membership.  They were subject to the members in general meetings.  It also provided for the keeping of accounts by credit unions and their auditing.  It established the credit union advisory committee, which has been of use to people since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit union movement nationally is a wonderful organisation.  It is a phenomenal institution given the huge number of people involved in it, its ethos and its operation.  It is unbelievable that it can operate at the discretion of voluntary contributions in the main.  For example, the 1995 figures for County Donegal show there were 14 individual branches, comprising 38,248 members. That is a considerable number of people by any standard who are catered for by an organisation which accepts them as they are.  In 1995 they had contributed £32,584,979 in savings to the organisation and 11,485 people were in a position to borrow £21,712,467.  That is a phenomenal record. There was not only the facility to save and take out loans but 249 people were working voluntarily in the true community spirit of the organisation. It provides full employment to 25 people and part-time employment to 17 people.  These <Col N="732" /> statistics are local but one only needs to examine the national picture to have an even more graphic view of the value of the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be welcomed because it is the first consolidating legislation relating to credit unions.  It will have major implications when it is enacted and above all it must maintain the special ethos of the movement and increase the services offered.  I welcome the provisions which include more flexibility in terms of withdrawing shares and deposits, that people under 16 years of age can join credit unions and that loans can be over a period longer than five years.  This will have major ramifications for many people.  I am glad credit unions will be able to participate in savings protection schemes for statutory fraud dishonesty insurance.  There is scope in the Bill to allow credit unions to provide additional services.</P>
    <P>However, given that the Bill took so long to come before the House and that it includes inputs from detailed discussions with the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Registry of Friendly Societies, I am surprised it has not been greeted with unanimous approval.  The Minister of State addressed the last two annual general meetings of the Irish League of Credit Unions and its conception of what should be contained in the Bill was conveyed to him on every occasion.  Yet, many people feel the Bill is over-regulatory and intrusive, which is against the ethos of the movement in certain sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people feel the Bill does not go far enough in terms of the services which could be extended but perhaps, on Committee Stage, we will have an opportunity to examine some of the outstanding issues.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for an increase in shareholdings, deposits and loans from £6,000 to £20,000. Why it is necessary to cap deposits at £20,000? Will the Minister clarify the exact position in relation to the indebtedness clause where a person can have £20,000 in shares, £20,000 on deposit and £20,000 on loan?  Does this mean there is, in effect, a £60,000, £40,000 or £20,000 limit?  The credit unions are most unhappy about the caps.</P>
      <P>While the percentage of those who have substantial savings in a credit union may be small, the imposition of a cap of £20,000 will have a twofold effect.  Those with over £20,000 on deposit will have no alternative but to find another institution in which to invest, while the capital at the disposal of a credit union will be reduced.  This is not in keeping with the ethos of the credit union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until now, the impact on the local community could be taken into account in assessing loan applications.  If the impact was likely to be positive, there was scope for leniency.  The question <Col N="733" /> that will be asked is: who will invest money in if they cannot withdraw it?</P>
    <P>As a county councillor, I cannot understand why the credit unions are not given some encouragement to assist local authority tenants who wish to buy their homes.  Although tenants can quickly produce proof of refusal by a bank and building society, they still find it difficult to provide the surety required by a local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is approximately £30,000. I do not believe that people would race in their hundreds to the credit unions for finance, the number in each community who need to be helped in this way is consistent.  What are the obstacles preventing the credit unions, which are community-led groups, from becoming involved in helping individuals to buy their homes?  They should have the option to do so.</P>
      <P>The credit unions have made a phenomenal contribution to the communities in which they are located.  They are self-regulated, have provided training for their employees and not lost a single penny in 37 years.  Any group with such a record should expect to receive a reasonable response when it expresses a wish to advance.</P>
      <P>Will the proposed cap be revised?  Will the Minister of State consider raising it to £30,000 or 5 per cent of the assets of the credit union concerned, whichever is the higher?  Alternatively, will he consider removing it?</P>
      <P>The Bill states that if the whole of a building held by a credit union ceases to be occupied for the purposes of the business of the credit union, the credit union shall dispose of its interest in that building as soon as it is practicable to do so.  Many credit unions which allow charities and other voluntary organisations to use part of their premises were under the impression that they would have to vacate the building.  As someone said to me, if the toilet was not being used the building would have to be sold.  I am glad the Minister of State has clarified the matter.  It is important that any other misunderstandings are cleared up.</P>
      <P>Despite the credit unions proven ability to help themselves, there is concern that the registrar will assume responsibility for making minor decisions and in the process remove the right of the credit unions to regulate their own activities.  This will affect their members sense of ownership.  Many credit union members who give of their time voluntarily are under the impression that every &ldquo;i&rdquo; will have to be dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed under the auspices of the registrar.  They will not agree to this as it will undermine the belief that the local community is in charge.  If others are allowed to offer their penny's worth, I envisage members saying they are no longer interested and withdrawing quickly.  There is, therefore, a need for clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The registrar will have an increased workload in that he or she will have to prepare and maintain a public file on each of the credit unions <Col N="734" /> throughout the country.  What resources will be available to him or her to carry out this task?</P>
    <P>There are stringent mechanisms in place in credit unions to ensure accountability.  Rigorous examinations have been carried out and the registrar has been called in when needed to carry out inspections.  They have not, therefore, been found wanting in that respect.  They are very much aware of the need to have everything above board and run their operations as smoothly as possible.</P>
    <P>The credit unions have expressed a wish to extend the range of services they offer to areas where strength in numbers can result in financial savings for their members.  There will be scope under the Bill to provide additional services such as ATMs and other facilities, but scope is not provided for other developments that would not have financial implications for credit unions where they could use their strength in numbers to develop their capabilities.  I hope the Minister of State will be amenable to expanding services that could be rendered in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Credit unions have stringent mechanisms to ensure accountability.  They brought in the registrar when inspections were needed, but they have also carried out rigorous examinations.  We should not over-expose credit unions, which are run voluntarily, to an outside influence because too much outside influence will result in the dissipation of the goodwill of those involved.</P>
      <P>The ethos of the organisation is based on participation. On publication of the Bill the Minister of State said it was in good shape primarily because of the expert contributions by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the credit union movement.  That the Minister of State and former Ministers involved in the preparation of this Bill were able to get people to participate in putting forward proposals for the Bill illustrates the ethos of the credit union movement.  Arising from ongoing consultations, the Minister of State also gave an undertaking that he expects to table amendments on Committee Stage following contact with the offices of the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General.  I hope he will take account of the scope that exists to widen the limits applying to credit unions and to the movement of funds into local authority-type ventures that would greatly benefit local communities for which credit unions cater.  The Minister of State gave a further assurance that he is open to considering all views and comments on the Bill.  I trust that will be the case and he will try to maintain the ethos of the credit unions as community self-help institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit unions have an excellent track record in guaranteeing the security of members' savings and that must be kept to the forefront of the Minister of State's considerations.  As this legislation <Col N="735" /> is long awaited, the Minister of State should ensure the spirit of the credit union movement is not interfered with through the imposition of a limit of £20,000 on savings, the unnecessary intrusion of the registrar and the restriction of services that can be introduced without legislating for the many other options that could be open at no risk to the league, given its combined purchasing power.  I would like to think we could pass on to the next generation the valuable contributions received in the past, but look to the reality of the present.  The provision to accept members aged 16 and younger is positive as is the provision to extend loans beyond a period of five years.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State consider the importance of increasing the limit applying to credit unions, and maintaining his contacts with the league so that really worthwhile amendments will be made to the Bill and in 30 years' time we will say this Bill was worthwhile?</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on introducing this Bill.  Many parties and Governments have talked about introducing it and last year we all came under pressure to introduce it before the forthcoming general election. The Irish League of Credit Unions would welcome amendments to it and I am sure the Minister of State will respond positively on Committee Stage to such amendments.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to people, particularly those in rural Ireland, who, for many years, voluntarily gave of their services to credit unions.  I am mindful of the manner in which banks have treated customers in rural towns for many years.  I accept credit unions do not compete with the banks, but many people in rural Ireland had to depend on credit unions when banks refused to grant loans to people living in housing estates on low paid jobs.  When those people needed help the banks were not there for them.  They were there for people who were able to secure loans from three or four banks, but the credit unions looked after the poorer people.</P>
      <P>As a member of the urban district council, I recall a major motion was put to the council on one occasion.  The council wanted one of the three banks in the town to install a banklink machine, but the three banks refused to install one stating it would not be profitable to do so. Shortly after that one of the banks decided that perhaps it should install one and now there are three banklink machines and a cash dispensing machine at the credit union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Achill has a large community, a good deal of tourism and many people visit it in the summer, but it does not have a resident bank.  Yet in all these small places credit unions have set up, <Col N="736" /> manned their offices and dealt satisfactorily with the general public.  I do not see anything wrong with giving them more power, facilities or allowing them to compete with the banks.</P>
    <P>Last week Allied Irish Banks announced a profit of approximately £420 million in the past year. The Bank of Ireland also recorded profits on which they are to be complimented.  I observe the AIB venturing to America again.  I hope it will be more successful there this time than on the last occasion when they made a serious mistake, resulting in Irish taxpayers having to pick up the tab and necessitating the urgent passage of Bills to offset the repercussions.  If I engage in business and make a serious mistake I cannot approach the Minister for Finance or any member of the Government to introduce a Bill to save me from its disastrous results; I am left to sink.  The same applies whenever one cashes a cheque, takes silver to the bank for conversion into notes or notes for conversion into silver.  It is a continuous litany of &ldquo;pay, pay, pay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The credit unions should be enabled to compete with the banks in a small way.  Like other Members, I have been contacted by constituents in relation to this Bill.  One of their concerns, is that the maximum shareholding of a member is now capped at £20,000.  Most people would be satisfied with the more realistic figure of £30,000. The maximum deposit permissible in the case of a member is capped at £20,000, whereas a figure of £50,000 or a percentage of credit union shares would be more realistic.</P>
    <P>The maximum loan a member can obtain is £20,000 but constituents have made the case to me that a figure of £30,000 or £50,000 would be more realistic.  For someone wanting to have a new kitchen fitted in their home, an extension built or windows replaced a figure of £10,000 or £12,000 would not be sufficient, especially if they want to replace carpets and curtains.  A more realistic figure would be £20,000 or £30,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin might remember that the Fianna Fáil Government of 1989 abolished house improvement grants, a decision which I hope will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>I see nothing wrong with credit unions owning their own property.  In my home town of Westport they bought two properties in not very good condition, complied with local authority regulations and converted them into two beautiful buildings which are a credit to them.  I see nothing wrong with credit unions being allowed to provide extra services for home <Col N="737" /> loans, insurance and foreign exchange since they would not really be competing with the banks. In certain locations where there are credit union offices there is no bank.  I think of places like Achill, Louisburg and Newport.  Credit unions should be provided with full facilities and allowed to compete.  The ultimate decision lies with the customer as to which of the two he or she prefers to deal with.</P>
      <P>I hope many of these points can be examined on Committee Stage.  I congratulate the Minister on having introduced this Bill.  I have no doubt that he will table necessary amendments on Committee Stage and that the League of Credit Unions will be satisfied with the outcome.</P>
      <P>It is great to see people involved in the credit union movement, providing such a valuable service for local communities.  We public representatives frequently meet people in financial difficulty. Thankfully people in the west are not as badly affected by money sharks.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations have worked closely with the credit unions.  The former has dealt with people experiencing financial difficulties and has introduced them to a local credit union, enabling them to obtain small loans, in addition to teaching them how to handle their finances, how to borrow and repay loans within their household budgets.  The banks are too large to cater for such people, they prefer to deal with more affluent customers or millionaires.  Many people have obtained credit union loans for the purchase of houses, cars, extensions to their homes or whatever and have repaid them.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that this work is carried out by local volunteers.  In the case of Westport I think of people like Liam Grant, Michael Gormley, Jackie Foley and Francis Geoghegan who devote so much time to assisting people to obtain loans whenever they need them.</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with affording credit unions the extra powers they seek.  Any bank that can make a profit of £420 million is more than able to charge its customers for the services it provides.  Credit unions would not be competing with the banks.  They are in a different league and have done a wonderful job for those in need of their services.  The Minister has gone 95 per cent of the way to meeting their requirements.  I see no reason for his not going the remaining 5 per cent.  I look forward to assisting him with amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Before becoming a public representative I had been a director on the board of a credit union in Raheny, now in my constituency.  I am particularly glad that this long promised Bill has been introduced. The purpose is to update the Credit Union Bill, 1966 and set out a framework for the future development of the credit union movement.  This is opportune and I congratulate the Minister on his initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> The credit union movement has progressed in leaps and bounds since 1966 to the extent that it is now timely to recognise that fact legislatively. In the Minister's introductory remarks on Second Stage, I was heartened to hear him say he intended safeguarding the principles of community and self-help, the underlying principles of the credit union movement, since it was that commitment and dedication on the part of the community which had been my experience within the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>Since 1958 credit unions, being non-sectarian, non-political organisations, have spread and operated on an all-island basis under the auspices of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The benefits of credit unions to the community are invaluable. In my constituency there are five, all very well organised, some with new buildings, incorporating modern, computerised systems enabling them to engage in modern financial transactions.</P>
    <P>It is within the area of home ownership, particularly in the city of Dublin, that the credit union movement has played its most important role.  For example, families who would not otherwise have been in a position to purchase a home have been assisted by credit unions to save the necessary deposit and provide essential financial advice.  In the case of many people a credit union was the only financial body to which they could turn. Other bodies like the banks, which operate purely on a profit basis, would not have dealt with these people in the same manner.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that within this State over the past 25 years &mdash; partly because of the activities of the Irish League of Credit Unions &mdash; a much larger percentage of our population is home-owning than is the case with most of our European partners, despite the fact that many of those countries have had a much higher <i>per capita</i> income than us in previous decades.  This high level of home ownership has relieved the State of the responsibility and cost of providing public sector social housing.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have played a significant role in allowing people to upgrade and refurbish their homes, construct extensions and so on.  For example, I dealt with a case in my constituency today of a low income family wanting to provide an extension for a handicapped child.  The shortfall between the disabled person's adaptation grant and other local authority financial supports was made good by a credit union loan without which such an extension could not have been provided.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister for Education extended the principle of free education to third level, the credit union movement played an invaluable role in helping to put working class students through third level education.  Sometimes the role of the credit union movement in this area has been overlooked because of the principle of confidentiality attached to their loans and transactions.  It is crucial that the future development of credit unions facilitates this activity.  The Bill will give an <Col N="739" /> impetus to the desire of credit unions to provide a much wider range of financial services.  This is a natural desire given the continued problems people experience in receiving fair treatment from some of our banks.  However, it is essential that this development does not cut across the central principles of the credit union movement, which are the needs of the community and the provision of self-help.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of months the credit union movement has brought to our attention a number of its concerns about the Bill.  The Irish League of Credit Unions made a submission to a special meeting of the parliamentary Labour Party and we were impressed by the strength and conviction of its arguments.  The Minister addressed a number of those points in his initial contribution.  I understand some of the Minister's concerns about the maximum size of credit union shares and I welcome his commitment to ensuring that this keeps pace with changing times, inflation and the value of money.  He also said that some people might use credit union savings to avoid tax liability, etc. and that possibility would also concern credit unions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure the movement's evolving role in the housing sector is continued and in that light I also ask him to consider the Irish League of Credit Unions' concerns about section 41.  Many credit unions have helped housing co-operatives and local initiative to develop and expand.  The reference to property in section 41 should not restrict this important activity and I hope this matter will be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>From experience I know the important back-up and regulatory function played within the credit union movement by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  When I was a director, the league played an important role in carrying out audits and assisting individual credit unions which had difficulties. The Minister is correct to put these functions on a statutory basis through the institution of a regulator.  As the number of credit unions increases &mdash; I am sure they will continue to do so &mdash; it is important that the public be fully aware that regulations are in place.  However, the Irish League of Credit Unions should not go out of existence as a result.  I accept the Minister's point that the use of the term &ldquo;credit union&rdquo; should be limited to legitimate and recognised credit unions operating under the control of the registrar but I ask him to examine ways in which the Irish League of Credit Unions can be facilitated.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill, which is another example of good legislation initiated by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This important Bill has generated considerable interest, particularly among members, volunteers and officers of credit unions.  It had a long gestation period and considerable input was made by the credit union movement, other bodies and groups, the Registrar <Col N="740" /> of Friendly Societies and successive Governments. It stemmed from the belief that it was necessary to establish credit unions on a modern, statutory footing.  In that context it is somewhat surprising that the Bill has generated considerable opposition and concern from the credit union movement, not least as regards the sections dealing with caps on shares, deposits, savings and loans, the degree of regulation and the powers of the registrar to regulate the affairs of the credit union movement in the provision of additional services and its affairs generally.</P>
      <P>It is widely agreed in the House that the credit union movement has been one of the most important agents for social progression and change.  We can all point to our own communities; in Turner's Cross, Ballyphehane, Greenmount and The Lough, the credit union was perhaps the most radical mechanism for social progress and change.  If it were not for credit unions, many people would not have been able to avail as successfully as they did of the improved economic conditions in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s.  Many house extensions were built and, as Deputy Kenny said, many people were able to pursue further education because of the availability of credit union finance.  In my household during the period when I grew up, the credit union movement played a fundamental part in our improved living conditions, comfort and access to education.  It provided people with a legitimate, safe and appropriate mechanism for obtaining loans for a variety of reasons &mdash; Christmas, Easter, buying new clothes at the start of the school year, etc.</P>
      <P>Credit unions also prevented many people becoming victims of loan sharks and moneylenders. The phenomenon of moneylending grew dramatically in the 1980s although it existed long before that.  In Cork we were aware of increased illegal moneylending and other less than desirable activities.  The credit union movement in Cork intervened extremely effectively through the work of Mr. Brendan Roche of The Lough Credit Union and others.  Together with the Department of Social Welfare they developed new schemes to enable people to avoid or escape the clutches of illegal moneylenders and develop a regime whereby, although they are on low incomes, they can meet their outstanding debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members of the House wish to create a legal framework which will enable the credit union movement to develop and grow.  The Bill introduces some restrictions and I have read the Minister's justification for these limits.  The banks and building societies are nervous about facilitating the growth of the credit union movement.  As Deputy O'Keeffe said, the legislation has a banking ethos but one trusts that this Democratic Left Minister was not overly influenced by the banking and building sectors in framing the legislation and impositing caps.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today, he said the new role of the left was to curb the untrammelled momentum of the marketplace but that does not appear to be happening.  From a left <Col N="741" /> wing perspective one would have expected a Bill more favourable to the credit union movement, given its position in Irish society and its contribution to uplifting and improving the lot of working people and families on low incomes.  The Bill is not favourably weighted in support of the movement.  The banks and building societies are breathing sighs of relief at the publication of the Bill and the limited nature and scope offered to the credit union movement to develop and attract new members with reasonable incomes which they could deposit or invest in credit union shares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I argue to the contrary.  The other alternative is, having read the Minister of State's Second Stage speech, that the Department of Finance won the day.  There is no rationale behind the limits and caps in the Minister of State's speech so I suspect the Department of Finance's conservative approach, that tax foregone is tax lost, won out.  The argument advanced is that simply because they favour the tax regime credit unions enjoy, one must be careful about allowing people to deposit too much in credit unions or to have too much savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument is not a strong one, given the limits imposed.  The limitation put forward is £20,000 but one could go to £40,000 or £50,000.  If one went as far as £60,000 one is not opening the door to massive tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>How far would Deputy Martin go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's argument is that the fundamental basis for the limitation is tax avoidance.  Corporation tax and DIRT were mentioned by the Minister of State, who went on to say that it is necessary to ensure that credit unions are not used as <i>de facto</i> tax avoidance schemes by unscrupulous individuals with significant personal wealth.</P>
      <P>That viewpoint, which I suspect is that of the Department of Finance, has won the day on limitations. The limit is far too low.  Government speakers have given examples where £20,000 would be in no way sufficient for people halfway through a mortgage, for example, if they wanted to finish it.  Many people with Housing Finance Agency loans are still paying up to 12 per cent interest on their house loans.  I recently met a man who borrowed a significant amount of money ten years ago and is still paying back the same amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shared ownership loans are now available through local authorities.  In five or ten years somebody may want to buy out their 50 per cent share in a house and a credit union might be their <Col N="742" /> only option.  It could cost more than £20,000 to buy out that remaining share.</P>
    <P>For many people in the low to middle income groups, the credit union provides a safe way for borrowing and the psychological impact of that is very important.  Local authorities have surrendered a significant amount of the market in loans and the banks and building societies are doing quite well.  We all know people on low incomes who come to our clinics and who have a deep fear of going to a bank or a building society for a house loan.  Their incomes are low and they fear that if they get into difficulty they will be evicted and their house repossessed.  People with shared ownership loans are on low incomes and on the housing list.  Their situation may improve and they might borrow a significant amount to buy out the remaining share.  Credit unions have a useful role in that area.</P>
    <P>The cost of adapting homes for disabled or elderly people has been going through the roof recently.  The £8,000 grant now goes nowhere near meeting the cost of the extensions.  In some cases, because somebody must put in a bathroom or a downstairs bedroom, further work such as the provision of a new kitchen may be necessary. The cost can rise to £25,000 or £30,000 even though the object of the exercise is to install the kitchen and bathroom.  The local authority can only fund the aspect of the extension that deals with the needs of the individual for whom the grant was applied.  People often have to make up the difference.  The £20,000 loan amount is very low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can make an order to raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Its floor area should be increased now rather than returning to it year after year. The arguments on that are unconvincing.</P>
      <P>We must be careful of the regulatory framework we put in place.  This is a volunteer movement and more than 10,000 people are involved in credit unions.  Left-wing parties love regulation but provide very little resources to see they are implemented.  For example, there is a current craze for regulation in education but we will kill the voluntary impulse if we overregulate.  People will get fed up and not volunteer.  We will not give credit unions the resources to meet these regulations, as invariably happens.  This House passes laws and regulations for all and sundry, placing obligations on credit unions in this case.  We are very slow to match regulations with the necessary resources to meet them satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, it is unnecessary that the Registrar should have to satisfy himself as to the capability of the credit unions to introduce new services. The credit union movement has survived and progressed very well.  Do we not trust people's capacity to judge the feasibility of new services any more?  We are saying we do not with this legislation.  It suggests that we want a &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; to decide, despite the fact that the <Col N="743" /> Registrar is probably not familiar with existing obligations for a range of organisations.  There is already a considerable backlog of cases in the Registrar's office and this legislation will add more.  There is no guarantee that people will respond within a reasonable length of time.  I have reservations about the new powers this Bill grants the Registrar.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful not to destroy the voluntary concept of credit unions.  The credit union movement was built on self-reliance and a strong sense of community.  It is a co-operative movement and people should be given a certain amount of freedom.  It is not a person's full-time job but something they are contributing to society.  It develops spirit and cohesion in the community and if one brings in a framework that is too regulatory it is destroyed, because people are offended by too much intrusion by the State. I agree with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's remarks on the State going overboard with regulations recently.</P>
    <P>On savings, the Minister of State might give more details of the amount of tax benefit a person might gain by depositing £40,000 in a credit union.  It would benefit credit unions to some extent to have customers who might want to invest in the community through the credit union. There could be small builders or publicans who want to help the community through deposits in the credit union.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have played a leading role in trying to lift some areas designated as disadvantaged under the PESP.  Many sporting, social and cultural groups have benefited from seed capital from the credit union movement and from a general involvement in it.  For example, many credit unions have dramatically improved their own premises and the north side of Cork has seen reinvestment in the community through a variety of forms.</P>
    <P>The limit on savings must be increased.  What is involved here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Either 26 per cent or 48 per cent with regard to interest, depending on whether one is on the marginal rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of balancing what is more important in the overall context, I am not sure tax foregone would be phenomenal if we increased the limits to a reasonably significant extent.  We would not lose that much in terms of tax revenue, despite the concerns by the Department of Finance.  The same concerns apply to designated areas.</P>

An opportunity will be presented on Committee Stage to improve the Bill and reflect the concerns of those involved in the movement.</P>
      <P>The proposed regulatory regime needs to be considerably diluted.  We must respect the relative autonomy which credit unions have enjoyed over the years and allow a proper and flexible framework within which they can develop.  We must also allow for the introduction of new services without undue regulation and without waiting for the registrar to make a decision on the capacity of the movement in this regard.  In addition, the limitations on loans, shares and deposits must be increased and we must allow the movement develop and grow and give the public continued opportunities to progress socially and improve their standard of living.</P>
      <P>We owe a great debt of service to the credit union movement.  The legislators and the State can often move too quickly to build on such a movement that has been built from the ground up with considerable voluntary effort.  We could kill the goose that lays the golden egg by being too intrusive and by interfering too much in its day to day internal operations.  We must be careful not to do this and to respect the fact that so many people are involved on a voluntary basis. We must also respect their opinions and reflect them in the legislation we eventually pass.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am proud to have a close relationship with the credit union movement.  I thank the Minister of State for a remarkably good job on this complex legislation. It is a great step forward, although there <Col N="745" /> are some aspects I wish to see changed.  Many people in the credit union movement have sought legislation such as this for the best part of 25 years.  There was little movement on anything to do with the movement since I was first elected to this House and I am grateful, therefore, to the Minister of State for the time and effort he has put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>No movement other than the credit union movement has offered a financial helping hand to so many people who could not have got it from any other source.  The ethos of the movement is self help and self regulation.  It has attracted members from all strata of Irish life.  There are 522 credit unions throughout the country.  They are to be seen in town and country, in the small rural areas and in the biggest centres of population. The growth in credit unions reminds me of the big growth in the co-operative movement under the great Sir Horace Plunkett at the beginning of the century.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement has reason to be proud of its achievements today.  Working quietly at local level and unnoticed in high financial circles, it is a beacon to community development because it espouses the principle of co-operation and dedication and the mutual understanding of and interdependence of all people.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of credit unions is that they are non profit making and are strictly self regulated.  Each of the country's 522 credit unions act separately but all are bonded by the same regulatory system.  No other organisation with more than one million members can manage its affairs so astutely, wisely and with such transparency. I know of no hint of scandals, double dealing or fraudulent activities.  Given the almost £700 million in share holdings, this is nothing short of a miracle.</P>
      <P>The credit unions are run by ordinary, decent people who see the necessity to provide a badly needed service for their communities.  When trained in credit union management, they deliver an excellent financial service to people, many of whom would not be welcomed elsewhere.  It is a training that is of great importance to the movement and many hundreds of people give generously of their time.</P>
      <P>However, the most enduring principle of any credit union is its ability to train its members in saving for whatever purchase they may require, whether it is a first holy communion dress, a holiday, a car, a new carpet or bathroom, a new tractor or new livestock.  Members will not get a loan unless they have a certain amount of capital in shares.  Many members of the public who are not members of credit unions do not realise that it encourages families to save first and purchase afterwards.  This central concept encourages thrift and discipline, characteristics that enable the credit unions to grant loans to their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision to extent the duration of the loans.  It was badly needed because the five year duration was too short.  Since it has been <Col N="746" /> extended it is a bonus which the league of credit unions wanted for some time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret it is necessary to take up the time of the House on an issue that should not have to come before the House &mdash; that is, the most unsatisfactory position of Irish missionaries particularly in African countries over many years. We are proud to be associated with the tremendous commitment of Irish missionary efforts.  As one who has had two uncles in the Irish Christian Brothers who taught in South America I had the opportunity to visit the area and see some of the work.  Also in a number of African countries I witnessed the commitment, dedication and vocation of these men and women to teaching those in need of their services.</P>
      <P>After giving a life's commitment to that work they cannot obtain their full entitlements under the pension scheme, despite their understandable belief that this would not be the situation.  It is unacceptable that, for a small number of dedicated Irish teachers who went abroad and gave of their time in underdeveloped countries in Africa, there is a threat to their full pension entitlements. I hope the Minister will inform the House that the matter will be fully addressed and that these missionary teachers will not be at a disadvantage. They risked life and limb and the potential of contracting various tropical diseases was enormous. This is deplorable.  In terms of costs it is not a matter of any great significance.</P>
      <P>What action is proposed?  There is incremental salary recognition for these teachers but they wish to purchase back pension rights, under a special scheme where a 6.5 per cent rate has been established.  To facilitate those who remained teaching in Ireland at the time and who had not joined a voluntary pension scheme, there will be no pensionable recognition from the African Government.  Based on the information that has come to hand these teachers should be given the opportunity to purchase those years for pension purposes at the same favourable rate.  I sincerely hope the Minister can give a commitment to address this human and unacceptable anomaly which has arisen for those who have served in difficult circumstances and would be justified in receiving the full pension entitlement.  I trust the Minister will give full recognition for that period and that the teachers' pension rights will be fully honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend teachers and others who have devoted some of their working lives to service in underdeveloped countries.  This invaluable service <Col N="747" /> makes an outstanding contribution to the welfare of people in less well off nations.</P>
      <P>The matter of incremental credit for teaching service abroad and relevant non-teaching experience has been the subject of discussion at the conciliation council for teachers on a number of occasions over the years.  Agreed Report No. 9/79 provided that incremental credit be allowed in respect of approved teaching experience abroad up to a maximum of five years subject to a maximum of four years in respect of service given prior to 1 June 1979.  This provision applies to all whole-time permanent teachers in primary, secondary, community, comprehensive and vocational schools.</P>
      <P>The matter was raised subsequently and these discussions led to Agreed Report No. 4/85 which provided that incremental credit be allowed for approved teaching service abroad up to a maximum of seven years subject to a maximum of four years in respect of service given prior to 1 June 1979.  There is provision also for the award of incremental credit in respect of non-teaching experience, up to a maximum of five years' credit. In the event of a teacher claiming credit for a combination of teaching service and relevant non-teaching experience, the maximum credit which may be awarded for incremental credit purposes is seven years.  The teachers concerned should apply to the Department of Education for the appropriate incremental credit if they have not done so already.  Teachers in vocational schools should apply to the appropriate vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>The superannuation of all primary and secondary teachers is regulated under the Teachers Superannuation Act, 1928.  As a result of this Act, separate statutory schemes were made for both sectors.  Both principal schemes, and their subsequent amendments, set out the basis for the qualification, award, calculation and payment of pension and put in statute form some general administrative arrangements to this end.  Under the terms of these schemes, there is no provision to make pensionable any teaching service given outside the State.  Such a policy would not be confined to superannuation schemes under the control of the Department as it would form part of an overall public sector policy on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a standard feature of public service superannuation that service purchased must be paid for in full.  In this context there are two options available to teachers who may wish to improve their level of pensionable service: a scheme for the purchase of notional service which is operated by the Department &mdash; this allows teachers to voluntarily purchase additional years for calculation of superannuation benefits &mdash; and superannuation arrangements for public service volunteers with the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO.  Approval for this arrangement was given by the Department of Finance to allow APSO, subject to certain conditions, to purchase the period <Col N="748" /> of volunteer service given after 1 January 1995.</P>
    <P>In the case of the first option, it would be open to any member of the appropriate scheme to apply for the purchase of notional service.  This would include the group of teachers to whom the Deputy's request relates.  I wonder if the Deputy is confusing this matter with a recent proposal made in the context of negotiations with the teacher unions on their PCW claims.  The revised proposals for agreement on the pay and conditions of teachers under clause 2(iii) of annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> include a proposal for the purchase for superannuation purposes of incremental service given by teachers when they were eligible to join the secondary teachers superannuation scheme but did not do so.  The proposals provides for the purchase of such service at the normal contribution rate of 6.5 per cent &mdash; 5 per cent for teachers who are not members of the spouses scheme.  That proposal is confined to actual incremental service given in secondary schools and would not apply to the purchase for superannuation purposes of any other service.</P>
    <P>There is no threat to the present incremental or pension entitlements of teachers who gave voluntary service abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I first requested permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment three weeks ago following a telephone call from a teacher in my constituency who was concerned about her cohort of leaving certificate applied students who had been informed, with little or no notice, that the first tranche of their assessments and examinations were being postponed.  The dispute between the Department of Education and the examiners has affected approximately 3,000 students who were to sit this experimental examination.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate applied is a new course for less academic students.  It is designed to ensure that they leave a school with certification and additional skills which they would not obtain under the ordinary leaving certificate course. These examinations are part of their ongoing assessment, on which approximately 50 per cent of their final marks are based.  They were supposed to present their projects this week, after which they would have an oral examination for which additional marks would be granted.  Those of us who face an indefinite future understand how these students feel, having geared themselves to sit their examinations on a certain date only to have them postponed.  This has increased the stress on these students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It took a long time to introduce the leaving certificate applied course and we all welcome it as it will help to keep more second level students in school for longer.  The &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; interviewed impatient academic students who complained <Col N="749" /> about the time devoted to the leaving certificate applied course.  This is not unrelated to this crisis in that these assessments still have to be completed, thus making it difficult to ensure the proper organisation of the school programme and the preparation of students for other examinations.</P>
    <P>I appeal to both sides in the dispute to renew their efforts and to reach an agreement in the interests of these 3,000 students who I hoped would blaze a trail for others.  The postponement of these examinations has meant a poor start to what many had hoped would be a new opportunity for many students.  It is imperative that the dispute is resolved as quickly as possible and I hope the Minister of State will outline the steps which will be taken to achieve this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of regret to the Minister for Education that it has been necessary for the Department to postpone the assessment of taskwork in the case of leaving certificate applied students.  The leaving certificate applied is a new programme which was introduced to schools in 1995 and it is being followed by more than 3,500 students in 124 schools.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate applied programme consists of a range of courses, each designed on a modular basis.  A module generally represents a half year's work in one course.  Each year of the two-year programme is divided into sessions, September to January and February to June.  Student achievement and performance in the leaving certificate applied is recorded in three modes: performance in final examinations; satisfactory completion of modules and performance of taskwork. Assessment of taskwork takes place at the end of each session and is undertaken by visiting examiners appointed by the Department of Education. The examiners assess the work produced by students and interview them on the processes involved.</P>
      <P>The assessment scheduled for the week commencing 3 February last, following the September/January session, has been postponed. This arose after members of the Public Service Executive Union in the Department took industrial action in support of a staffing demand.  As a result of this action it was not possible to complete the required preparatory work to enable the assessment to proceed as scheduled.  A letter notifying schools and examiners of the need for the postponement was issued to school principals and examiners on 29 January last.  The Minister is very concerned at the decision of members of the Public Service Executive Union to take industrial action.  The Department is currently pursuing all options open to it in seeking a resolution to this difficult industrial relations problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to reschedule the assessment of taskwork at the earliest opportunity.  In this context the Department is aware of, and regrets, the disruption which the postponement of the assessments has caused to schools, students and examiners. The Minister is aware that some schools are <Col N="750" /> currently taking their mid-term break and that many have made arrangements for students to take work experience over the next few weeks. Arrangements for the rescheduling of the assessments will be undertaken in a flexible manner following consultation with the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Every consideration will be given to ensure that the delay caused by this industrial relations dispute will not adversely affect the results achieved by candidates for their work.  I wish to restate the strong commitment of the Department of Education to the leaving certificate applied programme.  This commitment was recently given tangible expression in the announcement of new capital grants for schools offering the programme.  The Department is making ongoing and sustained efforts with the full support and assistance of all the education partners to establish this programme on a sound footing and to achieve full recognition of its worth in the world of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment.  There is much concern in County Clare about the lack of remedial school teachers and the failure to appoint even one remedial teacher last year.  Of the 346 teachers available for redeployment, 170 were utilised in the implementation of the Breaking the Cycle scheme which is ineffective in rural areas.</P>
      <P>When dealing with the issue of remedial teaching, one must look at the definition of the word &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo; which has one meaning in an urban area but a different meaning in a rural area.  The disadvantage in rural areas may relate not to socio-economic issues but to learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>We all realise the need for remedial teaching. It is not just the educational benefits which accrue from such remedial help; the psychological and emotional benefits are incalculable with the raising of self-esteem and the general confidence which accrues to pupils who are given the little extra help they need and which teachers, given the circumstances they have to face in the classroom, are unable to give due to the many other pressures on their time.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to recognise the tremendous standard of teaching in this country.  Teachers would be the first to say they wish to see a proper remedial system to aid the kind of work they wish to do and the even higher standards they wish their students to achieve.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that rural schools are the basis of any community.  We are talking here about a very fundamental element in keeping a community together.  If we are not prepared to look at remedial teaching, and any other education resource which is necessary for small schools, we are doing a whole generation a very great disservice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> I was at a meeting in County Clare last night at which six schools were represented &mdash; Ogonaloe, Broadford, Kilbane, Bodyke, O'Callaghan's Mills and Tuamgraney national schools.  The meeting was very well attended, not only by public representatives of all shades of political opinion, but also by parents and teachers.  The one thread running through the meeting was that they felt they were being discriminated against because they were rural schools in that their children were not being given the same opportunities as children in urban centres.</P>
    <P>I realise the importance of remedial teaching and I hope the situation in Clare is immediately addressed by the Minister for Education.  Her recognition that Clare is one of the worst in terms of a lack of remedial teaching would be of help in the sense that once the situation is recognised we can begin to address it.</P>
    <P>Out of 124 primary schools in County Clare, 57 have no remedial service.  The Minister may argue that a remedial teacher can service a number of schools but we recognise that the ideal is to have a remedial teacher in each school.  However, we must be practical and acknowledge that there must be a transitional period during which the schools I mentioned would have the services of one remedial teacher to begin with, and the need for further remedial teachers to deal with this great problem in the county would be recognised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have every reason to be proud of our education system but we must put an emphasis on primary education.  We all want to see improvements at second and third levels but the greatest emphasis must be on primary education because that not only gives young people an opportunity to develop educationally but also emotionally and psychologically, and it gives them the opportunity to be better citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education is not in a position at present to make remedial teacher posts available to the primary school sector. As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter, in the first instance, for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1995, an additional 55 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 223 schools benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,188.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,285 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> At this stage, 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher.  This is a big improvement on the position when the Minister for Education took office in 1993, when 77 per cent of pupils had the possibility of such access.  It is a matter of regret to the Minister that it is not possible at present to meet the needs of all pupils for remedial teaching as, unfortunately, she does not have unlimited resources.</P>
    <P>Of the 122 ordinary national schools in County Clare, 63, with an enrolment of 8,941 pupils on 30 September 1995, have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis, available to them.  This includes five schools allocated a remedial service with effect from the commencement of the 1995-6 school year as part of the distribution of 55 posts.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of information from the schools by the Department's primary inspectorate, and having consideration to data submitted by schools.  This means that 73 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Clare currently enjoy access to a remedial service.</P>
    <P>It is important that such a substantial resource should be used to best effect and deployed in line with evolving need.  The Minister considers it is now appropriate to carry out a review of all these posts to ensure they are being used in the most efficient and effective manner.  Remedial teachers are allocated to schools to enable them to reduce the numbers of those pupils who might have difficulties in learning literacy and mathematical skills and to support schools in teaching those who experience serious problems in acquiring these skills.  Research, for example the IEA English Reading Survey 1993, indicates that between 6.5 per cent and 9 per cent of pupils at 11 years of age, or fifth class, and at 14 years of age have serious learning problems in those areas.  The focus of the remedial teachers' work should be on those pupils who have the greatest needs, both in terms of prevention and remediation.</P>
    <P>An initial survey carried out by the Department's inspectorate in 1995 has raised concerns that some pupils may be receiving remedial teaching who do not need it.  This suggests there needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring that the service is targeted at those who need it most.  The key target group would be the lowest functioning 10 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>The survey has demonstrated there is a serious need to ensure the existing provision is correctly targeted.  There is a need to place much greater emphasis on preventative strategies in schools. There is a need to focus on early identification strategies and differentiated teaching.</P>
    <P>The Department has arranged, in consultation with the education partners, to commence a comprehensive remedial education study in 1997.  The study will survey principal teachers and remedial teachers focusing on the number of pupils attending remedial classes; the criteria for <Col N="753" /> inclusion in, and withdrawal from, remedial classes; the organisation of remedial teaching in schools; the development and implementation of policy on remedial teaching in schools; record keeping and reporting.  The study will review the instructional programmes of pupils in remedial classes, examine the progress made by pupils receiving remedial teaching and analyse data on remedial education participation.</P>
    <P>The Minister regards this study, which it is hoped to have completed by the end of 1997, as an enormously important step in basing future advances in the remedial service on up to date research, knowledge of precisely how the current remedial provision operates and knowledge of precisely what progress has been made by pupils. This research, to be conducted by the Education Research Centre in co-operation with the partners in education, will inform further advances in remedial provision throughout our schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has indicated to the House her intention to review the needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources.  When she is in a position to further extend the remediation service, all national schools in County Clare which have applied for a remedial service will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, as deis a thabhairt dom an cheist seo maidir le múinteoirí sa choláiste réigiúnda i gCeatharlach nach bhfuil postanna buan acu, a árdú.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister for Education aware that some members of the teaching staff at Carlow Regional Technical College, who previously had extended part-time and temporary whole-time teacher contracts, have not had those contracts renewed for this academic year?  They are now being paid at part-time hourly rates resulting in a virtual halving of their monthly income which, for some reason, is paid two months in arrears.</P>
      <P>Failure to renew their contracts has meant the loss of holiday and sick pay in addition to all the entitlements of a staff member in a permanent post.  To qualify for extended part-time and temporary whole-time contracts in regional technical colleges, teachers must have an honours degree and three years' post-degree experience. Teachers on these contracts are paid at the first salary scale which may be incremental.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister in reply to confirm whether a case brought in the Dublin Institute of Technology some years ago established continuity or rollover of contracts from one year to the next as long as the contract holder was doing a satisfactory job and the teaching subjects and hours covered were available, that is, not covered by a new permanent person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of Carlow regional technical <Col N="754" /> college and the Department of Education have so far failed in this academic year to renew the contracts of a number of teachers at the school who are continuing to do all their normal teaching duties but who are now only paid as part-time members of the staff at a part-time hourly rate of £22 per hour for hours taught.  I understand these teachers can be let go at one day's notice.</P>
    <P>There has been a new trend in some of the regional technical colleges in recent years to give seven hours part-time teaching or less to teachers, thus excluding them from the rights of part-time workers under the labour Acts which require eight or more hours to establish legal rights to certain conditions.  In Carlow regional technical college approximately 25 teachers are caught by the non-renewal of extended part-time and temporary whole-time teacher contracts or by failure to get this contract for the first time this year. Some of those teachers have had their annual salary reduced from £25,000 per annum to the part-time teacher hourly rate which will, at most, give them £10,560 per year on the basis of 16 hours teaching for 30 teaching weeks at the rate of £22 per hour.</P>
    <P>I do not have to elaborate further to explain to the Minister how unfair and unjust this is for the individuals involved.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise the right of continuity or rollover of contracts and to bring to an immediate end the disgraceful treatment of some of the staff at Carlow regional technical college.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter and for the opportunity it affords me to clarify the position.  I must point out initially that the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, states that &ldquo;a college may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers (in addition to the Director and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, the Governing Body from time to time thinks proper&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the function of the Minister for Education in relation to the staffing of the colleges is to sanction a quota of posts for each institution. The arrangements for the filling of vacant posts within the overall quota of sanctioned posts and sanctioned levels are generally a matter for college management.  In a letter to the director of Carlow regional technical college on 13 August 1996, his attention was drawn to the fact that sanction for the creation of posts is a matter exclusively for the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  It was also pointed out that the college would need to continue to seek departmental sanction for the creation of new and additional posts, whether permanent or temporary, or any upgrading to posts already sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department had sanctioned a quota of posts for the college which was increased over the years to take account of increased student numbers and various other relevant circumstances. The Deputy will be aware there are constraints <Col N="755" /> on numbers employed in the public service generally and it is incumbent on college management to be aware of these constraints and to have regard to them when making demands on the Department for increased staffing numbers.</P>
    <P>Demands from all institutions, at all levels of education, invariably exceed the resources available to the Department.  Consequently the allocation of resources is based on the priorities identified in consultation with the colleges.  Following this it is the responsibility of local management to manage their institution and to make appropriate appointments within the quotas allocated by the Department.</P>
    <P>For the academic year 1995-6, the Department sanctioned a total of ten additional permanent staff for Carlow regional technical college at lecturer 1 level.  This additional allocation was granted to take account of increased student numbers and to help the college reduce its dependency on part-time staff.  A case had been made by the college management to the Department about the difficulties it had encountered in finding suitable part-time lecturers and this difficulty was taken into account.  As there were severe restrictions on additional staff numbers being recruited in the public service at this juncture, it is clear that the Department in its dealings with Carlow regional technical college was being generous in its allocation of ten extra posts.</P>
    <P>Subsequently it transpired that there was a need to sanction an additional three posts at lecturer 1 level in Carlow regional technical college to regularise appointments that had been made by the college.  Consequently a total of 13 additional posts at lecturer level were added to the quota of sanctioned academic posts for Carlow regional technical college between September 1995 and September 1996.</P>
    <P>However, following discussions with the management of Carlow regional technical college regarding its quota of sanctioned posts in the context of ongoing monitoring of staffing in the sector generally, the college sought sanction for an additional number of temporary academic posts, i.e., 29 lecturer 1 posts and five EPT posts, in addition to a large number of part-time lecturers. <Col N="756" /> To evaluate the claim for such a large number of extra posts the college was asked to submit a detailed analysis of its needs supported by a comprehensive report to justify the demand.</P>
    <P>Following extensive correspondence and a number of meetings with the college authorities it was eventually confirmed by the college that the academic staffing in the 1994-5 and 1995-6 academic years exceeded the levels sanctioned by the Department.  Notwithstanding the explanations given by the college the Department considered the position that had arisen extremely unsatisfactory and of grave concern.  However, in view of the need to protect the interests of the students and to ensure the smooth running of the college it was decided, as an exceptional measure, to sanction the actual whole-time equivalent staff numbers in place in the academic year 1995-6. This sanction comprises the existing approved posts and a further 46 whole-time equivalent posts.</P>
    <P>These arrangements are approved for the current academic year only and will be subject to review in the context of the programme for 1997-8 and the budget for 1997 to be submitted by the college for approval shortly.  The college has been directed that any contracts entered into by college management in respect of the additional posts must have regard to the above conditions.</P>
    <P>The director of the college was asked on 19 February 1997 to submit for the approval of the Department proposals for the filling of the 46 whole-time equivalent posts.  Proposals have not as yet been received.  The position, therefore, is that college management is responsible, in accordance with its duties under the regional technical college Act, 1992, for deciding how the sanctioned posts are to be filled and for entering into appropriate contracts with the staff appointed.  As I indicated at the outset, the Department is not directly involved in contractual arrangements between the college and its staff. Accordingly it is a matter for the college as the employer to deal with any complaints of staff with regard to their contracts of employment.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 February 1997.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 5 November 1996 to offer State financial assistance and other support to the County Louth residents taking court action against BNFL.  The assistance applies to specific items of scientific investigation, research and other work to be identified.  The Government also decided to seek agreement for the removal of the State as a defendant from the action being pursued by the residents.</P>
      <P>Details of the decision were subsequently conveyed to the Louth residents at a meeting with members of the Ministerial Committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea.  Matters discussed included access to scientific reports and other relevant documents held by Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) and identification of other possible areas of support. The residents were invited to explore possibilities in this regard and to submit proposals for consideration. These are awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on documentation held by the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications, Environment, Health and the Marine and the RPII has been made available to the Louth residents, as well as copies or summaries of many of the documents concerned.  Other documents which the residents may regard as relevant to the preparation of their case can be supplied on request.  In addition, the Department of Health has offered to make medical and statistical experts available for a meeting to assist the <Col N="758" /> residents with the interpretation of health related data.</P>

In addition, it is proposed to identify a range of financial performance indicators against which local authorities will be required to measure their performance and publish the results; the purpose will be to identify best practice and encourage individual local authorities to improve their performance levels.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated previously in the House, my Department is preparing a series of guidelines on land use policy issues for local planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála.  Guidelines on telecommunications antennae and support structures and wind farm development have already been published.  Draft consultation guidelines on forestry development were published and issued to a wide range of interested parties on 10 January last and comments were invited by 12 March.  The guidelines, in final form, will issue as soon as possible thereafter when the comments received have been considered.  Guidelines on high amenity landscapes and on the scope and content of development plans are being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Priorities for further land use planning guidelines are being considered in the context of the national sustainable development strategy which is currently in its final stage of preparation in the <Col N="759" /> Department.  Taken together, the strategy and the guidelines will provide a comprehensive policy framework for land use planning.</P>
    <P>While it is not proposed, at present, to prepare planning guidelines specifically in relation to landfill sites, the Environmental Protection Agency are in the process of preparing a manual on landfill site selection in accordance with section 62 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  Also, under section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, local authorities are obliged, as part of their waste management plans, to address the selection of sites for the recovery or disposal of waste.</P>

      <P>No guidelines have been issued to planning authorities regarding the issues to be considered when dealing with planning applications in respect of child care facilities.  The consideration of individual planning applications is a matter for the planning authority concerned, in the first instance, or An Bord Pleanála on appeal.</P>
      <P>Arising from the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, my Department asked each local authority in January 1994 to reexamine their existing practices in relation to creches and child care facilities to ensure that they were in keeping with the findings of the report to the fullest extent possible.  The authorities were reminded of the importance of the development plan as a mechanism for setting out a blueprint for the development of residential areas, and all of the associated infrastructure and servicing, to meet the local community's development needs, including the particular needs of women, as identified in the report.  In the more recently adopted development plans there is evidence that planning authorities are now making provision in relation to creches in specified areas.</P>

      <P>The Government is maintaining its opposition to the NIREX proposal for a rock characterisation facility near Sellafield and will continue to avail of every opportunity to advance this case.</P>
      <P>A number of scientific reports on the proposal, which have recently become generally available, serve to endorse the basis for the Government's opposition as presented in January 1996 to the UK public inquiry on the matter.  In the light of these developments, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has written to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment reiterating the Government's position and urging him to refuse the NIREX appeal against the rejection of the planning application by Cumbria County Council. The Minister of State proposed that, at the very least, the public inquiry should be reopened so that all relevant scientific and geological data could be properly assessed.</P>
      <P>The Secretary of State has responded to these and other expressions of concern by providing a further consultation period for the purpose of receiving submissions on the scientific reports and other documentation that have recently become available.  The ministerial committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea reviewed these developments at its meeting on 11 February and decided that a further submission would be made on behalf of the Government to the Secretary of State.  The preparation of the submission is now well advanced.</P>

      <P>The erection of telecommunications masts requires planning permission.  Decisions to grant or to refuse to grant planning permission for such developments are matters in the first instance for the relevant planning authority and for An Bord Pleanála in the event of an appeal.</P>
      <P>Conscious of the anticipated growth in the number of communication masts, my Department issued guidelines in July 1996 on the planning issues arising in connection with these masts, including guidance in relation to the location of masts in urban and residential areas.  A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The guidelines indicate, <i>inter alia,</i> that only as a last resort should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or in the immediate surrounds of smaller towns and villages.  The guidelines also emphasise co-location of antennae by mobile phone operators as a key measure to avoid the unnecessary proliferation of masts.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 1997, which came into operation on 13 February, give statutory support to this policy of co-location.</P>

      <P>According to census returns, some 129,000 homes are served by private individual water supplies. To cater, among other things, for these, I am committed to continuing and expanding the programme for the supply of piped water to rural areas by way of new group and public water supply projects.  Expenditure on capital grants for group water schemes has already been increased from £3.4 million in 1994 to £6.6 million in 1996. This year, a total of £11 million, including the special provision of £5 million for upgrading, is being made available for such schemes.  Last week, I announced a total capital investment programme of over £150 million for water and sewerage schemes in 1997, the largest annual programme ever undertaken in the history of the State.  This underlines the Government's continued commitment to improving this element of the country's urban and rural infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The issues arising in relation to the provision of a quality water supply to households in rural areas not connected directly or indirectly to a local authority supply are highly complex and require careful study.  I have listened to the broad range of views presented to me in recent days by the IFA, the ICMSA and the Federation of Group Water Schemes, as well as other groups and individuals from around the country.  I will be considering all of the points raised when developing proposals for a properly planned approach to the development and operation of rural water supplies, and I will be reporting to the Government on the matter in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The successful development of waste recycling will depend to a significant extent on the development of more extensive and stable markets for recyclable materials.  At my initiative, this issue was discussed at the Informal Council of EU Environment Ministers in July 1996, where there was agreement on the need for consideration to be given to measures which will encourage more stable and adequate markets for recyclables.  The Environment Council has since formally requested the Commission and member states to take concrete action with a view to promoting markets for recycled goods.</P>
      <P>The development of enterprises which use recycled materials will be supported by the regulations which I published recently in draft in relation to packaging waste.  The regulations will place obligations on suppliers of packaging and packaged goods to take measures to facilitate the collection and recovery of packaging waste and should serve to provide for more reliable supplies of good quality waste for recycling.</P>
      <P>An increased demand for recycled paper will also be supported in Ireland by the Green Government Guide circulated last year.  This initiative seeks to promote better environmental management by all Government bodies, with particular emphasis on the use of recycled materials and the recycling of wastes.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance is being provided by my Department by way of grants which are EU co-financed to support capital expenditure on the provision of infrastructure for waste recycling. Grants have recently been approved for a number of private sector projects, including facilities to deal with paper and plastic.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 72 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The new funding system, with its inbuilt buoyancy, will adequately provide for the expenditure needs of local authorities, now and in the future. A key component of the new arrangements is an equalisation system.  Local authorities will retain 80 per cent of the proceeds of motor tax on cars and motor cycles and contribute all other motor tax revenues to the equalisation fund.  In 1997, this fund will be used in the first instance to ensure that the income lost through the abolition of domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant is made good to each local authority.  The balance remaining will be allocated equitably among local authorities all of which will benefit.</P>
      <P>The only charges being abolished as part of the new funding system are those for domestic water and domestic sewerage services.  The powers of local authorities to charge for other services, including their powers under section 35 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, to charge for fire call outs, are not affected under the new arrangements. The increased level of funding and buoyancy of the new system should ensure that, not only will there be no detrimental impact on the fire service, but that local authorities will be enabled to improve the quality of their services generally, including the fire service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some local authorities have made submissions to my Department since I announced the new funding system seeking clarification on various issues relating to the new funding arrangements <Col N="768" /> or making representations in relation to the proposed equalisation fund.</P>

    <P>The Government's Famine Commemoration Committee has chosen a site for the national famine memorial at Murrisk in County Mayo.  The memorial itself will consist of a very fine and moving sculpture by John Behan entitled &ldquo;The Coffin Ship&rdquo; which will be unveiled on 20 July this year.  Having examined many sites suggested to us, we chose the beautiful setting of Murrisk and we feel that it is entirely fitting that the national famine memorial should be located in the west of Ireland, which suffered most during the Famine with one in four of the population of Connacht dying in those terrible years.</P>
    <P>The events which the Government propose to organise or contribute to include a major international conference on the Famine in Dublin Castle on 9 and 10 May; the Great Irish Famine Event; a set of stamps commemorating the Famine to issue in May; publication of an atlas of Famine sites of Ireland; publication of book of Irish Famine Manuscripts; an ecumenical service; <Col N="773" /> a photographic exhibition and continuing programme of support for the renovation of famine graveyards (e.g. Swinford).</P>

      <P>The policy of the European Union in respect of East Timor is based on the EU Common Position on East Timor which was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 25 June 1996.  In accordance with the Common Position, Ireland actively supports international efforts to promote respect for human rights in East Timor and to bring about a peaceful and just solution which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.  In regard to the question of arms supply for use in East Timor, our partners in the European Union are fully aware of the strength of international opinion with regard to the record of the Indonesian authorities in East Timor and to the grave concern which exists in relation to the supply of arms which could be used as instruments of oppression there.  One of the objectives of the Government, which fully shares this concern, is to stop the supply to Indonesia of arms that could be used as instruments of oppression in East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All EU member states accept common criteria on the export of arms which require, <i>inter alia</i>, that the respect of human rights in the country of final destination be taken into account.  Implementation of these criteria is at the national level. As regards a full embargo on Indonesia by EU member states, this, as the Deputy is aware, requires consensus within the EU.  While such a consensus may be difficult to achieve, I believe <Col N="774" /> that the question of an embargo should be kept under continuing review in the light of developments in East Timor.</P>

      <P>In so far as the outcome of the EUASEAN Ministerial Meeting held in Singapore on 13-14 February last is concerned, I would refer the Deputy to the joint declaration adopted by the meeting, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  At the meeting, Ministers had a productive and wide-ranging exchange of views on a number of political, security, economic and other issues.  The discussions took place in an atmosphere of mutual confidence and understanding, following the spirit of the previous meeting in Karlsruhe on 22-23 September 1994.  Ministers reiterated that ASEAN remains a cornerstone of the EU's dialogue with the Asia region.</P>
      <P>In relation to East Timor, it was agreed by EU Ministers that the Presidency, on behalf of the member states of the European Union, would raise this issue at the plenary session of the meeting and would draw attention, in particular, to the importance attached by the United Nations Secretary General to a new impulse for the discussions under his auspices between Indonesia and Portugal.  Ireland of course associated itself fully with this statement by the President of the Council.  The Deputy will be aware that the policy of the European Union is based on the EU Common Position on East Timor which was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 25 June 1996.  In accordance with the Common Position, Ireland actively supports international efforts to promote respect for human rights in East Timor and to bring about a peaceful and just solution there which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.</P>

      <P>The Government has sought to ensure that Ireland plays a significant role in promoting the welfare of children worldwide, to focus on <Col N="775" /> issues such as the condition of children in orphanages, and on child labour, land mines and child prostitution.  The Government is very concerned about the reports which it has received through the Embassy of Ireland in New Delhi and the appropriate international for a, including the EU and UN, in relation to the problems faced by the street children in India, including the alleged use of violence against them by the Indian police.</P>
      <P>Under the Government's Bilateral Aid Programme, the co-financing scheme with nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) provides grants for small to medium-sized projects in developing countries, which meet the basic needs of the poorest sections of the population.  Irish NGOs have received substantial funding under this scheme for street children projects in many parts of the world including India.  In recent years GOAL received grants in the amount of £207,420 towards its street children's programme in Calcutta. In 1995 a grant of £5,768 was awarded to a local NGO towards the provision of an ambulance for a mobile street children's medical rescue unit.  Projects providing non-formal education and training in income-generating activities to street children have also been supported under the scheme.  Both the EU and UN (UNICEF) are active in addressing the problems of street children in India and work with the Government of India and various NGOs on this issue.  I understand that funding has been set aside this year by the EU for a project to assist street children in Bombay.  The Embassy in New Delhi will continue to monitor closely the situation of street children in India.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and our EU partners are gravely concerned about the spreading military conflict in Eastern Zaire and the issue was discussed by the General Affairs Council at its meeting in Brussels yesterday.  The conflict is increasing political tensions and aggravating the acute humanitarian situation in Central Africa. Our current concerns have been clearly stated in the declaration made by the Presidency on behalf of the Union on 17 February which, <i>inter alia</i>, calls on the parties to the conflict in Eastern Zaire, including the Government side, to negotiate a ceasefire without delay and to facilitate access to the region for humanitarian organisations so that they can assist those in distress.  We have reiterated our full support for the mediation efforts of African leaders and unequivocally condemned <Col N="776" /> all interference in the conflict, calling for the withdrawal of all outside and mercenary forces. The concerns of the EU are also being made known directly to the Governments of Zaire and other countries of the Great Lakes Region by the Union's special envoy, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who has been engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts throughout the region since 29 January.</P>
      <P>In its Declaration of 17 February, the EU has based its call on all parties to seek a political solution to the problems of Zaire and of the Great Lakes Region on the following five principles: (a) respect for the territorial integrity, inviolability and security of the frontiers of Zaire and of the other countries in the region; (b) respect for the rights of citizens in accordance with internationally recognised principles and the relevant international legislation; (c) voluntary repatriation of refugees, affording them a genuine opportunity to return home without intimidation or risk to their safety on the journey or at destination, in compliance with humanitarian law; (d) compliance with the principle of non-aggression between states and restoration of good-neighbourly relations, including effective prevention of all illegal activity by groups in opposition to the Governments of neighbouring countries; (e) the process of democratisation of all countries in the region and continuation of the process of transition to democracy and holding of free and fair elections in Zaire.  These principles, which guide the current approach of the Government and our European partners, complement and support that of the recently appointed Joint United Nations and Organisation of African Unity special representative to the Great Lakes Region, Mr. Mohammed Sahnoun, who had respective meetings with President Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Zaire last week.  His five-point peace plan was adopted unanimously by the United Nations Security Council in its resolution number 1097 of 18 February.  It seeks to build on an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries, to bring about a rapid and peaceful settlement of the crisis through dialogue, the electoral process, and the convening of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes Region under the aegis of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU strongly supports the early holding of such a conference, building on the ongoing mediation efforts of the organisations and heads of state in the region.  Arising from an initiative at the Nairobi Summit in December last, the leaders of Cameroon, the Congo, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe were mandated at a meeting in Pretoria last month to act on &ldquo;behalf of the leaders in the region to take the necessary initiatives and steps aimed at assisting in ending the conflict in Eastern Zaire and promoting peace, stability and security in the Great Lakes Region&rdquo;.  In a follow-up to this initiative, their foreign ministers visited Zaire on 19 February <Col N="777" /> and there are reports that their heads of state may meet with President Mobutu on 19 March. President Mandela of South Africa has also been making separate efforts to facilitate direct dialogue between representatives of the Government and rebel sides.</P>
    <P>While these initiatives have received a mixed reaction from the parties to the conflict in Eastern Zaire, they have provided clear evidence of a strong commitment by the international community, working in tandem with regional leaders, to resolving by peaceful means the problems of the Great Lakes Region.  The Government will continue to make every appropriate effort in concert with our EU partners to lend our full support to the co-ordination and success of these initiatives. We are also prepared to make available substantial aid for economic and social rehabilitation at regional level as soon as political circumstances and the security situation in the Great Lakes Region so permit.</P>

      <P>Both the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Response Unit and the European Commission's TACIS Nuclear Safety Unit are aware of the report referred to in the Deputy's question.  They advise that the risks associated with the disposal of highly radioactive waste at the plant in question are not comparable with the Chernobyl disaster, which occurred at an operational power reactor.  Moreover, it has been pointed out that the material referred to in the report is not uranium or plutonium as used in nuclear reactors.  In view of this assessment the question of the Government pressing for the dispatch of an EU envoy does not arise.  However, the report highlights the importance of ongoing nuclear safety programmes to improve the safety of operating nuclear power plants and civilian nuclear fuel and waste management activities, to promote regional co-operation on nuclear safety in countries operating Soviet-built reactors, and to strengthen regulatory frameworks.</P>

      <P>Ireland has consistently and strongly urged, in international fora, the abolition of the death penalty.  The US Administration is well aware of our views on the subject.  My Department has made inquiries of the authorities in Utah regarding the prisoner in question, who was convicted of a double homicide in 1979 and given the death sentence, which was commuted to life imprisonment in 1991.  According to the information which we have received, the prisoner began a hunger and thirst strike on 7 February 1997 because of his dissatisfaction with certain prison conditions and with the suspension of privileges. He ended his fast on 19 February and we have been advised that he has not suffered any ill effects.  The prison authorities have since reviewed the prison conditions in question and we understand that the granting of privileges is dependent on a prisoner's behaviour.</P>

      <P>The Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is a five year programme from 1995 to 1999.  The Essen European Council in December 1994 decided that the initial funding for the programme should be 300 million ECU over three years, with the allocation for the remaining two years of the programme to be agreed at a later date.  The level of funding for 1998 will be decided during the 1998 budgetary process.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government will spare no effort to ensure that funding for this programme will continue.  Indeed the Government is confident that funding will be provided, as the European Union has been extremely supportive of the peace process.  As the Deputy is aware, high level representations were made by the Government during the Irish Presidency to ensure full funding for the programme in 1997 and these efforts were successful.  The Troika format is used to support the Presidency only in the conduct of the EU's external relations.  It has no role in internal EU matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The restrictions on civil servants engaging in political activity operate at two levels; legislative and administrative.  Under the Electoral Acts no civil servant may be elected to or sit as a member of Dáil Éireann.  Administrative rules on civil servants and political activity fall into two categories; restrictions on standing for election to political office and rules regarding the maintenance of political impartiality.  Restrictions on civil servants standing for election are set out in circulars of 1925, 1934 and 1974.  The restrictions were relaxed somewhat by the Government in 1974 and the current arrangements are as follows: (a) Civil servants are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Assembly.  This restriction applies to all categories of staff.  (b) Civil servants in the industrial and in the manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections.  Civil servants in this category may, therefore, contest local elections. (c) Members of the clerical grades in the civil service and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the clerical officer maximum may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (b) but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused.  (d) All civil servants above clerical level are totally debarred from engaging in politics.  However, personal assistants and special advisers in Ministers' offices, whose terms of appointment are coterminous with those of the relevant appointing Minister, are exempt from the present arrangements covering State employees and politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to local elections, the grades in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which are not permitted to contest local elections in any circumstance are: secretary; assistant secretary; principal; assistant principal; administrative officer; higher executive officer; executive officer; staff officer; chief veterinary officer; deputy chief veterinary officer; deputy director veterinary research laboratory; senior superintending veterinary inspector; senior superintending research officer; chemist; veterinary inspector chief technologist; senior laboratory technician; research officer; laboratory technician; senior serological assistant; supervisory serological assistant; senior seed analyst; dairy laboratory assistant; poultry officer; supervising <Col N="780" /> poultry officer; supervising instructor (poultry); lay commissioner; examiner of title; assistant solicitor; senior legal clerk; legal clerk; chief inspector agriculture; deputy chief inspector; senior inspector; agricultural inspector; assistant agricultural inspector; inspector grade I; inspector grade II; inspector grade III; senior inspector forestry; forestry inspector grade I; forestry inspector grade II; forestry inspector grade III; agricultural officer; higher agricultural officer; supervisory agricultural officer; district superintendent; senior supervisory agricultural officer; area superintendent; dairy produce officer.</P>
    <P>These arrangements are kept under review by the Government who are conscious of the need to have as many citizens as possible play an active part in the affairs of the State, while at the same time ensuring public confidence in the political impartiality of civil servants.  The Government consider that civil servants concerned with the framing of policy should serve, and be seen to serve, all Governments objectively and impartially. The Government also consider that public confidence in the impartial execution of Government policy could be lost if civil servants whose work entails, for instance, a direct service to the public (e.g. the allocation of grants) or access to confidential information were known adherents of a political party or known to have political ambitions.  I have no plans to make any changes in this area at present.  However, the matter is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that no unnecessary restrictions apply.  Any changes in existing rules would, of course, have to be approved by Government.</P>

The Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme involves delivery of funding for a wide range of actions under measures dealing with tourism, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, training, roads, transport services, energy, telecommunications, water and sewage schemes, cross-Border linkages and community-voluntary activities. <Col N="782" /> Grant applications are assessed by joint north-south working groups with departmental responsibility for the sectors involved.  Applications are assessed on the basis of their compliance with the programme's objectives.</P>
      <P>Grant allocations are not categorised on a county basis.  Many successful applications involve multi-county and cross-Border projects. Details of grant approvals, including particulars of promoters, projects, project locations and amount of grants are published periodically.  A copy of the most recent grant approval listing follows. In all, over 800 applications have been received of which 180 are cross-Border in nature. 275 applications have been approved and over 70 million ECU in EU funding committed to end September 1996.</P>

      <P>My Department is joint manager, with the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, of the Special EU Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  The Department is not involved with the assessment of grant applications. This function is carried out in the main by intermediary funding bodies.  The total EU funding available to the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland is 300 million ECU (IR£240 million) over three years.  Up to 80 per cent of the funding will be available for activities in Northern Ireland and at least 20 per cent (IR£48 million) for activities in Border counties.  At least 15 per cent of the overall amount is devoted to activities carried out in a cross-Border context.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, funding for a further two years is subject to a Commission review.  An independent evaluation of the programme is at present being undertaken and I have every confidence that the progress to date will support the Commission's case in respect of funding for the final two years.  A measure by measure breakdown of commitments of 31 December 1996 is shown on the following schedule, together with the total committed as of that date.</P>

For the year 1995, the latest year for which statistics are available, the estimated cost of administering all revenue taxes and duties was £154.6 million which is 1.26 per cent of the net receipt of those taxes and duties in that year.</P>

      <P>The effects on different categories of taxpayers of the main changes announced in this year's budget were set out in table J of the Principal Features of the 1997 budget presented to the House on 22 January.  As will be seen from those tables when all relevant factors are taken into account, including changes in child benefit and family income supplement, there are widespread and significant increases in net income from the budget across many income levels, and the figures quoted by the Deputy are not the full picture in this regard.  Since one pays more tax in absolute terms as one's income increases, tax reductions will be of greater benefit to those on higher incomes.  When expressed as a percentage of net income, the variation in gains is far less across income levels.</P>

Price stability within the ERM &mdash; that is reliably low inflation &mdash; remains the objective of exchange rate and monetary policy.  This is central to the Government's policy of securing the maximum sustainable economic and employment growth, <i>inter alia</i>, by ensuring moderate wage developments. The importance of reliably low inflation in that context is very clear.</P>
      <P>Within the price stability objective, our aim is that the Irish pound should trade comfortably within the ERM band.  Participation in the ERM has helped to underpin the policy framework within which strong economic growth has remained consistent with low inflation over recent years.  In this context I would point out that the Irish pound has not tracked either sterling or the deutschmark, although it has been influenced by both.  For example, using current exchange rates, the Irish pound has fallen by almost 5 per cent against sterling since 30 September 1996, whereas during the same period the DM fell by over 12 per cent against sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Exchange rates are of course heavily influenced by the markets' views of countries' current and prospective economic and fiscal performance, and naturally these views change frequently. Given relative movements in exchange rates, it is not possible to assure an unchanging rate for the Irish pound against other currencies. The recent developments in the foreign exchange markets, which have affected the value of sterling and the DM against the Irish pound, must be seen in that light.  I should point out, however, that on a trade-weighted basis, the value of the Irish pound has not changed greatly, although it has appreciated somewhat; no doubt this is at least partly a reflection of the relative strength of our economy.</P>
    <P>I am of course, aware of the concerns being expressed by some exporters in relation to the current exchange rate situation, although the strength of sterling should benefit exporters to the UK, and some exporters are also, presumably, benefiting from a fall in the Irish pound cost of inputs imported from the ERM countries whose currencies have weakened.  It is primarily a matter for exporters themselves to cope with the economic environment in which they find themselves, including the currency environment.  The Government does have a role in helping to ensure that the economic environment is as conducive as possible to economic activity, including exporting; the current climate in Ireland is characterised by high growth, low inflation, moderate wage developments, interest rates close to historically low levels, a balance of payments surplus, sound public finances, and a high level of investment under the Community Support Framework.  The recent budget sought to improve this climate further, in particular by providing tax and social insurance reductions aimed at securing wage moderation and by improving our corporation tax structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The latest comparative figures for dental treatment levels for the Newry and Dundalk areas show that children across all age groups in Dundalk have significantly better dental health than their counterparts in Newry.  For example, five year old children in Newry have on average three decayed, missing or filled baby teeth in comparison to an average of one for five year old children in the Dundalk area.  The figures for 12 year olds show that Newry children have on average more than two decayed, missing or filled permanent teeth while Dundalk children have an average of less than one.</P>
      <P>These findings are consistent with previous studies which have shown marked differences in the level of dental health between children in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic.  There is widespread agreement among international researchers that the single most important contributory factor to the better levels of oral health in the Republic of Ireland as compared to Northern Ireland is the fluoridation of public water supplies in the Republic.</P>
      <P>The scientific evidence proving the effectiveness of water fluoridation in reducing tooth decay is overwhelming.  Extensive studies over the past 50 years have established that individuals whose drinking water is fluoridated show a reduction of up to 50 per cent.  In 1992 a study comparing the decay levels of 12 year old children in Dublin and Glasgow showed that the level of decay was 45 per cent lower in Dublin which is fluoridated compared to Glasgow which is non-fluoridated. A recent publication comparing the decay levels for five to seven year old children in 23 countries in Europe shows that Ireland has the lowest level of decay for this age group.  It is also the country with the highest percentage of its population receiving fluoridated water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major reviews of the evidence by leading medical scientists have shown time and time again that the use of fluoride in drinking water is safe to human health.  The Department of Health and Human Services in the United States has reviewed all the relevant scientific information, <Col N="809" /> including that put forward by antifluoridationists. This comprehensive review of the benefits and potential health risks of fluoride has concluded that the practice of fluoridating community water supplies is safe and effective.</P>
    <P>In the light of available evidence both in Ireland and internationally water fluoridation is of major social, economic and health benefit to this country and will continue to be the cornerstone of our preventive programme to promote good oral health.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Hepatitis C is not specifically a notifiable disease under the 1981 Infectious Diseases Regulations, but is classed under the heading &ldquo;Viral hepatitis &mdash; type unspecified&rdquo;.  There have been no population-based studies to show the prevalence of hepatitis C in the population as a whole.</P>
      <P>In the period October 1995 to September 1996, 0.002 per cent of blood donors were confirmed hepatitis C positive.  However, the donor pool consists of self-selected individuals with a below average risk for hepatitis C infection, and conclusions cannot, therefore, be drawn in relation to the rest of the population.  Intravenous drug users are a particularly high risk group for hepatitis C infection.</P>
      <P>In relation to the number of persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration in the State of blood and blood products, the following statistics are taken from figures supplied to my Department by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  These figures cover the period up to 3 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The national blood screening programme commenced in February 1994 for recipients of human immunoglobulin &mdash; anti-D, their children and partners.  Under this programme, 61,486 women were screened for hepatitis C.  The number of women who have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies is 974.  Of these, 463 have tested positive for the hepatitis C virus.  The number of children screened under this programme is 1,776. Twelve of these tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies, of which three are positive for the virus.  The number of partners screened under the programme was 504, four of whom tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies.  No partners tested positive for the virus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The targeted lookback programme was commenced in October 1994 to identify persons who may have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of a transfusion, by tracing the past donations of donors identified with evidence of <Col N="810" /> hepatitis C infection.  Under this programme, 270 living recipients have been traced.  Some 230 of these have been tested, of whom 128 are antibody positive.  Of the 230 who were tested for hepatitis C antibodies, 207 were tested for the virus.  Some 83 of these are positive for the virus.</P>
    <P>The operational screening programme commenced in September 1995 to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusions and blood products who might possibly have become infected with hepatitis C through the receipt of transfusions or blood products were given the option of being tested free of charge.  To date, 11,800 have been tested under this programme.  Of these, 43 have tested antibody positive.  Some 29 of these 43 persons have tested positive for the virus.</P>
    <P>I have requested updated figures from the Blood Transfusion Service Board, and I will make these available to the Deputy as soon as they become available.</P>
    <P>Testing for hepatitis C became available on 1 October 1991.  Many haemophiliacs and kidney patients would have been screened before the national blood screening programme was introduced in February 1994.  In this regard, my Department has been informed by the Irish Haemophilia Society that 210 haemophiliacs have been infected with hepatitis C.  The Irish Kidney Association has indicated to the Department that 50 kidney patients have been infected with hepatitis C.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the area covered by the Grand Canal Corridor study which extends from Grand Canal Docks to Lucan Road Bridge.  Since the launch of the Grand Canal Corridor study in July 1994, a task force has been established under the chairmanship of Senator Pat Magner to oversee the implementation of improvements along the canal system.  A regeneration officer has been appointed to liaise with local community groups. This has resulted in a number of community employment schemes being established in the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot areas.</P>
      <P>One of the sea locks in the Outer Basin in Ringsend has been automated and hard landscaping work has been completed at Charlotte Quay. A number of derelict boats in the Outer Basin have been removed and new mooring jetties have been constructed at Mespil Road and at Portobello. The programme of works scheduled for 1997 includes the provision of two new lock gates to be installed along the circular line and four lock gates are being installed along the main line. As a safety measure chains will be installed in the lock chambers in the Dublin area.  My Department has commissioned a report on the use of the Inner Basin in Ringsend with a view to examining proposals for the development of the area.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to hold a canal festival in April 1997 to coincide with the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland annual boating rally.</P>
      <P>A contract will shortly be placed for grass cutting and litter collection along the Grand Canal between Grand Canal Street and Newbridge, Kylemore Road.  It is also proposed to undertake a tree planting programme during the current year.  A new jetty will be constructed at the 9th Lock, Clondalkin, which will provide short stay moorings and canoe facilities.  Further fish stocking will be carried out on the system in association with the Central Fisheries Board and local angling groups.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Royal Canal Corridor study area which covers the stretch of the Royal Canal from Spencer Dock, Dublin, to Kilcock, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that last year, following the publication of the &ldquo;Royal Canal Corridor Study &mdash; Strategy and Proposals&rdquo;, I extended the remit of the task force for the Grand Canal under the chairmanship of Senator Pat Magner to cover the Royal Canal Corridor.  I have also arranged for the regeneration officer's duties on the Grand Canal to be extended to the Royal Canal.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the Royal Canal, which was closed to navigation in 1961, is now navigable from Dublin, 1st Lock, to Mullingar.  Since 1987, the Waterways Service has been undertaking the restoration of the system with the objective of making the canal fully navigable from Dublin to the Shannon by the end of the century.  Accordingly, the necessary capital investment for this restoration work, which is being funded under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, is being concentrated at Mullingar and to the west of that town.</P>
      <P>Improvements works have been undertaken in recent years on the Dublin stretch of the canal with the dredging of the system, the replacement of all the lock gates, a fish stocking programme, the provision of angling stands and markers, landscaping and maintenance works, including grass cutting and litter collection.  Property developers have been encouraged to take a more positive attitude towards the canal with more new developments addressing the waterway, and a new boat hire business has started operations from the 12th Lock, Castleknock.  The regeneration officer has held meetings with local authority planners along the corridor to discuss canal related matters of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>The programme of works scheduled for 1997 will include the removal of the existing culvert and the installation of a lifting bridge at Newcomen Junction, North Strand Road, which will permit access to and from the River Liffey.  Agreement has been reached with the ESB to relocate the high tension cable at Spencer Bridge, Spencer Dock.  Chains have been installed in a number of lock chambers in the Dublin area.  It is expected to carry out further upgrading of fishing facilities along the corridor and ongoing maintenance works on canal property will continue.</P>

      <P>Special areas of conservation are important natural areas which are required to be protected under the terms of the EU Habitats Directive.  I will sign the regulations transposing the directive into Irish law tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Farmers with land included in these areas will be required to farm in accordance with an agreed agri-environmental plan, which will be prepared on the basis of conditions for each relevant habitat agreed by my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Teagasc, private farm planners, and relevant non-governmental organisations.  Indeed, farming conditions have already been agreed on this basis for the Burren, blanket bog, heaths and upland grasslands, which represent over two-thirds of the land area to be included in the proposed SACs.  Arrangements are in hand to discuss and agree the conditions that will apply to the other habitats involved.</P>
      <P>These conditions are designed to impose on farmers the minimum restrictions that are compatible with protecting the sites.  There is no question of farmers being told to stop farming their lands.  Traditional farming has in many cases created the habitats now being protected and without farming these habitats cannot be maintained.</P>
      <P>The impact of proposals to prospect for or extract minerals would have to be assessed on an individual basis.  My Department would only object where significant damage would result for the relevant habitat.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, SACs will not have any effect on fishing and shooting rights.  Where restrictions in SACs cause income or capital loss for the farmer, compensation will be payable.  If agreement cannot be reached on the amount payable, independent arbitration will be available.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental working group established on foot of a Government decision of 5 November 1996 has since met on three occasions.  The group is conducting an examination of all available evidence on the operations at Sellafield, including scientific reports which have recently become generally available.  It is also exploring possibilities for obtaining additional evidence which could better inform consideration of the legal and other avenues available to the State to eliminate or limit the risks posed to the Irish population by Sellafield.  Matters receiving attention in this regard include the adequacy of the present monitoring programmes of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) and consideration of the possible need for further health-effect related studies.</P>

The report is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The report indicates that the reported total quantities of hazardous waste arising in 1995 were 167,000 tonnes.  Government policy on waste management generally seeks to promote the prevention of waste, optimum recovery of wastes which cannot be prevented and safe disposal of residual quantities.  The Environmental Protection Agency has initiated arrangements for the carrying out of a major strategy study to assist the development by the agency of a national hazardous waste management plan.  A comprehensive programme for the management of healthcare waste is being advanced jointly by the Department of Health and the Northern Ireland authorities; this will involve the early establishment of modern treatment facilities on an island-wide basis.</P>

      <Quest>in view of circular L1/97 of 21 January 1997, from his Department, if the question of funding for Lurganboy sewerage scheme, Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, has been devolved to Leitrim County Council; the proportion of the £50 million being made available in 1997 in block grant form to local authorities in respect of small public water and sewerage schemes and to Leitrim County Council; if he will bring these matters to the attention of local authorities when they are drawing up their priority lists in view of the fact that the contract documents for the extension have been in the possession of his Department for some time and this has been an issue since the 1960s; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 164, 173 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland was represented at the meeting of the <i>ad hoc</i> group on the Berlin Mandate, AGBM, from 9-13 December 1996 and in its capacity as Presidency undertook co-ordination and presentation of the EU position at the meeting, including the presentation of comprehensive elements for the terms of a Protocol to the UN framework convention on climate change.  The main outcome of the meeting was a request to the chairman to prepare a framework compilation incorporating proposals from parties for the elements of a Protocol or other legal instrument for discussion at the next AGBM meeting on 3-7 March 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current EU policy is to stabilise the level of carbon dioxide emissions at their 1990 level by the year 2000 in the Union as a whole.  Within this policy, which acknowledges the need of some member states for ongoing growth in energy <Col N="828" /> demand in line with economic development requirements, Ireland is committed to limiting the growth in its CO 2 emissions to 20 per cent over their 1990 level by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The position of the EU regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the post-2000 period will be discussed at the Environment Council on 3-4 March which I will attend.  The EU, however, has already indicated that developed countries should individually or jointly commit to quantified objectives to achieve significant overall reductions in greenhouse gas emissions after the year 2000 below 1990 levels, within specified timeframes such as 2005, 2010 and 2020.  The Environment Council on 3-4 March will consider further the EU and member state positions, including Ireland's with a view to specifying the post-2000 reduction objectives to be proposed by the EU in the negotiations under the Berlin Mandate.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of the international insurance industry about the effects of, and claims arising from, severe climate events.  The second assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change has stated that the international insurance industry currently is under stress from a series of billion dollar storms since 1987, resulting in dramatic increases in losses, reduced availability of insurance and higher costs. Some in the insurance industry perceive a current trend towards increased frequency and severity of extreme climate events.  The second assessment report concluded that examination of the meteorological data fails to support this perception in the context of a long-term change, although a shift within the limits of natural variability may have occurred.  Higher losses strongly reflect increases in infrastructure and economic worth in vulnerable areas, as well as a possible shift in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority concerned. Where a development has been carried out without the benefit of planning permission, or where development does not comply with the conditions of the planning permission, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority to take enforcement action.  In addition, it is open to any person to seek an Order in the High Court or Circuit Court under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, as amended, requiring compliance with conditions laid down by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>The Planning Acts specifically allow for conditions about the giving of security, the phasing and completion of works and the occupation of structures.  Effective use of such conditions by local authorities, the follow-up enforcement action, can do much to obviate the kind of problems that arise in unfinished estates.</P>
      <P>Under the Planning Acts, decisions on planning applications must be based on physical planning criteria, and for this reason, refusal of permission on the grounds of the character and past record of an applicant, or requiring developers to finish a housing estate before applying for permission to build another, would not be possible under existing law.  However, this matter will be borne in mind in the ongoing review of planning law.</P>

The Green Government Guide, which was circulated to all Government Departments last year, represents an important initiative in this direction.

      <P>The vast majority of automative-type lead-acid batteries are collected separately within the motor trade and otherwise under informal arrangements.  I have been encouraging the development of measures for more systematic collection systems such as the pilot scheme launched by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry for the separate collection and recovery of batteries.  In addition, I have approved a waste management grant for the provision of a more broadly-based collection system and treatment facility.  I am also considering the need for regulations under the Waste Management Act, 1996 to provide statutory support for such arrangements and for the collection of other batteries to which EU Directive 91/157/EEC applies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195, 196 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with a disability, in either special educational facilities or in an integrated environment. The fundamental objective of the commitment in the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.  The degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children concerned.</P>
      <P>Where the special education needs of pupils with Down's Syndrome are capable of being met within the ordinary school system, this is taken into account in deciding on an appropriate allocation of additional part-time hours for the school in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment policy of an individual school is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of that school.  However, a school which has the services of a remedial or resource teacher would be expected to enrol pupils with Down's Syndrome where integration was accepted as appropriate. <Col N="839" /> Such teachers would be expected to support the education of pupils who present with varying disabilities, including Down's Syndrome. Where such services are not available, my Department is prepared to consider the question of allocating additional part-time hours to an individual school in order to cater for the needs of the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me to compel a school to enrol a particular pupil or to impose a censure where a school refuses to enrol a pupil.  However, where parents of pupils with Down's Syndrome are experiencing difficulty in securing enrolment, my Department's inspectorate assists through a process of liaison and consultation with schools.  In general this process secures an acceptable outcome.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has any particular case in mind I will arrange to have the matter investigated if he provides me with the details.</P>

      <P>I recently announced my decision to allocate an additional two posts to the visiting teacher service. This brings the number of teachers in the service to forty.</P>
      <P>At present, three visiting teachers provide a support service to Down's Syndrome children in the Dublin area.  I have no plans at present to further expand this service.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the visiting teacher service is just one of a range of support services available to children with special needs, including children with Down's Syndrome.</P>
      <P>In many instances, children with Down's Syndrome are capable of being catered for in the ordinary school setting with the assistance, where necessary, of remedial teachers, resource teachers or visiting teachers.</P>
      <P>At present, a total of 1,188 remedial teachers and 46 resource teachers are in place in the primary system.  This includes 241 remedial teachers and 39 resource teachers who have been appointed since I took office.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200, 201 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools, by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>I have asked the Higher Education Authority to undertake a general review of outreach centres of higher education institutions and to report and make recommendations thereon.  The authority has determined its own working procedures for the review and has appointed a technical working group.  It has consulted and sought submissions from interested groups and I understand that it has received a submission from the chief executive officer, County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee on behalf of the vocational education committee and Monaghan Institute of Further Education and Training (MIFET).</P>
      <P>Pending the outcome of the Higher Education Authority review and consideration of its recommendations, no decision will be taken on the question of establishing new outreach centres.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary or second level schools.</P>
      <P>A detailed study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre has recommended that disadvantaged area status be confined to 16 per cent of the school going population. The report noted that the current coverage of the scheme is already in excess of this level.</P>
      <P>In line with the findings of this study, I recently launched the breaking the cycle initiative in an effort to target resources on selected urban and rural primary schools which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.  The urban element of this initiative was focused on schools which already had disadvantaged status and were located in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  A total of 33 urban schools were selected for a special package of supports under this element of the initiative.  The rural element of the initiative was targeted on schools nationwide with fewer than five teachers. A total of 123 schools were selected for a special package of supports under this element of the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> Each of the selected schools is preparing a five year development plan identifying the measures being taken to combat educational disadvantage in its area over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The operation and effectiveness of this initiative will be closely monitored over the plan period and the outcome will inform future developments in supports for disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>At present, the lead responsibility for the psychological assessment of children in national schools, where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health boards through the appropriate director of community care.  Expansion of this provision is a matter for the Department of Health and the regional health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention that there should eventually be a schools psychological service provided for all <Col N="847" /> children in schools.  For this reason, there is a policy statement concerning this matter in the Government White Paper on Education, which envisages the expansion of my Department's psychological service on a phased basis.  The provision of the service is seen as a function of the new education boards.</P>
    <P>The schools psychological service at primary level is being introduced gradually by my Department as resources permit.  This is currently provided for certain named schools which serve disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, in addition to the original pilot service in west Tallaght-Clondalkin and in south Tipperary.  The service is not available in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>Due to the need to limit public expenditure, it has not been possible to expand my Department's psychological service further in the recent past.  It will, necessarily, be some time before the Department of Education is in a position to take over responsibility for psychological assessments for educational purposes from the health authorities.</P>
    <P>As and when it becomes possible to extend the schools psychological service, the needs of children and of schools in various areas, including County Cavan, will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is, in the first instance the responsibility of individual schools.  In cases such as this, my Department's inspectorate endeavours, by a process of consultation with school management, to have the pupil in question placed in a school in his locality.  These efforts, which by their nature can take some time, are ongoing in this case and every effort is being made to find an appropriate placement.</P>
      <P>I should mention that in endeavouring to find a suitable placement for this pupil the parents were advised of initiatives to be taken which included making contact with a number of schools in the locality.  However, the family decided not to avail of all of these initiatives.</P>

I hope to be in a position to make such an order within the near future.</P>
      <P>I have also indicated that section 9 of the Universities Bill, now before the Dáil, provides a mechanism by which an institution can attain university status.  If, in the future, moving to university status enhances the mission of the institute, I am confident that section 9 of the Universities Bill provides an appropriate mechanism.</P>

      <P>The question refers to changes made to the basis for calculating Garda pensions in 1982 and 1994, which came into effect from the date the change was made but which did not have retrospective effect to include pensioners.</P>
      <P>The first, the pensionability of certain Garda allowances in 1982 arose out of a finding by the arbitrator that a number of Garda allowances, which has previously been non-pensionable, became reckonable for pension purposes with effect from 1 October 1982.  This was accepted by the then Minister for the Public Service and by the then Minister for Justice.  Garda pensioners who retired before that date did not benefit from the changes recommended by the arbitrator.</P>
      <P>The second change made to the basis for calculating Garda pensions, the decision in 1994 to make unsocial hours allowances pensionable, was part of a restructuring agreement reached under the local bargaining clause of the PESP, and was in return for agreement by Garda associations to contribute to flexibility and change within the force.  The agreement was subject to an overall limit on cost of 3 per cent of basic pay.  It did not provide for the extension of pensionability of unsocial hours to Garda pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 1994 restructuring agreement, I should say that restructuring deals have still to be finalised in respect of several other major public service groups and that consideration is currently being given to the implications for existing pensioners of the existing and pending restructuring deals across the public sector, and in relation to pensions increase policy generally.</P>
      <P>Concerning the Garda pension scheme generally, the Deputy will be aware that in February 1996 my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, established the Commission on Public Service Pensions to examine and report on the pension terms of public servants, including members of the Garda Síochána.  The Commission has been asked to report to Government in 1998.</P>

An interdepartmental committee, under the chairmanship of Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, is progressing the various projects under the accelerated programme as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>The new women's prison, will provide 60 places.  Local government planning procedures for this project have been completed, tenders for the construction of the institution were invited on 14 February and are due to be returned on 18 March.

      <P>The person concerned was refused retirement pension on the grounds that she has insufficient contributions paid or credited to satisfy the yearly average conditions of the scheme.  She has a yearly average of nine contributions between 1953 and 1997 which is the relevant period in her case.  A yearly average of 24 contributions is required for retirement pension at age 65 and a yearly average of 20 for old age, contributory, pension at age 66.  Provision is being made for <i>pro-rata</i> pensions with effect from November next, as announced in this year's budget, but a yearly average of ten contributions is required for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Department's records there were no contributions for this person between <Col N="857" /> 1957 and 1982, nor after the 1986-87 contribution year.  To qualify for credited contributions following her early retirement, she would need to have claimed unemployed or disability benefit and to have continued to prove unemployment or incapacity for work as appropriate throughout the period concerned.  There is no trace of any such claims from her and in the circumstances there is no basis for awarding her credited contributions.</P>
    <P>The person concerned might quality for an old age non-contributory pension however, depending on her and her husband's means situation. The Department has sent her an application form in case she wishes to apply for this pension.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance administered by my Department is available to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who are either living alone or only with children aged under 18 or persons who are so incapacitated that they could not get help in an emergency.  Last July, the free schemes of telephone rental allowance, electricity allowance and colour television licence were extended to low income pensioners who did not previously qualify because they were not in receipt of a social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>The allowance covers the cost of the normal telephone rental charges and up to 20 free call units in each two-monthly billing period.</P>
      <P>The extension of the free telephone rental scheme to include all pensioners aged over 66 years, regardless of their household circumstances, would have major cost implications and I have no plans at present to introduce such a measure.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953 &mdash; when the unified system of social insurance came into effect &mdash; or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>I announced in my budget speech that in future people who pay PRSI, but fail to qualify for the present minimum old age pension, will receive a contributory pension as long as their yearly average number of contributions is between ten and 20.  A yearly average between 15 and 19 will give entitlement to a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 will give entitlement to a pension of 50 per cent.  This measure, which will be introduced in November next, will mean that people with broken or sporadic contribution records will now qualify for a contributory pension, as long as they have at least 260 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Social Insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension and the new <i>pro-rata</i> pension in satisfying the first two conditions set out above but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
      <P>In this regard it is relevant to point out that prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable.  These were, national health insurance, widows and orphans pension and unemployment insurance contributions. These contributions gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the scheme under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of the satisfying of the yearly average test.  However they are still reckonable for the other two conditions.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a specific case in mind and can pass on the relevant details I would be happy to have the position investigated.</P>

      <P>I have responded to the inquiry referred to on 21 February 1997.  The students summer jobs scheme operated successfully again last year and proved to be of significant benefit to local communities and voluntary groups.  Many valuable projects have been undertaken under the scheme over the past four years which would otherwise not have been carried out.  Fifteen thousand, eight hundred students participated in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the students summer jobs scheme this year third level students who are debarred from qualifying for unemployment assistance during the summer will be entitled to do 200 hours work with an approved sponsor for which they will be paid £600.  Students who take part in the scheme can engage in other work either during or after their participation which enables them to maximise their earnings during the summer months.</P>
      <P>I propose to continue with the scheme this year on the same basis as last year.  A total of £10.2 million has again been provided by the Government for this years scheme and this will enable the same number of students to participate as in 1996.</P>
      <P>Details of the 1997 scheme will be announced shortly in the national papers and both sponsors and students will be invited to apply.</P>

      <P>In addition to the general flat-rate budget increase of £3 per week which was ahead of inflation in the last year, a 12-point package of measures was announced in this year's budget. These measures will directly and substantially improve the position of pensioners and carers. The details of these measures are available in the following appendix which is an extract from my budget speech of 23 January 1997.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Appendix</P>
      <P>The following is an extract from the Minister's budget speech on 23 January 1997 which details the improvements pensioners and carers will receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> A 12-point package of improvements is proposed for pensioners and carers.</P>
    <P>(i)  New <i>pro-rata</i> pensions</P>
    <P>In future, people who pay PRSI, but fail to qualify for the present minimum old age pension, will receive a contributory pension as long as their yearly average number of contributions is between 10 and 20.  A yearly average between 15 and 19 will give entitlement to a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between 10 and 14 will give entitlement to a pension of 50 per cent.  This measure, which will be introduced in November next, will mean that people with broken or sporadic contribution records will now qualify for a contributory pension, as long as they have at least 260 paid contributions. The reform will be of particular benefit to women who have spent long periods outside the paid workforce, working in the home; and who may not benefit from the 1994 homemakers provisions as these were not retrospective.  It will also benefit returned emigrants and people who had periods of self-employment prior to 1988 when the self-employed started paying PRSI.  It is estimated that this measure could benefit some 4,000 people at a first full year cost of £6 million, (although this should fall once the backlog of claimants has been dealt with).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Refunds for certain self-employed contributors</P>
    <P>An anomaly is to be rectified which affects self-employed PRSI contributors who entered insurance in 1988, but were already over the age of 56 at that time.  They will now be able to receive a refund of the pensions element of their PRSI, provided that they do not qualify for a social assistance payment.  Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving a refund.  It is estimated that this will benefit up to 600 people at a cost of £1 million.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Easing the Means Test</P>
    <P>The means test for non-contributory old age pensions is to be eased.  The same formula will be applied to this group as applies to a number of other groups.  This system will also apply to carers, non-contributory widows and widowers and people on the pre-retirement allowance.  This measures will make a significant contribution to achieving the important and long-standing objective of a uniform and consistent treatment of capital for means test purposes across all social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>The formula that will apply is as follows:</P>
    <P>* an initial disregard of £2,000 will be applied:</P>
    <P>* the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent:</P>
    <P>* the balance will be assessed at 15 per cent and</P>
    <P>* the £1 means penalty will be abolished.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Exempting rental income</P>
    <P>A new exemption from the means test for Old Age (Non-contributory) Pension is to be introduced. Income in respect of rent will no longer <Col N="861" /> be assessed where the income is in respect of a person who lives with and pays rent to the pensioner. This is a small but nonetheless important concession for old age pensioners with resident tenants, and will remove an unnecessary disincentive for pensioners to seek additional income and companionship.</P>
    <P>(v)  Extending time-limit for Late Claims</P>
    <P>The current arrangements for the payment of arrears in the case of late claims for certain pensions have been reviewed and the period for which arrears are paid is to be extended from six months to 12 months.  This revised arrangement will apply to claims for Retirement Pension, Old Age (Contributory) Pension and Widow's and Widower's (Contributory) Pension.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Retraining Treatment Benefits</P>
    <P>Dependent spouses who are entitled to treatment (dental and optical) benefits will now retain their entitlement to those benefits if and when they qualify for Old Age (Non-Contributory) Pension in their own right.  Heretofore, they lost entitlement because they were in receipt of a social welfare payment of their own, which was clearly an anomaly.</P>
    <P>(vii)  Transferring directly to PRETA</P>
    <P>It will not become easier for people who cease to be entitled to the carer's allowance or the one-parent family payment to qualify for pre-retirement allowance.  Entitlement to these payments ceases where the carer no longer provides full-time care and attention or, in the case of the lone parent, where they no longer have a qualified child.  In such circumstances (e.g. when a child grows up or a person being cared for dies), the carer or lone parent will have immediate access to pre-retirement allowance, as the requirement that they claim unemployment assistance for 15 months before becoming eligible for PRETA is being abolished.</P>
    <P>Free Schemes</P>
    <P>In addition to the seven changes outlined above, there are three other changes which will benefit pensioners, relating to the free schemes. These will also be of benefit to certain other social welfare recipients, who qualify for the relevant schemes.</P>
    <P>(viii)  Simplifying Qualifying Conditions (FEA and FTRA)</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for the free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance schemes are being simplified and eased.  This will bring the two schemes into closer alignment and makes it easier for social welfare customers to understand their entitlements.  It will also allow for more efficient and effective administration of the free schemes.</P>
    <P>Three specific changes will improve eligibility for these schemes</P>
    <P>(a)  Free telephone rental allowance is payable where dependent children reside with the <Col N="862" /> recipient, if the children concerned are aged under 18.  This age limit is being extended to 22 years for children who are in full-time education. This puts it on a par with the rules for the free electricity allowance.</P>
    <P>(b)  The definition of who may reside with a recipient of free telephone rental allowance is being eased so as to include invalids, as in the case of the free electricity allowance.</P>
    <P>(c)  the definition of who may reside with a recipient of the free electricity and the free telephone rental allowances is being eased so as to include a person who is providing full-time care and attention to any member of the household.  The carer in question does not have to be in receipt of a carer's allowance from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>(ix)  Applicants aged over 75</P>
    <P>A change in the qualifying conditions for the free schemes is being introduced which will benefit applicants for the free schemes who are aged over 75.  Under the present rules all people aged over 75 who currently hold the free electricity allowance and/or the free telephone rental allowance may retain these allowances regardless of who resides with them: and people over age 75 who previously held these allowances may requalify for them regardless fo who resides with them.</P>
    <P>However, new applicants over age 75 must currently satisfy more rigorous household composition conditions.  In future, they will be treated in precisely the same way as all other persons in that age category and their household composition will not affect their eligibility for the free schemes.</P>
    <P>(x)  Free Travel Companion Pass</P>
    <P>The free travel companion passes are being extended to cover all blind people who are registered with the National Council/League of the Blind.  At present pensioners who would lose out financially by switching from, for example, an Old Age (Contributory) Pension to the Blind Person's Pension, are effectively excluded from eligibility for the companion pass.  Similarly registered blind people aged under 66 who fail to qualify for the Blind Person's Pension on means grounds are also excluded.  Those categories will now become automatically entitled to the companion pass.</P>
    <P>All these improvements to the free schemes will take effect in June 1997.</P>
    <P>Carer's Allowance</P>
    <P>In addition to the ten improvements for pensioners outlined above, some of which also apply to carers and widowed people, there will be two important improvements to the carer's allowance this year.  This allowance is an income maintenance payment for people providing full time care and attention to pensioners and certain people with disabilities.  Hitherto, the particular needs of <Col N="863" /> those who are engaged in caring for more than one person have not been recognised.</P>
    <P>(xi)  Extra 50 per cent for certain carers</P>
    <P>From June of this year, provision is being made for the payment of an additional amount equivalent to 50 per cent of their existing entitlement to carers who are providing full-time care and attention to more than one person.</P>
    <P>For example, a carer who is providing full-time care and attention to an elderly and incapicitated couple, and who would currently qualify for the new maximum personal rate allowance of £70.50 per week will as a result of this measure, receive an additional £35.35 per week, bringing her total weekly income to £105.75.</P>
    <P>(xii)  Question of full-time care and attention</P>
    <P>A change is also being introduced to the rule which requires that carers must provide full-time care and attention.  This is to cater for those situations in which care-recipients attend approved rehabilitation courses.  The present requirement can have the effect of inhibiting or penalising such attendance.  The necessary legislative provisions to allow for this change will be included in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>As mentioned at point (iii) above, the means test in relation to the way capital and savings are assessed, for the purposes of the carer's allowance is also being eased.  The more generous assessment of capital which applies in the case of disability allowance and the new one parent family payment is being extended to the carer's allowance from June (see point (iii) above for details).</P>
    <P>(iii)  Increase in &ldquo;disregarded&rdquo; earnings</P>
    <P>A further improvement concerns the amount of earnings from employment of a rehabilitative nature which is disregarded in the assessment of means for disability allowance.  This currently stands at £33.20 a week.  Higher rates apply in the case of supplementary welfare allowance and the Blind Person's Pension.  The earnings for these three schemes will not be aligned and increases to a standard £36.30 a week for each scheme.  This will achieve much-needed uniformity in this area.</P>
    <P>Rates</P>
    <P>The personal rates are being increased by £3 and the adult dependant allowance by £1.50 from June this year.</P>
    <P>Social Insurance Payments: Retirement/Old Age (Contributory) Pension: under age 80, £75.00; aged 80 or over, £80.00.</P>
    <P>Social Assistance Payments: Old Age (Non-Contributory)/Blind Persons Pension: under age 80, £64.50; aged 80 or over, £69.50.</P>

Under the present rules all people aged over 75 who currently hold the free electricity allowance and/or the free telephone rental allowance may retain these allowances regardless of who resides with them: and people over age 75 who previously held these allowances may requalify for them regardless of who resides with them.</P>
    <P>However, new applicants over age 75 must currently satisfy more rigorous household composition conditions.  In future, they will be treated in precisely the same way as all other persons in that age category and their household composition will not affect their eligibility for the free schemes.</P>

      <i>Free Travel Companion Pass</i>
    </P>
    <P>The free travel companion passes are being extended to cover all blind people who are registered with the National Council/League of the Blind.  At present, pensioners who would lose out financially by switching from, for example, an Old-Age (Contributory) Pension to the Blind Person's Pension, are effectively excluded from eligibility for the companion pass.  Similarly registered blind people aged under 66 who fail to qualify for the Blind Person's Pension on means grounds are also excluded.  Those categories will now become automatically entitled to the companion pass.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Occupational Injuries Benefit: Survivor's Benefit</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, a person who is incapable of work due to an occupational illness or injury may be entitled to disablement benefit under the OIB scheme.  This is a personal award related to the <Col N="866" /> level of disablement of a claimant and is not payable to a claimant's spouse after death.  However, in cases where a person dies as a direct result of an occupational accident or injury, their surviving spouse may be entitled to a death benefit pension, which is payable at a higher rate than that of the Widow's/Widower's Contributory Pension.</P>
    <P>A problem arises with the current arrangements where the cause of death cannot be directly attributed to the occupational disease or injury. For instance, a person may have qualified for disablement benefit on the basis of having pneumoconiosis (miner's lung) but they may have died from a different or related disease, such as heart disease.</P>
    <P>In order to protect the position of the surviving spouse, the OIB survivor's benefit will be payable to a surviving spouse regardless of the cause of death of the claimant where the claimant's level of disablement had been assessed at 50 per cent or more.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will instruct the Western Health Board to approve an application for a supplementary welfare allowance for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo who is in financial trouble.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is currently in receipt of pre-retirement allowance of £64.50, plus dependent child allowance of £13.20, giving him a total weekly income of £77.70.  The mortgage on his residence is with Mayo County Council.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments, who satisfy the qualifying conditions.  The SWA scheme is administered in the area by the Western Health Board and my Department has no role in determining individual entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement an applicant must satisfy certain qualifying conditions, one of which is that the mortgage agreement was entered into when, in the opinion of the health board, the applicant was in a position to meet the repayments.  A person in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, who <Col N="867" /> then applies for assistance with a mortgage repayment, is not regarded as being in a position to meet the repayments of a mortgage.</P>
    <P>The person referred to by the Deputy applied for a mortgage interest supplement in January 1992.  He was refused on the grounds that he had been continuously in receipt of a social welfare payment, unemployment assistance, at the time he entered into the mortgage agreement in 1986. He also failed to supply details of an accident compensation award he received.  He re-applied for mortgage interest supplement in July 1996 and was again refused on the same grounds.  He did not formally appeal either decision.</P>
    <P>The only other payment the applicant may be entitled to under the SWA scheme is an Emergency Needs Payment (ENP).  Provision in relation to the payment of ENPs is contained in section 181 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which states that &ldquo;a health board may, in any case where it considers it reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, so to do, determine that supplementary welfare allowance shall be paid to a person by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  There is not an automatic or statutory right of entitlement to an ENP and my Department has no role in determining individual entitlement.  The person concerned recently applied for an ENP to help clear ESB arrears.  He was supplied with an application form for completion which has not yet been returned to the health centre.  Under the SWA scheme, assistance with fuel bills is provided in line with the practices set out in the code of practice agreed between the health boards, Bord Gáis Éireann, and the ESB.  The code was designed principally to assist people who are having frequent difficulties in meeting their fuel bills by setting up a repayment agreement with the company involved.  The payment agreement takes account of the customer's income and general circumstances.</P>
    <P>In addition to the code of practice on fuel debts, my Department funds a money advice and budgeting service (MABS), which provides confidential advice from trained personnel on money maintenance and debt management in centres throughout the country.  There is a MABS office located in the Mayo area at North Mayo MABS, Moy Valley, Cathedral Road, Ballina, Co. Mayo.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether it is unjust that a parent on unemployment benefit loses the child benefit allowance when that child reaches the age of 18 years in spite of the fact that the child may be at a second-level school while those in receipt of unemployment assistance may retain the allowance; and if he will change this regulation as a matter of urgency.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. This is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>However, it is recognised that the payment of child dependant allowances to social welfare recipients can act as a disincentive to taking up employment.  The policy direction of this Government has, therefore, been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit and this has been continued in the 1997 budget package.  This approach involves increasing child benefit as part of a planned strategy of moving towards a more integrated child income support system.  However, it is recognised that there are substantial costs involved in moving towards a more universal system of income support for children.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, priority has been given in this year's budget to assist low income families and in particular, larger families.  This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children by £5, 14.7 per cent, and in addition, increasing the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child, by £1, 3.4 per cent. When taken together with the substantial increase of £7 for each child provided for in 1995 and £2 for each child provided for in 1996, this represents an increase of 50 per cent in the rate payable in respect of the first two children and 56 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of third and subsequent children since this Government came to office.</P>
      <P>Child benefit remains one of the most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes as it is not taxable, is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc.  Therefore, it cannot act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in the context of reducing disincentives to work, priority is being given to family income supplement, FIS, as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children. Accordingly, FIS is being reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.  As a first step, this year's budget provides <Col N="869" /> that with effect from June, FIS will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions and levies payable.  Pension contributions will also be deductible.  The income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS are also being increased by £10 at each point.</P>
    <P>These two measures will mean that virtually all current FIS recipients will get an increase of at least £6 in their weekly payment.  FIS recipients who pay PRSI, those earning over £80 per week, and the levies, those earning over £197 per week, will receive extra increases.</P>
    <P>Given the Government's stated policy direction, it is not proposed to extend child dependant allowances on the lines suggested.</P>

      <P>Overall ministerial responsibility for the administration of the special programme for peace and reconciliation lies with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific tourism programme in the special support programme for peace and reconciliation, tourism-related projects are eligible for funding under a number of measures. These include: urban and village renewal and tourism &mdash; using European Regional Development Fund funds; village renewal and tourism &mdash; EAGGF funds; community-led development &mdash; using European Regional Development Fund funds and co-operation between public bodies &mdash; using European Regional Development Fund and ESF funds.</P>
      <P>In general terms, tourism related projects are eligible for up to 75 per cent grant assistance under the programme.</P>
      <P>The peace programme operates by placing a particular emphasis on a bottom-up approach to development.  Under the terms of the programme, the work of initiating and approving projects for grant assistance is carried out at local level by the county council-led task forces in the case of the urban and rural regeneration measures and by the specially appointed intermediary bodies, ADM Ltd and the Combat Poverty Agency in the case of the Community-led development measure.  However, I understand that a significant proportion of the total grant assistance approved in 1996 by the county tasks forces is destined for tourism-related projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the productive investment and industrial development measure includes a scheme for providing subsidised loans for which tourism projects are eligible.  I am advised by the <Col N="870" /> Department of Finance, which is responsible for its implementation, that the scheme is now fully subscribed and that a significant number of the projects approved to date are in the tourism sector.</P>

      <P>Under section 5 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, local authorities in the areas designated under the Act may grant a two-thirds remission of rates for ten years on industrial premises.  Such rates remission is an additional incentive which may be offered to industry in such areas.</P>
      <P>Under the urban renewal scheme, rates remission is available on a sliding scale over ten years for enterprise establishing in new or refurbished buildings in specified areas.  The scheme is administered by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>These two approaches allow rates remission to be used in a targeted way to achieve regional and urban renewal objectives by encouraging industrial development and employment creation.</P>

      <P>I understand, from the Irish Insurance Federation, that problems concerning the availability of insurance for public service vehicles arises from time to time with first time policyholders with no previous experience in a particular associated trade or service.  Insurers will regard such policyholders as a higher risk category and accordingly accept or reject such individual risks on the basis of their own underwriting experience.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the Declined Cases Committee was established in 1981 under an agreement between the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the authorised motor insurance companies to consider motor insurance risks which have been refused by individual insurance companies.  Similar mechanisms exist throughout the EU to deal with so called, aggravated risks.  The committee is composed of representatives from the authorised insurance companies under the chairmanship of the Irish Insurance Federation.  The agreement provides that, before a case may be considered by the committee, it is necessary to obtain written refusals to quote from five authorised motor insurers.  The committee then nominates one of the authorised insurance companies, normally the first company approached, to quote for the risk.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Irish Insurance Federation that recently, an increasing number of hackney and taxi drivers have approached the Declined Cases Committee with a view to obtaining a quote for motor cover.  The federation has confirmed that such motorists have received a quote under the procedure of the declined cases agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on Monday, 17 February the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology, Deputy Rabbitte, led a fact-finding delegation from the Department of Enterprise and Employment, IDA and Forbairt to Drogheda to discuss the situation there with business people, large firms, their workers, trade union officials and others.  His conclusion was that it would be wrong and damaging to the town to give any currency to the notion that industrial relations in <Col N="872" /> Drogheda are any worse than elsewhere.  In reality the industrial relations climate in the town is not, essentially, very different from the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State was made aware of a perception among some industrialists, though, of an unwillingness on the part of some workers and their unions to accept change and more flexible work practices.  In an increasingly competitive environment an openness and a will to change and to adopt new work arrangements has become an essential ingredient of competitiveness. Unwillingness to adopt changes in the workplace or in the management of a firm's affairs could prove very damaging to maintaining prosperity or even to survival.  In exchanges with firms, their workers and the unions, he spoke of the need for all concerned to explore positively the introduction of change and adjustment in workplaces to competitive pressures.</P>
      <P>In those exchanges with the trade unions he was told that the workers are increasingly accepting the need for change.  This is encouraging. Efforts in this connection should be positively supported locally by the unions and the business sector.  While the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the industrial development agencies, in conjunction with the Louth local authority can provide resources, including a sufficiently large landbank of approximately 50 acres to promote future industrial development, and while the town benefits from the well-regarded regional technical college in the county, ultimately only the local workers and employers themselves can bring about a change in this perception. This can best be achieved by their demonstrating clearly that they can solve their differences and address the need for change in a constructive manner and in a spirit of co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is fully aware that while the country is enjoying an unprecedented job creation period at the moment, there is a problem of job losses in Drogheda in firms undergoing a process of streamlining in the face of competitive pressures.  The town is currently undergoing a process of change, and while adjustment difficulties are being experienced, particularly in the older companies such as McDonnells Limited, he nevertheless remains very positive about the future of the town with companies such as DCS Communications Limited, manufacturers of telecommunication network systems already employing 30 people and expected to employ 450 in the long-term.</P>

    <P>As indicated in my replies to Deputies O'Hanlon and Leonard on 4 February last, while it is true that performance in job creation in 1996 in the north east region was disappointing, this was principally due to the substantial job losses, approximately 504 in Keytronic, Dundalk during the year.  Also, turbulence in the market for beef as well as over capacity in the pig slaughtering facilities nationally resulted in significant job losses in the pigment and beef processing sectors in the north east which increased the job loss figure in the region.  Steps are well under way to offset these losses.</P>
    <P>New IDA projects announced during 1996 for the northeast region, EPC Corporation and DSC Communication, are currently in start-up phases and will, over the next few years, create significant employment and assist in re-establishing growth across the region.</P>
    <P>More generally, I made an overall statement on the need to ensure greater regional distribution of new employment in response to the priority question from Deputy O'Rourke on 4 February 1997.</P>

      <P>In January 1996, I established a steering committee with terms of reference to examine the main features of the information society, with a view to elaborating a strategy and action plan for Ireland.  It is hoped to publish the report of the committee in the near future.  Awareness was one of the issues addressed by the committee.  It is important that all citizens should be aware of the implications and potential of the information society.  I would welcome any contribution that the public libraries can make to any awareness programme.</P>

      <P>The EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation contains a measure designed to assist actions of a cross-Border nature between public bodies in the areas of agriculture and forestry.  Under this measure a cross-Border initiative &mdash; the Erne catchment nutrient management scheme &mdash; which is designed to address farm sourced pollution, has been put in place by my Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  The public funding provision for the southern Border counties is £0.666 million up to 1997 with an equivalent provision for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Under the arrangements introduced in 1996, farmers are required to apply tags to calves born on their holdings.  There is no evidence available at this stage to show that these arrangements are proving to be unsatisfactory.  In this regard, there has been a very low level of requests for replacement tags from herdowners which would suggest a low fall-out rate of tags. At the same time and given the importance of having a secure tagging and registration system for cattle, my Department will continue to monitor the position.</P>

      <P>I assume the question refers to the claim presented by PDFORRA for the payment of subsistence <Col N="882" /> allowance to certain members of the Permanent Defence Force who took part in security operations during the period January 1992 to May 1992.  The question of the entitlement of these personnel to the payment of subsistence allowance in respect of these operations is presently the subject of legal proceedings and you will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is <i>sub judice</i> it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Marine owns the fishing rights in the estuaries of the Owenduff and Owenmore rivers.  Twenty-five special local draft net licences are issued by the Regional Fisheries Board in respect of the estuarial fisheries.</P>
      <P>A short stretch of the tidal waters of the Owenduff River is regarded as free.  The fisheries upstream of the estuarial fisheries on the Owenduff and Owenmore rivers are for the most part privately owned.  Details of the ownership of such fisheries and of legal transactions affecting such ownership may be investigated in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.</P>
      <P>Neither the Central Fisheries Board nor the North Western Regional Fisheries Board owns any of these fisheries.  The Irish Land Commission owns a fishery on the Owenmore comprising part of the Muing River, the Oweninny River and a portion of Lake Dahybaun.  (Land Commission fisheries are managed by the Central Fisheries Board.)  This has been let to a local hotelier by the Central Fisheries Board on behalf of the Irish Land Commission.  This licence expires on 31 December 1997.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Central Fisheries Board that Carrowmore Lake on the Owenmore River is a State lake.</P>
      <P>The North Western Regional Fisheries Board has general responsibility for the protection, conservation, improvement and development of inland fisheries in, among other areas, the Mayo region.</P>

      <Quest>the reason draft net fishermen were completely unrepresented on the Salmon Task Force Committee; if this imbalance on the advisory committee explains the imbalance in the new conservation proposals which are in danger of putting draft net fishermen out of business and which are out of all proportion in relation to the impact that draft net fishing has on the salmon stock; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that draft new fishing has its own inbuilt conservation in view of the fact that fishermen can only fish 30 hours per week out of 168 hours since this type of fishing is governed by the tides, that fishermen can only fish in low water and there is a further inbuilt conservation in that the legal limit is 30-40 yards less that the river width; if the existing automatic conservation in the draft net fishing business was brought to his attention before he agreed to the current changes; if so, the reason and the way in which he agreed to a total imbalance against draft net fishermen; and if he will make a statement on the matter in relation to the possibility of urgently redressing the situation in the current season by allowing the draft net fishermen to fish from 1 April 1997 on a five day week instead of from 15 May 1997 on a four day week to retain their livelihoods as draft fishermen in view of the fact that the current proposal reduces their working year drastically from six months to ten weeks.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 281 and 282 together.  The Salmon Management Task Force was established late in 1995 because of concern about the serious decline in salmon stocks.  The task force members were appointed in an individual capacity, as an expert group with a mandate to consult widely with all the fishery interests with a view to recommending practical proposals on future salmon management strategies.</P>
      <P>The task force undertook wide ranging regional consultation with all the relevant interests, including draft netsmen, and received over 230 submissions from the various sectors. The task force report endorsed the need for a rebalance of the salmon catch between the various sectors and for a new approach to salmon management.</P>
      <P>Since the report was published, there have been further consultations at regional level and meetings with the key sectoral interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new conservation regulations introduced for the 1997 season complete the first phase of implementing the recommendations of the task force.  There has been, at home and abroad, general <Col N="884" /> acceptance that the measures introduced for 1997 are necessary.  The measures contain gains as well as losses for the different sectors in the interest of optimising the resource itself.  For example, the significant restrictions introduced on drift nets, particularly in respect of sea area and days fished will bring benefits for draft net fishermen through improved returns of salmon to the estuaries.</P>
    <P>In view of expressed concerns about the specific and localised impact on the draft net fishery of the new conservation measures, it has already been decided not to restrict these tidally dependant fisheries to daylight hours only.  The weekend close period has also been staggered between the drift and draft-net fisheries which will allow the draft netsmen one clear day each week when there is no drift net activity.</P>
    <P>In addition to actively encouraging a local catchment management approach to cater for specific needs in each area, the overall concerns and needs of the draftnets men and others engaged in the estuarial salmon fishery are currently being assessed from all relevant perspectives &mdash; and there will be further consultations on the matter.  The concerns of the Boyne fishermen will be encompassed in this process of review and consultation.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a grant for a proposed £5 million marine development project at Moneypoint, County Clare on the Shannon Estuary has been withdrawn and the funding for this project then allocated to roads as recently announced at a meeting of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</Quest>

      <P>There has been no decision at any level to withdraw funding from this project.</P>
      <P>Due to the scale of the project an external evaluation of the proposal is required as set out in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 (OPT).  This evaluation has recently been completed and is being examined by the Department prior to submission to the OPT Monitoring Committee.</P>
      <P>The mid term evaluation of the OPT is under way at present.  Recommendations on the future allocation of funding will be made only by the monitoring committee following meetings to be held in March and April and, finally, in the context of the mid term review of the Community Support Framework (CSF) in June 1997.  No moneys have been transferred from the seaports measure to the roads measure in the OPT.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to ensuring that the full allocation for seaports under the OPT will be fully utilised by the end of 1999.</P>
