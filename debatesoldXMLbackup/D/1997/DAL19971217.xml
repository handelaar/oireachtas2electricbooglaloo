      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  This relates to statements on the EU summit.  To assist the House in preparing for this debate, will the Taoiseach clarify whether the White Paper on the Amsterdam Treaty is ready?  The Taoiseach said here on 4 December that it was ready but the Tánaiste said yesterday that it was not ready.  This is a matter of some importance.  We should know, before we make arrangements for the debate today on the <Col N="611" /> EU Summit whether the Government has prepared its White Paper on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on 4 December that the paper was practically ready, that there were a few small matters to be cleared up.  I was advised that it would be ready by Christmas.  I am aware that it was raised here yesterday.  I checked this morning. The paper will be ready by Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware of the horrible revelations about what may have been happening in Galway.  The child pornography legislation is, therefore, a very high priority.  Why is this legislation, which was promised for before Christmas, not ready and when will it be ready?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware of the allegations in some of this morning's newspapers. The Garda are carrying out an investigation and the full rigours of the law will be applied so that this matter is dealt with in the most stringent way <Col N="612" /> possible.  The child pornography Bill was cleared by Cabinet yesterday and it is proposed to publish it tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the Government's attitude to a report to the effect that it is contemplating the introduction of legislation to amend the way in which it conducts referendum campaigns on foot of the interpretation by the Supreme Court of the McKenna judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is examining the matter to ascertain the best way of presenting the cases in a referendum to the people.  The allparty committee on the Constitution has had a preliminary look at the matter, and I thank it for doing so.  It seems that the best way of dealing with the matter is by way of legislation.  It does not seem that it can be dealt with adequately by way of a directive or administrative means. Urgent attention is being given to the matter.  I am on record as saying we hope to be able to say what we will do when we publish the White Paper in January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pursue a matter raised by Deputy Quinn on legislation to allow adequate information to be given on the Government's proposals for ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.  Is it the Government's intention to introduce legislation which will be referred to the courts for testing as to its constitutionality before coming into effect and, if so, will the programme of preparation for the legislation allow sufficient time for this process to be gone through before the referendum campaign starts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is under consideration in the context of the overall issue.  If the legislation is referred to the courts this will have implications for the referendum as the 60 day rule will apply.  It is unlikely that a decision will be given sooner than 60 days, which will put back the referendum.  This may not be that bad as we can still deal with it.</P>
      <P>We are working through the proposals and the legislation is at an early stage of preparation.  I have asked for the matter to be treated urgently. I am aware from our preliminary meetings that for the referendum to be successful we must have legislation.  Deputy Bruton is familiar with the matter and has made some useful suggestions.  He is aware that it is essential we do this as otherwise we will not be able to adequately sell to the public or properly explain an extremely important treaty in terms of the future of Europe.  We must address this issue before we finalise the matter. However, this will not delay the publication of the White Paper.</P>

Does the Minister for Finance intend to follow the procedure established in recent years to publish an advance statement of the primary provisions of the Finance Bill to allow discussion before the Bill is published?  When does the Taoiseach <Col N="616" /> expect the consultants' report on the housing market will be published?  Will he provide Dáil time for debate on the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies, particularly the Opposition spokespersons on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for their co-operation in taking all Stages of this Bill today.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the transfer into the State of persons who have been sentenced to periods of imprisonment greater than the maximum penalties allowed under our law for similar offences.  The immediate effect of the Bill when enacted should be to assist in facilitating the transfer of seven Provisional IRA prisoners who are currently in the United Kingdom.  The Bill is relatively short, but it is of particular importance in the context of confidence building measures.</P>
      <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 provides the legislative basis for the operation of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons between Ireland and other parties to the convention.  Section 7 of the Act provides for the issue of a warrant by a court here authorising the continued enforcement by the State of the sentence imposed by the sentencing state.  In accordance with article 10 of the convention, section 7 permits a court to adapt the sentence to a sentence prescribed by the law of the State for an offence similar to the offence for which the sentence was imposed where the sentence concerned is, in its legal nature or duration, incompatible with the law of the State.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill a court will be permitted to adapt a sentence that is incompatible by its duration with the law of the State only where an application in this regard is made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This should facilitate the negotiation of transfers with States which insist that there can be no question of the sentence imposed in the sentencing State being reduced, while at the same time allowing a mechanism for the adaptation of the duration of sentences where the States in question have no objection to this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be helpful, before going into the detail of the Bill, to give some brief background information about the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which is <Col N="618" /> the basis for our 1995 legislation.  The initiative for the Convention came in 1978 when, at a Council of Europe Conference, Ministers for Justice discussed the problems posed by prisoners of foreign nationality, including the question of providing procedures for their transfer so that they may serve their sentences in their home country. The text of the convention was approved by the Committee of Ministers in 1982, and opened for signature in March 1983.  The operative date for the convention &mdash; the date on which it came into force &mdash; was 1 July 1985.  Ireland signed the convention a year later on 20 August 1986 and ratified it following the enactment of the 1995 legislation.</P>
    <P>The aim of the convention is to facilitate the transfer to his or her home State of a person who has been sentenced in a foreign state.  The convention provides a procedural framework for such transfers and seeks to provide a simple and expeditious mechanism whereby the repatriation of sentenced persons may take place.  The policy of the convention, which is based on humanitarian considerations, is to overcome the difficulties posed for prisoners serving sentences in foreign jurisdictions through, for example, absence of contacts with relatives and differences in language and culture.</P>
    <P>For a transfer to take place a number of conditions must be met.  The sentenced person must be a national of the State to which the transfer is sought; the judgment must be final; there must normally be at least six months of the sentence left to serve; the offence for which the sentenced person is imprisoned must also be a criminal offence in the State to which the transfer is sought; and there must be consent to the transfer from all parties, that is the person and the two States involved.</P>
    <P>Under the convention the receiving or administering State is given a choice between two ways of enforcing the sentence imposed by the sentencing State.  It may continue to enforce the sentence, in which case it is bound, subject to any technical modifications that may prove necessary, by the nature and duration of the sentence as determined in the original sentencing State.  Alternatively, it may adapt the sentence to one prescribed by its law for the same or a similar offence.</P>
    <P>Article 10 of the convention is concerned with continued enforcement of sentences.  It states:</P>
    <P>1.  In the case of continued enforcement, the administering State shall be bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the sentencing State.</P>
    <P>2.  If, however, this sentence is by its nature or duration incompatible with the law of the administering State, or its law so requires, that State may, by a court or administrative order, adapt the sanction to the punishment or measure prescribed by its own law for a similar offence.  As to its nature, the punishment or measure shall, as far as possible, correspond <Col N="619" /> with that imposed by the sentence to be enforced.  It shall not aggravate, by its nature or duration, the sanction imposed in the sentencing State, nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering State.</P>
    <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 has operated successfully so far, but an issue which needs to be addressed has been identified in relation to a number of prisoners in England who are seeking repatriation and are serving sentences longer than the sentences which could be imposed under our laws for similar offences.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, section 7 of the 1995 Act provides for the issue of a warrant by a court here, the effect of which is to authorise the continued enforcement by the State of the sentence imposed by the sentencing State.  However, in line with article 10 of the convention, section 7 permits a court &ldquo;if the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing State concerned is in its legal nature or duration incompatible with the law of the State&rdquo; to adapt the sentence to a sentence prescribed by the law of the State for an offence similar to the offence for which the sentence was imposed.  In adapting the sentence the new sentence may not aggravate it by its legal nature or duration or exceed the maximum penalty prescribed by the law of the State for a similar offence.</P>
    <P>In operating the convention between here and the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom authorities have sought specific assurances about the length of time to be served by persons seeking transfers here.  This has not given rise to difficulties where the sentences at issue would have been similar to those available in our law.  Under the terms of the 1995 Act, it is a matter for the High Court to decide whether a sentence is incompatible in its legal nature or duration and whether to adapt the sentence.  Therefore I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, would not be in a position to assure the United Kingdom authorities, in cases where the sentences were greater than those permitted by our law for similar offences, that such sentences would not be adapted by the courts to the maximum permitted under our law.</P>
    <P>Neither the convention nor the 1995 Act make the adaptation of a sentence mandatory on a State.  In the Act the court is given discretion as to whether to adapt a sentence if it is &ldquo;by its legal nature or duration&rdquo; incompatible with the law of the State.  While it is relatively easy to envisage circumstances where a sentence would be incompatible by its legal nature, for example penal servitude, which has been abolished here, there is no authority available to indicate how incompatibility in relation to duration of sentence would be determined.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in the Bill it would be left entirely to the court to adapt sentences where there is an incompatibility in legal nature. However, where there is an incompatibility as to the duration, the court could adapt the sentence <Col N="620" /> only on the application of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Even then it would still be a matter for the court to decide that the duration of the sentence involved was incompatible with our law.  This approach will allow me to offer assurances to those jurisdictions who are concerned that transferred prisoners would receive a reduction of sentence while allowing adaptation where jurisdictions are prepared to accept this.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on the individual provisions of the Bill, it might be helpful to give some brief statistics on applications under the Act.  One hundred and two applications have been processed by my Department for transfer into the jurisdiction.  Successive Ministers have consented to the transfer of 53 applicants.  Of these, 21 have now been transferred.  This included 11 Provisional IRA prisoners.  A total of 14 prisoners have been transferred out of the State to date.</P>
    <P>Section 1 involves amendment of section 7 of the 1995 Act by way of substitution of new subsections for subsections (5) and (6).  The new subsections will provide for applications to be made, in appropriate cases, to adapt the legal nature of a sentence and to adapt the duration of a sentence where they are incompatible with the position under our law.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (5)(a) will provide that when the High Court is requested to issue a warrant for the transfer of a prisoner into the State and where the sentence imposed by the sentencing State is, by its legal nature, incompatible with our law, the court may adapt the sentence to one which is prescribed by our law for a similar offence.  Subsection (5)(b) deals with the situation where the duration of a sentence is incompatible with the duration which could be imposed under our law for a similar offence, that is, one which is longer than could be imposed here.  In those cases the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have absolute discretion, where he or she thinks it appropriate to do so, to include in an application for a warrant authorising the transfer an application that the court adapt the duration of the sentence to one prescribed under our law for a similar offence.  If the Minister makes such an application and the sentence imposed by the sentencing State is by its duration incompatible with our law, the court may adapt the duration of the sentence to conform with our law.</P>
    <P>The amendment to subsection (6) of section 7 arises as a result of the amendment to subsection (5) which I have outlined.  The new subsection (6)(a) will provide that the legal nature of a sentence adapted under subsection (5)(a) will, as far as practicable, correspond to the legal nature of the sentence originally imposed.  However, the subsection goes on to stress that the adapted sentence must not either aggravate the original one or exceed the maximum penalty prescribed by the law of the State for a similar offence.</P>
    <P>Under the new subsection (6)(b), where the duration of the sentence is adapted following an <Col N="621" /> application in that regard by the Minister, the same conditions will apply &mdash; the adapted sentence must not either aggravate the original sentence or exceed the maximum prescribed by our law for a similar offence.</P>
    <P>To remove any confusion which might arise from the use of the term &ldquo;legal nature of a sentence&rdquo;, the Bill makes provision for the insertion of an interpretation of that term.  Section 10(7), which is a new subsection, provides that a reference to the legal nature of a sentence does not include a reference to the duration of such a sentence. Sections 2 and 3 arise from Labour Party amendments which I accepted when the Bill was going through the Seanad.  They deal essentially with the need to deal as expeditiously as possible with applications for transfers and to keep applicants informed of progress in relation to them. Section 4 is in standard form and sets out the short title, stating it will be cited together with the 1995 Act.</P>
    <P>They are the provisions of this short but important Bill.  I am sure it will receive widespread support in the House and I thank Deputies for their co-operation in agreeing to take all Stages today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and I acknowledge the Minister's statement that he appreciates the indulgence of the House in agreeing to take all Stages today.  Such a debate is not without precedent but I hope the Minister accepts that the Opposition, particularly Fine Gael, will not allow him to do this in future.  We accept the urgency of the legislation and the Minister's comment that it will have an immediate effect on facilitating the transfer of seven prisoners.  I hope the Minister is accurate in his use of the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; and that there will be progress on the prisoner issue when this legislation is enacted. I take the Minister's word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; at face value.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through all Stages so that it can be sent to Áras an Uachtaráin as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>We would not be dealing with this legislation were it not for the participation of all parties in the peace process.  It is important to note that the European convention and the introduction of legislation in this jurisdiction to allow for the transfer of prisoners is a basic human right which should not be seen as a political gesture or a confidence building measure in the peace process. Even if there was no peace process, the transfer of sentenced persons convention should have been signed and ratified by this jurisdiction and the 1995 Act put in place.  That convention should operate in accordance with our human rights legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right and proper that where persons on conviction are removed from society and restricted in their movements by a custodial sentence, their families should be allowed to visit them and to keep in close contact.  Rehabilitation is a fundamental cornerstone of our penal code. Unfortunately, the lack of a transfer arrangement <Col N="622" /> over the years has ensured that the prisoner's family, not the prisoner, has suffered.  Society has not given adequate recognition to the suffering of close members of prisoners' families.  There are issues of cost, inconvenience, particularly for those families who visit prisoners in far away jurisdictions, and loneliness not only for the prisoners but perhaps more particularly for their families. Families suffer more than anyone else.  We have not given sufficient recognition to the suffering of the families of prisoners in Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of the peace process.</P>
    <P>This Bill seems to be directly related to the peace process.  I welcome the changes which will help the movement of prisoners between the British jurisdiction and this State.  There are a small number of Republican prisoners in British jails, although the figures must be revised following a court decision in London yesterday.  Some of those who wish to be transferred have already arrived here.  I hope the passage of this legislation will allow for the imminent transfer of a further seven prisoners.</P>
    <P>I regret that progress to date has been slow, particularly during the lifetime of John Major's Government, and that an opportunity to build confidence was lost.  No regard was given by that Government to the role of the prisoners in the initial ceasefire in August 1994.  It did not give them any credit for the work they did or for their involvement in the consultation process.  That allowed a climate of frustration and anxiety to develop which has not been sufficiently improved since then.  Deputy Neville has expert knowledge of the relationship between the prison authorities and the prisoners in British jurisdictions and he will be able to update the House on the current situation there.  He and other Members of the House, particularly of the Labour Party, must be complimented for undertaking many initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the receiving institution which I assume will be Portlaoise Prison in my constituency. I ask the Minister to comment on a proposal which was floated two years ago that consideration would be given to the transfer of Republican prisoners from Portlaoise Prison to Castlerea in County Roscommon.  My understanding was that this proposal did not become a reality because of the resumption of violence by the IRA following the Canary Wharf bombing. Now that a second ceasefire is in place and appears to be stable, has the Minister given any consideration to that plan?</P>
    <P>One of the reasons such a plan was proposed was to make a further 50 or 60 prison spaces available in Portlaoise Prison.  The high security wing in the prison has one prisoner per two cells or two prisoners per three cells.  Given the Minister's programme for prison spaces and the improvements within the prison system, I thought he would use every opportunity to free up prison spaces not for Republican terrorist prisoners but for ordinary criminals, the bulk of whom travel <Col N="623" /> to Portlaoise from Dublin.  Perhaps the Minister could address this matter in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the speed with which he moved on a proposal to construct a new unit within the grounds of Portlaoise Prison, which is a sensible location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that more progress was not made on this matter when my party was in Government over the past two years.  I understand the plan was first mooted in the 1970s.  It subsequently died and I am delighted the Minister has decided to implement it.  I look forward to a speedy construction of the unit and hope it will be operational soon.  The prison in Portlaoise is of great importance to the town and the county of Laois.  Portlaoise, the capital town of the county, has in many respects suffered down through the years by dint of the negative impact of having a prison building not too far from the centre of town, particularly since the prison has been such a high security institution over the years.  The people of the town have lived with this problem and one of the reasons they were prepared to accept a prison, warts and all, was because of the obvious economic and employment benefits.</P>
      <P>The potential of the new unit is not to be underestimated.  I hope the structure and design of the prison building will be more pleasing to the eye and in keeping with the environment of the area than one might normally accept from such a building where the emphasis exclusively appears to be on bricks, mortar and bars.  I hope, whatever plan is finally agreed upon between the Department and the Office of Public Works, that an element of sensitivity and environmental consideration will be taken on board.  Normally it is required under law that an environmental impact assessment is undertaken for a building of this magnitude.  In this case, although, there is no need in law for such an assessment nevertheless there is a duty on the part of the authorities to ensure some assessment is undertaken.  Whatever structure is ultimately built, it should be in keeping with the environment of the surrounding area, particularly the buildings on the Dublin road.  A submission was made on this issue by Laois County Council and I hope its details will not only be carefully studied, but taken on board in the context of the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the efforts on the prisoner issue by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair since the summer.  Movement on it has provoked loyalist concern that the transfer of prisoners represents another concession to republicans which should be resisted as unfair.  I am not sure how this jurisdiction can assist the issue of loyalist prisoners but balance and parity should be foremost in the equation.  All confidence measures put in place must strike a balance if there is to be movement <Col N="624" /> towards a lasting peace.  The loyalist ceasefire has been in place for three years and credit must be accorded to the fringe loyalist parties for ensuring it has remained in place, but they repeatedly point out that they have little to show on prison reform.  I accept there are no loyalists in British jails seeking transfers simply because the campaign of destruction within the UK, particularly in England, has been perpetrated almost exclusively by republicans.  They are correct when they say the transfer issue is predominantly a republican matter, but other measures should be taken on board to ensure loyalist prisoners and parties do not feel aggrieved by any progress that is made on the issue.</P>
    <P>Progress must be reported in the case of prisoners on all sides of the Northern conflict.  The only proposed loyalist prisoner transfer was that of Jason Campbell, which was a shambles and an embarrassment to those involved.  I accept the early release of paramilitary prisoners is a totally separate issue from the Bill, but one which must not be too far down the agenda as political developments move forward.  The extension of Christmas parole from Portlaoise and the granting of parole to those to which it has not been granted to date must be considered in the context of the continuing ceasefire.  This is appropriate having regard to the record of those who have been granted parole in abiding by the regulations in the past.</P>
    <P>I am sure other confidence building measures will be considered by the Minister during the four week Christmas respite from the talks.  If progress is to be made, the ordinary citizenry of Northern Ireland must see a dividend from what is happening and that, unfortunately, has not been the case, as the talks have almost exclusively concentrated on constitutional and structural issues. There is a feeling on the part of Northern people that there has been no real dividend as far as their daily lives are concerned.  I hope the Government and, more importantly the British Government, will look at areas such as demilitarisation.  People living in Border areas have justified grievances with the lack of relaxation on the part of the security forces and much of the security in these areas has been almost intimidatory in recent times.</P>
    <P>The question of parades is another vexed issue and by the time the talks resume in January the House of Commons will have enacted parades legislation.  I hope the Parades Commission is given the type of remit that will not allow it to be merely a toothless tiger or to become in any way imbalanced or seen to be representing one view as opposed to the other.  Unless there is movement on the Bloody Sunday issue before the resumption of the talks, it will be a most vexed issue also, as we approach another anniversary of the atrocity.  I hope an independent inquiry and an apology will be forthcoming.  Initiatives must be taken on the issues of policing and fair employment during the talks recess.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> The Bill is similar to the 1995 Bill as it favours the families of prisoners rather than the prisoners themselves.  I recall the sad plight of Paddy Kelly, a prisoner from my constituency, about whom there was an unfortunate wrangle between both jurisdictions before his transfer was effected.  He died a short time after but the lack of compassion and the bungling and procrastination in the case was breathtaking and scandalous.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to tariffs in regard to some of those who wish to be transferred.  This is an area where the delay has been totally unacceptable.  The setting of tariffs is very important and a source of great concern where, for example, commitment after commitment has been given to the Balcombe Street gang but tariffs have not been set and their transfers cannot be effected until that happens.  I refer to a letter from the Northern Ireland Office dated July 1997 which stated that tariffs would be set a short time thereafter.  In 1996 Irish embassy officials were told by the Home Office that tariffs would be set by the end of the year.  In July 1997 the same officials were told they would be set by the end of the month and that did not happen.  In September the embassy was again informed they would be set by the end of the month and there was no action.  Deputy Cecilia Keaveney was told on 1 November that they would be set by the end of the month and that did not happen.  Action of an urgent nature is required on this.  I regret the administrative procedures between Britain and Ireland are cumbersome and time consuming.  It requires a real engagement on the part of those involved.  The Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs need to be engaged in this matter if there is to be real progress.  Unfortunately we did not see that engagement on the part of Sir Patrick Mayhew or on the part of Michael Howard and his junior Minister Ann Widdicombe, who were less than helpful in the operation of the European Convention.</P>
    <P>The measure today should be supported.  There are issues to be debated on Committee Stage which I hope will lead to clarification on a number of points, with particular reference to the guarantee of sentences, the question of remissions and the constitutional issues.  I hope the Bill will be enacted at the earliest opportunity. I am pleased the Minister has brought the matter before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is welcome as part of a confidence building measure between the various elements engaged in the peace process. The legislation shows a certain level of compassion for prisoners and their concerns and will make life much easier for the families in their efforts to visit and keep in touch with them.  It would also help prisoners more easily reintegrate into society on release from prison.  This in turn would help them find a new life away from crime. The Bill is based on humanitarian standards and decency which will allow prisoners to serve their <Col N="626" /> prison terms in their native country, close to their families and friends.</P>
      <P>The Bill arises from a European Convention introduced in 1983 and ratified in 1996.  It is noteworthy that Ireland was the last country in the EU to ratify this convention.  This legislation follows on from and is an amendment to the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>The objective of the Bill is to provide a means of dealing with concerns that may arise in relation to a number of prisoners in the UK who are seeking repatriation and are serving sentences longer than what could be imposed for similar offences committed here, or alternatively in the case of prisoners sentenced in the UK where similar provisions do not exist in Irish law.</P>
      <P>The Bill ensures that repatriation to Ireland to serve out a prison sentence will not mean the term served will be less than if the prisoner had remained in the UK.  This is primarily due to concerns expressed by the UK Government.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling that prior to the introduction of the 1995 Act, some held the view that there would be a huge influx of prisoners as a consequence of the enactment of that legislation. Those fears were unfounded and approximately 10 per cent of prisoners entitled to apply for repatriation have done so to date.</P>
      <P>This Bill is particularly appropriate to a country such as Ireland.  Given that this country is an island, any Irish person who wishes to visit a prisoner in the UK or on mainland Europe must of necessity travel long distances with consequent large expenses and a good deal of inconvenience. This new Bill might result in a speedier processing of transfers than has been the case up to now.  I understand that in as many as two-thirds of cases there are inordinate delays in processing. This is not acceptable.</P>

    <P>It is important that the provisions in this Bill are administered in an efficient manner so that applicants can have their cases dealt with in a speedy manner.  It is appropriate that the Minister should set some guidelines and take initiatives, either in his Department or with the British Home Office, to ensure decisions are reached rapidly.  It is important that prisoners are kept informed of the state of play at regular intervals in relation to progress or lack of it in their application for a transfer.  The amendments accepted by the Minister in the Seanad from my colleague, Senator Joe Costello, are welcome.  Will the Minister explain why the provisions found necessary to be introduced in this amended Bill were not introduced at an earlier stage when the parent Bill was being enacted?  This legislation is primarily designed to cover seven prisoners who have been anxious to return to Ireland for some time. Their applications have been pending for a long period under the earlier Act, yet it has taken until now to discover the flaws in the previous Act which are preventing their repatriation.  Their cases were allowed to lie dormant when it would have seemed reasonable to expect that the difficulties <Col N="627" /> preventing their repatriation would have been addressed at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the Seanad a number of issues were raised in respect of the constitutionality of this Bill.  Will the Minister outline the care he has taken to ensure the Bill is constitutional and is not open to being challenged?  The Bill will create a considerable disincentive for some prisoners to avail of its provisions because it provides that sentences handed down in other jurisdictions must be fully served here.  The policy on remission of sentences is much less generous here than in the UK and elsewhere.  If they remain in prisons outside Ireland they could not expect to fare worse and they would have a reasonable chance of faring better.  This is a problem which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Will the provisions of the Bill apply to those who have already returned to Ireland under the terms of the 1995 Act?  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this question.</P>
    <P>This legislation has been introduced as a means of enhancing the peace process and building confidence. If the peace process continues to develop and succeed, as we all sincerely hope it will, I am sure the question of an amnesty for many of those who have availed of transfers under this Act will arise.  In the event of an amnesty being granted, unless some initiative is taken by the Minister, those people who have availed of the provisions of this Bill will be locked into long sentences whereas they may be granted an amnesty if they remain outside the country.  The Bill is welcome as it will greatly benefit a small number of prisoners and their families.  However, broader questions arise in relation to whether it is compatible with the Constitution and whether it will give rise to serious anomalies as the peace process develops and expands.</P>
    <P>The Bill would appear to be primarily relevant to a small group of prisoners.  The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas has expressed concern about some of its implications.  Will the Minister consider putting a time limit on the period the Bill will remain in force, say, a year or two years?</P>
    <P>This Bill is important in that it takes into account the concerns of prisoners.  Prisoners had an important role in the peace process and I am glad the Bill recognises that role.</P>

      <P>On 12 December 1997, two days after this Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad, four Irish political prisoners &mdash; Joe O'Connell, Hugh Doherty, Harry Duggan and Eddie Butler &mdash; entered their 23rd year in English prisons.  When these men were sentenced Mr. Liam Cosgrave was Taoiseach.  For over two decades these men had to endure the worst of prison conditions in England, constant movement from prison to prison and the ordeal which that entails for families trying to visit their loved ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men and their families have served their time several times over.  They do not qualify for <Col N="628" /> repatriation because they have not received a tariff, that is a finite sentence from the British Government.  If and when this tariff is given they face the prospect of many more years in prison when repatriated to this jurisdiction.  I know the incredulity of these and other Irish prisoners at the Bill before the House.  The issue of transfer and repatriation predates the peace process and the IRA cessations.  It has been a just and reasonable demand of the prisoners and their relatives for as long as there have been Irish political and other prisoners in English jails.  Transfer and repatriation have been sought in vain for two decades. Campaigners met rejection, excuses and prevarication.  At this juncture I think of the suffering of Pat Kelly from County Laois &mdash; go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam dílis &mdash; and that of his partner, Angela, their child and family.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the legislation is long overdue. While this Bill is designed to facilitate repatriation, there is grave concern among prisoners and their families at the requirement for the Irish authorities to fully implement in this jurisdiction the savage sentences imposed on prisoners in England.  In the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons the first principle states, &ldquo;The Parties undertake to afford each other the widest measure of co-operation in respect of the transfer of sentenced persons in accordance with the provisions of this Convention&rdquo;. It is clear that if the British Government had given the widest measure of co-operation to the Irish Government, this Bill would not be before us.</P>
    <P>This is not a legal issue but a political one. Under the unamended Act there was no legal or technical impediment to the repatriation of all Irish political and other prisoners in England whatever the length of sentence.  It was the British Government's determination to extract the full measure of retribution in the imposition of savagely long sentences on Irish republicans that led to this legislation.  The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas has rightly pointed out that the issue of the integrity of sentences is ultimately a political and-or administrative one and should be addressed in that manner, that is, by political persuasion and administrative flexibility.  The amount of political persuasion applied by the representatives of the Irish Government to their counterparts in the British Government in this matter must be questioned.  I am certain that in this as in the treatment of Irish prisoners the British authorities have shown no administrative flexibility.</P>
    <P>This legislation is being rushed through in the last days before the House adjourns for Christmas.  It is couched in general terms.  The possible serious implications for political and non-political prisoners have not been fully explored.  The full implications for the right of this State to grant early releases or amnesties to certain prisoners held or to be held in prisons here are not clear.  The issue of remission of sentence is open to doubt in light of this legislation. <Col N="629" /> In an excellent contribution to the debate in the Seanad Senator O'Dowd stated, &ldquo;the downstream consequences are unforeseeable&rdquo;.  I echo that sentiment.</P>
    <P>By passing this Bill the House is granting to an external power effective control over the prison term applying to a section of the projected prison population in this State.  Thus the Bill is flawed in two fundamental respects.  It is legally unnecessary to achieve the purpose for which it is intended, that is, the repatriation of Irish republican prisoners, and it is framed in a general and sweeping way which could have unknown implications that would be open to legal challenge. While I acknowledge sincerely the goodwill of the Irish Government in attempting to facilitate repatriation and alleviate the plight of prisoners' families, it should go back to the drawing board and negotiate special arrangements with the British Government so that its right to release prisoners held in prisons here is unimpeded.  I offer my solidarity and support to Irish political prisoners in jails in Ireland, England and United States and especially to their families at Christmas time.  Regardless of whether a division is called, I formally wish to register my rejection of this proposal and would like the record to show that I stood against the measure.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is a small but important building block in the difficult and painstaking construction of a lasting peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland.  We only have to consider the current impasse in the Northern talks to appreciate just how difficult the process is proving to be.  There are, however, grounds for hope.  The talks will continue after Christmas and that in itself will offer opportunities for reconciling differences in an inclusive way.</P>
      <P>The issue of prisoners has been of central concern to the paramilitary groups on both sides. Concessions on prisoners can have an important function in reinforcing the message that democratic dialogue in a context of ceasefires on both sides produces real and tangible benefits.  They bring, too, responsibilities that cannot be ignored. The early release of prisoners was initiated by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government shortly after the first IRA ceasefire in 1994.  It was continued and accelerated by the rainbow Government up to the end of the ceasefire in 1996.  The release of prisoners is a demonstration of belief by the Government in the peace process and the commitment of those associated with paramilitaries to try to find a non-violent way forward.  On a number of occasions Democratic Left criticised the British Government for the slowness of the release of prisoners in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Confidence building has to be a two way process. Two men released by the previous Government have since appeared again in court on serious charges.  One is currently before the courts on the most serious charge possible, the capital murder of a garda.  Another had charges <Col N="630" /> dropped in the Special Criminal Court last week amidst allegations of intimidation of a key witness.</P>
    <P>The comment made by the Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams, &ldquo;good luck to him&rdquo;, following the escape from the Maze of IRA prisoner Liam Averill was, to say the least, misjudged.  This man was serving a sentence for the sectarian murder of two Protestants in County Derry.  How are the relatives of those murdered victims and the Protestant community in general expected to respond to Gerry Adams's comment?  Had Private Lee Clegg escaped from custody would Gerry Adams have said, &ldquo;good luck to him&rdquo;?  I doubt it.  It behoves him as much as any of us not to inflame passions in such a one-sided, glib way.</P>
    <P>We all need to be mindful of the victims when we consider the impact of this Bill.  Sadly, there have been too many.  Many have lost their lives while others have lost loved ones or suffered injuries and pain.  We need to acknowledge that the families of prisoners have done no wrong. Yet, they are often punished by the imprisonment of the offender.  The tribulations of families trying to keep contact and relationships going with prisoners located in another country are being acknowledged in a humane and decent way.  I welcome this.</P>
    <P>This Bill enables prisoners to be transferred to this State even though they have been sentenced to greater periods of imprisonment than are allowed under the law here for similar offences. Its immediate effect relates to seven Provisional IRA prisoners in Britain.  The transfer is part of the developing relationship between these islands and reflects in a small way an opening up of a further connection between us.</P>
    <P>In reply to the debate in the Seanad the Minister made a number of points relating to the Government's approach towards a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland.  I have sometimes been critical of him but in this instance I warmly applaud and support his views which outlined a balanced and realistic approach for the future.  He pointed out that Nationalists and Unionists must have an equal stake in their society, an equal sense of ownership.  How that is achieved depends to a great extent on the structures developed that can reflect the requirements of both communities. In the Framework Document a three strand approach includes new structures within Northern Ireland, new North-South bodies and new east-west bodies.  It is important each strand is given equal weight and importance.  The east-west bodies have only been sketchily outlined and the Government has indicated its willingness to involve itself fully in their construction.  In a sense the transfer of prisoners between these islands is an example of how co-operation can be built. Now that devolution is changing the nature of the relationship between Scotland, England and Wales it opens up possibilities of new arrangements that can concentrate on issues of mutual concern.  Obviously powers should be conceded to these bodies only where they are of clear, mutual <Col N="631" /> benefit.  There are obvious examples where this may be the case, such as those relating to the Irish Sea.  A nuclear processing plant has been located close to our shores, yet there is no clear means, other than the legal route, of resolving the difficulties that have arisen as a result of that placement.</P>
    <P>In turn, Dublin probably is the biggest urban conurbation located on the shores of the Irish Sea, which may be something that concerns coastal communities living in Britain.  Therefore, building a connection on the basis of common concerns could be very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from our interests in this, there is a central point relating to east-west bodies which would offer a balance to the North-South bodies already mooted and can provide the same assurance for Unionists that North-South bodies can provide for Nationalists.  This does not imply any move toward this Republic agreeing to integrate into the British State in any form, no more than it implies the integration of North and South without the full consent of the Northern Ireland communities.  What is clear is that this network of relationships can and will grow and develop. Successive Governments have worked toward this end.  I am very glad that this Government is taking a pro-active role in this regard and I have no doubt will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>At a time when there are indications of good progress overall at the talks on Northern Ireland this Bill represents a small but significant contribution to building confidence.</P>
    <P>I am unclear on the final point in the explanatory memorandum, that new staffing or financial implications do not arise as a result of the provisions of this Bill.  Recently I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister, to which he responded very fully on Wednesday, 10 December, which related to six men involved in a hostage taking incident at Mountjoy Prison, currently held in D Block, Portlaoise Prison.  I asked the Minister the terms of their imprisonment, the time they had to spend in their cells, whether they had access to educational facilities and so on.  I also asked the cost of maintaining somebody in that block in Portlaoise Prison.  While we are all aware that such costs are high, the Minister's reply surprised me.  The concluding paragraph states:</P>
    <P>The average annual cost of keeping an offender in Portlaoise Prison is approximately £105,000.  This figure takes into account approximately £4.8 million for overtime generally in the prison.  The amount of this overtime attributable to the custody of the prisoners in question may vary from time to time.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point.  While I accept that that is an average figure, the immediate impact of the enactment of this Bill will be that seven IRA prisoners will be returned. Surely that will have staffing and cost implications, on which I should like the Minister to <Col N="632" /> elaborate.  I also seek his views on the overtime costs of prison officers.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister and the previous Government have initiated a prison building programme, it is important to deal with this issue once and for all.  I do not think anybody can accept that overtime generally in Portlaoise Prison can be supported to the extent of £4.8 million, an inordinate amount, unsustainable in the longer term.  My understanding is that conditions of pay have not been updated to take into account new arrangements in prisons.  Will the Minister clarify this point and give the House the benefit of his views on how this matter will be dealt with?</P>

      <P>When this Bill was debated in the Seanad over two years ago I pointed out to the then Minister certain inadequacies in its provisions which could delay the transfer of prisoners. Since then, very slow progress has been made in that regard.</P>
      <P>I want to express my concern about two prisoners from County Clare who have been in prison in the United Kingdom for over 20 years, Joe O'Connell and Harry Duggan.  In the earlier Seanad debate several requests were made to have their cases dealt with under the appropriate European Convention.  This Bill gives effect to that European Convention but apparently does not reflect some of that convention's provisions.</P>
      <P>I welcome any amendments to the Bill which will help to expedite the transfer of prisoners. The amendments are welcome and will aid the transfer of prisoners.  Nonetheless there is an absence of any appeals mechanism in circumstances in which a State may refuse or does not give a satisfactory reply whenever the transfer of a prisoner is sought.  I raised this matter in the Seanad in l995 by way of amendment with the then Minister, contending that Article 23 of the European Convention, which provides for friendly settlements between member states, could be embodied in our legislation, thus giving much greater effect to that convention if some amendments were accepted providing a mechanism by which member states would be obliged to participate in an appeals procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was unable to convince the then Minister of the necessity for such a provision which I still believe to be desirable.  While I shall not press the matter today, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to Article 23 of the European Convention whereby a European committee can intervene in an endeavour to resolve problems between member states who, because of the provisions of that convention, are not bound or obliged to give any information or reason for a prisoner not being transferred.  In such circumstances <Col N="633" /> the position could be remedied by the inclusion of an amendment which would provide an appeals procedure whenever a member state was not satisfied with an explanation for the nontransference of a prisoner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as its provisions go but, the Minister might favourably consider introducing amendments at a later stage to provide an appeals procedure such as I outlined on previous occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his Department for the speed with which they reacted positively to this issue which arose in specific cases.  As other Members said, the purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the transfer to this State of persons who have been sentenced to periods of imprisonment greater than the maximum penalties allowed under our laws which, when enacted, will have the immediate effect of assisting the transference of at least seven prisoners at present held in prisons in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the fact that the Bill is a confidence building measure which will help the peace process.  From talking to the prisoners concerned I am of the view that it should not be linked necessarily to the peace process.  This legislation is required under the EU convention and it is a human rights measure, even though one does not have the right to be transferred, rather than a political link to the peace process.  The Bill is important as a confidence building measure but it is also concerned with giving prisoners a chance to serve their sentences as close to their families as possible.  That is extremely important to them.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, a court will be allowed to adapt a sentence that is incompatible by its duration with the law of the State only where an application in this regard is made by the Minister.  That should help the negotiations currently ongoing in relation to getting the prisoners transferred. There was a significant lack of movement on this issue between December of last year and November of this year and no prisoner was transferred during that period, despite the fact that three applications were on the desk of the UK Minister, Jack Straw, for a number of months. During that time no action took place in regard to 24 sentenced prisoners in England, most of whom I had visited, which led to serious concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach on the role they played in enabling the three transfers which took place in the past few weeks.  I understand a further transfer to the Republic has been sanctioned by the Home Secretary as well as a transfer to Northern Ireland. That will help the seven other prisoners awaiting transfer and constitutes movement in regard to half the prisoners currently serving time in England.  While our concept of the movement that has taken place on this issue is different from that of the prisoners concerned and of the UK Government, the movement that has taken place <Col N="634" /> since November is significant and worthy of praise.</P>
    <P>An issue that does not seem to have been given the same momentum and which concerns prisoners who would like to seek repatriation is the question of the setting of tariffs.  This issue affects a number of prisoners and I intend to press the Minister and the Taoiseach to try to get these tariffs set because until that is done these people will be unable to apply for repatriation, which is extremely significant to them and their families. This may link the issue to the peace process, and I do not want to do that, but it is important.</P>
    <P>This is a human rights issue.  People want to be close to their families and families do not want to break the bonds with their relatives.  On another level, there is the economic consideration of relatives travelling to a prison in a particular part of England only to be told that their spouse or partner has been moved to the opposite end of England.  This is a difficult issue economically as well as emotionally for those families.</P>
    <P>People must have confidence that movement on this issue is taking place.  That is why we should commend the Bill.  Deputy Ó Caoláin might say we should go back to the drawing board but delays can be very worrying for the prisoners in jails in England.  Their concept of movement on this issue is different from ours and that of the UK authorities and it is important that we advance a Bill that will enable the process to move on and allow these prisoners transfer to Irish prisons.</P>
    <P>The timescale we have seen previously, where transfers sanctioned by our Minister in January of one year did not occur until November of the same year, was too long for the prisoners and families.  These people wait from week to week convinced that this week their family members will come home.  Having talked to both the prisoners and the family members, I know this is a trauma which cannot be understood by anyone not totally involved in the process.</P>
    <P>There must be a constant momentum in regard to all prisoner issues, not just in England but also in Ireland, in terms of loyalist and republican prisoners.  The need for that momentum is clear from the events of last weekend.  I attended a cross-Border meeting last Friday evening in Derry along with representatives of the Unionist parties, Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Independents, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  When we left the meeting we admired the Christmas decorations around Derry but, as a result of a breakdown in communication and a lack of meaningful discussion on all sides, some of those decorations did not exist the following night.  That is very sad.  I look forward to meaningful discussion and action to overcome what is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>I commend the fact that there has been movement on this issue and I hope further issues will be agreed in the months ahead in the context of a more lasting settlement.  Perhaps this Bill may be revised, subject to the agreement of both Governments, in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that the prisoners issue is vital to the peace process.  The transfer of prisoners has not taken place as speedily as we wished when the Bill was introduced two years ago.  If we had looked into the future at that time and seen that it contributed little, we would not have believed it.  All political prisoners in Britain should be transferred immediately to Ireland. That is the wish of the prisoners concerned.</P>
      <P>I visited the prisoners on 4 and 5 December and the one message we received from that visit was that there is an enormous level of frustration about the speed of the transfers.  The prisoners believe that both the Irish and British authorities are not working towards a resolution of this problem. In previous visits, much of our time was taken up with discussing prisoners' conditions and family issues but the issues the three groups wanted to concentrate on were transfers, the setting of tariffs and moving the matter forward.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the view expressed by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  This is a humanitarian as well as a political issue.  Extreme stress is being suffered by families travelling from the Republic to Britain in addition to a great deal of expense.  The cost of visiting these prisoners over a three or four day period is between £700 and £1,000.  There is no assistance available to families who want to travel to visit these prisoners.  Families living in Britain get a grant from the Home Office to visit prisoners but that money is not available to families travelling from the Republic.</P>
      <P>There is a humanitarian aspect to this issue. Many prisoners have visits from their families once or twice a year but contact with wives, partners and children is not being maintained.  It is difficult enough to maintain a relationship when one is in prison for five, ten, 15 or 20 years, but it must be extremely difficult when one receives visits from relatives only once or twice a year.  I along with Deputy Flanagan and Mary Flaherty visited prisoners in January 1996.  Our report of that visit states that the resolution of all major world conflicts has shown that progress on the prisoners issue is essential to underpin progress on the larger agenda.  It also states that the prisoners issue must be central to the peace process. With regret we concluded that the current Home Office treatment of prisoners was actually damaging and destabilising the peace process.  That was the case in those circumstances.  It is difficult to say that any one issue affected the broader agenda, but the level of frustration felt at that time about treatment in the SSUs, the medical treatment available and the general approach of the Home Office to political prisoners, which was unbelievable, did play a role.  I was pleased to note during my recent visit that approach has changed.  The position has improved dramatically in the way the prisoners are treated, but prisoners in Franklin, Full Sutton and Belmarsh want to concentrate on the issue of transfers and moving it forward.  Many improvements have yet to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> There was a good deal of frustration about the setting of tariffs and this Bill will assist in that area.  The setting of tariffs for the prisoners referred to, Harry Duggan, Joe O'Connell, Hugh Doherty and Eddie Butler, is of utmost importance, but I am not convinced it will happen quickly.  I impress on the Minister the need to move forward this issue with his counterpart in the Home Office.  We met representatives of the prison service and during our discussion they accepted that promises made over a number of years, especially during the past 12 months, were not kept.  They accepted that the promise that tariffs would be set was not kept.  We impressed on them the need to move this issue forward.  It was announced that representations were made recently and we do not know what delaying effect that will have.  We tried to probe further into that, but we did not get much information.  The Minister will have an amount of work to do to ensure that the tariffs are set and that those concerned are transferred immediately.  All the republican prisoners stated that one of the key issues concerning transfers is the transfer of those who are serving long sentences, such as the Balcombe Street gang.  The Minister should start to address this by ensuring that those who have served long sentences are transferred very quickly.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of other issues, particularly the levels of remission.  Is it the case that when prisoners are transferred they will serve longer sentences in Ireland than if they had stayed in Britain because of differences in remission rates?  Liam O'Duibhir points out that if he is transferred he will serve 22 years in Ireland, but his counterpart, who was sentenced on the same day for conspiracy, will serve only 17.5 years in Northern Ireland.  There is a difference between the two jurisdictions of 5.5 years in the sentence handed down for the same crime on the same day.  The Minister might deal with that in his reply.  It was also pointed out to us that 22 years will be served for conspiracy.  No weapons or explosives were found.  One prisoner will serve 22 years while the Shankill butchers who had multiple murder convictions were released after serving 17 years.  Gareth Pierce raised that issue at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation when the prisoners issue was discussed.  She said there seemed to be a totally different approach to the Irish charged with committing political crimes in Britain.  She also said that the likely sentence handed down for a particular crime to an Irish person would be in the region of 35 years compared to 17 years for a person from the Middle East and seven years for an animal rights activist. She said there seemed to be a different approach towards sentencing and in the attitude of the British towards Irish political prisoners compared to others.</P>
    <P>Sixteen files have yet to be transferred, four are in the UK and four are with the Minister.  I understand from the British prison that Dingus Magee's file has been in Ireland since July and the Minister might outline the reasons for the <Col N="637" /> delay in dealing with it.  I impress on him the degree of frustration felt by republican prisoners in England, the need to move quickly on this issue and the implications for the peace process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak, even for a limited period, on this issue. I have been the leader of the Irish delegation on the Council of Europe, a strictly humanitarian body, for the past two years.  My tenure of office is coming to a conclusion.  I have constantly raised the plight of republican prisoners in British jails during that period.  I was astounded to read a statement made by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, in summer 1995 to the effect that despite the ceasefire having been in operation for a full year the conditions of republican prisoners in British jails had considerably worsened.  In case anyone might misinterpret my language, that is exactly what he said and that was exactly the position.  It was extraordinary and an incredible contradiction that despite the ceasefire having been in place for a full year the conditions of republican prisoners had worsened.</P>
      <P>When I took over as leader of the Irish delegation on the Council of Europe in spring 1996 I immediately put down a motion to the effect that the conditions of Irish republican prisoners should be examined by the Council of Europe. From the time the motion was discussed in May 1996 until May 1997 the British delegation on the Council of Europe thwarted the efforts of the committee to visit the prisoners in England.  It was in my view a sadistic and vindictive act and it was only when a general election was announced for 1 May 1997 that the then British Government announced it would allow a delegation from the human rights committee of which I was a member to visit the prisoners in Belmarsh, Whitemoor, Full Sutton and Franklin. Their visit took place two weeks after the general election on 12-13 May.  That scandalous state of affairs cannot be tolerated or allowed to pass without comment.  I am glad that since the change of Government matters in England have improved quite considerably, although they are not altogether as they should be.  Closed visits are no longer the norm.  Republican prisoners are now allowed open visits.  However, Belmarsh Prison, which is only a remand prison, still has a severe regime and the special security units are still in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activities of the British Home Office, which is in control of the prisons, have been entirely irregular and contrary to all conventions on human rights and this Government should not be slow to say so.  We, in this House, and Governments past and present have been remiss in allowing such a situation to pertain.  The former Home Secretary, Mr. Michael Howard, M.P., the British Cabinet and perhaps the Prime Minister may have tolerated a vindictive attitude or even a racist attitude towards republican prisoners in British jails.  Despite the best advice from the chief inspector of prisons in England and the <Col N="638" /> chief medical officer in charge of prisons in England to the effect that the conditions in which republican prisoners were being held were inhuman, the practice continued and it took a change of Government to have this situation improved.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this valuable debate.</P>
      <P>The background to the Bill arises in the context of my consideration of a number of cases where the sentence imposed in the UK was greater than the maximum sentence for a similar offence which could be imposed here.  When considering those cases, it was clear I would not be in a position to offer the usual assurances which the Home Secretary would want before consenting to the transfer of the persons involved.  So that I would be in a position to give those assurances and, thus, facilitate the transfer of the persons in question, I decided it was necessary to make the change in the law which is in the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>In bringing forward this legislation, I am merely facing reality.  The British Home Secretary and the British Government require a categoric assurance from the Government that the integrity of the sentences imposed by British courts would be recognised and applied here.  If I could not give that assurance, the probability is those transfers would be refused.  That the assurance is given does not mean that at some future date as matters develop the British and Irish Governments might be able to come to some new arrangement. However, any such arrangement would have to be by consent so this Bill is for the benefit of the prisoners and is a recognition of reality.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to delays in processing applications for transfers.  I appreciate the time it can take to process applications for transfers can be frustrating for those concerned, but owing to the complexity of the documentation required to effect a transfer the administrative process can be quite time consuming.  For example, legal confirmation must be obtained that the offences for which sentences are being served would constitute offences under Irish law.  When the application is consented to by the sentencing state, the administering state and the person seeking the transfer, an application must then be made to the High Court for the necessary warrant authorising the person's transfer and subsequent imprisonment here before the physical transfer can take place between the two jurisdictions concerned.  I assure the House that every effort is made to process each application as speedily as possible, once the three-way consent between the jurisdictions involved and the sentenced person is forthcoming. It must be remembered that two jurisdictions are involved so the pace at which an individual transfer application is dealt with is not entirely within our control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> I keep in touch regularly with the Home Secretary about transfers from the UK and I appreciate the attention he gives to these matters. Equally there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and the Home Office in processing applications.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the question of transfers of prisoners from England to the North is not directly within my remit but it is a matter in which my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, takes a particular interest.  I will bring to his attention what has been said about this matter during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Obviously given the context in which this legislation is being brought forward, it was inevitable that the debate would touch on a number of aspects concerning the North and, in those circumstances, I am sure the House will bear with me if I say a few words about political developments there generally.</P>
    <P>As a legacy of Northern Ireland's difficult history, there is a lack of inter-communal trust and mutual confidence.  Building this trust and confidence is an essential task which must concern all of us.  The Government attaches deep importance to building confidence as an essential element in underpinning peace in Northern Ireland.  The creation of confidence is also a vital component of the peace process.  Only by the creation of this confidence can the two sides make the compromises and accommodations necessary to achieve an overall agreement in the talks.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas where sensitive and generous action can make a significant difference to the talks process.  One of the most important of these, as the Bill recognises, is prisoner issues, an area of great concern to Sinn Féin and the loyalist parties.</P>
    <P>The most important confidence building measure is already in place in the loyalist and republican ceasefires.  The peaceful atmosphere has helped provide the necessary foundation on which to promote meaningful dialogue between the parties, and to develop measures to increase reconciliation and trust.  It is essential, therefore, that we focus in an imaginative and progressive way on all the questions relating to those who have been imprisoned in the context of the conflict, both republican and loyalist, while also giving full attention to the concerns of the victims of violence.</P>
    <P>If we are to secure lasting peace, there must be progress in the multi-party negotiations towards a political settlement towards an honourable and just settlement which will command the support and allegiance of all the people in Northern Ireland.  There has been substantial progress in the multi-party negotiations since September.  We have come a long way since the stalemate of the first 15 months of the talks, but there is still much to be achieved.  As the talks chairman, Senator Mitchell, has put it, the talks are now getting down to brass tacks.  We need now to step up the <Col N="640" /> pace and get into more intensive negotiation on the core issues.</P>
    <P>A small working group of the chief negotiators from each party and the two Governments has been engaged in identifying key issues where agreement is required.  It has also been considering how to organise the work ahead to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>Over the past two weeks the members of this working group have covered a great deal of ground and addressed the issues which go to the core of the talks process.  However, despite the obvious commitment of all the participants to reach agreement, they were unable to complete their deliberations and produce a list of key issues and a programme of work before Christmas.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that this work has been valuable in terms of identifying common ground and in clarifying the scope and extent of the issues which remain to be resolved in negotiations. This will be the immediate focus of the talks when they resume in January after the Christmas break.</P>
    <P>The broad outlines of an agreement are already clear.  Its basic characteristics, across all the key relationships, should be partnership, fairness and mutual respect.  The Framework Document and the draft report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation represent the basis of the Government's approach, but we do not wish to impose a blueprint on anyone.  We are willing to examine any proposals which meet agreed objectives.</P>
    <P>It is not for the Government to prescribe the form of institutions in Northern Ireland, but we believe there should be structures which allow the two communities to work together for their shared benefit in a wide range of issues.  Nationalists and unionists must have an equal stake in their society, an equal sense of ownership. Reforms promoting justice and equality, including in the policing area, should also be agreed. There is a need for new North-South structures which, as the Taoiseach said in Belfast last week, will enable &ldquo;mutual co-operation in the interests of developing the issues that would be common to the island of Ireland.&rdquo; Such structures will also help to give expression to nationalists' sense of an all-Ireland identity.  They must be meaningful, have the capacity to make decisions and agree policies.  However, they can only work by agreement and in a democratically accountable way.</P>
    <P>We are also willing to develop more substantial east-west links.  These would allow for enhanced co-operation between Ireland and Britain on a wide range of practical issues.  We also recognise that these matters are of particular importance to Unionists.  Moreover, devolution within Britain opens up a range of exciting new possibilities.  As part of these changes we have expressed our willingness to replace the Anglo-Irish Agreement with a new and more broadly based agreement.</P>
    <P>These arrangements will have to be compatible with each other.  They should be interlocking and mutually supportive because it is impossible to address any one of our key relationships in isolation <Col N="641" /> from the others.  There is also a need for balanced constitutional change in both jurisdictions. In the context of a satisfactory overall settlement, we would, as set out in the Framework Document, propose that amendment of our Constitution.  It is also very important &mdash; on this there is already a broad consensus among the parties &mdash; that this institutional structure be underpinned by provisions to address the equality, justice and human rights agendas.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the challenge that faces all the talks participants to find acceptable political structures which can command the agreement of both communities.  As already stated, the elements of a settlement, which can be combined into a comprehensive and durable agreement for our time, exist.  The talks provide our best chance to achieve such an outcome.  In January the talks will enter the most intensive and decisive phase of the peace process to date. It is essential that everyone engaged in the talks grasps to the full the opportunity that now beckons.  We must all build on the good work of the autumn and work together in January to reach agreement by May.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, I will not be in a position to reply to the important points made by Deputies in the Second Stage debate.  However, I will endeavour to reply to them on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>As it is now 12.30 p.m. I am required to put the following question in accordance with an Order of the Dáil today: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Transfer of Sentenced Persons (Amendment) Bill," RHead="1997: Committee and Remaining Stages">
    <Title>Transfer of Sentenced Persons (Amendment) Bill, 1997  [  Seanad ]:   Committee and Remaining Stages.</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) in subsection (4) after &lsquo;remission of sentence accrued in the sentencing state,&rsquo; to insert &lsquo;and such remission of sentence as would be likely to accrue if the sentence were to be served in that state, provided that such remission would be at least as favourable to the person transferred as the remission which would apply to a similar sentence in the State,&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the provisions in the Bill, there is a considerable disincentive for prisoners to return to Ireland because of the attitudes and positions adopted here and in the UK toward the remission of sentences.  In Ireland the tendency is to remit one quarter of a sentence while in the <Col N="642" /> UK one third is remitted.  This amendment seeks to remedy that disincentive and remove it.</P>
    <P>In effect, the amendment proposes that prisoners who return to this country under the provisions of the Bill would be enabled to carry the remission entitlements or expectations that would have accrued or have been accorded to them in the United Kingdom.  This seems reasonable and I hope the Minister will be favourably disposed to accepting the amendment.  It appears to deal with an unfortunate anomaly which arises from the different attitudes toward the remission of sentences in Ireland and the UK.  That anomaly is in conflict with the general spirit of the Bill and with British concerns about the transfer of prisoners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will support Deputy Upton's amendment unless the Minister can provide reassurance on this matter.  The Deputy's statement was self-explanatory.  This is an important issue in the context of the operation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, the Minister made the point that the Bill is an amendment of our legislation which was brought forward when Ireland signed the convention.  Nevertheless, although not stated in the Bill, it appears the legislation is directed at relations between the jurisdictions of Great Britain and Ireland.  In that context, as Deputy Upton stated, the question of remission is important.</P>
      <P>Assuming the Bill is enacted this week and signed into law as soon as possible &mdash; perhaps before Christmas &mdash; has the Minister received assurances from his British counterparts that this legislation will clear all hurdles?  Has the Bill, in draft form, been seen and commented upon by British Government officials and the Secretary of State?  How does the Minister know that the enactment of the Bill will clear the existing hurdles, which were not anticipated in 1995 when the legislation was first dealt with in this jurisdiction?</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will have a difficulty in this area because different jurisdictions are empowered to impose whatever remission arrangements they see fit.  However, Deputy Upton raised an important point.  Will the Minister provide assurances that the Bill meets that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this issue on Second Stage. At that time I was not aware that Deputy Upton had tabled an amendment to deal with it.  I support him because it is anomalous that a Bill is introduced to ensure we can increase the level of sentencing to facilitate the British legal position in respect of transfers.  This means that, under our legislation and regulations, time served will be extended in respect of time served in British prisons.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about facilitating the British by introducing a Bill.  The Bill should be introduced because, as a sovereign state, we see it as the right course of action to take.  It should not be an accommodation of the view of the British</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> Government.  During discussions with Irish prisoners in Britain, concerns were expressed about the Irish Government responding to demands to change our legislation.  We should only amend our legislation because we wish to do so, not in response to demands from another state.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in this area because there is an urgent need to transfer Republican prisoners.  The enactment of this legislation will accommodate that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the wholly objectionable nature of the construction of the Bill, the amendment focuses upon an anomaly to which I referred on Second Stage.  At that time I stated that the full implications of the Bill were unclear in respect of the State's right to grant early releases or amnesties to certain prisoners held or to be held in prisons here.  I also stated that the issue of remission of sentence is also open to doubt in light of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I join colleagues in asking the Minister to clarify this matter, which is a further indication of what I believe is a flawed approach.  The legislation is not necessary to achieve its purpose &mdash; that is, the repatriation of Irish republican prisoners, which I support.  It is a matter of grave concern to me and those I represent and also to those who are the focus of this amendment, the prisoners themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the philosophy behind Deputy Upton's amendment.  At present, when a court issues a warrant for continued enforcement under section 7 of the Act it has due regard for any remission of sentence accrued in the sentencing State.  The amendment seeks to allow a court also to take into account any remission likely to accrue to that person if they remain in the sentencing State, once that arrangement is beneficial to that person.  Unfortunately, I am unable to accept the amendment for a number of reasons, not least of which is Article 9 of the Council of Europe convention, which states that the enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering State and that State alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions.  This provision is fundamental to the operation of the convention and means that transferred prisoners are subject to the same remission arrangements as apply to other prisoners.  This principle is underpinned by section 7(4) of the Act, which states that the warrant issued by the court shall otherwise have the same force and effect as a warrant imposing a sentence following conviction by that court.  In other words, the sentence is to be treated as if it had been imposed in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the issue of adherence to the convention did not arise &mdash; and let us be clear that it does &mdash; there would be a practical difficulty with the proposal in that remission is earned for good conduct and is prospective in its nature.  To seek to have a court grant remission in advance in such <Col N="644" /> circumstances could be argued to overlook the nature of remission.  It can also be argued that, given the principle that remission exists to encourage good conduct, it would be invidious to discriminate between prisoners here on the basis of where they received their sentences.</P>
    <P>In making these points I do not denigrate or dismiss the concerns expressed by Deputies Upton, Ó Caoláin, Neville and Flanagan.  I am sure the House will appreciate the sensitive issues involved and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on particular cases.  I can say, however, that in the same way that sentences under the Act are subject to our laws on remission, they are equally subject to our laws on temporary release.  There is nothing in our law to prevent a Minister taking into account administratively, when considering a decision on a release, the fact that a person would have been likely to have gained a higher level of remission if they remained in the jurisdiction where they were sentenced.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, particularly given the convention provision, I regret that I am unable to accept the amendment and I hope Deputy Upton agrees it would be more helpful not to pursue the matter further at this stage.  I assure him and the other Deputies that I have taken careful note of what they have said.</P>
    <P>There are differences in remission rates between this jurisdiction and the UK.  However, the sentences of any prisoners transferred here will be administered under Irish law, which is in accordance with the terms of the convention. Accordingly, in reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin, a future Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have some discretion as to the management of long sentences and will be able to take into account likely release dates if the prisoners had not transferred.  I can give that assurance.</P>
    <P>In the context of the amendment, Deputy Keaveney recognised that the immediate issue is the repatriation of Irish prisoners.  We are endeavouring to do that as quickly as possible.  I feel certain this view is shared by the families of the prisoners concerned.  It is in that context that the measure has been brought forward.  It deals with specific circumstances which have arisen in relation to seven prisoners in UK prisons, and covers the possibility of this happening again in future cases.</P>
    <P>To talk of the British Government interfering with Irish law in that context is, in my view, naive. I am endeavouring to adapt Irish law to the reality, which is that the British Government sought assurances regarding the integrity of sentences of British courts being accepted in this jurisdiction if it consented to transfers.  The transfer of a prisoner is not a unilateral matter for this State.  It is not merely a two-way but a three-way consent process.  There must be consent from this jurisdiction, the prisoner and, crucially, the other jurisdiction where the individual has been sentenced. To believe otherwise is not to confront <Col N="645" /> the reality of the position.  If I did not introduce this legislation and could not give the assurances being sought, the probability exists that I could not achieve my objective of securing transfers of certain prisoners from the UK.  I feel sure Deputies will recognise that because it is the true position.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage Deputy Upton asked why this was not foreseen when the legislation was introduced in 1995.  I will not lay fault at anyone's door for that, other than to say that applications for the seven prisoners who are of immediate concern in the context of this legislation were not received in this jurisdiction until the period from July to October of this year.  The problem of higher sentences abroad was only seen when the complex legal analysis of the details of the applications commenced.  The changes now proposed to the legislation will be of benefit not only to the seven prisoners immediately and directly affected but also to prisoners in future cases.  Of that I have no doubt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan asked whether I had assurances as to the efficacy of this legislation.  In other words, is it certain to achieve the transfers I am seeking to achieve?  I cannot guarantee that but I directly informed the Home Secretary that I was bringing forward the legislation.  I outlined to him why I was doing so, in the context of his request that I be in a position to guarantee respect for the integrity of sentences passed in British courts in relation to transferred prisoners.  I am hopeful to the point of being confident that this Bill will achieve its immediate objective and will achieve similar objectives in the future.  To use Deputy Flanagan's terminology, I believe it will help &ldquo;clear the hurdles&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Whatever about my confidence in that respect, I am certain that if I did not bring forward the legislation I would be in no way hopeful about the immediate transfer of certain prisoners.  It has been made clear to me on a number of occasions that the British Government expects this jurisdiction to respect the integrity of sentences handed down in its courts.  That does not mean the two jurisdictions could not come to a different agreement in the future.  However, this is now the position, and our word has to be our bond in that respect.  Otherwise we would demean our own sovereignty, we would become untrustworthy, and that would be unthinkable for a sovereign people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin questioned the need for the Bill.  This Bill is necessary for the transfer of political prisoners to take place in the near future.  If it were not necessary I would not take up the time of this House and of the Seanad in seeking to have it passed.  Whatever about the ultimate aspirations of people, this measure is being brought forward in the context of trying to secure the transfer of Irish prisoners from United Kingdom prisons.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of setting tariffs in relation to the Balcombe Street gang.  In this context I pay tribute to Deputies <Col N="646" /> who went to the trouble and expense of going to British jails to see for themselves the conditions in which Irish prisoners are held and to help wherever they could.  As I have regular close contact with her in relation to this matter, I pay special tribute to Deputy Cecilia Keaveney who has worked extremely hard in this area over a prolonged period at considerable inconvenience and expense to herself.</P>
    <P>The question of setting tariffs is a matter for the British Home Secretary.  In discussions I had with him, I raised this matter and made representations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has done likewise with his opposite number.  I trust Deputy Upton will accept the explanations I have given, and that he understands that I cannot breach the convention and he appreciates why the legislation is being brought forward as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reasons for introducing the legislation.  I have no difficulty in understanding the pressures he has to deal with, and I accept his good intentions in attempting to have those prisoners who wish to return to their native country transferred to Ireland.  Why can the Minister not apply the principle he enunciated in the course of his reply, namely, to adapt Irish law to the reality of the situation?  I am unable to understand why it is necessary to, in effect, force these prisoners to serve longer periods in prison than they would realistically expect to serve if they remained in the UK.  If some prisoners are undecided as to whether to return to Ireland, with all the desirable factors that would ensue if they did so, there is a considerable disincentive in terms of how long they can expect to serve in prison.  If I recall Deputy Neville's figures correctly, there was a differential of perhaps as much as five years.  I accept that there are some implications in relation to the conviction etc., but I hope the Minister will be able to circumvent those difficulties one way or another.  Perhaps there is some scope in the context of an initiative that he indicated might be in the pipeline in relation to long sentences.  I would like to hear from the Minister again on those matters and particularly on the need to deal with the principle I have enunciated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my certainty that in this, as in their treatment of Irish republican prisoners always, the British authorities have shown no administrative flexibility.  I know what the Minister is endeavouring to do, and I respect his motivation and good intent which I have never questioned.  However, it is patently clear the Minister's assertion that these prisoners will be treated in accordance with the laws and practices in this State is contrary to the real effect of this Bill.  These prisoners are to be subjected to the worst excesses of the British sentencing code when held in this State and yet will not be afforded the prior stated benefit of the better remission arrangements that apply in the British state itself.  The right of the Irish Government to <Col N="647" /> release prisoners held in its own prisons should remain unimpeded.  This is something this House should not hand over easily.  There remains real concern in this House, a great degree of discomfiture on all sides, at the prospect of passing this Bill.  That reflects what is at the very core of what is before us.  The Bill is flawed in its fundamental approach, abrogating its role in terms of future control and decision making over the term of sentence and the expectation of release in any form of those who are to be repatriated.  I stand fully in support of the attempt to secure the repatriation of all Irish political prisoners in Britain at the earliest possible achievable time and yet I must, on the balance of all that is before us, stand as an Irish Republican in this House today and say I cannot support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says the amendment conflicts with the convention and that we would have difficulty in complying with Article 9 I accept his point and would say to Deputy Upton that unless the Minister can find another way around it there is probably not much point in pressing the amendment.</P>
      <P>I have not often been in agreement with my colleague on my right, Deputy Ó Caoláin, in recent times, but there is a justified grievance as far as setting tariffs is concerned.  I can think of no reason for the delay other than to point the finger of blame directly at the British authorities not only for their tardiness and reluctance to deal with this matter but for the fact that they deliberately misled Dáil Deputies and Embassy officials over the question of setting the tariffs on at least four separate occasions.  There may be more but I can document four cases since April 1996 where commitments on definite dates such as &ldquo;the end of the following month&rdquo;, &ldquo;within days&rdquo; or &ldquo;by the end of the season&rdquo; given by the British Authorities were not honoured.  Is there a connection, which I do not see, between this Bill and the setting of tariffs for these prisoners?  It is totally unacceptable that Members of a parliamentary Assembly in a sovereign State can be so misled on numerous occasions by two different Governments and Home Secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will move from the obviously important area of the repatriation of Irish prisoners from the British jurisdiction to this jurisdiction and look at the manner in which the British Government has embraced the Transfer of Sentenced Persons' Convention since it first ratified it, which was a long time before we enshrined it in legislation. The British have been somewhat reluctant to embrace the terms and conditions of the convention when dealing with ordinary prisoners.  This is not unusual having regard to the climate of Euro scepticism which has pervaded Britain in recent times.  There has been an unfortunate reluctance by successive British Governments to embrace the spirit and letter of the transfer of sentenced persons when dealing with nationals from other <Col N="648" /> jurisdictions who have been convicted of crimes. I am talking about Italians and US citizens in jails in Britain where unfortunately there seems to be a major delay in effecting transfers.  It is not surprising, therefore, that we have encountered such a difficulty when dealing with the very sensitive and important area of the repatriation under the convention of Irish prisoners, which is separate from confidence building measures.  If the Minister tells me there is a difficulty with the amendment from a convention point of view then I will accept what he says.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  There are seven prisoners we know of in United Kingdom jails at present. Under British law they were given sentences ranging from 30 to 35 years.  A similar offence in this jurisdiction would attract a maximum sentence of 20 years.  In those circumstances it was necessary for me to introduce legislation to provide that an application for the adaptation of a sentence could only be made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day. This is to ensure I can give the necessary assurance to the British Government that we will respect the integrity of sentences handed down by British courts.</P>
      <P>The point that transferred prisoners serve a longer term here because our remission rate is shorter has been well made by several Deputies. I have a difficulty with the convention in that Article 9 states that the enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering state and that state alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions.  Inasmuch as the sentences under the legislation are subject to our law in relation to remission they are equally subject to our law in so far as temporary release is concerned.  In those circumstances there is nothing in our law to prevent the Minister of the day taking into account, when considering a decision on the release of an individual, that he would have been likely to have gained a higher level of remission if he had remained elsewhere. In other words, the objective of the legislation is not to ensure that a person will serve a longer time in prison as a result of being transferred to this jurisdiction.  I said the temporary release of such a prisoner would be governed by our laws. It would be wrong when considering a temporary release not to take into account that an individual would have served a shorter sentence in another jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is of paramount importance that the integrity of the sentence handed down by a British court is respected in this jurisdiction, it is equally important that we do not expect an individual transferred to this jurisdiction to serve a longer time in prison.  The objective of the legislation is to secure the transfer to this jurisdiction of Irish prisoners currently incarcerated in the United Kingdom.  In the pursuit of this objective it is necessary to be able to assure the British Government that we will respect the integrity of <Col N="649" /> the sentences handed down by British courts. There may be criticism of the legislation in relation to the various side matters, but its thrust and objective is humanitarian in all respects.  I am not shy to say that it is also designed to assist the peace process.</P>

      <P>In page 3, paragraph (a) lines 24 to 26, to delete &ldquo;in his or her absolute discretion if he or she thinks it appropriate to do so&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where he or she considers it appropriate and where the prisoner concerned, after being fully advised of the effect in relation to him or her, has expressly indicated in writing his or her consent to such application&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is directly relevant to our discussion on the integrity of sentences and, as Deputy Neville said, the reality that prisoners who have their transfers effected could end up serving longer sentences than those which would have been imposed if they had been convicted in this jurisdiction. I hope in all circumstances consideration will be given to making clear to the applicant the dangers involved.  I would have thought it would be important to build into the legislation a clause to ensure all the facts are on the table before a transfer is effected.  That point was raised by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas in the course of its consideration of the Bill.  That body deserves to be applauded for a long and positive history of involvement in these issues.</P>
      <P>On the terms and conditions to be complied with before a transfer may take place, the Minister said there must be consent to the transfer from all parties.  I assume he will tell me that before such consent is forthcoming the facts should be on the table.  It is important in the circumstances that the import of my amendment is taken on board and that the express indication is contained in writing from the person involved, having fully availed himself or herself of the circumstances under which the terms and conditions of the legislation operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 3, because of the importance of the legislation and the fact that the Minister would give guarantees from time to time on behalf of the people of this jurisdiction, consideration should be given to reviewing the legislation <Col N="650" /> on a 12 months basis, having regard to transfers or difficulties that might arise from time to time.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the general principle outlined by Deputy Flanagan.  There is a case for reviewing the legislation from time to time.  To some extent it is implied in the Minister's speech that the legislation may not endure indefinitely.  I suspect events may render it irrelevant or that it may be necessary to modify it in the future.  For that reason there is much merit in the point made by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6(5) of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, already covers the matters raised by this amendment.  In the context of a request for a transfer to this State, section 6(5) of the 1995 Act provides that the Minister may not consent to a transfer request unless he or she is satisfied reasonable steps are taken to inform the prisoner in writing and in his own language of the arrangements in place for such transfers, of the effect of a warrant authorising the transfer and of the powers of the Minister to seek revocation or variation of a warrant authorising the transfer.  The effect of section 6(5) is that the Minister must be satisfied all reasonable steps have been taken to inform the prisoner of the effect of a warrant authorising the transfer. Accordingly, it is difficult to see how the proposed amendment offers prisoners further safeguards and in those circumstances, unfortunately, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3 would be to permit the operation of section 5(b) for an initial period of 12 months, which could be renewed.  I do not agree with that amendment.  Experience of the operation of the convention has shown that some states are not prepared to consent to transfers unless a guarantee can be given that the sentence imposed will not be reduced.  The only way I, as Minister, would be in a position to give the necessary assurances would be by way of the proposals in the Bill.  I do not believe the position will have changed in 12 months' time or in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge what is sought to be achieved by the amendment.  It is recognition of the fact that this legislation relates immediately to the prospective transfer of seven prisoners in the United Kingdom.  The legislation, however, while very much geared in that direction, does not exclusively relate to those seven prisoners.  It can relate to other prisoners in future years and to jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom.  It can relate to prisoners other than Republican prisoners, to any prisoner where the foreign jurisdiction seeks a guarantee from this State that the integrity of the sentence handed down will be respected in this State.  Accordingly, the legislation as presented applies not only to events of today, tomorrow or the next 12 months but to the future.  I trust Deputy Flanagan will understand why I am unable to accept his amendments on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept what the Minister said on amendment No. 2, provided he is happy every opportunity will be availed of to ensure prisoners who come back to this jurisdiction will not say they were not aware of the circumstances before their transfer. On amendment No. 3, however, the position is somewhat different.  I do not wish to labour the point with the Minister, but I am confused on the question of the guarantee.  The Minister referred to guarantees that will be given, but no guarantee can be given because it would not be constitutional to do so.  The Minister said his word is his bond, and it is important that is accepted internationally.  We have a proud record in that regard and I do not anticipate the position will be different under the Minister's stewardship.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to what he said about his word and about guarantees. Section 1(6)(b)(ii) makes it clear that the duration of the sentence cannot exceed the maximum penalty prescribed by the law of this State for a similar offence.  It appears there may be a contradiction in that, that it is at variance with what the Minister said about guarantees and bonds because there are cases where we do not have corresponding crimes or sentences to those in other jurisdictions.  In those circumstances how does the concept of the guarantee fit in with the subsection to which I referred?  Given there is an apparent contradiction there, I would have thought amendment No. 3 would be accepted to allow us to review a statute that may give rise to confusion in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the legislation is to ensure the Minister would be in a position to offer an assurance that the integrity of a sentence handed down in a foreign jurisdiction in respect of a transferred prisoner would be respected here.  Such an assurance given by a Minister of this State would be honoured by every subsequent Minister.  That has been the position on other matters and I have no doubt that, irrespective of the political persuasion of a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that would be observed.</P>
      <P>The legislation as it stands provides that the sentence can be adapted only on foot of an application by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That will ensure the assurance to which I referred can be given.  Deputy Flanagan said the legislation should be reviewed in 12 months.  I do not believe that will be necessary.  I firmly believe the legislation can, and possibly will, have application in the not too distant future to prisoners other than those currently incarcerated in United Kingdom jails, at whom it is immediately directed.  The legislation will have effect in the future when foreign jurisdictions seek an assurance from an Irish Minister that the integrity of sentences handed down by their courts will be respected in this jurisdiction if they agree to transfer a prisoner here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> The transfer requires the consent not only of this jurisdiction but of the foreign jurisdiction and the prisoner concerned.  If any of those consents is not forthcoming the entire procedure will break down and the transfer cannot take place.  While I understand the motivation behind Deputy Flanagan's amendment, I trust I have explained the matter sufficiently and that he will accept the necessity to leave the legislation as it stands.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  -Section 6 of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(7) Reference in paragraph (a) of subsection 3 of this section to close ties with the State shall include reference to birth or residence in Northern Ireland.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward drafting amendment designed to ensure the term &ldquo;close ties&rdquo; with Ireland includes people born or resident in the North.  It is simply designed to clarify what is already contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3(a) specifies as a requirement that before a transfer into this jurisdiction can take place the sentenced person must be, for the purposes of the convention, regarded by the State as a national of the State and, for these purposes, a national of another state shall be regarded as a national of the State where it considers the transfer of the national appropriate having regard to any close ties which the national has with the State.  I hope the Deputy understands that.  The amendment seeks to enshrine in the Bill that close ties with the State shall include a reference to birth or residence in the State or Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act as currently worded gives a high degree of flexibility to the State in facilitating persons with close ties to the State who are not nationals.  I do not understand the benefit of defining that concept by reference to birth or residence. What is at issue is that the close ties, whatever their nature, are such as to make a transfer appropriate.  While the amendment only states that a reference shall include the matters referred to in the amendment, including a part definition which might limit the flexibility that already exists, the flexibility that currently exists under <Col N="653" /> the legislation might be limited in its scope if this amendment were accepted.</P>
    <P>In practice it is difficult to know the effect of the amendment on individual applications. Obviously, it would still be a matter for the Minister to decide whether the close ties were sufficient to make a transfer appropriate.  Including the amendment could be misleading because a non-national who happened to reside in the State many years ago for a short period and who had no family ties here would not in practice be regarded as having sufficiently close ties to warrant a transfer into the jurisdiction.  Irrespective of close ties, the State has discretion in agreeing to a transfer.  Including the amendment would not alter that.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances including the amendment would serve no useful purpose.  It could limit the existing flexibility and for those reasons I regret I have to oppose it.  However, in rejecting the amendment I assure the Deputy I will exercise as much flexibility as possible during my tenure of office on the transfer of prisoners into the jurisdiction and, in deciding if a person has sufficiently close ties, that flexibility will be of considerable importance.  I will not be rigid in the matter.  I will be flexible in terms of each application in so far as it relates to the question of an individual having close ties with this country.  The amendment as framed could limit the scope of that flexibility and, therefore, I must oppose it.</P>

      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  -The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, is hereby amended by the insertion after section 10 of the following section:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;10C.  -Where a sentenced person is dissatisfied with a decision of the Minister refusing an application under section 4(1) of this Act or refusing a consent to an application under subsection (1) or (2) of section 6 of this Act, concerning that person, he or she may within 2 months of being informed of the decision, or such longer period as the High Court may order, appeal against that decision to the High Court and that Court may if it is satisfied that it is proper to do so, direct the Minister to grant or consent to the application as the case may be.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to introduce an appeals system for people who have made applications for transfer and are dissatisfied with the Minister's decision.  It is simply a safety mechanism which would allow a second opinion when people are dissatisfied with a decision.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes a right of appeal to the High Court against decisions made by the Minister on applications made by the convention.  I cannot accept the amendment.  Transfers take place under an international convention and arranging such transfers is clearly a matter for the Executives of the States involved.  Under the convention a State has the right to refuse an application and it would be inappropriate for that decision to be left ultimately to the courts which is what the amendment, in effect, proposes.</P>
      <P>One of the practical difficulties that arises is the effect transfers have on the availability of prison accommodation.  It would be unthinkable to take control of this matter from the Minister.  Deputy Flanagan raised the question of the possibility of transferring provisional IRA prisoners from Portlaoise Prison to Castlerea Prison.  A decision has not been taken on moving those prisoners, but such matters are kept under continuous review.  I note the Deputy's enthusiasm for the building of a new prison at Portlaoise and I am sure this is not due to an objective bias on his part.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that decisions on transfers are policy matters and are proper to the Executive, not the courts.  Our courts are involved in transfers into the jurisdiction, but basically that involvement relates to ensuring the lawfulness of the detention of a person being transferred.  Consent to the transfer is a matter for decision by the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>As Minister I will be responsible to the House for the actions taken under the legislation.  While I cannot accept the amendment I assure the Deputy that I will continue to operate the convention to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, transfers into the jurisdiction where they are warranted.</P>

      <P>The priorities extend beyond 1998 but are directly relevant for next year.  They include effective participation in the Northern Ireland multi-party talks and implementation of any agreement arising from them; implementation of Partnership 2000 and the further development of the social partnership process; effective Irish input to the work of the European Council on major issues on the EU agenda, including the EMU process and the Agenda 2000 negotiations; deepening and strengthening the SMI process throughout the public and Civil Service; promotion of concerted action in relation to economic and social policy and maximising the contribution of the IFSC to the economy; production of a revised edition of the Government's procedure instructions; facilitation of greater co-operation between the State's legal offices and appropriate commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the 1798 rebellion.</P>
      <P>As regards legislation, the respective roles and functions of the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum are currently being reviewed in conjunction with the social partners, under the terms of Partnership 2000, and the institutional and administrative arrangements that emerge are likely to be given a statutory basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed but not overly worried about yesterday's outcome.  The important thing is that while it was not possible to reach total agreement on the list of key issues, the discussions in the restricted group have crystallised for further debate.  People were not prepared to leave their positions in what they considered a vacuum for three weeks.  Although they had agreed the key issues to be put by all parties in relation to what should be discussed in the future, it finally emerged that people wanted to <Col N="656" /> draft the heads of an agreement and discuss the issues on which they would agree.  However, that was not what they were trying to do.  I talked to people yesterday and to the parties the night before and they were not happy to leave certain issues on which they had agreed for three weeks in what they considered a vacuum.  For that reason positions were adopted yesterday which were not in order for discussion over the past week.  I understand the different perspective of those involved, the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that we will not be in a position to move straight back into the smaller subgroups which we set up over the past three to four weeks. We will go back into the strands again and then we must renegotiate the subgroups, which were difficult to set up.  I put a lot of time and effort into it, but it was only a fraction of what others did.  It was in that context that I mentioned play acting.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my concern that the timeframe between 12 January and the February plenary will be extremely tight given that the talks will probably take place on two to three days each week during that period?  Will any special arrangements be made to accelerate the pace of the discussions, including setting more days aside and clearing people's diaries during the January period so that there will not be little progress to report at the February plenary?  Is the Taoiseach aware of the great concern that if substantial progress has not been made by the February plenary, there could be serious pressure on some of the participants?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Every day is important, so the February plenary is not the end of the world.  One party wants to see progress on a particular issue for that meeting.  However, it would not be helpful to discuss that.  Apart from that one issue on which the party has stated it needs action by the February plenary, there is no other pressure. However, when we reach January 12 the pressure is on to get back to the subgroups, then to take the useful work done over the past number of weeks and recognise areas of agreement, as well as other issues.  I could go into detail on what happened on the inside yesterday, but I would rather not as it is confidential.  However, two issues were raised by two parties which I referred to earlier.</P>

      <P>Practically all of it is but I am signed up to the confidentiality clause.  The Deputy is right, even though one or a few nuances were missed and, unfortunately, that is <Col N="657" /> one of the reasons a move from Castle Buildings now and again would be helpful.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's other question, more days should be set aside.  We agreed &mdash; even though one party tried to unravel the agreement set down in the document to which it had agreed &mdash; about meetings in Dublin and London. However, I take it that both dates are still fixed with the meeting in London first in January and then a meeting here in February.  I believe that will help to concentrate minds and I favour at a certain stage moving to a neutral venue where the key participants would make an all out attempt to reach an agreement with support from our international friends and others.</P>
      <P>It was interesting yesterday that the key agreements issue was not where delegations had a problem.  If the delegations were in the mood for finalising things yesterday, and two parties were not, the key issues would have been all right but the heads of an agreement would not.  However, they are two separate issues and yesterday people were moving from what they were trying to do into the heads of agreement.</P>
      <P>While that was not helpful to achieve a result yesterday, it is not unhelpful in the context of people focusing on that, but I share Deputy Bruton's view that in any negotiations there is a time when one must participate and we are at that stage.  I hope people do so on January 12.</P>

I have contacts with Sinn Féin as well but not nearly as many.  In terms of the talks, we have been criticised by a number of people for the fact that we check practically everything with the SDLP.  That has been a practice of my party for many years and we continue to do that.  We tend to hold meetings with whichever groups look for them.  The only oversight I have been guilty of over the past four months was with the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition.  Somewhere along the way communication broke down.  They were looking for a meeting to which we did not respond for about a fortnight but I since fixed a date and met them twice.</P>

Can I <Col N="658" /> take it that his thinking is along the lines of taking them to somewhere, such as Oslo, for instance, where the Middle East accords were agreed?  When does he think it would be appropriate to move to such a venue?

      <P>The early meetings in London and Dublin will help to deal with certain issues and to move things around.  The neutral venue is more down the road, probably at the end of what we said would be a ten week working period.  An amount of excellent papers have been produced by everybody, some better than others.  Some people were more organised and put in more effort, but there is a huge amount of documentation, much of it with very good ideas, while there is some repetition and duplication.  I was hoping yesterday that if we had a set of agreements on what the issues were arising from the documentation that had been put forward over the past three months, then we could move towards looking at the heads of agreement.</P>
      <P>This started yesterday so at least we have the benefit of knowing those areas.  At that stage, one must start filling in the heads of the agreement. Most of that is there frankly, not just from the work done recently but from that done over the past few years, from the time of the Framework Document up to the time of the election this summer. It involves work done in 1991/2, good, independent work carried out by many agencies over the past five or six years, and a spirit of goodwill and compromise to start fleshing that out within the three strands.  However, in the tight negotiations of the past few weeks more progress has probably been made than for a long time.  The important thing is to get back to that position.</P>

The more one moves to novel venues for meetings, the more risk there is of grandstanding, of people appearing important because they are in a new place and of a discontinuity developing in the negotiating atmosphere necessary for compromise.

      <P>The reply to the first question is clearly yes in so far as one can ever be definitively positive about something in Northern Ireland.  All parties are prepared to negotiate across three strands.  They have put in their provisos and considerations of what they mean by them.  I now know where Deputy Bruton is coming from and where Deputy Quinn was.  That means I have to answer the question which I would have liked to avoid.  In relation to my recent trip to Northern Ireland I had allocated most of the day to a trip to Derry and the remainder to a trip to west Belfast.  A few days in advance I was asked not to go to Derry because a certain person was missing, so I did not go.  That is the reason it looked slightly imbalanced.</P>

      <P>Dr. Joe Hendron spent the greater part of the day with me.  Unfortunately I cannot fix everybody's diary.  In relation to locations, I agree with what Deputy Bruton has said.  All parties agree that a move from Castle Buildings where they have been meeting much of the time might serve to advance progress.  That is all they wish to do.  In relation to a neutral venue, that would be at a final stage.  No particular location was mentioned.  The location does not matter so long as the time is given to it.  Since it is the season of goodwill, I am going to Derry for a whole day in January.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Taoiseach I have met with the financial services industry representatives on the IFSC Clearing House Group and with senior ministerial colleagues to discuss the future development of the IFSC.  At those meetings it was agreed we should take a strategic look at the development of the centre as we move into the next millennium.  I have asked <Col N="660" /> the clearing house group to put in place a strategy into the 21st century for the IFSC in order to consolidate the success of the centre and develop it for the future.</P>
      <P>The specialist IFSC working groups, which form part of the clearing house group structure, continue to develop policies to enhance the competitiveness of the centre in specific industry sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>During my time as Minister of State with responsibility for the IFSC I chaired an international group which produced a report on the future evolution of the IFSC.  Is the Taoiseach aware that that report referred to the need to ensure there is not a lack of suitable educated labour available for the IFSC in the future?  What steps have been taken to ensure there is a flow of suitable educated labour?  How many people are now employed in the IFSC and will the target number, set during the term of the last Government, of 7,500 employees by the turn of the century be met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 7,500 was for direct and indirect employment.  The figure for direct employment was in the order of 4,000 to 4,500.  I think the figure of 4,000 will be exceeded by the end of 1997.  Clearly, both targets will be met.  The Deputy was responsible also for the international advisory group which reported.  Its central recommendation was that I should be directly involved.  I have done that.  The long-term review group recommended that we revamp the IFSC clearing house.  That has been done.  The clearing house now has a number of local IFSC leaders involved in the clearing house committee and it will involve a number of leaders of the international firms.  It has started to work on that basis in the past few months.</P>
      <P>In relation to skilled staff, a considerable amount of work is ongoing to ensure a continued supply of trained staff at the centre.  The Financial Services Industry Association has undertaken a detailed survey of future skills needs across the entire financial services industry, including the IFSC.  It was not exclusive of all the other sectors. This survey should provide the information for future planning purposes for the education institutes and various colleges specialising in this work.  They have also co-ordinated their work with the group which Deputy Quinn set up &mdash; the Docks Development Authority.  It is important that the two work together in harmony.  That will ensure they continue to develop their activities properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the objective of 7,500 employees for the turn of the century will be met?  The Taoiseach referred to the group which I chaired.  Has he given consideration to another recommendation in the report, that location within the Dublin docklands area might be considered as a qualification for certain of the tax incentives which are now attached to the <Col N="661" /> IFSC?  When will the Government will be in a position to make an announcement on the tax regime at the IFSC post 2005, since for planning purposes those who are located there and intend to locate will need to have a target date in mind?  In relation to back office development, what plans are in place to ensure that targets are set?  What targets have been set to attract back office development to the IFSC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the questions in reverse order.  The IDA has been spearheading the campaign separately to try to bring as many back office developments as possible.  They have had a number of successes but they are also engaged in head hunting a number of companies which have expressed an interest in moving to Europe and other companies in Europe where they believe there is potential to get them into this country.  It is not necessary for the IFSC, it is for developments in several parts of the country. It was pointed out in a recent debate that these back office developments are useful for regional development.  Two or three proposals in 1997 have worked in that regard.</P>
      <P>So far as the IFSC companies are concerned, the question of holding the 10 per cent rate of tax to 31 December 2005 is not finalised but I think it will happen.  Hopefully it will be finalised early in the new year.  After that date the rate will be 12.5 per cent as announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>
      <P>On the question of accommodation, Deputy Mitchell is familiar with that issue.  Lower spec accommodation is available.  The Docks Development Authority intends to maintain its supply of office accommodation at the top, middle and lower levels of the market.  That would remove the excuse given by many companies for not moving for a long time.  If the tax differential will not exist in future, we should look at other ways because the intention was that they should be on that site and that everything should be done to encourage them on to that site.  The main obstacle has continually been the price of accommodation. I am confident, having listened recently to the chairman of the Dublin Docks Authority, that he intends to make this happen.  He has pointed out that he has a statutory duty to secure the continued development of the financial services activities in the docks area.  In the masterplan, launched by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government last Friday, they say they will fulfil that duty.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the proposals for the eco-sphere for stack A have not been responded to with finality by the Government?  Until such time as the proposal which is before the Department of Tourism, Recreation and Sport and the Department of Finance is responded to in a finite way, the Docklands Authority cannot move to complete what was the original Custom House Docks development site, stack A which is in the Taoiseach's constituency.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct.  I attended a Financial Services Industry Association function last week at which that point was made by the chairperson of one of the committees.  There are a number of proposals which they are anxious to examine.  We will make our decisions shortly to enable them to move ahead.

      <P>There were 180 at one stage. As the Deputy knows, most of the big ones have moved.  Their argument centred on the accommodation.  There are many small ones which employ few people.  While the question of extension will fall within the remit of the overall development plan, there is no proposal to extend the area.  As a supporter of the development, we should allow the docklands body to make recommendations.  It should be allowed to proceed with its work.  It has been asked to develop in a balanced way the docklands area, which encompasses 1,200 acres, during the next 20 to 25 years.  The Government will be glad to look at any proposals it produces.  Telecom Éireann, the Financial Services Industy Association, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the IDA are conscious of the need to continue to update infrastructure to ensure the telecommunications systems are the most modern available, not alone to maintain and develop the companies currently located within the centre but to attract new ones.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I visited the United States on 14-16 December. The main focus of my visit was my meeting with President Clinton.  We took the opportunity to review the talks and their possible future direction. I thanked the President for his tremendous personal commitment to the peace process and the invaluable support which he and his administration are giving.  My meeting at the White House was followed by a press reception and a media lunch.</P>
      <P>I also visited New York and Boston.  In New York I addressed a dinner with an investment promotion focus arranged by the IDA at the Plaza Hotel.  In Boston I attended a dinner in my honour hosted by a great friend of Ireland, Senator Edward Kennedy, at the JFK Library.  I also visited Boston College.</P>
      <P>These engagements provided me with an opportunity to meet a great many friends of Ireland, to thank them for their ongoing support and to highlight the excellent investment opportunities which Ireland offers.  I have arranged for copies of the speeches I made to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The current president of Conradh na Gaeilge was among the people I met on my visit to Belfast.  The Government has been actively pursuing with the British Government specific proposals to vindicate the rights of those who wish to use the Irish language in their daily lives in Northern Ireland or to equip their children to do so.  The Government is fully supportive of moves to ensure the Irish language is seen and accepted as part of the heritage of all the people of Ireland of all traditions.  I see no reason these two objectives cannot be pursued in parallel and I fully support all those who work to promote the Irish language on an inclusive non-sectarian basis.</P>

Is it intended that the full cost of the Taoiseach's trip to the United States will be met from public funds?

What steps are being taken to assist them regularise their position?  The Taoiseach indicated that he met an tUasal Ó Cearbhallain of Conradh na Gaeilge.  Was the Taoiseach aware at that stage of an tUasal Ó Cearbhallain's statement in which he referred to the learning of Irish by Unionists as a disease?

I did not raise the issue of the other document with President Clinton but I did discuss it with a number of others within the context of forthcoming events.  Recently I also met a number of emigrant groups home on a visit, some diocesan groups in addition to some Irish emigrant associations in New York and Boston who pointed out that their difficulties had changed dramatically from those obtaining a few years ago.  They presented me with a paper which they asked me to examine to ascertain whether outstanding issues could be dealt with over the next year or so.</P>

      <P>Even if the president of Conradh na Gaeilge did say later that his remarks about teaching Irish Protestants were a very clumsy attempt at black humour, would the Taoiseach agree it was highly ill-advised of him to create the risk of the Irish language even being seen to be used in a sectarian manner?  Is the Taoiseach aware that these remarks caused great upset among many Irish speakers in the North, among groups who work very hard there to decouple the Irish language from identification with a narrow nationalist view?  Since the president of Conradh na Gaeilge might be seen as speaking for Conradh in this article &mdash; which he probably was not &mdash; and Conradh might be seen as speaking for Irish speakers in the Republic, would the Taoiseach agree it would be criminal and totally wrong of any individual or any group to run the risk of suggesting that Irish is the property of one community in the North rather than being the heritage of all to be received by all in whatever manner they wish?</P>

There are many people of different religions involved in Irish language movements all over the country who are very proud of it.  I am quite sure they do not want <Col N="666" /> their use of the language identified with their religion because they are two separate and distinct facets of their lifestyle.  Of course, any remarks that endeavour to put a sectarian slant on things are clearly unhelpful.

      <P>Can the Taoiseach assure the House that the National Economic and Social Forum will not be subsumed into an enlarged National Economic and Social Council bearing in mind that the two bodies perform quite separate but complementary functions?  Is he aware of the widespread concern among some participants in the National Economic and Social Forum of their possible exclusion from any future arrangements if the forum, in its present form, is to be merged in any way with the National Economic and Social Council?</P>

      <P>I shall certainly take note of what the Deputy has said.  I have heard both sides of the case.  The National Economic and Social Forum, established four years ago, does a particularly good job.  I think some people are confused, because of the similarity of titles, that both are one and the same body whereas they are not. One contributes to a very much wider national consensus on economic and social issues while the other plans the future and engages in a macro and micro economic analysis of our economy, which is a different matter.  The Cabinet will address the matter in its meeting on Friday next.</P>

      <P>If the Cabinet is to consider it on Friday next, I presume the Taoiseach has some thinking of his own on this matter.  Does he agree that the two bodies are quite distinct, notwithstanding the similarity of their respective titles, and that anything that would result in the abolition of the third strand or sector, clearly represented within the forum but not within the NESC to anything like the same extent, would constitute a retrograde step?  Will he assure the House that the forum will not be abolished?</P>

      <P>The matter will be discussed by the Cabinet on Friday next and has been discussed by the social partners, whose views and those of many others will be taken into account in those Cabinet discussions in addition to any expressed here.  However, we should not preempt those discussions.  I acknowledge that these two bodies have distinct and separate roles, both of which have proved very useful, particularly over the past few years.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it creates some difficulty for social partnership when the Government, in its choice of tax policy, goes against the consensus of the social partners and opts to reduce tax rates, which tends to help those on better incomes more, rather than increase tax free allowances and widen the tax bands, which was the consensus view of the social partners?  Does he agree that, when the Government unilaterally ignores a consensus among the social partners on a key issue like the distribution <Col N="668" /> of the benefits of prosperity, that does more damage to the social partnership than any neglect of particular institutions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said during the Adjournment Debate last Wednesday, a huge amount of taxpayers' money is at stake and we must ensure every effort is made to contain this expenditure while having regard to the legitimate claims of those serving and former members of the Defence Forces who may have been genuinely injured.  However, the State does not accept the current level of quantum because it believes this is too high.  Furthermore, a rapid settlement policy, whether by a tribunal or some other scheme, would be effectively an unwarranted admission of liability.  This would in turn have the effect of inducing many more claims. The present strategy of running selected cases is producing results.  A number of cases, albeit <Col N="669" /> small, have been dismissed by the courts and, more importantly, the overall level of quantum has been reducing, particularly in the last legal term.  Pending the production of the Irish handicap assessment system by the Department of Health and Children that strategy should be continued, at least in the short term, for as long as it yields such results.  The expert group of ear, nose and throat consultants and an audiologist, convened by the Department of Health and Children and tasked with developing an Irish hearing handicap assessment system, has now met.  It is hoped they will be in a position to report early in the new year.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department met representatives of the Incorporated Law Society on Tuesday, 9 December 1997 and had a useful exchange of views on the whole question of hearing loss litigation.  They proposed to the society that solicitors handling these cases reduce their fees by 50 per cent in view of the volume of litigation being processed.  The representatives said they would consider it.  A further meeting to work out a common approach to solving this problem was agreed.  They were also told of my concern about solicitors advertising and the role this plays in fuelling this problem.  The Government yesterday decided to examine this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Government is prepared to compensate those who have suffered a genuine injury and who are suffering a significant handicap.  What it is not prepared to do is waste taxpayers' money on compensating individuals whose hearing is normal for their age or whose handicap is so small they did not notice it until they spotted an advertisement in the paper inducing them to make a claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimates for this year have increased to £38 million and £85 million will be required to deal with the cost of these compensation cases in the coming year.  During the debate on the Estimates in Committee the other day, the Minister said he believed most of the claimants would not get compensation in any other country.  We are facing a significant problem in that large numbers of cases are getting compensation yet the Minister is saying he does not believe they should, even though the State is losing most of the cases.</P>

      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that gardaí are now putting in claims, is it not time to establish a Cabinet subcommittee to deal with this issue and bring together the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance, Health and Children, Defence and other relevant Departments to examine the overall strategy?  Even if the Minister succeeds in reducing the legal fees, the enormous demand on the Exchequer will continue. There is no doubt that genuine claims must be <Col N="670" /> met but the percentage of those is unclear at this stage.  However, 12 to 15 High Court judges have found that these cases are being met, that there are genuine cases, and we must examine the contradiction between what the Minister is saying and what is happening.  What was the reaction of the law society to the Minister's request to reduce its fees by 50 per cent?  Did it undertake to do anything in relation to the advertising which appears to be quite excessive in terms of these claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the question, the problem facing the State is that the courts have awarded large damages for levels of hearing loss which, in other jurisdictions, would not be considered a serious handicap and which would not attract significant damages.  It is the relatively high level of court awards, combined with the large number of existing and potential claimants, which gives rise to the huge bill the Exchequer now faces.  To say that all members of the Government are not concerned about this would be to underestimate what is happening.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the final part of the Deputy's question, I must tell her that the avalanche is continuing.  In the past four weeks, there have been 465 new cases.  If one converts the present awards, taking the total award and the legal costs together, and if these were to be met on a monthly basis, we are talking about £16 million per month which is the equivalent of providing a ship for the naval service every month of the year. It is one and a half times the amount of resources I have for the refurbishment, rebuilding and improvement of accommodation in a whole year. That is the reason I put forward a number of proposals, the first of which is to get the new Irish accredited hearing handicap system in place to bring down the quantum awards and have that accepted by the courts.</P>
      <P>The second proposal is to negotiate with the Incorporated Law Society on the basis of the legal fees.  There are approximately 1,700 solicitor firms in the country, a tiny percentage of which are engaged in this area.  A number of those, three of four firms, are following up more than half the cases.  The Incorporated Law Society is in the process of considering my proposal to reduce the fees by 50 per cent in the significant number of cases being handled by individual firms, and we hope to have another meeting in the course of the next few days to see how that is proceeding.  The Government is also giving active consideration to my proposal in relation to the change in the law which allows solicitors to advertise their services which can induce further claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is getting constant, dedicated commitment from all members of the Government, particularly from me where it is my responsibility to safeguard the taxpayer while ensuring that genuine claims are dealt with comprehensively and effectively.  The Deputy's comments about the legal costs are correct.  The plaintiff's legal <Col N="671" /> costs represent about 30 per cent of the claim. The overall legal costs, including my costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even if there is agreement on an Irish assessment test and a reduction in lawyers' fees, we are still talking about an enormous amount of money and a huge liability for this State.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we may need to introduce legislation.  We may also need to examine the possibility of dealing with this issue through the social welfare system or working with a panel of experts and fixed amounts for certain levels of hearing handicap or loss.  The Minister said he is attempting other measures in the short term, but how quickly does he consider he can move to deal with these claims in an alternative way, given that every other country appears to deal with them in a different way from how we handle them?  I say that with full respect for the rights of genuine claimants.  There is also a rights issue involved here.</P>

However, we are working within a tight timeframe and I hope by the end of January or early February to be in a position to inform the House of developments in this precise area.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive information which will be of particular interest to members of the Defence Forces.  Is the Minister satisfied that the scheme introduced by his predecessor has reached its potential and that the criteria in respect of the aims set by the previous Government for dealing with the age level within the Defence Forces have been met under this scheme?  Is it his intention at any stage to extend the existing scheme or to introduce a follow-up scheme?  Will he indicate if it is the Government's intention to do what I have advocated for the Defence Forces for a long time, to recruit on a planned yearly basis to take account of retirements, natural wastage, etc?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the third part of the Deputy's question, I have made it clear that I will end for all time the stop-go recruitment procedures that have been part and parcel of some of the problems that have developed in the Defence Forces concerning promotion and other problems. More importantly and apart from promotion, it is a young person's job in the main. There should be an entrée of young people who should have the opportunity to join the ranks of the Defence Forces on a continuous basis.  When we have reached the target strength of 11,500 set by the previous Government, constant recruitment will take place thereafter on a year on year basis to fill the vacancies from natural wastage or retirement.  I will continue the final phase of the voluntary early retirement scheme this year at a total cost of £23 million odd.  Part of that involves pensions in respect of those who retired in the first two phases of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, the first two phases of the voluntary early retirement scheme were quite successful in a number of ways.  Bearing in mind it was a voluntary scheme and that not all those whom one might want to retire from different places will avail of it, broadly speaking the scheme was quite successful.  However, this year the new scheme needs to be more focused and targeted to deal with some surpluses that have arisen.  Where gaps have emerged in respect of the first two phases we have an opportunity to make sure they are not tampered with and some support will be available for those areas.</P>
      <P>It is too soon to visualise what will happen in future.  We will reach the target figures by the end of 1998, we will have constant recruitment, the voluntary early retirement scheme will continue this year and at that stage we can consider what is necessary to ensure sufficient numbers will be available in appropriate geographical areas.  We will then be in a position to provide the best and most efficient force this House and country envisages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear about the additional recruitment because of the shortage of private soldiers in my area and the Border areas. Those who are there are to say the least overworked. Recruitment should be on the basis of taking into account the numbers who will retire and it should be done in advance to take account of the time it takes to train troops to a certain level of efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why when I made this announcement I said the first tranche would be in March and the second in June and that I would review the position then.  One can visualise over the years early stages of recruitment in the early part of the year and the balance in the middle and at the end of the year.  That would ensure we will not have to wait for a full complement, which has often been the case where at the end of the year personnel would not be able to operate in active service for the better part of the following year.</P>

      <P>Provision in the region of £70 million has been made in my Department's Estimates for 1998 for the procurement of a broad range of equipment, ancillaries and spares for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  Approximately £10 million has been allocated to defensive equipment to provide for such items as the replenishment of ammunition stocks, the delivery of refurbished 105 mm light artillery weapons to replace obsolete 25 pounder guns, the delivery of the first instalment of new turrets and fire directing systems for armoured vehicles, etc.</P>
      <P>The provision for military transport generally will also be about £10 million.  Some of the more important items to be purchased in this area will be new troop-carrying vehicles such as 3-4 tonne trucks, four wheel drive trucks, minibuses, etc., forming part of ongoing programmes to modernise the transport fleet.</P>
      <P>As regards the Naval Service, a large part of a £16 million provision for 1998 will be taken up by stage payments on the new fishery protection patrol vessel and by the refurbishment of existing vessels such as the <i>LE Aisling,</i> due to be completed in January 1998, and the <i>LE Eithne</i> due to commence around May 1998.  About £10.5 million will be available to the Air Corps and will be spent on keeping the aircraft fleet fully maintained and the aerodrome operational.</P>
      <P>The substantial balance of the £70 million provision will be shared by areas such as communications, including completion of the ongoing VHF radio replacement programme; clothing, barrack and engineering equipment; and information technology procurement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> I am particularly satisfied that the level of funding which I have outlined has been secured to enable a number of special procurement and refurbishment programmes to be put in place as part of the modernisation of Defence Forces equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. My area of concern is that in the Action Programme for the Millennium the Government stated that it would equip the Defence Forces adequately for an expanded role in international peacekeeping.  Peacekeeping missions in this day and age have moved on and they require a mechanised capability.  Our Army does not have such capability.</P>
      <P>I believe a project team was established comprising civilian and military personnel to identify the most suitable type of armoured personnel carrier. The Minister in his reply, as far as I can ascertain, did not mention anything about the purchase of new APCs.  Has the project team made recommendations?  If not, when does the Minister expect them?  Will he allocate some money for the purchase of APCs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>An extensive tendering and evaluation process will take place in 1998.  I regret that the Deputy may feel I did not give attention to it, but it was because the question related to the estimate for the general area and that does not include provision for APCs in 1998.</P>
      <P>I would expect, however, towards the end of 1998 &mdash; not involving expenditure in 1998 but involving significant expenditure in 1999 &mdash; to place the first order for APCs as agreed by the expert group and through the normal processes early in 1999 if not by the end of 1998.  I accept that they are required.</P>

      <Quest>the number of claims for army deafness settled in court and out of court; the units or corps to which the claimants belong or did belong to; the total cost to date in this regard; the estimated cost for 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>At 30 November this year settlements had been reached in a total of 1,007 cases and court awards following hearing had been made in 28 cases.  A further 29 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn.  Compensation of £26.249 million and plaintiff costs of £4.492 million have been paid in respect of 1,064 cases finalised.  The current average settlement is approximately £22,000 but this is within a wide range of awards and settlements from as low as £4,000.  Total legal costs for the plaintiff in general are about 30 per cent of the award or settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> The units to which the claimants belonged are detailed in the schedule which I propose to include in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>There is provision of £85 million in the 1998 Defence Vote for personal injury claims both hearing impairment related and of a general nature. It is estimated that approximately 90 per cent of this provision will be required for the finalisation of the hearing impairment claims likely to be dealt with in the courts during 1998.</P>
    <P>I repeat that a rapid settlement policy whether by a tribunal or some other scheme would be effectively an unwarranted admission of liability and would, in turn, have the effect of inducing many more claims. Pending the production of the Irish handicap assessment system by the Department of Health, it is my view, and that of the Government, that the current strategy should be continued at least in the short term for as long as it has the effect of lowering settlement levels.</P>

    <P>The details above also include cases finalised since 1 December 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if he proposes to include this subject in the Defence Forces (Amendment) Bill or by separate regulations or amended regulations under the existing DFR?  Equally, to give this balance, is he aware of the statements of the president of PDFORRA that he was aware of situations where men on the firing range were actually ordered to take off proper ear protection muffs?  Is he aware that I, as an officer of the Defence Forces, have had similar experiences on the firing range when I was ordered by a senior officer to remove proper ear protection, which is now being used by the Defence Forces on firing ranges?  In view of the discussions at the Committee of Public Accounts and on the Supplementary Estimates, is he aware that many injuries are caused not only to members of the Defence Forces and the FCA on firing ranges but to those in what is known in Army parlance as &ldquo;the butts&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said many times that we are applying health and safety standards of the late 1990s against a backdrop of what was the norm in most defence forces throughout the world for the greater part of this century.  There is ample evidence to show that there were regulations and guidelines in place as far back as 1952 but there is no substantial evidence or written <Col N="686" /> record as to how they were implemented in individual cases, and that has posed real difficulties for us in the courts.</P>
      <P>We will be bringing the memorandum on the changes to the Defence Act before the Government soon and I will see whether the Deputy's proposition can be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if the Minister is aware that many injuries caused to members of the Defence Forces were in the service units, such as &ldquo;butt&rdquo; duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say, without getting into great detail on this, on the basis of the best evidence that has been made available to me that there is a significant number in the Defence Forces who have suffered a serious hearing handicap whatever the circumstances of the time, of which I do not have the details.  I have said that I want to be their guarantor.  I want to make sure that they are properly protected and compensated. My difficulty is that, as the scenario has developed, others have been encouraged into this mill which creates the sort of problem with which this House is trying to grapple today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the figures he has given in answer to my Priority Question and the large percentage of the cases already processed through the courts which have been proven in favour of the injured applicants, will the Minister agree that establishes negligence on the part of the State?  If that is the case, the State is responsible for compensating those serving and former members of the Defence Forces for the injuries so caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the State is compensating and will continue to compensate every genuine case coming before or outside the court for settlement.  I would always want to see that happen and to ensure we are as generous, understanding and helpful as possible in all these cases. I do not accept that the State has a responsibility beyond that because I have looked at the experience in most other countries where soldiers who were in warlike circumstances do not have this particular experience.</P>
      <P>It is also true that, to date, the courts here have not accepted the international hearing handicap systems which apply elsewhere.  That, of course, has led to a situation where awards were granted in cases where proof was also provided that there was no hearing handicap and no significant hearing loss.  It is in that area that the difficulties lie and where we must address the issue in the interests of the taxpayer, equity and fair play. Those who have genuine claims have no fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I find a contradiction in what the Minister is saying.  On the one hand on the examination of the Estimates the other day the Minister was saying that the vast majority of people who have cases in court here would not <Col N="687" /> get compensation anywhere else.  Then he goes on to restate his concern for genuine claimants. It seems to me that we must move urgently to a situation where we can distinguish clearly between genuine claimants and anybody who is putting forward a claim who, in another jurisdiction and under an international hearing test, would not receive compensation.  If the courts do not accept international tests, such as the American model, which is accepted in other countries, what guarantee is there that, when a test formulated by Irish experts is introduced, the number of claims will be reduced or that it will be accepted by the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I can provide no such guarantee. I inherited this problem which has been travelling down the road like a juggernaut with no brakes for several years.  The number of claims has quadrupled in recent times.  There is no contradiction between my concern to deal with genuine cases and ensure that people with significant handicap arising from exposure to gunfire are properly compensated and my protection of the taxpayer in circumstances where claimants would not receive awards, in court or outside, in other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply seems to imply there are no genuine claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate circumstances involved and there is a real difference between those with significant handicap and those without it.  In some cases the courts have decided that if there is any deviation from perfect hearing &mdash; namely, a person's standard of hearing at birth &mdash; people are entitled to compensation.  I do not share that view.  If I were to share it, I would have to accept that a large majority of the population would be automatically entitled to compensation because of deterioration in their hearing during their lifetimes.  I cannot accept that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister implied there are few genuine cases before the courts and stated that compensation would be paid in a relatively small number of these in any other court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the committee which dealt with the Estimates, he stated that he wants to demonstrate to the courts that many of the claimants have no hearing handicap and that the vast majority do not have any significant handicap. That seems to suggest he is of the opinion there are very few genuine cases before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to give exact percentages in respect of this matter.  It is fair to state that, on the basis of international experience, and what has happened in Irish courts, if 40 to 60 per cent of cases were to be tried in other <Col N="688" /> jurisdictions, under acceptable international hearing criteria, the claimants would not be awarded significant damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that 40 per cent of cases are genuine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to state exact percentages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an air of <i>déja vu</i> about this issue.  The attitude adopted by the Minister and his Department in respect of these claims is almost a mirror image of that adopted to married women who sought compensation for a loss of social welfare payments as a result of the actions of the Department of Social Welfare and the Government of the day.  The ultimate net cost to the State in that instance was £260 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <P>It is important that every Deputy be given the opportunity to illicit as much information as possible from the Minister.  If Deputies make statements, it curtails the time available to the Minister to deal with the issues raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but the time taken to interrupt me in asking my question also wastes the time available.  My preamble was by way of ensuring that the information we might obtain from the Minister will be new information.</P>

      <P>As already stated, the net cost of compensation payments to married women was £260 million when settling in the first instance would have cost £18 million.  Are we not now going down the same road, given the use of pejorative terms such as &ldquo;scam&rdquo;, &ldquo;avalanche&rdquo; and &ldquo;juggernaut&rdquo;?  Any citizen of the State who feel they have a right to claim compensation, social welfare payments, a medical card, headage payments, etc. are entitled to apply for them.  It would make better sense if the Department of Defence tried to develop a system which will not drag thousands of people through the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I flatly reject Deputy De Rossa's contention.  He may pretend to the House that he is the man who cares.  I hold myself as no greater or better than anyone else.  I am merely concerned that everyone with a genuine claim against the State or other interests is treated properly. The Deputy wants me to surrender and accept liability, take the quantum of award on offer and inform the taxpayer that education, health and other services will be affected by payments to potential claimants who would not receive awards in other jurisdictions.  It would be highly irresponsible for me to do so.</P>
      <P>During my short time in the Department of Defence, I have set out to give this matter serious consideration and find a system which will be fair and equitable to all sides.  I am committed to continuing that process and I have received genuine support from Members who have expressed their views publicly and made suggestions to me in private.  I will pool those views and suggestions in attempting to resolve this problem.  However, I will not play second fiddle to anyone in respect of my dedication to be fair and deal with matters quickly.  Earlier court awards in respect of these claims were so great that the final bill &mdash; currently estimated in billions of pounds &mdash; will be astronomically higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister regards those cases as unfair, did he appeal any of them to a higher court?  Has he considered ways of dealing with claims, other than driving everyone into court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered a number of ways to help solve this problem with which I have been dealing constantly for several weeks.  I have put a certain amount of action in train and I am confident I will be able to develop a different system which will be less onerous, legalistic and costly and will be as fair as possible.  That is what I am determined to do.  I have taken every possible action to reach that position in entering discussions with and taking advice from interested parties.  The Deputy's advice is as welcome as that of anyone else because I want this matter to be dealt with properly, without leaving us open to the problems we will face if current circumstances prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In a written reply on 5 November the Minister referred to the establishment of an expert group by the Department of Health and Children to examine the method of assessing hearing handicap.  He stated it was hoped the group would report by the end of this year or early next year.  At what stage is the group's report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in almost constant contact with the group which has met the experts and is working on the process at present.  It is also receiving help from external sources and the <Col N="690" /> views of other experts may be required.  I will be disappointed if I have not received its report by the end of January or the beginning of February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that for a period of five years following the lodgement of the first claims, the regulations relating to proper hearing protection were not applied on firing ranges?  I do not hold the Minister responsible because this happened long before he assumed office.  I have been warning the House about this problem for 16 years.  Does the Minister agree that the level of regulation applied in the countries to which he referred was not applied in Ireland and that is what caused this problem?  If no case has been appealed, how can we say the cases are not genuine?</P>

      <P>The comparisons we have made have been with defence forces in order to get expert advice on what has happened, even where the exposure to training ranges and gunfire associated with warfare, etc., has produced nothing like the significant hearing handicap allegedly taking place in the Irish Defence Forces. As I indicated on the Estimates debates, I also had discussions with a great number of people in the Defence Forces, whether in Lebanon, Athlone, Cathal Brugha barracks or McKee barracks, talking to those in the enlisted ranks and at officer level who have stood on the ranges.  I have listened to them but I remain to be convinced. Whereas one cannot provide proof, I do not contend that there were no cases of negligence. However, in a great number of cases the norm for the time was applied and as far back as the 1970s 110,000 ear plugs and other equipment were purchased by the Defence Forces.  As and from 1987, these measures were further strengthened. The Defence Forces have applied rigid health and safety standards since then and have implemented about 65 different provisions to ensure people are properly protected.</P>
      <P>As to why no appeals have been lodged, I am not in a position to indicate the legal advice.  I made comparisons on the basis of what is happening elsewhere and on the level of quantum awards for similar cases before the same courts.  In one case, an award in respect of an ENT report of handicap was £5,000; for an exactly similar case in the Defence Forces, the award was £45,000.  These are ambits we must try to control in order to have a more unified system.  As I said to Deputy De Rossa, I am trying to arrange that as quickly as possible.  I assure the House that is my aim and when we return to discuss these questions in the New Year I hope we will have advanced that position much further than we have today.</P>

      <P>The members of the Reserve Defence Force study group, the setting up of which I announced recently, has not been finalised.  However, I can inform the Deputy that it will be a joint military/civilian study group.  It is my intention that the group will commence its examination of the reserve early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to include deadlines in the study group's terms of reference for the submission of interim or final reports.  I am confident, nevertheless, that the group will conduct the study as quickly as possible and submit its recommendations at the earliest possible date.  In that regard I am advised by the military authorities that a considerable amount of preliminary work has already been undertaken by them.  For example, military boards were set up to seek the views of the members of the reserve on its future organisation and structure.  The boards consulted with members and sought submissions from them. They completed this task earlier this year and it is anticipated that the work undertaken by the military authorities will be of considerable assistance to the study group in its deliberations.</P>

However, the reserve will be involved in the consultative group which will underlie the work of the overall group.  I have had a number of representations on this and might be prepared to look at it again.  I will finalise that in the course of next week.  The involvement of the reserve at the consultative level is guaranteed but I am not <Col N="692" /> sure that its involvement in the overall group is the wisest course.  We must strike a balance and I am not certain whether it is correct.  I am thinking about it at present.</P>

      <P>I am interested in facilitating the wider public, particularly in the outlying regions. As the Defence Forces are centralised and made more efficient and mobile there is a risk that FCA activities in outlying areas of many counties may be downgraded and I am most anxious to avoid that.  One way would be to give local communities the opportunity to provide advice on the value of the work undertaken, such as the guard of honour and other ceremonial occasions in which the FCA facilitate people.  It is also possible that withdrawing the FCA could denude those areas.  I assure the Deputy that this facility will be made available.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the reports on the Air Corps and the Naval Service have taken so long.  One reason is that when the first report was made available to the then Minister, it was considered not to be comprehensive enough and that some questions needed to be addressed more fully. That caused some of the delay.  I understand I will have the report within the next few weeks and I have already indicated to Deputies Bell and Fitzgerald that I will make it public as soon as possible.</P>

For non-military people, such as myself as Minister for Defence, I want to have the best advice available to me in the House and on the committee.  I will see to what extent that can be facilitated on an ongoing basis.  As to the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, the study of the reserve force will take cognisance of the requirements to integrate elements of the reserve force in the reorganised units of the PDF and <Col N="693" /> practical deployment of non-integrated reserve elements, and the tasking of integrated and non-integrated elements, the effective strength of the reserve forces and the required equipment and training levels, proposals in relation to the current first line reserve, the cost of the reserve forces, command and control structures, and requirements and organisation of the PDF training cadre whose strength will not exceed that provided for in phase 1 in the implementation plan.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has a long tradition of supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations <Col N="694" /> and has been involved in international peacekeeping since 1958.  Irish military personnel have built up a considerable reputation as peacekeepers having contributed to more than 30 UN missions.  As a small country we can be proud of our peacekeeping record.  The Defence Forces also contribute to peacekeeping operations under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the EU.  Sadly, however, our involvement has not been without its costs as there have been 75 fatalities involving members of the Defence Forces while on peacekeeping duties.</P>
      <P>Ireland was among 81 countries which supplied troops for UN missions in 1996 and of these countries Ireland was 17th highest in terms of the number of troops contributed.  A total of 735 military personnel is currently serving with ten UN missions.  Taking all missions and assignments into account the total number currently serving overseas is 758.  It can be said with pride that Ireland continues to build on a long tradition of service to the founding principles of the UN by making practical commitments of personnel on a continuing basis &mdash; proportionately, far beyond its size.</P>
      <P>As well as the extensive involvement of Irish military personnel in UN peacekeeping operations, a number of senior military officers have, down the years, served with distinction in senior appointments in UN missions.  Currently Major General David Stapleton is serving as Force Commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in Syria.  These appointments bring prestige and honour not only to the Defence Forces but to the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces derive considerable benefits from participation in international peacekeeping missions.  In so far as experience and training are concerned, the professional advantages gained in such missions are very substantial.</P>
      <P>Down the years the making available of contingents for overseas service has been made possible by drawing small numbers of personnel from units throughout the commands.  The level of overseas participation is, however, kept under continual review in order to ensure that security needs at home can be met at all times and that the cost to the Defence Vote does not become excessive.  In this latter regard it must be borne in mind that certain peacekeeping missions are now conducted on the basis of contributing countries bearing their own mission costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of standby forces for UN peacekeeping missions has been in the course of development since 1990.  This system is intended to enhance the United Nations' capacity for rapid response to emergency situations.  I am happy to say that it has been decided that the Defence Forces will participate in this system, known as the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System. Participation in UNSAS would not entail the commitment of additional personnel for UN service over and above the numbers which obtained during Ireland's participation in UN service in <Col N="695" /> Somalia, i.e. 850 military personnel.  There would be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and, as at present, Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation.  Our decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>Ireland is currently contributing to SFOR, the NATO-led Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  This mission operates under a United Nations Security Council mandate.  A significant factor is that our involvement in this mission reflects the importance of staying in the mainstream of peacekeeping at a time when the UN is increasingly turning to regional solutions in troubled areas.</P>
    <P>Defence Forces participation in peacekeeping missions involves major operational taskings and a heavy financial commitment.  It is my policy to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to continue in this very important role of peacekeeping under the auspices of the UN.  Overall, international participation by the Defence Forces in peacekeeping missions has had considerable benefits and has been a positive element in our relations with other countries</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Shaw who said that peace is not only better than war but infinitely more arduous.  Therefore, in terms of our armed forces being involved in peacekeeping missions, there is much preparation to be done and resources given to them.  In that context is the Minister still planning to prepare a White Paper on defence in which this issue of our involvement in peacekeeping will be dealt with?  Will the Minister be recommending involvement in Partnership for Peace?  Is the Minister concerned about the short gaps between tours of duty abroad?  I gather there have been problems in getting volunteers as some people have done quite a number of tours of duty.  For example, if 60 replacement military police are required for the SFOR mission in Bosnia, I understand there are already too few at home?  Are there now logistical problems in terms of numbers to fulfil our international peacekeeping commitments and obligations?  Obviously it is a very important opportunity for the members of the Defence Forces.  It helps morale, and we have heard that morale is poor lately. In view of those facts, what action will the Minister be taking to ensure that we can continue to contribute to peacekeeping at an international level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The first way to address it is to ensure that we have constant recruitment.  Part of the problem is that we sometimes have difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers to meet our mandate once the Dáil has decided.  Members are required to serve for many missions and thankfully there have been a great number in the <Col N="696" /> Defence Forces who have been prepared to make the sacrifice of serving away from home on a continual basis.  At present some are volunteering for consecutive six month assignments.  We must recruit young people into the Army in sufficient numbers to ensure that the demand for repeat service will not be as acute as it has been in the past.  We have to take every situation as we find it and to have regard for security needs at home, overall financial limits and so on.  We have a proud history of involvement in the UN, being 17th highest in terms of the overall number of troops serving, and there is no going back on that.</P>
      <P>Many countries view the Partnership For Peace as a waiting room before joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.  This is not something of which the Government is in favour or in which it will be involved.  We deal with each case on its merits and we get a mandate from the Dáil. Given the size of the country our participation in many difficult areas has been extraordinarily widespread.  Despite the loss of 75 men in the service of the United Nations, it is important when advocating membership of the Partnership For Peace to bear in mind that our involvement in peacekeeping missions has been greatly enhanced by our neutrality and the fact that we do not carry colonial or other baggage.  It is also important to take into account the safety of the men and women who serve in the Defence Forces.  That is our absolute position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the Luxembourg European Council on 12 and 13 December last. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevy.  The outcome of the Luxembourg European Council is set out in detail in the Conclusions of the Council, copies of which I have placed in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>The Luxembourg European Council was an historic occasion.  The launch of the next enlargement process involving ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus has initiated, in the words of the Council Conclusions, &ldquo;the dawn of a new era, firmly putting an end to the divisions of the past&rdquo;.  Apart from the launch of the next round of enlargement other key outcomes of the Council were the agreement to intensify the review of the Union's common policies and future financial framework by using as a working basis the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals and, in the context of Economic and Monetary Union, resolution of the so-called Euro X issue.</P>
      <P>This successful European Council builds on a very successful period for the European Union in recent years.  The launch of Economic and Monetary Union is now a little over a year away.  The Union has shown great cohesion and determination in charting the difficult path to this rendezvous.  As a result EMU is on course to start on 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam also marks a further important step forward for the Union.  The treaty contains many important and new provisions on issues of real concern to Europe's citizens.  It will allow Europe to address more effectively the most direct concerns of citizens in the areas of employment, crime, the environment, public health, consumer protection, social exclusion and non-discrimination.  The provisions of the treaty have already been drawn on at the highly successful Employment Summit last month to ensure better co-ordination of member states' employment policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These important recent initiatives of the EU were built on the solid foundations laid by the founding fathers of the European Community and their successors.  The result is the successful political and economic entity which the EU is today.  In the same way as the Common Market, as it was then known, acted as a magnet for Ireland in the 1960s and early 1970, membership of the current European Union is the priority of the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.  This demands a generous and open response from the European Union and I am glad <Col N="698" /> that the Luxembourg European Council agreed such a response.</P>
    <P>At Luxembourg the European Council considered applications for membership from ten Central and Eastern European States and from Cyprus.  After considering the opinions of the Commission on each applicant state the European Council decided to launch an accession process comprising all 11 applicants.  In making this decision the European Council also affirmed that all the applicant states are destined to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria and that they are participating in the accession process on an equal footing.  The process is, therefore, an inclusive one.  This feature was particularly welcome to all the applicant states.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to intensify efforts to prepare for membership, the European Council also agreed to an enhanced pre-accession strategy for the applicant states.  The key to this new strategy is the creation of a new instrument, accession partnerships, which will mobilise all forms of assistance to the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe within a single format. Taking account of the assessment set out in the Commission opinions, the European Council decided to convene bilateral intergovernmental conferences in the spring of 1998 to begin negotiations with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia on their entry into the Union.  While this is a signal that these countries are at present more advanced in terms of their preparedness for EU entry I again emphasise that the enlargement process is inclusive of all 11 applicants.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a supporter of the enlargement process, will adopt a positive approach to the enlargement negotiations.  However, nobody should be under any illusion as to the magnitude of the task.  The ten associated states of Central and Eastern Europe have a combined population of 106 million, yet their total combined GDP corresponds only to that of the Netherlands and their average <i>per capita</i> GDP is approximately one third of the Union average.</P>
    <P>The issues and challenges raised by the next enlargement are, therefore, clearly of a different nature from those raised by previous enlargements. I stress, however, that enlargement provides opportunities as well as challenges for Ireland.  As the economies of the associated states develop and as their standards of living rise new markets with significant potential for Irish exporters will open up.  There has already been a dramatic increase over the last few years in the level of Irish exports to the five Central and Eastern European states, with which detailed negotiations will initially commence.</P>
    <P>In a further measure to encourage closer relations between the applicant states and the EU, the European Council agreed to set up a European conference.  This conference will bring together the member states of the European Union and the European states aspiring to accede to it which share its values and its internal and <Col N="699" /> external objectives.  Initially, the EU offer to participate in the European conference will be addressed to Cyprus, the applicant states of Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey.</P>
    <P>The European Council also considered the position of Turkey in depth.  This issue will be dealt with in detail by the Minister of State in his statement on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  However, I stress that the European Council confirmed Turkey's eligibility for accession to the European Union and stated that its application will be judged on the basis of the same criteria as the other applicant states.  The situation with regard to Turkey, as well as Iran, formed part of my discussions with President Clinton, when I also availed of the opportunity to brief him generally on the outcome of the Luxembourg summit.</P>
    <P>The European Council conclusions underline the need to ensure in advance that the Union is in a position to cope with enlargement under the best conditions by making the adjustments deemed necessary to its policies and their financing. It considered that the Commission proposals in Agenda 2000 are an appropriate working basis for further negotiations for an agreement on the Union's policies and the financial framework. The conclusions adopted by the European Council in this key area are welcome from an Irish viewpoint.  We have always accepted that the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals set out in a comprehensive and balanced way the issues facing the EU's common policies against the background of enlargement.</P>
    <P>Decisions were not taken in Luxembourg on the share-out of EU funding under the next round of financial perspectives which begins in the year 2000.  The Commission will next year submit detailed proposals for revised Structural Fund regulations and lengthy negotiations lie ahead.  Member states' allocations will not be decided for some time, probably as late as 1999.</P>
    <P>Because of our recent economic performance Ireland will approach these negotiations in a comparatively better position economically than was the case on the last occasion.  As I stated at the conclusion of the Luxembourg Council, we should welcome our improved economic performance. It has delivered more employment, stable public finances and low inflation and interest rates.  Our good performance has also been assisted by EU transfers.  We have used these transfers in a wise and progressive fashion. We are testimony to the success of the EU's cohesion policy.  Care must be taken to ensure this success is nurtured and sustained.  EU transfers to Ireland will continue to have an important role in achieving this and this must be recognised in the detailed Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to have significant development needs in relation to our relatively underdeveloped infrastructure and our continuing employment needs.  In addition, because our movement towards average Community GDP is <Col N="700" /> so recent, we have not had the opportunity to accumulate the national stock of wealth and capital available in other member states which have been relatively prosperous over a much longer period.</P>
    <P>The Commission has recognised in Agenda 2000 that any transition from Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds must be gradual, and has proposed transitional provisions for regions which exceed the threshold for Objective 1 status. We welcome this recognition because it is essential that the aims of Objective 1 in Ireland are met fully and on a sustainable basis.  Ireland emphasised at the European Council that transitional arrangements must be adequate in both content and duration.  It is in everyone's interest, especially that of the Union as a whole, that a cycle of dependency be avoided and that Ireland's relative success story continues.  A period of consolidation is definitely required, if Ireland's present achievements are not to be undermined.</P>
    <P>I will put these and other points to President Santer tomorrow when we discuss Agenda 2000 at our scheduled meeting.  We will not discuss specific allocations for Ireland at our meeting &mdash; that is for future negotiation.  I welcome the opportunity to set out Ireland's broad position and to ascertain in more detail the Commission's approach.  At my meeting with President Santer I will also raise the introduction of Ireland's proposed single rate of corporation tax notified to the Commission some months ago and the new regional aid guidelines agreed by the European Commission yesterday.</P>
    <P>On agriculture, the European Council took note of the work done by the Agriculture Council on the agricultural aspects of Agenda 2000.  It agreed the process of reform begun in 1992 with the MacSharry reform should be continued and that the end result should be economically sound and socially acceptable and should make it possible to ensure a fair income for farmers.</P>
    <P>The European Council also took an important step towards the achievement of EMU when it agreed on a mechanism for economic policy co-ordination. This mechanism includes provision for informal meetings among Ministers of states in the euro area to discuss issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency.  It is also provided, in this context, that whenever matters of common interest are concerned, they will be discussed by Ministers of all member states.  The objective here is to minimise any possibility of a division between member states participating in EMU and those that will not participate from the beginning.  This is in Ireland's interest, especially in view of our close trading links with Britain.  The Council also confirmed that the ECOFIN Council remains at the centre of economic co-ordination as the sole decision-making body in this area for the entire Community.</P>
    <P>The European Council noted that following on the successful Special Council on Employment, <Col N="701" /> held on 20 and 21 November last, Union action to promote employment is now in place.  The Labour and Social Affairs Council, at its meeting on Monday last adopted the employment guidelines which were approved by the Special European Council on Employment.  The Council also noted much useful work which was progressing in the justice and home affairs area.  Particular satisfaction was recorded with the adoption of the first concrete measures for putting into effect the action plan to combat organised crime.  This action plan was an initiative of the Irish Presidency. It is gratifying from an Irish point of view to see that this initiative and initiatives in the drugs area are bearing fruit.</P>
    <P>I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, in the margins of the European Council meeting.  Our discussions focused on the talks and we agreed that, from 11 January, for a ten week period, the two Governments would work to drive the process forward.  We also discussed Bloody Sunday, the case of Roisín McAliskey and prisoner issues, including transfers and tariffs, and the level of the military presence necessary in the current situation.  We reaffirmed our strongly held view that, with goodwill and resolution on all sides, an agreement could be put in place which would be fair to all and acceptable to all reasonable people, both Nationalist and Unionist.  We confirmed that May 1998 continued to be our target date for completion of the talks process.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I also reviewed progress on the wide-ranging programme of bilateral co-operation which the two Governments had agreed earlier this year to take forward and intensify. Following our meeting, we issued a statement and a progress report on co-operation between Ireland and the UK &mdash; Developing East-West Relations.  The report details more recent developments in the co-operation that is taking place in a great many areas of public policy.  It is not necessarily exhaustive, but it illustrates the co-operation that is taking place and the wide range of areas involved.  Copies of the report have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Luxembourg, and particularly Jean Claude Juncker, the Prime Minister, can take much pride in the achievements of its Presidency.  The two European Councils were very successful.  They succeeded in advancing the Union's agenda in important areas.  I have worked in various councils with Jean Claude Juncker, on the Social Affairs Council, ECOFIN and European councils. Our careers have followed a similar path. While he represents a small country, his chairmanship of the European Council, the Social Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council was a great achievement.  Most of my colleagues will know him well because he has been on the scene for a long time.  To undertake such a task, attend all the meetings and tour the capitals on two occasions is more than should be asked of the leader of any country, not to mention a small <Col N="702" /> country.  He made tremendous efforts during Luxembourg's Presidency.</P>
    <P>The task for the Union now is to complete the Agenda 2000 process which has been initiated at the most recent Council.  Ireland will approach the negotiations on Agenda 2000 and on enlargement in a positive frame of mind.  On the eve of Ireland's 25th anniversary of membership it should be recalled that Ireland has always adopted a positive approach to our membership of the European Union.  We have not been afraid of change and we have always sought to participate actively in shaping change in the best interests of Ireland and Europe.  This approach has served us well and will be the approach which will guide us through the difficult negotiations which are to commence in 1998.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union is attempting one of the most difficult tasks it has undertaken since 1958.  It is attempting simultaneously the biggest ever enlargement of its membership while intensifying and deepening the union in regard to economic policy.  Normally it would be possible to undertake one of those tasks with some prospect of success, but the European Union is currently attempting to do both at the same time.  I am not sure the policymakers at the head of affairs in Europe have thought through the implications or the magnitude of what they after attempting.</P>
      <P>The prospect of creating a single European currency means there must be a single European economic policy.  It is evident from listening to debates in the House that economic, or tax, policy is at the heart of domestic politics.  It is the issue on which elections are decided or lost, on which, in argument across the floor of the House, controversy is at its most intense.  Yet that issue will be moved from national to European level. The fiscal policy of member states will be decided partly in member capitals and to a great degree at European level.</P>
      <P>Currency policy is at the heart of Europe's competitiveness.  We know from our experience that adjustments in currency policy here in l996 and l992 were among the principal reasons for a substantial leap forward in job creation the following years.  Our competitiveness was adjusted, but we were able to make that decision ourselves. Although it had a down side in the short-term in terms of inflation and so on, it yielded considerable results in the long-term.  We will not be able to do that now and neither will any other member state.  The instrument of being able to use the currency as a means of redistributing the pain in the economy in difficult times will pass from the hands of member Governments and be decided at European level.  Flowing from that, decisions will be taken on tax policy and pressure on the trade union movement and employers to reach agreement on the flexibilisation of the labour market will increase significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first years of the euro will be extremely difficult, particularly for Germany and France <Col N="703" /> whose labour markets are rigid in the extreme. They have feather bedding on a grand scale underpinned by law.  Labour costs in Germany are twice the level here and three or four times higher than in Portugal.  Yet, Germany will enter the same currency zone as Ireland, Portugal and other countries with much lower labour costs and more flexible labour markets.  While there is currently a flight of money from Germany and capital outflows are large, because the Deutschmark is still separate from other currencies there has not been the same outward flow of jobs. However, when Germany enters the euro along with other countries with much lower labour costs, it will not be open to them to allow the Deutschmark to float downwards as a way of easing pain.  Neither will it be possible for France to allow the franc to float downwards to ease the pain from the competitive loss that may result.</P>
    <P>There may also be significant movements in the dollar, the yen and other non-European currencies which may put considerable pressure on European exports.  There will be immense political arguments within Europe, with some countries wanting the euro to decrease in value to retain export markets or keep imports out and others wanting incomes slashed as a result of a fall in the euro.  There will be serious arguments on these matters between member states and social interests in Europe.  They will be similar to those that took place in the United States in l932 and l933 when a major recession flowed from the l929 crash and a cohesive federal decision had to be taken on how to share the pain and on how the country could recover from the 1929 shock.  The United States was able to deal with that shock. It had a single currency and a federal system of Government and was able to deal with the matter on a national basis.  It was able to share the pain between states because it had an elected president in the person of Franklin D. Roosevelt.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the European Union has equipped itself with the political means to cope with the inevitable economic and political crises that will arise as we try to manage a single currency for a very diverse economy, the European economy.  There is not a focus of political power in Europe with the mandate to take the necessary political decisions in which the European people can feel they have had an input.  The people of the United States felt they had an input in the decisions Franklin Roosevelt took in l933.  They did not know what he would do when he was elected, but he tried everything open to him.  He was able to do that because he had a political mandate from all the states of the union.</P>
    <P>After 1 January l999 or 2002, when the currency is introduced, the Taoiseach will have a mandate from the Irish people and the other heads of Government will have a mandate from their respective peoples, but no individual will have a European mandate.  The Commission does not have a mandate from the people.  There will be a lack of a common act of European citizenship. <Col N="704" /> I regard the election of the US President as a form of ritual reaffirmation of Americaness every four years, when everybody votes on the same question.  That unifies the country.  People from Maine to California held different views on Clinton and Dole and may agree or disagree with the result, but they make one decision which incarnates a sense of American political will that enables the President to take really tough decisions, as Roosevelt had to do in l933 to manage the value of the single currency of the United States following the crash.  Nobody will be fit or mandated to do that under our arrangement in Europe.  That is a major deficiency.</P>
    <P>The political unification of Europe has not proceeded apace with economic unification.  We have got away with that up to now, but we will not get away with it forever.  There is a major aversion to thinking seriously or radically about this issue.  I tried to raise it on several occasions at the European Council but there was a decreasing interest in the subject.  Germany, which was very federalist in its approach and was willing to contemplate a deepening of the political union in Europe, has moved in the opposite direction in the past few months under Chancellor Kohl, who is almost as nationalist as the French.  That is not good for Europe.  Things may have changed, but I do not believe they have.  Germany is, effectively, being governed by the Lander, but the federal Government is a comparatively weak entity.  There is no person capable of getting Germany's act together. In the absence of somebody who is able to commit Germany to a European decision, there could be a paralysis of decision making once the euro comes into being.  That is a major concern.  It is also worrying that in addition to not dealing with the political unification that is necessary to manage the single currency, we are simultaneously increasing membership to include a number of new States that have not got a similar political history to the existing States.  We are trying to manage two Europes in one without creating two sets of institutions.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Luxembourg meeting is a typical fudge.  It is claimed that of course there will be different discussions between those who join the euro and those who do not, but that separate institutions will not be created.  Informal discussions, without the capacity to make decisions, will be held among members of the euro and those who have not joined will remain outside for those discussions.  It is claimed that all formal decisions will include those who join and those who do not.</P>
    <P>If, for example, difficult decisions have to be made by members of the euro to protect Irish interests against a competitive devaluation of sterling, would we be happy to see the British Prime Minister take part in them?  We would not, but that issue has not been addressed in the arrangements.  If there is a competitive devaluation of the Polish zloty to undermine competitiveness from Eastern Germany to get industry to move across the Oder Neisse line, will the Germans <Col N="705" /> be happy to see the Polish Prime Minister making a decision on the matter when the problem is being created in Poland?  That does not make sense.  This has not been thought out by the European leaders.</P>
    <P>Underlying the original Treaty of Rome and the concept of building the European Union there were people behind the scenes doing the thinking.  They may not have been Prime Ministers but people like Jean Monet who had a model or a dream of the type of Europe they wanted.  There is no one doing that thinking now. We are going forward almost blindly to enlarge on the one hand and deepen on the other.  This process of widening and deepening is like the Fianna Fáil advertisement in a particular general election of two horses pulling in the opposite direction.  The tensions were more severe than those Fianna Fáil was attempting to describe in coalition Governments.  However, that was before Fianna Fáil was converted to the idea of coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the situation in relation to Turkey.  Europe has not thought out if it wants the Turks and the Russians or just the Turks as members of the European Union.  If both become members, the European Union will be involved in Turkey/Russian conflicts in central Asia, which may not be savoury for us.  We have said we want to bring in the Turks.  Are we excluding the Russians?  Where should Europe end?  The Cypriot Government is proposing to point missiles at southern Cyprus.  That must be stopped as it could be a major threat to peace.</P>
    <P>The references to the Middle East process are depressing.  The record of the Israeli Government is appalling as far as the peace process is concerned. There will be no movement of the peace process until Mr. Netanyahu is out of office.  I have not said that about any Prime Minister up to now.  He is the great obstacle to peace and his party must be removed from office and the Labour Party brought back or no progress will be made.  It is time that people said that frankly.  He has reneged on the Oslo agreements in a way that is inappropriate.  I say that as someone who considers myself a friend of Israel.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 54 of the conclusions refers to the date problem and how we will adjust Europe's computers for the year 2000.  We are told a communication will be prepared by the Commission.  When will that happen?  Does the Taoiseach realise that all programmes to deal with the year 2000 problem must be completed by 31 December 1998 because at least a year is needed to test if they work?  The Commission's decision to produce a programme sometime during 1998 about how computers can be adjusted, given that the adjustment of hundreds of thousands of lines used in computer programmes must be completed before the end of the year, displays a lack of urgency.</P>
    <P>A number of people who understand these matters have suggested that the adjustment of computer programmes to solve the millennium <Col N="706" /> problem could be the cause of a major worldwide recession because of the huge diversion of resources which will be necessary to deal with it in the period between now and 31 December 1999.  There is no appreciation of the magnitude of this problem.  There is a foolish belief that a magic piece of software will be found to solve all these problems.  However, dates are not always identified in computer programmes by numbers. Sometimes the code used to identify a date could be somebody's girlfriend's name.  Unless someone goes through the programme line by line, they will not know if it refers to a date and unless every date is identified and changed, there will be problems.  Nobody has come to terms with the magnitude of this problem at European or national level.  I hope the Taoiseach will consider this issue as his Christmas project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the remarks made by the Taoiseach in congratulating the Luxembourg people on an effective and successful Presidency.  I also pay tribute to Jean Claude Juncker who has played a major role on the European stage for a number of years.  It is also pertinent to draw attention to the fact that another successful Presidency has been completed by a small member state of the European Union.  This is proof positive, if such was needed, of the constructive contribution that small member states make to the ongoing progress of the Union.</P>
      <P>I want to confine my remarks to the ongoing project of the single currency and to express my serious concerns about the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  If we have a referendum on this treaty between now and 1 May &mdash; the euro X group of countries must be identified by 1 May &mdash; it will become a referendum on the single currency, notwithstanding the fact that this issue is not the subject matter of the Amsterdam Treaty. I am concerned that various issues will be made part of that referendum and that we could get a negative result because of the genuine fears many people have about the possible negative consequences of a fluctuating value for sterling while the Irish pound is in the euro group.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to consider holding that referendum after 1 May.  If I understood the Taoiseach correctly on the Order of Business, it will probably require time to introduce legislation to enable the Government to provide more substantial information on referenda than is currently allowed under the interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment in the McKenna case.  It might, therefore, be suitable to consider that proposal. While I do not want to be alarmist about the single currency, there is the possibility of some fluctuation and turbulence in European money markets between now and 1 May.  That could be presented to the electorate as the reason for not accepting the single currency and for using the only instrument available to it, the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I am disappointed the Government has not yet published the White Paper on the Amsterdam Treaty.  I draw attention to the fact that the European Commission has been able to publish fairly readable documentation which we all received recently.  I cannot understand why the Government has not done something similar.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the outcome of the second Luxembourg summit as the first summit on employment was reasonably successful.  I share the views expressed by Deputy John Bruton about Europe's attitude to Turkey.  We need to clarify our position in relation to Turkey both from the point of view of Europe's self-interest and from the Turkish point of view.  While I am glad that the Turkish Prime Minister drew back from severing links with the European Union at the last moment, it behoves all of us to clarify our relationship particularly with Turkey given that it is a secular state of an Islamic nation.  It is a democratic state, albeit an imperfect one in that it has had military rule on a couple of occasions. It also has serious internal problems and civil rights abuses of which we are all familiar.  Notwithstanding that, it provides a bridge for Europe into central Asia for reasons to which Deputy John Bruton has already referred.  Europe will ignore those links at its peril as we go into the next century.</P>
    <P>As regards Agenda 2000, I note the Taoiseach's statement that discussion on this issue has been postponed.  I put on the record of the House the Labour Party's concerns about the way in which we are currently using Structural Funds, the manner in which the mid-term review is being conducted, the appalling decision with respect to Luas, which seriously endangers the access of the Government to those funds because there is a presumption that that money can be diverted from it to other transportation projects within the operational programme.  Commissioner Wolf-Mathies indicated that, not just to Government officials but also to other people in Dublin.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, ensure Luas goes ahead and the money is not lost, in light of the transportation problems we have and the absolute necessity to draw down enough money in a constructive and effective way?</P>
    <P>The decision by the Minister for Public Enterprise was wrong and politically motivated and we know what the conclusion of the report will be.  An underground option for Dublin is simply too expensive and if anybody thinks that the construction of an underground network as distinct from one on the surface would be less disruptive to traffic, then he or she need only look at the record of construction of subway systems in Athens, which is ongoing, and Milan, where the system was built over 20 years ago and large sections of the street were dug up to facilitate cut and fill construction.  There is also the sad reality that many people do not feel safe in underground <Col N="708" /> passages and this is an additional deterrent to the construction of a subway.</P>
    <P>I share the Taoiseach's view that enlargement of the Union to include other six countries &mdash; Cyprus and the five Central European countries &mdash; is a positive decision.  There are real and constructive opportunities for Ireland, including the agribusiness sector, having regard to similar large sectors in the new countries and the large section of our economy devoted to agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Government of the day and Opposition parties to enter into a new dialogue with the people which points out the fact that Ireland will soon become a net contributor to the EU.  This is good because it demonstrates that Ireland is of a sufficient level of wealth to become a net contributor but the attitude in some sectors of society has been that Europe was a place from which we got money, to which we went with the outstretched lámh and the béal bocht.  That attitude will no longer prevail because it will not be the case.  None of us should be surprised if there follows from those sectors of the community a negative reaction to our membership and participation within the EU.  Therefore, the Government has an obligation to start a process of communication and education.  I fail to detect any signs of either an awareness or a commitment to such a programme.</P>
    <P>It is most relevant in the areas of CAP reform and Structural Funds.  The Government has the information and instruments at its disposal to embark upon the necessary programme.  Otherwise, we will inevitably get a negative reaction from certain sections of the community, as can be seen in other member states.  It is simply not in Ireland's interest for that to become manifest or for that attitude to take root politically because it has been a considerable beneficiary over the past 25 years of membership of the EU, not just in cash terms, although that has been significant, but in the transformation of the country's culture, politics, social laws and general attitude to the rest of the world in a way very few people envisaged during the referendum in 1972.</P>
    <P>The process of decision making within the community is very slow.  The failure in Amsterdam &mdash; Deputy Bruton and I were there &mdash; to address this issue has left the burden in terms of discussion with the six applicant countries more difficult because the institution framework is not clear.  The issue of one commissioner per country has not been resolved and the democratic deficit that exists has not been addressed, as referred to by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>The difficulties he described when there is an economic shock or a downturn within the EU will bring about the political forces necessary in the first instance to get the flexibility within the French and German economies and also bring about political realisation that the issue of what Dominique Strauss Khan has described as &ldquo;economic governance&rdquo; will have to be addressed in a more meaningful way than is the case at present. <Col N="709" /> In due course, I will be bringing forward my party's ideas in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have everything to gain from participating in a form of &ldquo;economic governance&rdquo; which is democratically accountable to the European Parliament as well as our own.  We have much more to gain than we have to lose but we should be pushing forward ideas in the context of the European debate.  Ireland has for too long been a passive participant in the EU integration process. Different Administrations with different combinations of parties have been extremely good at running the Presidency and we have a superb Civil Service in terms of the way it has risen to that task on numerous occasions.  Our capabilities in that regard are in no way doubted and our ability to contribute ideas is enhanced by our performance in the past but the Taoiseach's responsibility is to start to contribute constructive ideas to the debate.  The enlargement process will not be consummated and concluded unless the institution questions are addressed.</P>
    <P>Rather than having blocking and holding positions which tended to be our tradition we should be taking the initiative.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach may ask &mdash; and I accept it as a valid criticism &mdash; why Deputies Quinn and Bruton are making these speeches now when for the past two and a half years we were in Government.  Cultures must change and periods in Opposition gives one time to change culture but we will have to come forwards with positive proposals.  There will be a willingness to listen to a country such as Ireland because of our success in the past and the authority that the Luxembourg Presidency has given to citizens and to a lesser extent the success of the Dutch Presidency.</P>

      <P>The EU is at a critical point in its development and decisions now being made &mdash; or in some cases not being made &mdash; will have a profound impact on the lives and wellbeing of the people of Europe for generations to come, not least for the people of this country.</P>
      <P>The most significant development at the Luxembourg Summit was clearly the decision to set in train immediate formal accession negotiations for six countries and to begin pre-accession procedures involving five other candidate countries.  If these countries eventually join it will mean a huge enlargement of the EU, with an increase in 60 per cent in the land area covered by the community and an increase of close to 50 per cent in population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enlargement process provides both great opportunities and very serious problems.  The accession of additional countries from Central and Eastern Europe can clearly contribute to the further development of a stable and peaceful Europe.  Many of them suffer from serious levels of poverty, with living standards varying from 18 <Col N="710" /> per cent to 59 per cent of the EU average.  There will be huge difficulties involved in absorbing them.  One question is whether EU institutions can be adapted to deal with the huge increase in territory, population, language and cultures involved.  The complicated decision-making process is already scarcely capable of coping with 15 member states.  How do we ensure a Union of 25 or 26 is not reduced to a bumbling, indecisive, bureaucratic giant?  How do we restructure the institutions &mdash; the Parliament, the Council of Ministers, the Commission &mdash; to give a real voice to the new member states, without diminishing the rights of existing member states, including smaller states such as Ireland?</P>
    <P>The financial implications are enormous.  Are we prepared to contribute to the economic and social development of the African countries in the same generous manner in which the wealthier European countries have contributed to our development in the past 25 years?</P>
    <P>Agriculture in the African countries is underdeveloped and huge changes will be needed in the European Union agricultural regime.  Are Irish farmers prepared to face up to this?  All the areas I have referred to have major implications for Ireland and yet, with the exception of those who specialise in European affairs, there has been little or no public debate on them.  In this regard the referendum campaign for the Amsterdam Treaty will provide an important opportunity but the efforts of Government so far do not inspire confidence.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste seem to be at loggerheads over such basic matters as whether the promised White Paper will be completed and when the referendum will take place.</P>
    <P>We should continue to support in principle the accession of Turkey to the European Union.  I do so on the grounds that Europe should not be limited to a 20th century definition of what constitutes its borders.  Accession should be determined by economic, social and democratic structures and the compatibility of those who want to join the European Union within those structures.  We should unequivocally support all those who insist there is no place in the European Union for any state which engages in official torture among other grievous human rights abuses, refuses decisions of a legitimate international organisation such as the United Nations and generally has an accepted dependence on military solutions to problems within and between states.</P>
    <P>While supporting, so far as we can, the British Government in terms of its new openness to Europe, it would not make sense for us to support the presence of the British Government representatives on decisions in relation to how we manage the new euro currency.  It should not be connected in any way to rewards or punishments. Ireland must unequivocally support the French Government's stance on the matter over those who regard the ECB as sacrosanct.  Sentiment should not enter into this.  We are close neighbours but, at the end of the day, Ireland's <Col N="711" /> interests are Europe wide and we should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  I welcome the pledge made after the meeting to attempt to drive forward the agenda in relation to the negotiations in Northern Ireland.  It is clear considerable progress has been made.  The failure at yesterday's meeting in Belfast to agree an agenda is a setback but it will be possible to make significant progress when the talks resume in January.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the negative signs coming from the republican movement.  The orchestrated violent rioting in Derry last weekend, the unfounded attacks on the Taoiseach and the Government in <i>An Phoblacht</i> last week and the reported refusal of Sinn Féin to agree to the inclusion of an assembly in Northern Ireland on the talks agenda are all matters of concern.  I hope they do not indicate any back-track on the part of the republican movement.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, who is in Copenhagen attending a ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate as I contributed to a previous debate on the employment summit.  We adopted the employment guidelines on Monday last.</P>
      <P>This was a European Council of exceptional interest and importance.  As is clear from the Taoiseach's account of the occasion, the Luxembourg European Council of 12 and 13 December mapped out the future development of the European Union and took historic decisions on its enlargement.  Because of the necessary and understandable focus on the future of the Union, the European Council did not devote its customary attention to key foreign policy issues. Deputies will have noticed in assessing the Presidency conclusions of the European Council and considering media reports, that apart from the Union's relations with Turkey which permeated much of the discussion on enlargement, only two foreign policy issues of vital importance were considered.  I shall return to these later.</P>
      <P>In launching the next phase of the enlargement process to include within the European Union the new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe together with Cyprus, the Luxembourg European Council took a decisive step forward in the historic project of creating a new Europe, one united on the basis of shared democratic principles, respect for minorities and human rights, and economic opportunity and social justice for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council also noted that the major part of the arrangement for the transition to the single currency is now in place and urged that final practical arrangements for implementing the third stage of EMU, which are <Col N="712" /> to be completed by May 1998, be speeded up. The agreement reached in Luxembourg on the issue of meetings of representatives of member states participating in the single currency should enable the Community to work effectively after the introduction of the euro.</P>
    <P>Ireland took a positive view of the Commission's proposals for enlargement in Agenda 2000.  We saw them as being generally well balanced and, together with the opinions, providing an objective basis for the conduct of the next phase of the enlargement process.</P>
    <P>We also made clear Ireland's commitment to the enlargement of the European Union, on the basis shared by all our partners, namely, that it is an historic opportunity for peace and stability in Europe.  If time permitted, I would like to have a longer debate on what other Deputies have said. The ultimate vision we all share is one of building a stable and peaceful European Union.  I could also raise some of the issues raised at the Amsterdam Treaty negotiations.  In Opposition we raised some of the points rightly raised by Deputy Quinn concerning the way to deal with these issues and the need for more openness and transparency whether in Opposition or in Government.</P>
    <P>In summing up at the Luxembourg European Council the Taoiseach was open and transparent when he referred to Ireland's success.  We benefited substantially and he was open and frank in relation to where we stand and what we have to do in the future.</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg European Council faced the task of ensuring that the Union took the necessary decisions to launch successfully the next phase of the enlargement process, including accession negotiations.  At the same time, the Union had to ensure that these decisions would set in motion an inclusive process leading to accession by all the new democracies that have applied to join.  Both of these important objectives were achieved.  In the process, the European Union has shown itself to be open and generous towards the new democracies which have emerged from the former Soviet bloc.  This will help underpin democracy in these countries and will help their economies and assist in ensuring a secure and prosperous Europe for the future.</P>
    <P>The accession process will be launched on 30 March 1998 by a meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the 15 members states of the European Union, the ten Central and Eastern European applicant states and Cyprus.  Detailed negotiations on enlargement will commence in April 1998 with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.</P>
    <P>The European Council also addressed the issues of the European conference and the development of the Union's relations with Turkey. Ireland welcomed the proposal for the establishment of a European conference on the basis that the conference could provide a useful multilateral framework for closer consultations between all applicants and the Union which <Col N="713" /> should serve to strengthen their involvement with the Union.  Initially, the Union's offer is addressed to Cyprus, the applicant states of Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the European Council relating to the conference set out the necessary common commitment to peace, security and good neighbourliness, including respect for other countries' sovereignty and the principles upon which the European Union is founded.  Countries which endorse the principles in question and respect the right of any European country fulfilling the required criteria to accede to the Union and which share the Union's commitment to building a Europe free of the divisions and difficulties of the past will be invited to take part in this conference.</P>
    <P>Ireland felt it was important that the European Council should recognise Turkey's European vocation and confirm Turkey's eligibility for accession to the European Union.  This confirmation is explicitly stated in the European Council conclusions.  The conclusions outline the main elements of a strategy to prepare Turkey for accession by bringing it closer to the European Union in every field.  Given the positive elements contained in the European conference proposal and the European strategy for Turkey, with the importance of strengthening Turkey's links with the European Union, I remain hopeful that Turkey will keep all these elements under review and be able to respond positively to the possibilities and potential they represent.</P>
    <P>I am especially pleased to report that the European Council adopted a significant declaration marking the beginning of the year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The text in its first paragraph affirms that &ldquo;the Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As we move towards enlargement of the Union it is more important than ever that we should be clear about the fundamental principles on which it is based.  These principles are enshrined in the criteria established by the Copenhagan Council in June 1993 for accession to the Union.  The Commission, in formulating its opinions on individual candidates for membership which are contained in the Agenda 2000 document, has paid due attention to the political and human rights criteria established by the Copenhagen Council.</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg Council declaration appeals to all states to step up their efforts in the field of human rights by acceding to international instruments to which they are not yet party with a view to achieving the objective of universal ratification of the international treaties and protocols concerning human rights; ensuring more stringent implementation of those instruments; strengthening the role of civil society in promoting and protecting human rights; promoting activities on the ground and developing technical assistance in the <Col N="714" /> area of human rights; and strengthening training and education programmes concerning human rights.</P>
    <P>In regard to the first area where the European Council has called for enhanced efforts by member states, the House will recall that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced the motion against racism which was passed yesterday, without a division, and committed himself to bringing forward proposals for legislation which will allow Ireland to move towards ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as soon as possible.  The Minister has confirmed his intention to make provisions which will enable Ireland to move to ratify the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</P>
    <P>The European Council pledged its full support for Mrs. Mary Robinson in her position as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and stressed the importance of her task.  The House will recall that in recent weeks the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with special responsibility for human rights have reaffirmed Ireland's support for Mrs. Robinson and her office.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with the other member states of the European Union, will be organising a number of national activities to mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It will be our aim, in co-operation with the office of the High Commissioner and our partners, to ensure 1998 &mdash; Human Rights Year &mdash; is observed in Ireland and elsewhere by increased and sustained efforts to make human rights a reality worldwide.  We have a proud record of working to prevent human rights violations.  In commemorating the 50th anniversary of the solemn act of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we have an ideal opportunity to give new impetus to human rights, drawing inspiration from the achievements of the past 50 years while not forgetting the tragedies that have beset many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The Middle East peace process is a major foreign policy concern of the European Union. Deputies will recall that at the Dublin European Council in October 1996 a decision was reached to reflect that concern by appointing a special envoy of the Union to the area.  By the December 1996 Council in Dublin the appointment had been made.  Successive Presidencies have paid particular attention to the peace process and I compliment the Luxembourg Presidency on its achievements in this respect.  Foreign Minister Jacques Poos has visited the region extensively and maintained close contacts with the United States whose efforts to revive the peace process the Union fully supports.</P>
    <P>The lengthy conclusions, which run from paragraphs 70 to 87, adopted by the European Council reflect the continuing concern of the Union with the current stalemate in the Middle East peace process.  This is a concern which the <Col N="715" /> Government fully shares.  The Council recalled the Union's policy reflected in earlier declarations, expressed its satisfaction with the activities of the Union's special envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, and endorsed a series of guidelines aimed at facilitating progress in the short and medium term.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the Council's affirmation that the Union will use all its political and moral weight to ensure existing commitments are fully implemented on the basis of reciprocity by the Israeli and the Palestinian sides.  Such commitments include credible and significant redeployments.</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg conclusions pointed out that progress requires the avoidance of counterproductive unilateral actions in relation to settlements in Jerusalem, while underlining the importance of the fight against terrorism and security co-operation between Israelis and Palestinians. The European Union is ready to contribute to permanent status negotiations by offering specific suggestions on related subjects, including &ldquo;possible Palestinian statehood, borders/security arrangements, settlements, refugees, Jerusalem and water issues&rdquo;.  The listing of these issues is a salutary reminder of the complexity of this and every peace process.</P>
    <P>The role of the Union as a major economic partner of Israel and the Palestinian Authority is not always fully appreciated.  The Council conclusions are valuable in pointing to this reality and identifying a number of ways in which the Union can contribute to economic development which is vital to the creation of a sound environment for peace.  The House will share the Government's view that the Council's conclusions represent a comprehensive and balanced text and offer a clear indication of the importance attached to the Middle East peace process.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs reported to his colleagues on his recent visit to Algeria in the course of a working dinner on Friday last.  The visit was warmly welcomed by the Presidency and other partners as helping to reinforce the dialogue between the Union and Algeria.  As my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has pointed out, a real concern to ensure positive developments in Algeria is best demonstrated by patient dialogue based on an understanding of the situation.</P>

    <Title>Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1997  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is concerned with two important issues relating to the courts.  It provides for an increase in the statutory limit on the number of ordinary judges of the High Court from 22 to 24, not including the President of the High Court, and that all future appointments as Chief Justice, <Col N="716" /> President of the High Court, President of the Circuit Court and President of the District Court will be for a maximum, non-renewable period of seven years.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the increase in the number of High Court judges.  Earlier this year the House was involved in the enactment of the Courts Act, 1997.  That Act increased the statutory limit on the number of ordinary judges of the High Court from 19 to 22.  It was brought forward in the context of pressure on the number of judges in the High Court due to commitments arising from non-court duties involving the Nursing Commission and the pending Dunnes Tribunal.  The Act was welcomed by the House because its objective was to ensure the progress being made in reducing delays in hearing criminal and civil cases before the High Court would not be adversely affected by the temporary appointment of High Court judges to carry out other duties.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the work of the Nursing Commission is ongoing and that further tribunals are in the course of being established. Because of the involvement of High Court judges in the proposed tribunals, these developments threaten the considerable progress which has been made in reducing delays, particularly in hearing personal injury actions in the High Court and in dealing with cases in the Central Criminal Court.  Deputies, I am sure, will agree that litigants, victims of crime and the community as a whole which has an interest in the efficient operation of the courts system should not be adversely affected by the developments to which I have referred.  That is one of the main reasons I have brought forward this Bill which, in section 2, provides for an increase in the statutory maximum limit on the number of judges of the High Court from 22 to 24, in addition to the President of the High Court.  The Government has approved the filling of one of these new vacancies immediately and the need for the filling of the second High Court vacancy created by the Bill will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, to make provision for an increase by one in the number of judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court where one of the judges of those courts is appointed to the position of commissioner in the Law Reform Commission. This is essentially a technical matter and all that is involved is a tidying up of earlier amendments which have been made to the 1975 Act.</P>
    <P>The second overall objective of the Bill is to provide that all future appointments as Chief Justice or as President of the other courts, who are described as presiding judges in the context of the Bill, will be for a maximum, non-renewable, seven year period.  This was recommended by the working group on a Courts Commission chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham in its second report entitled Case Management and Court Management.  The relevant provisions of the Bill for that purpose are sections 4 to 12 inclusive.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the working group in <Col N="717" /> relation to seven year court Presidencies was made with reference to the extremely heavy administrative workload involved in these key judicial positions which must be managed along with the normal judicial functions of those positions. This is a very sensible approach and reflects the modern trend with regard to limiting the term of senior office in areas of professional and public life.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the central provision with regard to the new maximum periods of appointment for presiding judges, subsequent sections being consequential on this section.  There are a number of significant aspects resulting from the provision for new periods of appointment for presiding judges.  First, only appointments made after the enactment of these measures will be affected. Second, the Bill does not preclude the appointment as presiding judge of a person who has less than seven years to serve before full retirement as a judge.  Third, an appointment as a presiding judge will not be capable of being renewed at the end of the seven year period although, of course, the Bill does not preclude a further appointment as presiding judge of another court.  Last, when a presiding judge has completed his or her seven year term and has not reached retirement age, he or she will continue to serve as a judge of the relevant court.  This last element of section 4 gives rise to the need for the directly consequential provisions of sections 5 and 6.</P>
    <P>When, for example, a Chief Justice completes his or her seven year term and continues as a judge of the Supreme Court, the maximum number of judges of that court will be unaffected where another judge of the Supreme Court is appointed as the new Chief Justice.  If, however, the new Chief Justice were to be appointed from outside the Supreme Court, the former Chief Justice continuing to serve as a judge of that court would breach the statutory limit on the number of judges of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Section 5 takes account of this by providing for an increase in the number of judges attached to a particular court in such circumstances notwithstanding the statutory provisions relating to the limitation on the number of judges of the courts. However, section 6 makes it clear that this increase in the maximum number of judges will be temporary, or will not occur at all, depending on the position in the relevant court with regard to vacancies.  Again, taking the Supreme Court as an example, where there is already an existing vacancy, the former Chief Justice will automatically fill that vacancy and the provisions of section 5, increasing the number of judges, will not apply in that case.  Where there is no immediate vacancy, the number of judges in the Supreme Court will be increased by one temporarily until the next vacancy arises which will be filled automatically by the former Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>Section 6 applies this provision for the filling of vacancies by former residing judges to each of the courts.  I might add that the new seven year terms may give rise to the presence on a court bench of <Col N="718" /> more than one former presiding judge.  The provisions relating to increases in the numbers of judges and the filling of vacancies take full account of that possibility.</P>
    <P>Section 7 adapts existing provisions whereby the Chief Justice is <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court and the other Presidents are <i>ex officio</i> judges of the next superior court.  The section provides that, when a presiding judge has completed a seven year term and continues as a judge of the relevant court, he or she will retain his or her position as <i>ex officio</i> judge until retirement. This is being done to ensure that no constitutional problem will arise out of the removal of judicial duties conferred by virtue of <i>ex officio</i> membership of a court.</P>
    <P>Article 35.5 of the Constitution prohibits the reduction of the remuneration of a judge during his or her continuance in office.  Accordingly, I have provided in section 8 that a former presiding judge will continue to be paid the salary payable to the presiding judge and that pensions and other entitlements will be paid at the higher judicial rate.  Would that the same applied in the case of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 9 adapts existing provisions relating to the order of the precedence of judges of the Supreme and High Courts to take account of the position of former presiding judges.  A former Chief Justice will have precedence after the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court but before the ordinary members of the Supreme Court.  A former President of the High Court will have precedence after the President of the High Court and after the judges of the Supreme Court but before the ordinary judges of the High Court. A former President of the Circuit Court, who will be <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court, will rank after the President of the Circuit Court but before the ordinary judges of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that only a presiding judge will be capable of exercising a statutory function of a Chief Justice or President of the court.  Any such statutory function will not continue to be exercisable by a former Chief Justice or President who continues to serve as a judge.  This provision has been included for the avoidance of any doubt in the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 11 takes account of various existing provisions conferring functions on the &ldquo;senior ordinary judge&rdquo; of the Supreme Court or High Court.  For example, legislation provides that the Chief Justice, or in his or her absence the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, may determine that an appeal before the Supreme Court may be heard by a division of five or three judges. This section makes it clear that a former Chief Justice or a President of the High Court who continues to serve as a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court, respectively, will be the &ldquo;senior ordinary judge&rdquo; by virtue of his or her ranking ahead of the other judges of the court under the provisions of section 9.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts Acts the President of the District Court is permanently assigned by the <Col N="719" /> Government to the Dublin Metropolitan District. Section 12 provides that a former President of the District Court who continues to serve as a judge of the District Court will continue to be permanently assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan District but also will be in a position to avail of the normal transfer arrangements for District Court judges.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members will appreciate that this Bill is important in the move towards a more modern courts system very clearly signalled by the Courts Service Bill considered at Second Stage in the Seanad last week.  Under that Bill, the establishment of an independent Courts Service to manage the courts system more efficiently is a key priority of Government.  It is my firm belief that the public is entitled to expect an efficient, quality service from our courts and that this Bill will contribute in a significant way to the continuing programme of reform of our courts system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I welcome the Bill in that, by increasing the number of High Court judges, it should lead to speedier justice.  Emphasis on speedier justice was very much to the fore of the agenda of the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, within whose tenure in office investment in the courts increased from £23.8 million in 1994 to £30.5 million in 1997.  The working group on the Courts Commission laid the basis for the Courts Service Bill, passed by the Seanad, which will be discussed in this House shortly and was based on the detail of four major reports.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of judges permitted by legislation was increased from 86 to 110; in other words, 24 extra judges were appointed to our courts in just over two years compared with an additional ten in the preceding ten years.  A second Supreme Court was established so that two cases could be heard simultaneously in that court.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, additional court sittings were arranged to reduce the backlog.  The net result is that the period for obtaining a court date has been reduced from two years to within six weeks of lodgment.  In the Dublin Circuit Court the period for obtaining a court date in family law cases has been reduced from 16 months to four months and delays in the hearing of criminal cases have been virtually eliminated.  In the Dublin High Court delays in hearing personal injury actions have been reduced from 35 to 20 months.</P>
      <P>However, there are certain accepted norms and procedures which, if abolished, would certainly speed up the administration of justice in our courts and might even dispense with the need for the extra judicial appointments proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the Four Courts last week.  Not being a lawyer I was absolutely fascinated to see Court 12, for example, packed with barristers and a High Court judge presiding over the setting of the timetable and calendar for court hearings, part of <Col N="720" /> what is known as listings.  Every Monday morning there are two common law listings with High Court judges tied up on basic administrative work which could just as efficiently be carried out by a specially trained civil servant or clerk.  Alternatively it could be easily filtered by a registrar as is the case in Britain where there is a listing system twice a month when defence lawyers, almost guru-like in style, receive a rap on the knuckles for failure to file in time.  There is also a warning list and a call-over list in relation to personal injuries.  That is a gross waste of time and valuable judicial experience and personnel.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom system deals efficiently with the rather mundane work involved in listings and releases judges to their primary function of dispensing justice.  That problem could be remedied in this country in 70 per cent of cases, perhaps in all cases except those where legal issues are to be determined.  We must revisit procedures and dispose of traditional but time wasting practices which have become an unnecessary and ingrained part of the system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the appointment of two extra judges because of the assigning of judges to tribunal duties.  Tribunals, by and large, have been invaluable in terms of sifting through some of the more unseemly aspects of political practice and behaviour over recent years.  It is crucial for the restoration of confidence in the body politic that the tribunals currently afoot can fully discharge their functions, establish full facts and send out a clear signal that shadiness and shoddiness have no place in Irish political life.  As I said in the House last week, if either tribunal fails to fulfil its remit, I have no doubt that more damage than good will accrue.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the decision to limit the appointments of Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court to seven years.  Indeed, that practice might well be replicated in other walks of life. I proposed a similar idea, when I was education spokesman for my party a number of years ago, for school principalships from the point of view of enhancing promotional prospects and incentives in the teaching profession as well as acknowledging the burn out factor which is a feature of modern schools.  I did not envisage, however, that they would settle back to less onerous positions with their emoluments intact, as happens in this case.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the motivation of the people who drafted section 35 of the Constitution but it should be adequate for judges' pension entitlements to be enhanced by the percentage of the additional salary for the seven year period in question they are presiding over the court without the guarantee of the full higher rate, even though he or she no longer continues to do the management job.  That seems to be a bad principle and a wrong practice which is impossible to explain.  I do not understand the reason for it. Perhaps the Minister would indicate what is behind this section of the Constitution which <Col N="721" /> determines that even though a person is no longer doing the job they continue to draw the pay.</P>
    <P>I agree with the flexibility the Bill introduces in terms of accommodating short-term adjustment of the number of judges in the various courts depending on whatever procedural or promotional positions are put in place.  There is a strong case for examining the possible unification of the legal profession, in particular the eligibility of solicitors to become judges of the Supreme Court.  Since solicitors can appear and have the right of audience in the Supreme Court they should at least be eligible to be judges of that court.  People should be assessed on their qualifications and competence to do the job and, without wishing to be judgmental of judges, it is generally agreed that solicitor-judges are recognised as good judges.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, allowed, for the first time, solicitors to be appointed to either the Supreme Court or the High Court.  As a result, a solicitor became eligible to become a judge of the Circuit Court.  Any solicitor who has been a judge of the Circuit Court for four years or more becomes eligible for appointment to the High Court and from that to the Supreme Court.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment which will introduce full uniformity in judicial appointments.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is in the process of introducing two Bills to the Oireachtas, the Courts (No. 2) Bill and the Courts Service Bill, for which I am sure he will be willing to claim and accept the credit, I hope he will realise that there is a consequent obligation and responsibility to answer questions.  The refusal of the Minister to make any attempt to explain to the Dáil the systems failure in relation to the arrest and release, re-arrest and re-release, of persons connected with the Tallaght cannabis haul was not good enough. The Minister initially refused to divulge any of the relevant details to which this House and the general public are entitled.  He eventually came into the House the following week and gave the facts, which he had not done the previous week, as they transpired in the intervening period.  It then transpired that the Minister imparted the wrong information in relation to the number of judges in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The Minister had to come into the House on Tuesday, 2 December and again tell the House that a third judge had been appointed for the purpose of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act.  I ask the Minister if he is absolutely satisfied that no other judge who had not been nominated for the purpose of this Act acted in relation to the extension of detention warrants.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of the Bill and I join with the Minister in commending it to the House. I have tabled an amendment which has substantial merit and substance and I hope he will see his way to accept it because it is the right direction in which to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the main provisions of which seem to be necessary, relevant and sensible in the context of the increasing demands now being placed on the Judiciary.  The main provision of the Bill is to increase the total number of judges in the High Court to 24 which is reasonable in the context of the increasing workload in the courts and the involvement of judges in tribunals, commissions and so on.  The amount of work carried out by judges in areas outside the courts over the past number of years has been exceptional by any standards.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that tribunals and commissions consume an enormous amount of judicial time.  While tribunals have a function and are necessary, I hope we are coming towards the end of the current spate of tribunals.  The public will become exhausted with them and their cost.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Bill should lighten the workload and the pressure on judges because it is essential that they have an opportunity to reflect at some length, particularly in certain cases, before they make judgments.  Such decisions should be arrived at in a calm manner.  Judges should not feel under pressure to reach decisions as a result of their workload.  It is more important that the decisions arrived at are given a little more consideration than is normally the case.</P>
      <P>The placing of a limit of seven years on non-renewable appointments for the positions of Chief Justice and Presidents of the High Court, the Supreme Court and the District Court is in accordance with modern thinking on the appointment of key decision makers throughout the public service and in business.  In the wider public service, county managers and people of similar status are normally appointed on a five year contract. Many of those in business have similar contracts including the heads of institutions such as universities.  It is worth bearing in mind, however, that while this should be the normal procedure, there may be exceptional circumstances in which it might be necessary to deviate from that general principle.  As a general rule, however, it is desirable and it will greatly enhance the functioning of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has decided this provision will only apply to appointments made after the Bill has been enacted.  That is a wise decision because an attempt to apply the new measures to existing appointees may give rise to some discord as well as exposing the State to the risk of legal challenges which, in the event of their being successful, would be very undesirable.  It is sensible that retiring presidents of the various courts should be allowed serve in the relevant court after their presidential appointment has expired. I have no doubt those people will have accumulated a good deal of wisdom during their period of appointment and that some of that wisdom will be transferred and transmitted in the general environment in which judges find themselves. That is desirable rather than much of the wisdom and experience they would have accumulated being lost when they retire.  It is worthwhile that <Col N="723" /> ex-presidents of the various courts should be still practising, as it were, in the courts so that those who may want to seek their advice would be able to obtain it.</P>
    <P>I am fascinated the Minister included a section in the Bill which lays down the pecking order of the various judges after they have retired.  I would have thought such a matter would be determined by custom and practice and the tradition associated with law rather than it being necessary to write that into the Bill.  It might be a precaution to avoid wigs on the green in the event of someone overstepping the mark.  In the world of high decorum I associate with the law I would have thought it might not have been necessary for the Minister to include that provision in the Bill, but perhaps we should not underestimate the capacity for contention and discord in some circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand the catalyst for the introduction of this Bill was the retirement of Mr. Justice Declan Costello from his position as President of the High Court.  During the debate in the Seanad a number of tributes were paid to him for the manner in which he carried out his duties as a judge and carried on his career as a lawyer and a politician, which included the role of being a TD and Attorney General.  I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to him in the debate in the Seanad.  He seemed to be an excellent judge, but I do not speak from a position of having any great insights into the law as I am not a lawyer.  His career as a politician was worthwhile.  He filled the role of a TD and the position of Attorney General with a good deal of distinction.  His role as a political thinker and writer had a significant influence on Irish politics generally.  He is credited with having written &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo;, a forward looking and progressive document at the time it was published.  The ideas contained in it are in sharp contrast to some of the other cautious ones that were prevalent at that time.  I wish Mr. Justice Costello every happiness and fulfilment in retirement after his very distinguished career on a number of different fronts.</P>
    <P>I am also fascinated by Deputy Higgins's amendment which he mentioned during his Second Stage contribution.  It deals with the idea that solicitors can go all the way to the top.  That is not a matter on which I have a well grounded view.  I would not like to get involved in any exchanges of discord about it, suffice to say I have met a number of barristers who are quite disturbed &mdash; a stronger word might be more appropriate &mdash; at the prospect of solicitors going all the way to the top.  However, that is a matter I am happy to leave to the rarefied atmosphere of the higher end of the legal profession, but I am sure the Minister, who is also a solicitor, has a view on that which he may be too cautious to share with us or is not prepared to take the risk that would be attached to expressing it.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the good wishes and congratulations other Deputies and Senators expressed to Mr. Justice Declan Costello on his retirement.  He has made a tremendous contribution and that is justly recognised.</P>
      <P>This Bill recognises the increasing role of judges in legal and non-legal duties.  I accept fully the need for extra judges to be appointed to meet these new and changing needs.  The appointment of judges to head up tribunals has proved to be an effective means to ensure that tribunals can and do carry out their functions.  We had a fine example of the effectiveness of the judge appointed in the recent McCracken tribunal into payments to politicians.  That tribunal carried out its work with great speed, clarity and effectiveness. The growth in the number of tribunals is a relatively recent phenomenon and reflects a great public requirement for accountability in the political system.</P>
      <P>Many politicians have expressed their dismay at the scandals attached to the political system in recent times.  However, there is another perspective on recent events.  Irish politics will only be strengthened in the long run if it is subjected to consistent public scrutiny.  In the past there was too much secrecy, too many strokes, too much of the &ldquo;nod and wink&rdquo; and too little disclosure and access to information.  However, at a practical level such scrutiny requires resources.  In increasing the number of judges we are recognising the changed circumstances within which we now operate; circumstances that have changed for the better.</P>
      <P>In this spirit of change it is a pity that the substantive Courts Service Bill is not being taken with this Bill.  Changes proposed in that Bill will radically transform courts services, including the establishment of a new courts service.  Great credit is due to Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and the working group charged with this work and I pay tribute to her and the group for their contribution. Her work is a reminder that this country has been served well by its Supreme Court.  The current Chief Justice follows a long line of distinguished holders of that office who have brought credit to the Judiciary and set wise precedents in difficult cases where sometimes politicians failed to live up to their obligations and it was left to the Supreme Court to make a determination in the absence of legislation.  The judgment in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case was one in point.  We have also been well served by our Chief Justices who have steered their courts through often difficult times while maintaining the absolute independence and integrity of the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill the change proposed will limit the appointment of Chief Justice and other appointments to a maximum non-renewable seven year term.  I understand this recommendation from the group headed up by Mrs. Justice Denham reflects a need to recognise the workload involved.  A seven year limit is now commonplace in the appointment of secretaries to Government <Col N="725" /> Departments and of county managers of local authorities.  There are cogent arguments for a limit which leads to a more dynamic and effective management, but it is worth pointing out that the appointment of judges and their advancement is very different from any other category of appointment.  For example, Article 35.5 of the Constitution states, &ldquo;The remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during his continuance in office.&rdquo; That Article has significant implications for this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that when a presiding judge has completed a term and continues as a judge he or she will retain his or her <i>ex-officio</i> judicial position until retirement.  This means, in effect, that ex-presidents at each court level will benefit financially on an ongoing basis after their seven years are up.  As there will be many more ex-presidents, the additional pension demand will also be significant.  I am unhappy that the cost of this generosity by the Oireachtas is not spelt out in the Bill.  It should be because that information might indicate that such generosity to our judges deserves to be given more consideration than this debate allows for.</P>
    <P>In particular, even if we pay this extra cost and it does not address the underlying problems in running the courts, it is evident that the administrative workload is creating problems.  What is needed to improve the efficiency of the courts is a chief executive and a proper administration.  Judges are ultimately appointed to judge, not to be administrators although, as seen by the great improvement in dealing with the delays in the courts, the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High, Circuit and District Courts have done their work. However, effective administration is needed to back them up.  Otherwise serious problems can and will arise.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister can recall &mdash; how could he forget?  &mdash; the recent debacle where a District Court judge was unaware he did not have authority to grant an extension to the detention of five men detained following a major drugs find.  In that case, the President of the District Court had responsibility for the appointment of specific judges under the legislation, yet Judge Windle was unaware of this, and the Garda and the Minister's Department were also unaware of it. Indeed, even when the Department received the information, there was a final extraordinary twist to the tale when it was discovered that the information given to the Minister as to the number appointed for the Dublin area was inaccurate.  As a consequence, the Minister was duty bound to come back into the House to correct the record.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I considered it normal practice for the Minister to advise Opposition spokespersons when he intended to come into the House to make a statement of this kind.  I was not informed.  I do not know whether the other spokespersons were advised.  That is a courtesy which should be maintained.</P>
    <P>This kind of failure in the system does not <Col N="726" /> serve anyone except the criminals.  It undermines confidence and leads to the evasion of justice.  I look forward to the Minister bringing the Court Services Bill before the Dáil soon &mdash; I think the Minister has undertaken to do that &mdash; so we can set about the true and comprehensive reform which the courts need to provide an efficient, prompt and fair service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but there are a number of issues arising out of it which need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Yet again we have a Bill increasing the number of members of the Judiciary.  One of the primary reasons given by the Minister for this measure is the existence of so many tribunals and commissions which are being presided over by members of the High Court.  I have no objection to members of the High Court presiding over tribunals and commissions, but it needs to be said on each occasion when we are dealing with these matters that the only reason we require tribunals to investigate certain issues is that the committee system of this House does not allow for the type of investigations provided for by committee systems in other parliaments.  Whereas we have, with each successive Government, tried to reform our committee system, I hold firmly to the view that if our committee system was revamped to a more radical degree, some of the matters which we must currently refer to tribunals could be dealt with promptly by committees of this House.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I recognise and accept that, in the position in which the Minister finds himself, he is right to increase the numbers of the Judiciary.  Indeed, if he did not, he could be open to criticism and probably would be criticised by this side of the House if a backlog of court proceedings developed arising directly from the reduction in the number of judges available, particularly in the High Court, to preside over court hearings due to their involvement in other matters.</P>
      <P>I think I am accurate in my view, although I have not undertaken an exact count, that, following the enactment of this Bill and additional appointments being made to it, there will be almost double the number of judges which existed approximately 20 years ago, a substantial increase.</P>
      <P>In that context, I want to return to an issue to which I referred on occasion on Committee Stage of various courts Bills of different Administrations, including, on occasion, those in which my party was involved.  The pool of lawyers from which we select the Judiciary is far too narrow. The appointments to the High Court and Supreme Court have been, since the foundation of the State, the preserve of members of the Bar Library.  It was the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, which finally allowed solicitors to be appointed as judges of the Circuit Court and provided that members of the solicitors' profession, who had served for four years or more as a circuit judge, could be elevated to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> At the time when it was finally agreed to render solicitors eligible for Circuit Court appointments, there was a degree of uncertainty about the capacity of solicitors to act as members of the Judiciary at Circuit Court level despite the fact that solicitors had acted as district judges since the foundation of the State and the vast majority of district judges derive from the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that we have seen, since the 1995 Act came into force and a number of solicitors were appointed to the Circuit Court, that they can act with great competency in a judicial capacity.  The persons so appointed should by now have set aside residual doubts of any nature as to the capacity of solicitors to serve as members of the Judiciary in courts higher than the District Court.</P>
    <P>Before I am accused on an issue in respect of which I have a vested interest, I want to make a declaration which comes as no surprise to any Member, that I happen to be a member of the solicitors' profession.  This is not exactly a national secret, but I want to make the point that I am not engaged in special pleading for a profession to which I belong because as a solicitor for many years I have acted as an advocate in the superior courts in a personal position and, indeed, I have probably acted in a great many more cases than some members of the Bar Library.  I am not saying that to score a point or to pat myself on the back.  I am merely saying I have a view of the courts system based on my personal involvement and experiences in it both as advocate and solicitor.</P>
    <P>The measures taken in the 1995 Act have proved that there is no reason to maintain in place the narrow pool from which we select judges to the High Court and Supreme Court. There is no particular reason that somebody who is a barrister of 12 years' standing or longer, who is regarded as having a degree of legal expertise which warrants his or her appointment to the Judiciary, should be simply eligible to be appointed to either the High Court or the Supreme Court whereas a solicitor of 12, 15 or 25 years' standing cannot be appointed to the High Court unless he or she has first served a circuit court apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not used this Bill to amend the relevant provisions in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, which confines direct appointments to the High Court and Supreme Court from practising lawyers to members of the Bar Library.  The Minister should have taken the opportunity of this measure, bearing in mind the great increase in the number of the Judiciary, to widen the pool.  Having had experience of the 1995 Act, I urge the Minister to table an amendment to this Bill on Committee Stage which will simply render all solicitors practising in the State who have a minimum of 12 years' experience, as in the case of <Col N="728" /> barristers, eligible to be appointed directly to the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>There is no logical reason that this should not happen.  There is a concern expressed by the general public, which is not always a fully informed concern but which is sometimes sincerely held, that appointing members of the Bar Library solely to the High Court and Supreme Court means there is a very narrow focus on the part of the Judiciary within those courts in the context of certain day to day matters on which they must often pronounce.  That is an unfair criticism of the Judiciary which I do not accept, but it is a perception because the public cannot see any reason for confining appointments to the superior courts to members of the Bar Library.  In my view, successive Attorneys General have had a vested interest in preserving the monopoly of the Bar Library on superior judicial appointments.  That should not be the case.</P>
    <P>In the context of appointments to the High Court, the Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice, which operates under the European Union Treaties, and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, members of the solicitors' profession should have the same eligibility for appointment.  They should also go forward for appointment under the same system.  The Independent Appointments Commission receives applications for appointments to the Judiciary, has a remit to interview those seeking appointments and can make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of those qualified to be appointed.  That sifting process should guarantee that people unqualified for appointment do not proceed through the system.  However, there is no reason the system should have a narrow focus when it comes to making such appointments.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider this issue because the Bill before us is the correct vehicle to deal with it.  It is worth pointing out that in some European Union countries and in the United States a number of eminent people who were not practising lawyers but who made their names in the academic world of legal scholarship and who have proven to be erudite and dynamic judges have been appointed to the judiciaries of those countries.  Subsequently, they have been appointed to the highest courts in their respective states.</P>
    <P>It is time to radically reform the eligibility criteria and the Minister has the opportunity to do so.  A portion of that reform has worked well in the Circuit Court and it should now be applied to the other levels of the court structure to which I referred.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate on this important Bill.  I welcome the general support the legislation has received in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members are aware, the Bill forms part of a comprehensive series of measures I propose to <Col N="729" /> introduce for the purpose of reforming the operation of our courts.  One of the main elements of that programme is provided for in the Courts Service (No. 2) Bill, 1997, which is concerned with the establishment of an independent body to be known as the Courts Service.  This body will assume my statutory functions in respect of the administration of the courts.  The Bill is currently before the Seanad and I look forward to having it debated in this House at an early date.  In addition, there are other reforms relating to the courts which I intend to address and I envisage the publication of further courts legislation in 1998.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputies appreciate the need to make additional provision for the appointment of High Court judges as set out in the Bill before us.  It is vital that the significant progress achieved to date in reducing arrears in the hearing of High Court cases, including trials in the Central Criminal Court, should be maintained and should not be put at risk because a number of judges of that court will be involved in tribunals of inquiry and other non-judicial work.</P>
    <P>The introduction of seven year court presidencies represents a significant step in the development of the court system.  As the working group on the Courts Commission indicated in its second report, the administrative burden attached to presiding over a court can be considerable.  Furthermore, the proposals in the Courts Service (No. 2) Bill envisage that court Presidents will be members of the board of the new service and, as such, administrative and related responsibilities could become more onerous.  In the circumstances, I believe there is broad agreement that it would be in the interests of the judges concerned and the general administration of justice that appointments to these important judicial positions should be for a specified term.</P>
    <P>As stated in my initial contribution, the new arrangements will not apply in the case of the President of a court who is serving in that position. When the provisions of the legislation come into operation, any other approach would create constitutional problems in the context of the Bill. I will now deal with some of the points raised by Deputies in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins referred to the question of paying superannuation to presiding judges who continue to serve after the expiration of their seven year terms.  This is dealt with in section 8. Arising from a decision of the Supreme Court in the area of judicial pensions, the Attorney General has advised that there is no alternative but to provide that the judges in question should be dealt with on the basis that they should receive superannuation at the higher judicial rate for their entire period of service once they have been appointed as presiding judges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton referred to the question of precedence. He considered that this should not happen in what he colourfully described as the rarefied atmosphere of the Four Courts.  The precedence among judges is already the subject of <Col N="730" /> existing legislative provisions and the Bill merely adapts those provisions to take account of a former Chief Justice, President of the High Court and President of the Circuit Court retiring to the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court, respectively, under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter made an erudite call for the extension of the pool from which superior court judges are chosen and Deputy Higgins has tabled an amendment in this regard.  I acknowledge that there are some eminent solicitors and academic lawyers who would, without question, make outstanding judges in the superior courts.  I have not taken the opportunity to introduce what would be relatively radical amendments in this legislation. However, a working group was established by my predecessor to consider this topic.  I understand this was done in December 1996.  I also understand the working group will be reporting to me in the near future.  When that report comes to hand, I will consider this matter carefully.</P>
    <P>There is no question that a decision will be placed on the long finger.  It is my intention to bring forward further courts legislation in 1998.  If there is to be a change, it would be appropriate that it be contained in that legislation.  Such an approach would be radical and different.  As Deputy Upton point out, it will meet with resistance in some quarters.  Nonetheless, where the Judiciary is concerned, it is the duty of the Houses of the Oireachtas to provide the best talent available.</P>
    <P>It is true there are eminent people in the solicitors' profession who have written authoritative works of law and there are others who work full-time as academic lawyers who have done likewise, lectured on the subject of law and been responsible for educating many Chief Justices, Presidents of the High Court, members of the superior courts and members of the general courts.  In my former life I was a solicitor and I may be again.  In that context, I have no ambition, nor would I aspire, to become a member of the superior courts.  That rids me of the declaration of interests section of my address.  However, it does not mean there are not others who would not be interested and who are eminently qualified. It is something to which I should return in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I hope that summarises comprehensively the replies to all the queries raised by Deputies on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 3 to 5, to delete &ldquo;, and, in a case to which <i>paragraph (a)</i> relates, shall not be eligible for reappointment as presiding judge of that Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this amendment is to allow an element of flexibility about the seven year period of appointment.  I have no difficulty with the principle &mdash; it is a good idea and should be the norm under most circumstances.  I put forward this amendment to cater for eventualities which may not be apparent now, whereby it might be desirable to prolong an appointment even for a short period.  I accept the standard practice should be a seven year appointment and that judges should step down at the end of that period but this amendment will allow flexibility in the event of unusual circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Upton but I have difficulties with his amendment. He will recall that the provision in section 4 was based on recommendations made by the working group on the courts commission.  The group examined the relevant issues in detail and concluded that, in view of the heavy judicial and administrative workload which falls to be carried out by court presidents, the appropriate arrangements to be put in place were that such appointments should be for a maximum term of seven years which would not be renewable.  I have already indicated that I agree with the reasoning of the group and would be reluctant to depart from its recommendations in this area.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Upton is concerned that in an individual case it should be possible for a presiding judge to serve for in excess of seven years but that is a substantial period and should allow sufficient time for the initiation of new policies and to ensure they are fully developed and implemented.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware it has become the norm that appointments to senior public positions are made for fixed and limited terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment has major implications for the Bill and if adopted would seriously undermine the proposal to introduce seven year court presidencies. I do not believe there would be much point retaining that proposal if the House agreed to the change the Deputy suggests.  When a seven year term came to an end, arguments would be advanced for lengthening a person's term, the <Col N="732" /> probability is that there would be good reasons for doing so and it would duly happen.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that if there are good reasons, the term should be lengthened but the philosophy behind limiting the term to seven years is to ensure fresh, innovative thinking after that period. It is not intended as an insult to the work of the person retiring but a statement that we wish to move to the next stage.  The incumbent has moved matters as far as he could in his seven year term and we now wish to appoint someone else. The need for fresh thinking after an individual has served seven years would be apparent to all and is part of the fundamental philosophy of providing for a limited seven year term.  I, therefore, regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I sympathise with what Deputy Upton is trying to achieve.  His rationale is that an extension should be granted only in exceptional circumstances.  The problem is that if there is a deviation, the exception often becomes the rule.  We are introducing clear and definitive legislation and we should stick, as far as possible, to what it sets out to do.  In this case, it sets out to fix a maximum seven year term.  As the Minister said, there will be plenty of advance notice and opportunity to make changes and adapt.  My fear, which is shared by the Minister, is that if one allows extensions in exceptional circumstances, many persuasive arguments will be advanced about the exceptional brilliance of the present incumbent, or that he or she is only at the halfway stage in any reforms, procedural changes or administrative adjustments which are being suggested, and so the term should be extended for another year or two.  The tendency will probably be to grant the extension.</P>
      <P>I agree with the principle on which it is based, that apart from enabling everyone to give of their best for the seven years, it will help to clear the arteries, as it were &mdash; to enable new people to come in who will rejuvenate the system with fresh ideas and bring their reforming zeal and vigour to bear on the office which, as has been acknowledged, is an onerous position from the point of view of challenge, day to day tedium and demands, and charting a course for the period for which the person is responsible and the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right to stick with the determination that the period should be seven years.  One would like to go along with the argument that there should be flexibility in certain exceptional circumstances but I fear that once it is allowed, the exception will become the rule.</P>

      <P>The existing order of precedence in relation to the superior courts is the Chief Justice who ranks first, the President of the High Court, the ordinary judges of the Supreme Court according to priority of appointment, and the ordinary judges of the High Court according to priority of appointment.  We are filling a gap to provide that a former Chief Justice will have precedence after the present Chief Justice and the President of the High Court but before the ordinary members of the Supreme Court; that a former President of the High Court will have precedence after the President of the High Court and after the judges of the Supreme Court but before the ordinary judges of the High Court; and that a former President of the Circuit Court would rank after the President of the Circuit Court.  We are setting out in legislative format the position of those who have served as heads of the respective courts.  It could be of considerable importance.  If, for example, the Chief Justice were to become ill or had to be absent, the next person in order of precedence would be the person who had retired as Chief Justice immediately preceding the appointment of the Chief Justice, and so on down the line.  There is nothing very revolutionary in it.  It merely sets out their precedence following retirement from their positions as heads of the respective courts.  I trust that explains the mystery that appears to have surrounded that section.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.  -The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the insertion in section 5(2)(a) of &lsquo;or a practising solicitor&rsquo; after &lsquo;barrister&rsquo;, and</P>
      <P>(b) the insertion in section 5(2) of the following paragraph for paragraph (e) (as inserted by the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995)</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(e) for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, service, in the case of a solicitor as a judge of the Circuit Court, shall be deemed to be practice as a solicitor.&rsquo; .&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter made the case very eloquently and I thank the Minister for his response &mdash; he made a pre-emptive strike in relation to the amendment.  I welcome the thrust of the Minister's remarks in view of the fact that he has shown clear intent in relation to whatever transpires in the working group report.</P>
      <P>The case is well made.  The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, was a watershed in that it opened up doors which had previously been locked to the solicitors' profession.  The judgment of its performance by those who have benefited from the promotional opportunity has been very positive indeed.  The situation opened up a huge area of potential, promise and promotion to solicitors who had the acumen, ability, training and skill to undertake higher judicial appointments.  It introduced a filtering process whereby one had to have served for a period in the Circuit Court before being eligible for appointment to the High Court and, consequently, the Supreme Court. The basic thrust of my proposal is to eliminate that interim period so that where one has the ability, where one is deemed worthy of appointment, there would be no bar to going straight into the court.  I make the point in the context of what Deputy Shatter said and the Minister acknowledged, that there is huge potential in terms of the expertise garnered collectively and individually by solicitors.  Solicitors are very close to the ground in terms of knowing what happens in the real world &mdash; I say this with no disrespect to people at the Bar.  One only has to look at the sheer numbers.  There are 4,400 practising solicitors and 900 barristers.  It would seem wrong to preclude these people from the possibility of being appointed at the outset in terms of their capacity to serve in the higher courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make the point also that much of our law has been borrowed from Britain, our parliament is almost an exact parallel of that in the United Kingdom.  Similarly our courts and court procedures <Col N="735" /> are borrowed, almost <i>en masse,</i> from the British system.  Much of the legislation and many of the Acts that determine what happens in the courts are based on what happened in the days of British jurisdiction.  Rather than slavishly following the United Kingdom, we should take an initiative of our own in this House and make a quantum leap forward.  I suspect from what the Minister said, although I do not know whether he has had a preview of the report, that he has had some indication that the report will go along with what I am seeking to implement by way of this amendment.  Therefore, I ask that the House take the amendment on board.</P>

      <P>Nobody could argue against the fundamental principle of Deputy Higgins's amendment, namely, that the best person should get the job, a solicitor, barrister or, in the context of what Deputy Shatter said, somebody from the world of academic law.  As I said on Second Stage, I have encountered some barristers who were less than enthusiastic about this amendment. In that context the Minister is wise to at least wait until he obtains the report of the working group which, I presume, includes an appropriate number of barristers who can state their case as eloquently as only they can, and let us hope not as expensively as they usually do.  It is worth giving them the opportunity to state their case and to consider it carefully.  As a general principle it would seem impossible to argue against the amendment or against the further principle that the scope should be extended to anybody who is capable of doing the job.  Presumably people who are not lawyers would not be acceptable as being able to adjudicate in the courts, but it would seem proper that anybody who has an adequate knowledge, understanding and experience of law should have the opportunity of putting their names forward for a position, and if they are good enough, good luck to them.</P>

      <P>I had an opportunity of mentioning this matter earlier when Deputy Shatter spoke in support of Deputy Higgins's amendment. It was extremely interesting to hear the views of the Opposition spokespersons on Justice on this important matter and they, obviously, must be given due weight and consideration.  The effect of the amendment would be to put practising solicitors on the same footing as practising barristers in terms of their basic eligibility for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts.  It would also provide that the services of a judge of the Circuit Court would reckon for the purpose of the qualification period as a practising solicitor in the same way as the law provides for the reckoning of services of a judge of the Circuit Court for the purpose of the qualification period as a practising barrister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the enactment of the Court, and Court Officers Act, 1995, practising solicitors of not less than ten years standing qualified for appointment <Col N="736" /> as judges of the District Court only.  The Act qualified practising solicitors of not less than ten years standing for appointment as judges of the Circuit Court.  During the debate on the legislation the main Opposition spokesperson advocated this change which the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, took on board.  The Act also provided that a judge of the Circuit Court of four years standing would be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the legislation by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security in December 1995 the then Minister, Deputy Owen, indicated she would examine further the qualifications required to be eligible for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts and on 10 December 1996 she established a working group on qualifications for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts with the following terms of reference: to consider and make recommendations to the Minister for Justice on the question of qualifications for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the very real interest among Deputies in the outcome of the deliberations of the working group.  I am not privy to the conclusions reached but I am pleased to inform Deputies that the working group has made considerable progress and I expect its final report to be submitted to me early in the new year.  I assure Deputy Higgins that on receipt of the report I will quickly move to consider the appropriate legislative reforms arising from its recommendations. It is appropriate that we should await the outcome of the working group's deliberations before seeking to legislate further in the area of judicial appointments.  In these circumstances I am glad Deputy Higgins indicated he is prepared to withdraw his amendment.  If changes are deemed desirable following consideration of the report then I propose to introduce them in a new courts Bill which I anticipate will be introduced next year.</P>

      <P>In an Adjournment debate in the first week in December the Minister of State explained his thinking on the use of public parks for development.  The proposal to build houses in Carlow has been the subject of more time in this House than many more pressing issues of public policy.  The matter was also discussed at the sub-committee on the environment this morning.  At the same time we are trying to find time for a general housing debate, but it seems it will be some time before such a debate is taken.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has given good account of his stewardship in important areas of public policy for which he is responsible.  He made it clear he was motivated in this matter by his desire to give equal weight to the two areas of his brief, the need for social housing and the need for a positive urban renewal policy, where, in the case of the Carlow development, a conflict arose.  I congratulate the Minister on his concern for this issue.  I support his view that public parks and designated recreational areas should not be lost to development unless there are special reasons for doing so, as the Minister believes there are in this case.  I have a particular interest in this matter <i>vis-à-vis</i> my constituency, to which I will refer later.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Opposition has continued to push this matter relentlessly in recent weeks.  A full explanation was given in the Adjournment debate when the Minister detailed the background and the concerns about the development for Shaw Park.  He expressed his reluctance to make available public funds to provide housing at this location, which is a public park.  He gave details of the arrangements he had put in place to find a solution to allow housing to go ahead while retaining the public amenity.  It should have been obvious to the Opposition that the Minister had an open mind on the matter and was considering all the factors in making a proper decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Opposition, however, chose to ignore the facts and rushed to put down a motion, which constitutes an unjustifiable attack on the Minister. Some of the personal remarks directed at him last night were unacceptable.  The time taken up with this matter could have been used for a broader, more inclusive debate.  Some speakers last night seemed to be more interested in embarrassing the Minister and the Government than providing social housing in Carlow.  I do not know whether Deputy Hayes contributed to the budget debate last week, but he was more interested in scoring points on the budget than in the Carlow development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After last Friday's meeting the Minister was made aware, through his officials, that further delays in finding a suitable alternative site would cause hardship to members of the co-operative <Col N="739" /> which is promoting the development.  Deputies will agree it is to the Minister's credit he gave priority in making his decision to the expectations of a group of people who came together in a co-operative venture to provide housing to meet their own needs and who had the determination and sense of purpose to pursue that objective. The Minister acted correctly in ensuring the views of all the parties involved and the relevant information was available to him before making a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>I was amazed last night listening to Deputies refer to the procedures operated by local authorities and by the Department.  Some of the speakers were former Ministers who are aware of the procedures.  I have never been a Minister but I am a member of a local authority and I was amazed at some of the comments made.  It seems the Department had total control over many projects and gave limited approval at every stage.  I believe in local government and would like local authorities to have total control, but that is not the case.  Deputy Hayes should become better acquainted with the procedures used in this regard.</P>
    <P>Even when local authorities receive letters of approval, one of which was read out last night, they must go through the planning process and the public consultation process.  There is no point setting up a system and then totally ignoring the process.  The Minister has a duty to ensure the range of social housing measures is developed to its full potential so that housing is available to those who require it but cannot afford it.  He must ensure towns and urban areas continue to have living and recreational space for the local communities. As Minister responsible for housing and urban renewal, he must ensure an appropriate balance between those two aspects.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, in planning the location of social housing schemes, must take account of the impact of their decisions on the urban area as a whole.  Public amenities such as parks and recreational areas are essential components of urban life.  They are generally well established hubs of a thriving local community.  Only in exceptional circumstances should those areas be sacrificed for development, even for social housing.</P>
    <P>I am glad to speak on this issue, which is about open space.  People should be careful in making statements on this matter.  Planning is at present under way for a huge project in my area of Ballymun. Everybody favours the redevelopment of Ballymun.  The previous Government made an announcement in that regard earlier this year and funding has been provided for the project, but it takes much more space to build 2,800 houses than it does to build the same number of flats.  This is causing a major problem.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister feels strongly about the retention of public open spaces because that may be a divisive issue in the case of Ballymun. While I am not trying to spike the planning process because it has many positive aspects, some <Col N="740" /> of the proposals that have been put forward would mean building on many green areas.  If the most elaborate, or the worst, of those schemes is implemented it would mean removing one concrete jungle and building another in its place.  I am sure that will not happen.  Internal bureaucratic disputes between Dublin Corporation and the adjoining local authority, which has other land available close by, will have to be resolved. Otherwise, what we all dreamed of for Ballymun could end up in tears.  I am interested in the principle on which the Minister of State fought the Carlow issue and will note it for the debate that may take place on the Ballymun project in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good Government, with great co-operation between the parties.</P>
      <P>We are all part of the housing policy on infill developments that has existed since 1991.  We must accept that problems exist and that some of the infill developments have not been welcomed because they deprive people of amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New housing developments will make a significant contribution to the areas in which they are located.  Substantial public funds have been invested in the provision of social housing.  The range of options open to housing authorities affords them a measure of flexibility that was not available in former years.  It is essential that authorities avail of the opportunities provided by the social housing programme to ensure housing schemes not only provide good living standards, but contribute to the integrated development of the areas in which they are located.  The Minister's recent announcement regarding major improvements in the general social housing provisions were widely welcomed.  I accept we would all like a larger provision, but it shows the Minister is committed to social housing.  Authorities must take careful stock of the resources available to them in terms of sites.  It has been suggested <Col N="741" /> that parks and other similar recreational areas often become the focus of anti-social behaviour and, therefore, become unusable.  This may be the case, but it may be a mark of the low esteem in which parks are held by some local authorities that they do not devote the necessary resources to maintain them.  The same argument could be made about the local authority of which I am a member.  Proposals are made every week to extinguish the right of way on public laneways. We cannot close open spaces because of anti-social problems.  That is not the answer.  The gardaí have a role to play.  Too often they believe it is their job to police the streets and when a problem arises in a public park somebody else must deal with it.  We cannot draw rigid lines on these matters.  Otherwise, all our open spaces will be built on and in a few years' time we will realise our mistake.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are not the only culprits in this matter.  Much of the land owned by the Church or other institutions, which acted as the green lungs of many suburban areas, is being brought by private developers for housing development.  We will end up with houses everywhere and not a blade of grass.  We must resolve the problem in a balanced and organised way.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the growth of infill housing in urban areas.  Local authorities increasingly recognise the value of providing small, well designed housing schemes in the heart of urban areas where communities are settled and services and amenities are provided, but this must be done in a balanced way.  The Minister has shown great concern on the Carlow issue.  He took some time to make his decision, but the housing will go ahead.  I am pleased he has shown concern for the provision of open spaces and I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">

      <P>This debate is a waste of parliamentary time.  The people of Carlow and the public are not interested in the schoolyard horseplay in which the Opposition is engaging.  The public are tired of its &ldquo;I caught you out&rdquo; puerile nonsense.  If the Opposition believes it is providing a worthwhile service by doing this, it knows little about what the public and those who elected them expect.</P>
      <P>There is no case to answer.  The Minister has taken a decision with which the people of Carlow are happy.  They are delighted they got what they wanted and if they had to fight a little for it, the victory is sweeter.  I can only assume from the antics of the Opposition that it is unhappy the people of Carlow got what they wanted.  Far from dealing with a constructive debate, we are forced to listen to the baying of a badly trained and poorly controlled pack who have lost the scent and are making as much noise as possible to cover their bemusement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The direction the debate has taken is a pathetic attempt by the Opposition to discredit a Minister of State, a Member of the Seanad and the Government.  It is fed partly on misinformation, <Col N="742" /> half truths and because of the political goal to discredit, the movers of the motion have lost sight of the core argument, the provision of houses by a self-help group and the local authority on a site which is largely derelict and not used by the people of Carlow as an amenity.  The decision of the Minister of State &mdash; the only one on file &mdash; to sanction the project is a victory for local democracy and a firm display of people power.  The public will not thank the Opposition for its disgraceful attempt to discredit the Government and its abuse of this worthwhile project.</P>

It will relieve a housing problem and develop an open space that will be welcomed in the growing urban centre of Carlow town. There is great public support for the project.  It should be encouraged on a large scale throughout the country and substantial funding should be directed to that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing lists are growing and this Government should launch a national housing programme to deal with the crisis over the next five years.  Local authorities, self-help groups and voluntary housing organisations have a role to play in tackling this problem.  Substantial Government funding should also be provided.</P>
      <P>Today's decision spells victory for local democracy and the Carlow Friendly Housing Co-Op Society, but it also underlines the poor state of our local democracy.  The practice of going to central Government with a begging bowl must be brought to an end.  County structures should be strengthened, financed and empowered to deal with all local matters.  Community structures are becoming more important, particularly as issues are directed and controlled by Europe.  I encourage the Minister to have a firm belief in local government and to direct that all local matters be dealt with at that level.  If that had happened, this distasteful political charade would not have taken place.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála was mentioned during this debate.  It should be restructured as we approach the new millennium.  The planning process must be an integrated part of local government.  No body should be able to dictate or overturn a local authority's decision, particularly when a county development plan outlines the general thrust of the development required by that county.  Any interference from outside the county by an unelected big brother undermines the ability and desire of local bodies to take control of their affairs.  It also means that people shrug their shoulders when asked to become involved as they believe they have no say and do not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Minister in his efforts to protect <Col N="743" /> green spaces and amenity areas in our cities and towns.  We must take this a step further and deal with issues at the planning stage.  We must ensure that all planning applications for large housing schemes include cosmetic and functional green areas and that developers, in partnership with the local authority, develop the infrastructure needed by a modern local community as the project proceeds and not, as in this case, as an afterthought. The heart of all our urban centres must be restored and green areas developed.  The thorny question of public liability insurance for parks and open spaces must also be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We must cater for the needs of our young people by continuing to substantially fund community centres which can be used as meeting places.  This will help our young people to become involved in various types of activities which will encourage their personal development and create more positive opportunities in life.</P>
    <P>I would put a word in the Minister's ear to achieve this necessary development.  The public knows how our system works and this is reflected in the attendance at our clinics.  The arguments put forward during this debate are naive and a poor cover up for an attack on the Government. I wish the housing programme in Carlow every success and I assure the people of my full co-operation as a Member of the Oireachtas for that constituency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has a fundamental duty to provide housing.  The social housing budget for 1997 is £220 million, which is a considerable responsibility for any Minister.  Targets were set by the last Government of 7,000 housing starts which <Col N="744" /> included a range of options.  There was trepidation in the community when the new Government came into power because the social housing programme collapsed during the last Fianna Fáil Progressive Democrats Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Government's commitment to continue to provide an increased level of housing.  However, it is important to remember that housing policy does not happen by accident and it is not only about numbers.</P>
      <P>What is so disturbing about this scandal is not just the sleaze attached to the Progressive Democrats but also the clear contempt the Minister has for his responsibilities in Government.  The sequence of events we are debating reveals a cynicism towards his responsibilities which is as breathtaking as it is despicable.  Last night the Minister came into the House and tried to flimflam the Deputies and thereby the public.  He constructed a fairytale to justify the unjustifiable. Fortunately, the political system is not made up of cynics.  It also produces people like Deputy John Browne who does not make the most noise in this House but who has shown a quiet yet strong determination to see that justice is done.  I thank him for the work he has done not just for the people in Carlow who are affected but also for the social housing programme and its future.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the year I, as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, gave a general allocation to Carlow Urban District Council.  This housing authority, which must live up to its responsibilities, produced a project which is a model of its type.  It meets all the criteria of today's social housing policy, including social mix, infill and reaching cost targets.  I wish all local authorities were as successful in ensuring they were below the cost ceilings.  The council also dealt with the problem of dereliction at a particular site.  There was no need for me, for example, to look at this file because it was such a good project.  It went through the system and the Department responded by sending a letter on June 9 stating there were no objections to the proposal and the council had the go-ahead.</P>
      <P>I subsequently left the Department &mdash; I hope in good order &mdash; and a new Minister came in.  At some point after that, the chairman of his party spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and suddenly he developed an interest in open space.  This is a Pauline conversion because I recall there was a legacy from his previous time in the Department, when it was known as the Department for Local Government, for all to see in Galway &mdash; the road between Galway and Furbo which was developed and is now cited as an example of how ribbon development can destroy the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He suddenly discovered open space in Shaw Park, Carlow, and, contrary to what Deputies may think, he informed the House last night:  <Col N="745" /> I know Shaw Park.  I have good memories of a day in 1971 when I had the privilege of opening a swimming pool there.</P>
    <P>The year 1971 is over a quarter of a century ago; Ireland was not even in the EEC; wives were the chattels of their husbands; Mary Kenny was still a feminist and babies were born who are now having babies themselves.  We need to get a grip on reality just as Carlow UDC did.  It had to tackle the reality of its housing programme and the problems that they, and many other local authorities, face with modern experience rather than some trip down memory lane.</P>
    <P>I refer to the county engineer's letter to the Department concerning Shaw Park.  He states:</P>
    <P>Shaw Park has not operated successfully as a town park for some time with the removal of play equipment on the advice of our insurers and the closure of the swimming pool.  Non maintenance of these areas subsequently has resulted in the degradation of the amenities of the park and it no longer functions as a town park, an amenity area as originally laid out in design.  The swimming pool area has become a potential hazard as manhole covers have been removed, the dressing rooms and service buildings have been vandalised and the pool itself has become a hazard area and an area which attracts anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>The local council recognised that the open space needed to be developed and upgraded and that housing was a useful mechanism to meet not only the need to which it was obligated but also to ensure the open space was made safe.</P>
    <P>We must remember the people affected by the decision made by the Minister of State and the obstacles he put up.  He did not put them up for the Opposition but for ten families who were trying to make a home for themselves, which is very difficult nowadays, with the assistance of the State but ultimately taking responsibility for their housing needs even though their incomes are not lavish.  It is not easy and with the best will in the world very often families such as these fail to achieve their objectives.  What disturbs me most about this series of incidents is not the sleaze, the stroke politics, the nod and the wink, but the failure to acknowledge just how complex and difficult social housing programme objectives are and to ensure policy is appropriate to modern day needs.  Local authorities often fail to reach their targets and young families often fail to avail of the sites for sale scheme and build homes.  Voluntary housing associations often are unable to develop their full potential because, for example, they cannot get land.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of difficulties in regard to the social housing programme.  The Minister of State, rather than attending to those difficulties, has created the major difficulty and would have ensured a blockage which would have meant people would not have been able to either house themselves or be housed by the local authority, were it not for the fact Deputy Browne <Col N="746" /> stood his ground and refused to go away until he saw justice done.</P>
    <P>One of the key issues relating to social housing is good management by local authorities and in this regard any local authority would find it incomprehensible that a Minister would interfere and manipulate a local authority in this way, at the same time as a senior Minister is promising wonderful things for local authorities, for example, that local government will be put on a constitutional basis.  What conflict of thinking exists where one can have, on the one hand, a promise of upgrading local government and, on the other, manipulation of the worst kind by a Minister in the ordinary, standard work of a local authority?</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahern made a good point about the problems with which many local authorities deal.  I pay tribute to him because in Opposition and Government he has always shown a great interest in social housing and he knows just how difficult it is &mdash; and I suspect he agrees with many of the points I am making &mdash; because of the area he represents.  The challenges that exist in Ballymun are enormous and need all the resources of a dedicated Minister.  There is no doubt civil servants are dedicated in this cause, but I have my doubts about the Minister of State. However, if that project is to succeed it requires drive and political will to ensure it realises its full potential.</P>
      <P>He knows maintenance, vandalism, dereliction are problems of the 1990s and that we must ensure progress is made in dealing with these issues.  It must be ensured there is good estate management, resources are given to local authorities and a cultural change is adopted by local communities, by the various agencies that deal with them and by local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is very good for politics that the debate has taken place even though it is unusual for a specific item to have taken up Private Members' time in this way.  I have found it depressing, not that the debate should have taken place, but that we have had to debate this issue at a time when major issues in social housing need to be addressed.  I have already cited the example of the traveller accommodation Bill on which considerable work had already begun when I left office.  I appreciate a former Minister of State should not be in the business of knocking a current one simply because there is always a feeling that one could have done it better but I do not feel that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social housing is an integral part of the quality of life not just for those who live in local authority estates or benefit from local authorities in providing houses for themselves, but in the nature of communities as a whole, how we integrate and ensure social mix is one of the biggest challenges. Far from ensuring the social mix is realised and <Col N="747" /> supporting it, we have a Minister who tried to divide, separate and, in effect, destroy a project that deserved and should have got his support.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil as am an Teachta McManus a roinnt agus an Teachta Browne as an rún seo a chur ós ár gcómhar.  I support the motive behind Deputy Browne's motion as it is important that social housing is recognised as taking priority in almost all cases.  In the case of Carlow, there is no doubt there was considerable local support for this development and, to that extent, the position seems clear when local democracy is taken into account.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, articulate a general principle last night?  I sympathise with the principle he articulated that the preservation of amenities should not be overtaken by development pressures.  That principle is a good start when it comes to looking at the context in which development takes place.  Is the Minister of State on top of his brief in relation to other issues?  He is not if he truly believes what he said last night of a small town park, referred to by Deputy Browne.</P>
      <P>A park in Swords, County Dublin, just over an acre in size, has mature trees 150 years old and is facing an old castle which is being developed as a tourist amenity.  In every sense this park is crucial in terms of open space and amenity value in what is known as the fastest growing town in Europe. That park was opened by a former Minister and Deputy, Ray Burke, ten years ago.  Since l995 Fingal County Council has removed seats and supervision from the park and locked it at night.  I sympathise with Deputy Ahern that the net effect is to encourage those who are athletic to leap over the walls and to prevent those who are enforcing the law or parents from keeping an eye on what their youngsters are doing.  To that extent Fingal County Council has set about a policy which culminated in September l995 when the county manager, now retired, proposed that the park become a building site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State believe what he said in his speech last night?  Consistency is not a bad thing.  That park is not for houses but an office block.  If it were for houses we could have a valid debate on the merits of social housing. The council, which has copious amounts of land in the area on which to build, has decided to take over that park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister of State who is examining the position in Carlow aware of the situation in other areas?  Does he believe what he said or is he simply saying it to justify the decision he has taken, regarding housing in Carlow?  I ask whether the Minister of State needs to be informed more fully.  I hope he is listening to the debate on the <Col N="748" /> monitor even though he is not present.  A decision was taken to locate civic offices in a small town park.  In a report presented to the councillors, the manager stated it looked at only one other site. No list of alternative sites was given.  This decision was presented as <i>a fait accompli.</i> There was no consultation and the county officials were not invited to the Minister's office.  If one were to ask the people of Swords whether this is what they want, they would respond in the negative.</P>
    <P>On hearing about this motion, I was astonished at the bizarre turn of events and the statement delivered by the Minister of State.  I regard social housing as much more important than the building of an office block, while the Minister has a problem with social housing rather than an office block.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  It was not a waste of time as it is important to look behind the motivation of decisions taken, look for the criteria and the policy underlying them and hope it is consistent. If housing can be debated more fully then we have done a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McManus's call for traveller accommodation legislation.  This embarrassing <i>faux pas</i> highlights the lack of real democracy here.  In l994 we had the election of town commissioners and UDC members, thereby establishing democracy.  The decision in relation to Swords was taken by councillors elected in l991.  Since then elections have been postponed until now and may be postponed again until l999.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, has interfered in the local democratic process in the manner in which he did, for the provision of housing in Carlow, but I am surprised, given his long political experience &mdash; since his election to Dáil Éireann in l965 &mdash; that he would make such a crucial mistake in this instance.  His many years of political experience should have told him otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to comprehend that the Minister of State, a former Minister for Local Government and a former Minister for the Environment and who should be able to interpret Government procedures and regulations better than most, should expect us to believe he had the best interests of Carlow at heart, in particular those who had legally binding contracts and were approved for housing when he intervened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> Since there are 500 people are on the housing list in Carlow it is difficult to explain why the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, refused funding to Carlow Urban District Council given that it had gone through the various procedures outlined in the l994 local government legislation and that his colleague, Senator Gibbons, chairman of the Progressive Democrats, objected to that development in conjunction with his local residents and neighbours.  Carlow Urban District Council found that his case did not stand up.  Like others he had the opportunity to appeal to An Bord Pleanála but did not do so.  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, cited open space and amenity value as the reasons he was concerned about the housing development proceeding at Shaw Park.  He made great play of this.  However, in his objection to the development, Senator Gibbons cited completely different reasons.  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, intervened in Carlow Urban District Council to stop this development, mainly because political intervention was required to satisfy Senator Gibbons's concerns about the project going ahead.</P>
    <P>The House should consider why the Minister of State decided at short notice and with considerable speed last Friday, 12 December, to reverse his decision.  On that day officials of the Department visited Carlow to discuss the matter with officials of the urban district council.  Later that evening the Minister of State changed his story.  I wish that many other matters could be addressed with the same speed and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has demonstrated clearly that it is pay back time for the 26 families concerned. I am not surprised at his actions given that he is a first cousin, once removed, of Fianna Fáil.  As we all know from past examples, when it comes to political strokes and cronyism there are no better artisans than those associated with the friends of Fianna Fáil.  Through his membership of Fianna Fáil, the Minister of State would have learned enthusiastically, in his ministerial role, how to do things such as this.  He delivered for one of his own, Senator Gibbons.</P>

The Progressive Democrats have been to the forefront, particularly in the past three to four years, in calling for high standards in high places and in highlighting the need for transparency, openness and accountability.  It is clear the Minister of State did not know the difference between right and wrong.  It took a phone call from his party leader to put him right.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate Deputy McGuinness is a new Deputy and I wish him many years of happiness in the House, I was surprised at some of the phrases used by him.  He said we were engaged in school yard horseplay.  I am sure that will go down well in Carlow.  He also described the debate as distasteful.  He should read the Official Report covering the period of office of the previous Government to see how his party behaved in Opposition.  Many over the top remarks were made.  The book <i>How to behave when in Opposition,</i> which is compulsory reading in Fianna Fáil, has been put on the high shelf in Mount Street in the hope it will not have to be used for a while.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment and fully endorse the sentiments expressed by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in his contribution to this debate and when the matter was raised on the Adjournment on 4 December.  It is irresponsible of the Opposition to be pressing the issue in this almost reckless way.  The base allegations which have been made against the Minister of State are without foundation. His motives in handling the Carlow case have been beyond reproach.  Yet, the Opposition persists in this ridiculous attempt to smear a Minister of State who is carrying out his responsibilities diligently and successfully.  He has given a full explanation of his thinking in relation to the use of public parks for development of any kind.  He has done so not once but twice.  The Opposition refuses to accept that the issue, although centring on a small housing development in Carlow, has important policy implications which the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal is entitled and bound to raise.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State gave serious and detailed consideration to the issues raised in the Carlow case.  He expressed his concerns about the use of a public park as a site for housing and arranged for intensive discussions at local level to see whether a solution could be found which would preserve and develop Shaw Park for the purpose for which it was intended and which would allow the housing development to go ahead.  I will read the notes which the Minister of State wrote on the departmental file at the time as an indication of his thinking.</P>
      <P>What Deputies seem to have forgotten is that the Minister of State made his decision as soon as his officials reported to him on the outcome of the local discussions between all the parties.  He gave the housing schemes the go-ahead on the basis that alternative sites would be some time in coming onstream and that the members of the co-operative society who had already spent a considerable time promoting part of the housing development would suffer personal hardship as a result of further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly unworthy of the Opposition that it should have tabled its motion last week having been informed in the course of the Adjournment debate a few days earlier that the Minister of State was arranging a meeting in an effort to reach a satisfactory outcome.  It is sad that it did not have the good grace to await the outcome of this meeting before mounting this further pointless debate.  The Minister of State is to be congratulated, not criticised, for making his decision in this case within minutes of the conclusion of the meeting last Friday recognising that <Col N="752" /> sometimes human considerations have to take precedence over policy.  The Opposition should recognise the futility of attempting to score political points and begin to address the more serious political and social issues facing us.</P>
    <P>The housing development proposed for Shaw Park in Carlow may be small in scale but in its location and the nature of the housing to be built there it is more than a housing scheme in the traditional sense.  It gives effect to many of the principles of social housing policies now widely accepted as encouraging more innovative housing design and lay-out, better use of in-fill and difficult sites, a better social mix and the participation of the voluntary and co-operative sector in the provision of social housing.</P>
    <P>The provision of housing has become a more complex task for local authorities and is no longer a matter of merely providing a sufficient number of houses to meet current needs.  There are many examples in our cities of the manifestation of former thinking on the matter, the results of which we have all lived to regret.  Local authorities must have regard to the impact of their housing decisions in other policy areas, on the urban fabric, including local amenities and on local communities.  In providing social housing local authorities are more than builders of houses, they influence the shape and composition of communities and urban areas.</P>
    <P>This is happening at a time when there is intense competition for land and an apparently insatiable appetite for developments of all kinds. It is in this context that local authorities must guard against the temptation to avail of the easy option and use public parks and recreational areas for housing.</P>
    <P>I understand that local authorities have to work within the constraints of their housing programmes and capital allocations but they must also weigh carefully the balance of advantage and disadvantage in losing a public recreational resource to housing or any other form of development. This is the nature of the issue which has emerged in relation to Shaw Park in Carlow.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for two aspects of this issue, housing and urban renewal.  In his approach to the Shaw Park housing development he has demonstrated his desire to achieve the solution which will give complementary expression to both.  The entirely satisfactory and humane outcome to the Carlow case does not take from the validity of the position the Minister has adopted in relation to the use of public parks for housing or other development.  In particular I noted the Minister's endorsement of the role of social housing in counteracting social exclusion and renewing urban areas.  Increasingly local authorities are recognising the value of providing small, well designed housing schemes in the heart of urban areas, where communities are already settled, where services and amenities, including parks, are readily available and where the development brings life to what may be a rundown area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> The Minister has also paid tribute to the contribution of the voluntary and co-operative sector in the provision of public housing.  I have always believed in the virtues of enterprise and self-reliance and that those qualities can only bring benefits to the community as a whole.  The voluntary and co-operative sector encourages people to have a greater sense of responsibility for their houses and housing estates and helps to develop a sense of co-operation and partnership among local communities.  The greater the participation of the voluntary and co-operative sector in the provision of social housing, the less will be the reliance on local authority housing and on the Exchequer to meet social housing needs.</P>
    <P>I am particularly impressed by the efforts of co-operative groups to supply their own housing. Dedication and commitment are required of a small group of people over what may appear to be a long period of time to bring a housing scheme into being.</P>
    <P>I endorse what the Minister said last evening about the need for greater encouragement by local authorities of the efforts of groups such as the Carlow Friendly Housing Co-operative Society.  Such groups should be able to rely on the practical support of local authorities and on the development of good working partnerships in the supply of housing.  Carlow Urban Council and county manager are to be congratulated on the support they have given the Carlow co-operative society with its project.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my support for the Minister's stance on this issue and reject the insinuations of the Opposition that he acted less than correctly in this matter.  The Minister has never made it other than completely clear that his position is motivated by his strong belief that the preservation of valuable local amenities should not be overtaken by the pressure to develop, even if such development is desirable social housing.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the position of Senator Gibbons.  In 1993 Mr. Gibbons was not a Senator &mdash; he was appointed to the Seanad in September last &mdash; or councillor but a private citizen.  As well as being a graduate in agricultural science, he also holds a masters degree in landscape architecture and perhaps knows as much about that topic as anybody else in this country.  In 1993 he spoke to the county engineer in Carlow about the nonmaintenance of this park, which was being allowed to run down, and made suggestions to him.  In or around March 1996 he spoke to the county manager, who is also the town manager, and gave him sketch plans of suggested landscaping of the park to restore it to a vibrant amenity for the citizens of Carlow who, at that stage, could no longer use it.  By mid-1996 the county manager came up with a review of the development plan which included a proposal to change the use of this park to that for a housing scheme. In August 1996, in the context of the publication of the review of that development plan, three people including Mr. Gibbons, who live in the locality, signed a letter to the manager about the <Col N="754" /> matter.  At the same time a public meeting was held in Carlow to protest at the proposal to abandon this park and a petition against the proposal to abandon it and use it instead for housing was signed by 40 of the people who attended.</P>
    <P>In July last, some months before Mr. Gibbons was appointed to the Seanad, he spoke to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government whom he met at some function and asked him whether he was aware of the proposal to abandon the park.  The Minister of State was not aware.  As far as I know he did not know anything about it at that stage. He requested a report which he received from officials on 25 July.  He wrote on that report on 28 July as follows:</P>
    <P>Runaí,</P>
    <P>I am concerned that public open space, in this case a public park, is being utilised as a building site, thus eliminating what was a valuable public amenity.  I would not be keen to approve public funding for such a development. Your comments, please.</P>
    <P Just="Right">R.M.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Minister of State requested a further report on the matter, requesting that the Carlow county manager be written to and consulted about the matter.  The county manager was written to on 13 August last expressing the views of the Minister of State.  The matter was considered further and another submission made to the Minister of State in November.  On that submission the Minister of State wrote:</P>
    <P>I am very much opposed to the loss of public open space and decry its use, as in this case, for housing.  County managers should be spoken to and assistance offered to help them find an alternative location for these very worthwhile housing schemes.</P>
    <P Just="Right">R.M.</P>
    <P>I have as much experience, if not more, than Deputy Molloy in Cabinet.  Were I handed this file with this information I would write what he wrote.  I fully subscribe to what he wrote; he is absolutely right.  Because land is very expensive, if we find ourselves in circumstances in which local authorities have to resort to their own public amenity land in order to execute housing or other development, very soon we shall have little or no public open spaces.  It is one of the unfortunate features of many of our cities and towns that we lack adequate public amenities.  In Limerick, for example, I am tragically aware of the appalling position where we lack sufficient amenities of this kind.  During the time I was a member of Limerick Corporation in the 1970s, I had frequent discussions, and indeed arguments, with the then city manager urging him not to build thousands of houses through the NBA without providing amenities.  Unfortunately, I was overruled and tragically we now know the cost in social terms of the desire at that time of a local authority to build houses at any cost.  We also know its cost in <Col N="755" /> Ballymun and indeed in other places to a smaller degree.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, asked his officials to accompany the county manager and look at alternative sites.  The manager showed them two sites; one was potentially open to flooding at times of extreme weather and was thought unsuitable for that reason.  The other site was two miles outside the town and, therefore, was not suitable.  That was reported last Friday, the day of the meeting, to Minister Molloy and he said that, in those circumstances, the proposal in Shaw Park, as an exceptional measure, should go ahead.  There was no U-turn.  No decision was made that had to be reversed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read out exactly what the Minister of State said and the legitimate and laudable concern he had that local authorities would not utilise their own public parks for housing or other development.</P>
      <P>There is a grave danger at a time like this, when land prices are high and when there is a demand for housing, that local authorities will take the financial soft option.  If they do that they are condemning those living in cities and towns who come after us to a situation where there will be completely inadequate public housing.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting some of the comments made by Deputy McManus in the House.  On RTE radio this morning she accused the Minister of State of telling a lie when he said she had no hand, act or part in this matter and was never involved with the file.  That has since been checked with officials and Minister Molloy is correct.  The Minister of State, although accused of telling a lie, was not the one telling a lie and it was interesting to hear Deputy McManus confirm tonight that she had never dealt with the file.</P>
      <P>It would be particularly regrettable if local authorities were to be allowed the option of allowing their own parks to fall into disrepair and disuse to convert them into development for some other purpose.  That is somewhat akin to landlords and property owners who, until legislation was passed recently, used to allow houses &mdash; often valuable and historic houses &mdash; to fall down so that the local authority would be forced to make a demolition order allowing them to clear the site and build.  It would be very regrettable if local authorities were in effect allowed to do the same with their own public amenities.  Public space and public parks are there not just for the enjoyment of the present generation but for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the policy so clearly enunciated by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will be taken on board now by all local authorities.  I am particularly <Col N="756" /> conscious in my own city where Limerick Corporation currently has proposals to encroach on public open space to allow development.  I am very much opposed to that and I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is also opposed to it.  If there is any value out of this debate and this motion, it is not from the unworthy motives for which it is put down but because it has been used now, by some of us at least, as a vehicle through which the proper approach to this form of planning and social policy can be enunciated, hopefully taken on board and followed by local authorities throughout the country.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I will deal with that.  Deputy O'Malley has fallen into the same trap as the Minister of State by waffling on about open spaces and parks.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the amendment the Minister of State, or someone on his behalf, tabled.  It states: &ldquo;.  . notes the decision of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government to give the go-ahead to the housing development at Shaw Park, Carlow&rdquo;. The go-ahead was given last June.  The Minister of State rescinded that order so he has now backed down.  People voting for this motion are saying that the Minister of State made a dog's dinner of this issue.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment goes on to state: &ldquo;.  . supports the Minister of State's policy that existing public parks and designated public recreational areas should, as far as possible, be retained for the benefit of local communities and not used for development&rdquo;.  That is acceptable and normal, and I do not need a lecture from the Minister of State or anyone else.  When housing development was planned for a play area in Pollerton, I led the campaign against it and we prevented the houses being built.  I have as much respect for open spaces as the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment continues: &ldquo;.  . commends the promotion by local authorities of integrated social housing developments involving different types of housing including local authority, voluntary and co-operative&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State began his contribution last night as follows: &ldquo;It has been nauseating listening to Fine Gael spokespersons who displayed sheer hypocrisy and naked political opportunism&rdquo;. He seems to have as much respect for the English language as he has for democracy. Does the Minister of State honestly think that opposing his undemocratic decision is naked political opportunism and sheer hypocrisy?  He went on to state:</P>

    <P>That housing proposal was approved nationally as indicated in the letter to which I referred.  The Minister of State ignored local and Government democracy and took offence at our raising this matter here because he thinks this is a cheap stroke.  Two changes took place, Mr. Gibbons who is present in the gallery became a Senator and Deputy Molloy became a Minister of State. He interfered and looked for a file that surprisingly concerned Carlow.

The manager's report gave the Minister of State a detailed account of the position.  It showed that Shaw Park was derelict, but talking objectively about park space for housing is one thing and talking about Shaw Park is another.  Shaw Park is secluded, is approximately 30 yards in off the main road and is surrounded by houses.  It is not suitable for an unsupervised park.  I will not go into the details of the other point.  When houses are built there will be supervision there.  There is adequate space in Carlow and this development is needed.  There are 12 acres available in Graiguecullen and 13 in Hanover Park.  We want that land developed.  I would agree with anybody who would advocate more park space for Carlow. People travel to Kilkenny to avail of a park there, but we want them to stay in Carlow and spend their money there.</P>

Deputy O'Malley whom I respect has talked about officials going to Carlow and being shown a flooded area considered unsuitable for building.  Is that not why Shaw Park was originally picked?  The officials did not only discover that when they went to Carlow.

How could I objectively talk about a park in Galway or Roscommon if I did not know anything about it?</P>

He was going to send his officials and all hell would break loose when he would say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that proposal, but unfortunately for the Minister of State we tabled this motion last Thursday.  Instead of blaming my party members for doing that, he should compliment us for keeping an eye on this, as his leader advises eternal vigilance to protect democracy.  I will quote what she said later if time permits.  It is important we have done that for the Minister of State.

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> What the Minister of State did was an insult to local democracy which he apparently loves, because he would not step down when he was in Galway.  It is amazing that he does not accept this decision now. What he did is an insult to the high standards set by his leader in Opposition.  It is also an insult to his former leader, Deputy O'Malley, who foolishly came in here tonight to make a speech that did nothing for a man of such high standing.  It is a pity having stood by the Republic that tonight he did not stand by democracy.  He waffled about open spaces and so on which have nothing to do with the motion before us.  In simple language the Minster of State used stroke politics that have blown up in his face.</P>

      <P>Extensive discussions took place in the Dáil between myself, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, and others in recent weeks about Sunday trading and the changing nature of shopping.  In this festive season, with only one day before the Dáil adjourns for the Christmas holidays, I wish to raise the prospect of late night and all night trading &mdash; certain shops will remain open for 36 hours and longer &mdash; in residential areas.  This will affect many districts in Dublin, particularly Donaghmede, and others in cities such as Galway and Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am specifically concerned with the area of Donaghmede, a parish which comprises approximately 2,500 to 3,000 households.  The people there are deeply upset by the prospect, from Friday onward, of late night shopping &mdash; until midnight &mdash; and all night trading &mdash; particularly at <Col N="765" /> Dunnes Stores &mdash; at Donaghmede Shopping Centre. This centre, with its large carpark, is located within ten to 15 metres of dozens of households on Newbrook Road, Donaghmede Road and other nearby streets.  The residents are faced with the prospect of the shopping centre opening early next Tuesday morning and operating continuously until it closes late on Christmas Eve.  Residents are aghast, horrified and deeply upset at the prospect of traffic chaos, noise pollution and intrusive lighting from the shopping centre during this overnight shopping.  Literally metres from their doors, people will be opening and shutting cars, pushing shopping trolleys and talking loudly in the middle of the night under bright lights.  This is a dreadful prospect.  It is also possible that people will pour out from public houses, clubs, etc. to descend on this area for all night shopping.</P>
    <P>One of the most annoying aspects is that valuable and limited Garda resources will be deployed to protect the late night and all night opening.  Given the Government's policy of zero tolerance, so called, one wonders at the wisdom of moving Garda resources away from more deprived areas with greater security needs.</P>
    <P>The potential traffic problems are particularly upsetting.  This time last year the queues stretched two and a half miles from the Dunnes Stores complex at Cornelscourt.  Despite the fact that Donaghmede Community Development Association and I have made representations over many months, we have so far not gained a proper response or an offer to negotiate from Dunnes Stores executives such as the former Assistant Garda Commissioner, Mr. Tom King, or Mr. Pat Doherty, the owner of Donaghmede Shopping Centre.  The decision to provide all night shopping may not be too disruptive in some locations but Donaghmede Shopping Centre is built in the centre of a densely populated residential area.</P>
    <P>Most residents are deeply upset because Dunnes Stores has an agenda which puts profit, wealth and greed before the wishes of local residents or organised family life.  Their plans will be extremely destructive and one must wonder at the role of Dunnes Stores over the last decade, in which it has effectively subverted the political process, not to put too fine a point on it.  In this case it is inflicting a way of life which we do not want on north Dubliners and Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the local representatives in the constituency have effectively washed their hands of this matter and are blaming EU law for this problem in Donaghmede.  However, the Minister stated on 9 December, in reply to a question from Deputy Bell, that the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938 governs the opening hours of retail establishments and provides for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops but gives the Minister power to add to the list of exempted businesses or to exempt specified regions from the provisions of the Act.  An order <Col N="766" /> made later that year exempted the entire country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their parties could at the stroke of a pen regulate the growth of what should be called anti-social trading. However, they are refusing to do so.  At this peaceful Christmas season, they are inflicting on the people of Donaghmede something they do not want.  They are upset because their family lives will be disrupted.  The Minister can stop this by statutory instrument and that is what he should do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I appreciate his strong views about Donaghmede Shopping Centre.  The question of late night and all night trading in residential areas is a legitimate issue for the Adjournment but the issue of Sunday trading is also connected.  The Deputy will appreciate we have had exchanges on this in the Dáil and in public and there is a complex legal background.  The last Government endeavoured to deal with these issues and I am also concerned, particularly with the Sunday trading issue.  In the limited time available I will cover the legal background.</P>
      <P>The Deputy rightly referred to the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, which had as its aim the governing of the hours of trading which are permitted in this country.  The Act was brought in 60 years ago as a method of controlling competition and was not intended to deal with such matters as conditions of employment or any other matter relating to shopping.  The Act dealt with Sunday trading, half day holidays and hours of trading.  Deputies will know of the position regarding Sunday trading which I am dealing with at present.</P>
      <P>At the time of the passing of the 1938 Act it was felt that where a number of shops were in competition with each other, it was difficult for them to observe reasonable hours if one of their number decided to remain open.  It must be borne in mind that we are talking about a period where the number of shops was relatively fixed, economic growth was static and incomes were low. The then generally gloomy economic conditions were exacerbated by a falling population due to a high level of emigration.</P>
      <P>Under the Act numerous orders were made which governed the hours shops could open.  The first such order was made in 1939 and the last was made 30 years ago.  The orders were specific as to geographic area and sector.  The sectors covered were drapery and boot shops, hairdressing shops, hardware shops, boot repairing and in one case the category of miscellaneous shops in respect of Tuam.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that it was in respect of Tuam, where I went to boarding school.  The way the Act operated was that a specific class or type of shop in a specified area had restrictions placed on the times it could open and close.  Generally speaking shops could not open before 9 a.m. and had to close no later than 6 p.m. or in some towns by 6.30 p.m. I must emphasise again that the sectors covered were very restrictive.  For example, in Dublin only two sectors had their trading hours regulated, boot repair and hairdressing shops.  The then normal way for trading hours to be regulated was for either trade associations or trade unions or both to petition the Minister to regulate the particular sector.  The Minister had to be satisfied that there was consensus between all concerned and only then would make an Order under the Act.  It reminds me of the position I am in now but I will come to that.</P>

      <P>The Shops (Hours of Trading) Orders gradually fell into disuse over the years as both traders and employees realised that it was to their mutual benefit to have greater flexibility in opening hours.  This movement also coincided with changes in society.  Initially the main reason the old regime fell into disuse was the increasing use of private cars.  Because the orders were specific as to towns, people could avoid what was increasingly becoming a restrictive practice by driving to the next town which perhaps did not have an hours of trading order or had one with different hours.</P>

      <P>Given this evolution over the years, the Shops (Hours of Trading) Orders are no longer operative.  It would be difficult both legally and practically to devise regulations which would cater for all the complexities of our modern life and the requirements of consumers.  For example, I do not believe that anyone would object to the trading of all night petrol stations, most people would say they were a necessity.  However some of the more modern petrol stations have the characteristics of a small shop or supermarket.  A law which restricted sales to petrol and related products would in reality be unreasonable and unenforceable.  This is just an example of a relatively simple situation.</P>

      <P>The problems I assume the Deputy is referring to are those relating to public order and nuisance.  Local residents often complain of cafés, etc., creating traffic congestion, noise and often more serious disturbance long after pubs and clubs have closed.  I understand and sympathise <Col N="768" /> with these people but the problem is essentially a public order one and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has over the years sponsored legislation to give the Garda powers to deal with this type of nuisance.  Residents who sometimes complain about traffic congestion at such centres late at night can have these problems solved by the local authorities and the gardaí who are responsible for regulating traffic.  I know some local authorities have introduced traffic calming measures which have proved successful.</P>

      <P>As far as the interests of the employees are concerned &mdash; this is crucial &mdash; issues such as the conditions of employment and rates of pay in the retail trade are governed by an Employment Regulation Order and some outlets in the clothing and footwear trade are governed by a registered employment agreement.  The primary purpose of these legally binding agreements is to set minimum rates of pay and terms and conditions of employment.  In addition to being bound to the provisions of the ERO or REA, the larger employers in the sector have entered into collective agreements which generally exceed the minimum pay and conditions of the ERO or REA.  Another provision which provides protection to employees is the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, which implements the EU Working Time Directive (93/104/EC) and provides for minimum daily, weekly and annual rest, a minimum rest break during the day, limitations on maximum weekly working time and limitations on night work.  The Act introduces fundamental standards in these areas to protect the health and safety of employees.  In line with the Directive, the Act is based solely on health and safety considerations to protect employees from damage to their health caused by the continuous working of long hours without adequate rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act is being commenced in stages from 30 September 1997 with improved holidays, provision of information on working time and zero hours protection for employees already in place.  From 1 March 1998 the new maximum average working week will be 48 hours.  Averaging may be balanced out over a four, six or 12 month period, depending on the circumstances.  Every employee has a general entitlement to 11 hours' daily rest per 24 hour period and a day off per week which must be preceded by the 11 hours' daily rest. These rest breaks and intervals may be varied if there is a collective agreement in place approved by the Labour Court.  Variations may also occur in certain sectors e.g. agriculture, tourism, continuous processing, etc.  The employee has an entitlement to take equivalent compensatory rest if there are variations in rest times and rest intervals under agreements or in the permitted sectors. In addition, I have previously announced the measures which I have taken to initiate discussions <Col N="769" /> between the social partners on the sensitive question of Sunday working and I am glad to confirm that ICTU and IBEC have now responded positively to this initiative.</P>

      <P>I raise this issue because families all over the county I represent &mdash; and all over the country &mdash; object to the planting of trees near where they live.  The only way to solve this problem to the betterment of the areas represented by Deputy Ellis and me is to put in place a proper planning instrument.  The amount of acreage for which planning permission must be obtained should be reduced dramatically.  For example, planning permission should be required for planting trees in any area over 15 to 20 acres.  In Adoon and Garvagh a farm has been bought by an outside interest who wishes to plant the land with trees.  If that plantation goes ahead a young family will be surrounded by trees; in ten or 15 years' time they will be unable to live in the area. They should have the right to object, and under the existing planning laws they do not have that right.  I am aware that a person selling land is entitled to sell to whomever he or she wishes. However, as the planning laws stand local residents cannot object to tree planting unless there is a huge amount of land being planted.</P>
      <P>Ironically, this week in the <i>Leitrim Observer</i>, there was a three-quarter page advertisement for forestry development in the area because of the enormous grant aid being made available.  Most of the people applying for grant aid are outside large financial institutions.  In the county that Deputy Ellis and I represent, people are being replaced by trees.  If planting is not restricted that haemorrhage of people will continue, and in five or ten years' time neither Deputy Ellis nor I will have to opportunity to speak here because there will be nobody to vote for us.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at this positively.  All Governments have ignored this issue but at some stage one has to cry &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  Now is the time to do that.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for allowing me to share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an issue which has been brought to our notice very vividly in recent weeks.  There has been an ongoing problem of large financial institutions bidding against local farmers for land to plant it with trees.  Institutions are prepared to pay £1,600 or £1,700 per acre for afforestation.  It is impossible for farmers to purchase it for farming at those prices.  It is unfair that there is assistance for afforestation but none for farmers who wish to purchase the land and maintain it for farm <Col N="770" /> purposes.  The net result of this sort of action will be depopulation, particularly in the western counties, in view of the crisis in farming.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in which I asked what action he proposed to take with regard to the estate in question.  He now tells me that his Department has not yet carried out any assessment. I hope the technical assessments to be carried out will take into consideration the environmental damage caused by indiscriminate afforestation right across the country, not alone in Leitrim and Sligo and the west, but now even in the midland counties where recently a large farm was sold for afforestation at over £2,000 an acre.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to give a favourable reply so that we can ensure that the livelihood of the farmers affected by this case at Adoon and Garvagh, County Leitrim, will be safeguarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies Reynolds and Ellis for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to explain the position in relation to afforestation under the planning system.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the maximum area of afforestation that could be developed without planning permission was reduced from 200 hectares to 70 hectares. An application for planning permission for such development must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement, which must be considered by the planning authority in making a decision on the application.</P>
      <P>In addition, since May 1996, the Forest Service notifies local authorities of all afforestation projects exceeding 25 hectares in respect of which grant applications are received.  The Forest Service has also clarified and tightened the operation of forestry guidelines which contain provisions on the appropriate distance of forestry from houses.</P>
      <P>My Department issued draft land use guidelines on forestry development earlier this year for comment.  These guidelines are intended to help planning authorities, in consultation with the Forest Service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, to ensure that commercial forestry is carried out in a sustainable way.  They set out proposals under which local authorities may designate areas which they consider sensitive to forestry development.  The sensitive areas would be based on factors such as the need to protect views and scenic areas, landscape quality, protection of the natural and archaeological heritage and the avoidance of rural isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these areas it is proposed that local authorities will be notified of all proposals for afforestation regardless of threshold, and the Forest Service will have regard to any observations made by the authorities when deciding grant applications.  The draft guidelines in their final form have been the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of <Col N="771" /> the Marine and Natural Resources.  The guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, the current review of the planning system is considering, <i>inter alia</i>, the possibility of amending the Planning and Development Acts to enable planning permission to be required for plantations which do not require an EIA.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to developing a strong forestry sector and recognises that the development of afforestation can make a positive contribution to the economy and the environment. I am confident that the improved controls referred to above will assist in ensuring that the afforestation programme will continue to contribute to Ireland's sustainable development while enhancing the environment where possible and at the very least avoiding any undue adverse effects on the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being in the House.  Despite the introduction of the free fees initiative in 1996 and the availability of a means tested maintenance grant, a large number of young people cannot afford to attend college.  This is reflected in the decrease in the number of students who accepted places on CERT and diploma courses last year.  According to CAO figures, last year 14,341 students accepted offers on CERT and diploma courses compared to a figure of 16,741 for the previous year.  The Union of Students of Ireland is convinced this is due to the very high cost of attending college.</P>
      <P>Students on a maintenance grant living away from home receive the ridiculously low sum of £45.13 per week.  It is estimated that a student needs £137 per week to survive.  The escalating cost of rented accommodation means students have very little left in their grant cheque after they pay their rent.  Students have to take out loans and take up part-time jobs to fund their way through college.  This leads to other problems such as exhaustion among students who have to juggle study and work.  All too often student fall into debt.  There is also a high failure rate among students who have to take up part-time work to support themselves.</P>
      <P>A full maintenance grant is £1,625 per annum or £45.13 per week.  In most cases rent is approximately £40 per week.  The school year is usually 36 weeks but some students secure their accommodation before the term begins which means they pay rent for longer.  They also have to pay for their accommodation during the mid semester breaks and Christmas and Easter holidays.  In some cases students pay rent during the summer holidays to ensure they have accommodation for the following school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A student pays at least £32 per week on food and groceries, £25 on ESB, fuel and telephone bills, £5 on travel in the city, £15 on clothes, medical and laundry expenses and approximately £20 <Col N="772" /> on entertainment and other expenses.  This amount to £137 per week, yet students only receive £45.  The cost of keeping a student who lives away from home is approximately £5,617 per year, excluding fees.  A large number of students, particularly those from rural areas, are suffering much hardship.  Even though they do not pay fees, their parents cannot afford to borrow money to help them.</P>
    <P>Many students are looking at options other than college.  For example, young people in working class areas believe they are better off on the dole and are prepared to take their chances on it. It is important to review the entire grant system. An increasing number of students are questioning if they can afford to go to college.  This is a sad reflection on all of us.  The only feasible option for some students is to give up college as they cannot survive on £45.13 per week.  They should not be asked to live on this inadequate amount of money.  Will the Minister say if a review will be carried out in the near future into this very important matter?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil don Teachta Deenihan toisc an ábhar tábhachtach seo a chur faoi bhráid na Dála.</P>
      <P>We are engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants, including the eligibility rules.  Maintenance grants have been increased in recent years in line with changes in the consumer price index.  Similarly, the reckonable income limits for grant eligibility have been increased in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The maintenance grants rates for the 1997-8 academic year are: full maintenance, non-adjacent rate, £1,624; full maintenance, adjacent rate, £647; part maintenance &mdash; 50 per cent &mdash; non-adjacent rate, £812 and part maintenance &mdash; 50 per cent &mdash; adjacent rate, £324.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing maintenance grants and income limits will be considered early next year in the context of the annual review of these schemes and in the light of available resources.  In this context, I would point out that in the 1995-6 academic year approximately 26,000 students received grants under the higher education grants scheme at a cost in 1996 of more than £51 million. Furthermore, more than 28,000 students benefited under the free fees initiative in 1995-6 at a cost to the Exchequer of £54.5 million in 1996. Under this initiative the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students attending full-time undergraduate courses which must generally be of at least two years duration at approved colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that a £200 increase in the maximum maintenance grant and a proportionate increase in the other levels of grants would cost approximately £7 million per annum.  An increase of 2 per cent or just over £30 to compensate for inflation would cost approximately £1.2 million. The question of increasing grants levels under the student support schemes has to be considered in <Col N="773" /> the context of the overall level of funding and the many competing demands in the education sector. On the question of student support, the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support of students attending PLC courses.  This commitment reflects one aspect of the importance which the Government attaches to students in the PLC sector.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to introduce grants, which will be at the same level as the third-level maintenance grant, as soon as possible for students who are registered on PLC courses as of September 1998.  While the method and timing of these payments may take some time to finalise, they will be made and they will fully meet our commitments.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of student support schemes, the report of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support, chaired by Dr. Donal de Butléir, was published in February 1995.  The advisory committee found the present system of student support to be fragmented, cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants. It identified overlaps and duplication with up to 70 different organisations involved in the administration of the grant schemes.  It also found that payments were too frequently delayed and students were often disadvantaged by various administrative problems in the system.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee recommended that the three existing schemes, which have the same means test, the same rate of grant and cover virtually the same courses, should have a single application form.  It also recommended significant changes in the processing of grant applications and payments.  In August 1997 a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and <Col N="774" /> Family Affairs commenced an examination of various options for the future administration of the student support schemes, including the case for and against transferring this activity to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  I accept the current administration of the student support schemes needs to be improved. Apart from reservations about the need for a new body, we have an open mind as to the best and most appropriate options for a new centralised system.  Our priority is to ensure that the system properly addresses the concerns of students and parents.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that more than one million young people attend educational courses at primary, second level and third level.  Only today the Select Committee on Education and Science passed the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Bill under which £250 million will be provided over the next three years for major technological developments in the education system.  We will continue to support the education of young people as this is the engine which will underpin economic sustainability in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 36, 38, 72 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A service commitment scheme targeted at certain categories of Air Corps pilots was announced by my Department on 1 August 1997 in response to the increasing number of Air Corps pilots seeking to retire to take up employment in the civil sector.  The closing date for the receipt of applications from officers invited to participate in the scheme was 11 December 1997.  The applications under the scheme are now being processed and a total of 11 pilots have indicated that they wish to participate in the scheme.  I hope that the introduction of this scheme will help to alleviate the problems which have arisen with regard to the turnover of Air Corps pilots in recent years. However, it must be borne in mind that the solution of the problem of pilots leaving the Air Corps does not lie within the system.  As long as the large demand for pilots in the civilian aviation <Col N="778" /> industry continues there will be pilots wishing to retire on pension from the Air Corps.  This problem is not unique to the Irish Air Corps but exists in many other air forces throughout the world who are faced with the same problem.</P>
    <P>A sub-committee of the Conciliation and Arbitration Council has been established and will review the position regarding Air Corps pilots.  It will also review the available options with regard to staffing levels of pilots in the Air Corps, balanced with an equitable policy in regard to personnel who wish to retire, having regard to the operational demands of the corps.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources rescue helicopter service to be based at Dublin Airport, the position is that because of the number of pilots who have retired or who intend retiring from the Air Corps in 1998, it is not now possible to assign Air Corps pilots for training for this service in the timeframe originally envisaged.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,271 officers of the Permanent Defence Force were appraised by means of annual confidential reports in 1995 and 1,760 were so appraised in 1996.  Details of the ratings awarded, with the number of officers awarded each of the ratings in 1995 and 1996, are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The compilation of similar statistics for 1997 has not yet been completed.  Defence Force Regulations prescribe the categories of officers in respect of whom an annual confidential report shall not be completed.  These include general officers, <i>aides de camp,</i> an officer who is nearing retirement and officers who have been retained in service, at their own request, beyond the normal retirement ages for their ranks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 24, 53, 66, 79 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>On 30 September 1996, the latest date in respect of which the military authorities have compiled strength statistics, a total of 256 females were serving in the Permanent Defence Force. There were five in the rank of commandant, 27 in the rank of captain, ten in the rank of lieutenant, 11 in the rank of second lieutenant, 11 in the rank of sergeant, 25 in the rank of corporal and 154 in the rank of private and 13 female cadets in training.</P>
      <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same conditions as those which apply to men.  All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.  In essence the basis of selection for recruitment and for advancement in service is suitability rather than gender and there are no gender quotas.</P>
      <P>The deployment of military personnel, including recruits on completion of their recruit training, is a matter for the military authorities having regard to the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force generally.  Accordingly, should the military authorities consider that additional personnel are required in Columb Barracks, the matter will be examined by them in that context.</P>
      <P>The Defence Force review implementation plan envisages the amalgamation of certain units of the Permanent Defence Force and in that regard it is to be expected that, in common with the position in all other barracks, amalgamation and relocation of some of the units currently based in Mullingar is likely to take place.  The implementation plan of the EAG review group provides for the recruitment of 1,000 military personnel over the three year period of the plan which commenced in 1996.  This plan is based on the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force on the basis of a three brigade structure with a total strength of 11,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the efficiency audit group was the development of a personnel policy with emphasis on lowering the age profile.  It is essential, to maintain the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces, that new young blood continues to be recruited into the organisation which is essentially a young persons's profession.  The target strength of 11,500 at the end of the three year period of the first phase of the plan and the lowering of the age profile, are being addressed by means of a programme of recruitment of young <Col N="781" /> personnel on a continuous basis combined with a voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the enlistment of 200 recruits was authorised and in 1997 the enlistment of a further 600 was authorised.  In addition, 46 cadetships were awarded to successful candidates in 1997.  A competition for the award of 17 apprenticeships is nearing completion and it is envisaged that the successful candidates will be enlisted in early January.</P>
    <P>With regard to the numbers seeking to join the Permanent Defence Force, a factor which has affected the number of potential applicants for general service enlistment is the more targeted recruitment policy adopted in recent years.  In 1996, the upper age limit for recruits was reduced from 27 to 21 years on enlistment.  This followed specifically on a recommendation of the efficiency audit group and its consultants who reviewed the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.  This policy is specifically geared towards achieving a much needed reduction in the age profile of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>In the case of cadetships, the educational standards required have been raised in recent years in order to reflect the standards required for third level college entrants.  This has had a consequential impact on the number of eligible applicants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>A sub-committee of the conciliation council has been established to review, in the context of the PCW, allowances payable to the ranks represented by PDFORRA.  A very constructive meeting with the association was held on 11 December and the next meeting will be held on 18 December.  In the review which is now under way, the official side will be as anxious as PDFORRA to reach a conclusion which is acceptable to all sides, and many of the concerns of the association can be addressed in a constructive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These discussions are taking place under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force.  As agreed with the associations, the scheme provides that discussions <Col N="782" /> taking place under it are confidential to the parties involved.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate, therefore, for me to comment in detail on the issues under discussion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 43, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The question of relocating a company of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil from Cathal Brugha Barrack to Baldonnel has had consideration by the military authorities recently.  However, the question does not arise for the present in the light of the forthcoming study of the Reserve Defence Force, which I announced recently, and the efficiency audit group review of the Air Corps that is taking place at present.  Accordingly, pending the outcome of the study and the review no decision will be taken on relocating an FCA company in Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>Similarly, any development of the FCA that may be necessary will, I am confident, be identified by the Reserve Defence Force study group. The group will have wide-ranging terms of reference and its objective will be the development of a more effective, efficient and value for money Reserve Force.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,612 personnel were recruited to the FCA to the end of September 1997.  Recruitment, which takes place at local level, is permitted to the extent necessary to replace wastage.  Accordingly, there are no recruitment campaigns for enlistment in the reserve.  The strength of the FCA on 30 September 1997, the latest date in respect of which figures have been compiled, was 14,459.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 41, 54, 65 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>There are 29 members of the Permanent Defence Force and 19 civil servants dealing with personal injury claims from members of the Defence Forces alleging hearing impairment. Details are as follows: one commandant, five captains, two company sergeants, six sergeants, seven corporals, eight privates, one principal, one assistant principal, two higher executive officers, three executive officers, two staff officers (job-sharers), ten clerical staff (four of whom are job-sharers).</P>
      <P>Some of the above also have responsibility for personal injury claims not relating to hearing impairment.  In addition, there are 30 staff dealing with this litigation in the Chief State Solicitor's Office broken down as follows: one principal solicitor, 13 assistant solicitors, three law clerks, five clerical officers, five clerical assistants, one paperkeeper, one staff officer, one messenger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 30 November this year settlements had been reached in a total of 1,007 cases and court awards following hearing had been made in 28 cases.  A further 29 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn.  Compensation of £26.249 million and plaintiff costs of £4.492 million has been paid in respect of 1,064 cases finalised.  Some 853 cases were finalised this year at a cost of £21.2 million in awards/settlements and £2.8 million in legal fees.  The current average settlement is approximately £22,000 but this is within a wide range of awards and settlements from a low as £4,000. Total legal costs for the plaintiff in general are about 30 per cent of the award or settlement.  As I said in the Adjournment debate on Wednesday, <Col N="784" /> 10 December 1997, a rapid settlement policy whether by a tribunal or some other scheme would be effectively an unwarranted admission of liability.  This would in turn have the effect of inducing many more claims.  The present strategy of running selected cases is in fact producing results.  A number of cases, albeit small, has been dismissed by the courts and more importantly the overall level of quantum has been reducing, particularly in this last legal term.  Pending the production of the Irish handicap assessment system by the Department of Health and Children it is my view, and that of the Government, that current strategy should be continued at least in the short-term, for as long as it yields such results.</P>
    <P>Since September 1990 a defence advisory committee, comprising military and civilian personnel, has monitored and directed a programme to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  Safety statements and safety representatives are now in place at unit level and 63 safety standards providing detailed technical safety guidelines on a wide range of general and specifically military activities have been completed and issued.  Considerable resources have been made available for an ongoing programme of safety training.</P>
    <P>There are procedures in place for the protection of hearing of members of the Defence Forces on the ranges and in field training.  These include guidelines for the conduct of range practices, instruction on the use of ear defenders and comprehensive training not only on induction but also at various stages of a soldier's career.  I am satisfied that the ear protection equipment in use at present, and purchased after broad international research, is the best that technology can provide at this time.  Both procedures and equipment for hearing protection are kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>In addition to the expert group under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children the centre for insurance studies, UCD Graduate School of Business are undertaking a study of environmentally induced hearing impairment.  It is felt that the average hearing level in the population may be as much as 20 per cent worse than is currently understood.  Other countries have carried out research in order to quantify this trend. It is also hoped to obtain some useful data regarding the prevalence of tinnitus among both the general population and among those with hearing impairment.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department met representatives of the Law Society on Tuesday, 9 December 1997 and had a useful exchange of views on the whole question of hearing loss litigation.  They proposed to the society that solicitors handling these cases reduce their fees by 50 per cent in view of the volume of litigation being processed. The representatives said they would take this back for consideration.  A further meeting to work out a common approach to solving this problem was agreed.  They were also told of my <Col N="785" /> concern in relation to solictors advertising and the role this plays in fuelling this problem.  The Government yesterday decided to examine this matter as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 58, 61 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the questions, the survey in question were carried out on behalf of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the results are essentially a matter for the association.  RACO has however, done me the courtesy of drawing the survey results to my attention.</P>
      <P>Prior to my appointment as Minister for Defence, I took an active interest in Defence matters for a considerable period as Opposition spokesperson.  I believe that the Defence Forces have a highly developed and very professional approach to public relations and that this professional approach is widely respected in media circles.  Furthermore, members of the Defence Forces are well known and respected in a number of other fields, which would include the Army bands and show-jumping where members of the Defence Forces have been seen on arenas all over the world.  The service of members of the Defence Forces overseas is also something of which the general public is well aware and of which it approves.</P>
      <P>The members of RACO occupy the senior and middle management ranks of the Defence Forces and they have a right and duty to be concerned about the image of their organisation.  However, given the pro-active and well developed nature of the Defence Forces PR machine I respectfully disagree with the proposition that members of the public do not have an awareness of the Defence Forces.  I might also add that if public awareness of the Defence Forces was not so high there would not be four questions on this subject today.</P>
      <P>As regards morale, the Defence Forces are going through an enormous reform process, the need for which is accepted by all.  The current restructuring programme cuts across all areas of military life and there will inevitably be major changes as the new organisation takes shape. While the implementation plan is essentially sound, a degree of change such as this engenders a certain degree of anxiety which in itself leads to a lowering of morale.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the fact that the service of members of the Defence Forces overseas is something of which the genral public is well aware and of which it approves.  I recently returned from an excellent trip to the UNIFIL area of operations in Lebannon in the company of the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> Everywhere, the military personnel to whom I spoke, were highly motivated and in excellent spirits.  The troops are doing a wonderful job and the atmosphere in the mission area is very positive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The question of the accommodation requirements of the Defence Forces will be considered within the context of the Defence Forces review-implementation plan.  An examination of barrack requirements will only take place at the end of the three-year phase one implementation period. No decision has been taken in relation to the closure of any barracks other than Collins Barracks, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Department has for some years been pursuing a programme of building, construction and refurbishment to provide the Defence Forces with accommodation suitable to the needs of a modern military organisation.  Since 1993 about £38 million has been provided in capital moneys and a further £19 million has been expended on non-capital repairs, renewals and maintenance.</P>

      <P>In July 1992, following consultation with representatives of the personnel of the FCA and An Slua Muirí, a representative association was established for the Reserve Defence Force.  This association, called the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA), now represents its members in discussions with the Department of Defence on matters concerning their remuneration <Col N="789" /> and certain other conditions of service. Rates of allowances, including deductions for rations, come within the scope of representation. Accordingly, this is a matter which comes within the remit of RDFRA and which can be dealt with under the representative arrangements which have been agreed with the association.  It is open to the representative association to present a claim at any time.  No claim has been received from the association in regard to the question of ration deductions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan, 1996-98 provided for special studies to be carried out in the Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1996, the efficiency audit group engaged Price Waterhouse management consultants to conduct special studies into the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The consultants subsequently furnished a prelimianry draft report to the efficiency <Col N="790" /> audit group.  This draft report highlighted issues which required to be studied in greater detail and identified a number of new issues which required examination.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, rather than publishing a report that merely identified problems, it was decided that the consultants should further examine these problems to produce a report that was as comprehensive as possible and which could serve as the blueprint for the development of these important services in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In September 1997, the efficiency audit group issued extended terms of reference to Price Waterhouse, as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) To determine, through consultation with the various interests involved including the Department of Finance, the current and the likely medium/longer-term extent of the State's requirements for sea and-or air support in the areas of:</P>
    <P>(i) fishery protection;</P>
    <P>(ii) search and rescue;</P>
    <P>(iii) drug interdiction;</P>
    <P>(iv) other aid to the Civil Power; and</P>
    <P>(v) other aid to the Civil Community.</P>
    <P>To the extent possible, to quantify such requirements by reference to historic tasking levels and-or, as appropriate, known or likely future needs and in so doing to develop minimum and maximum parameters for such requirements.</P>
    <P>(b) To recommend the most appropriate model for the provision of such services, taking account of models for the provision of such services in comparable jurisdictions-environments, with particular emphasis on the key taskings of fishery protection, search and rescue and drug interdiction, for the purpose of developing a framework for decision making on the State's current sea and air support requirements which will enable the following options to be meaningfully considered:</P>
    <P>(i) to have all of the State's future sea and air support requirements discharged on a multi-tasked, multi-capability basis by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, having particular regard to the implications for future staffing requirements and equipment purchase-replacement;</P>
    <P>(ii) to contract some of the State's sea and air support requirements from the private sector and-or to resource other State agencies to discharge some of the taskings involved.  The taskings to be considered under this option would be taskings in excess of those currently discharged by the Naval Service and the Air Corps with current levels of manpower and equipment (including decisions already taken);</P>
    <P>(iii) to have any additional sea and aid requirements over the above current tasking <Col N="791" /> and capability levels provided by the Naval Service and the Air Corps on a dedicated basis, that is on the basis that the additional manpower and-or equipment assets provided will be used by the Naval Service and-or the Air Corps exclusively for the specific purposes provided; and</P>
    <P>(iv) whether the structure and equipment of the Naval Service and Air Corps in particular are appropriate to the taskings that the services currently carry out and if so whether these structures and types of equipment should be expanded-replicated in the event of additional tasks being imposed on either service.</P>
    <P>(c) In developing the above framework for decision making, to construct a matrix which will allow all relevant factors to be taken into account, including the likely extent of future requirements by tasking, the implications for the State of the dedicated and multi-capability approaches, the factors impacting on cost and value for money, the trade-offs between costs and different modes of operations and the benefits of different approaches.  The development of the matrix should also indicate the factors involved in and advice on how to treat the State's requirements for a contingent defence capability at sea and in the air as part of the total decision-making process.</P>
    <P>(d) To carry out the foregoing work in a manner which will enable the output to be incorporated into a consolidated report which also includes the outcome of the current review of the Naval Service and Air Corps.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that the consultants are due to furnish their report to the efficiency audit group in early January 1998.  It is my intention to publish this report at the earliest possible juncture.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 45 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the <Col N="792" /> Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations.  Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to such taskings. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a Joint Task Force involving the Garda the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has also increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the Naval Service is 1,047.  Arising from the recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force in 1996 and 1997, 20 recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service on 30 December 1996 and 80 have been enlisted in 1997.  A further ten Naval Cadets have commenced training and it is proposed to enlist seven apprentices for training in the service in January, 1998.</P>
    <P>A special study of the Naval Service is currently being undertaken by the efficiency audit group as part of the review of the Defence Forces. The question of the resources necessary to discharge the tasks assigned to the Naval Service will be encompassed by the study.</P>

      <P>The total cost to the Exchequer in 1997 of troops serving on overseas missions was £23,600,000 approximately. This figure is made up of £15 million approximately on normal pay and allowances and £8.6 million approximately on extra costs, chiefly overseas allowances, cost of telephone calls and postage, temporary promotions, travel or leave and preparation of contingents.  Arrears of almost £7 million have been paid by the UN to date in 1997.  The annual cost of temporary acting appointments overseas is approximately £225,000.  As the data in relation to the numbers of such appointments is in the form of a tabular statement I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances come within the <Col N="794" /> scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO) and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  The question of the rate of patrol duty allowance payable to members of the Naval Service has been raised by the associations under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the associations, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential and you will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</P>
      <P>During the period December 1996 to November 1997, 81 non-commissioned personnel have left the Naval Service, some having transferred to other areas of the Permanent Defence Force.  A total of 100 non-commissioned personnel were recruited to the Naval Service during the same period.  A total of 13 officers have left the Naval Service since 1996, while a total of 13 naval cadetships have been awarded during the same period.</P>

      <P>The question of the appointment of an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force.  The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions under it are confidential to the parties involved.  Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.  I might add that revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996. These procedures included the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister.  The agreement provides for a two year trial period after which a review will take place i.e., in May 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 46, 101 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote for new weapons, transport and communications equipment and in providing new and upgraded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the more important developments in 1997 in relation to the improvement of Defence Forces' equipment were: a contract for a new fishery patrol vessel, for delivery in 1999; a contract for the supply of new turrets and fire directing systems for fitting, during 1998 and 1999, to existing armoured cars; a contract for the purchase of refurbished 105mm.  light artillery <Col N="796" /> guns, for delivery in 1998, to replace &ldquo;25 pounder&rdquo; guns which are now obsolete; a contract for the final instalment of equipment to complete a major programme to provide new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces at a total cost of nearly £10 million; expenditure of approximately £3 million on new troop carrying vehicles; and purchase of a second hand motor launch for the Slua Muirí, which means that each Slua Muirí company now has its own launch.</P>
    <P>The question of procuring armoured personnel carriers is under consideration in my Department. A project team has been established comprising civilian and military personnel and has been tasked with identifying the most suitable type of APC for the Defence Forces, the numbers and variants required and the estimated costs involved.  Procurement of APC's will be undertaken by way of a competition which will be conducted in accordance with Government contracts procedures.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that commencing in 1999 there will be net pay savings of the order of £15 million a year arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force.  It has been agreed that from 1999 onwards 50 per cent of the pay savings will be made available to provide additional funding for equipment and infrastructural programmes for the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative position on this matter is quite clear. Sections 2(3) and 2(4) of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, provide that the Defence Forces representative associations shall be independent of and shall not be associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body, and furthermore that a member of a repreentative association shall not be or become a member of a trade union or any other body, other than an association, which seeks to influence or otherwise be concerned with the remuneration or other conditions of service members.  The position of the Defence Forces representative associations in this regard is identical to the position of the Garda representative associations.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment further on his question regarding PDFORRA as the association has not furnished the specifics of its proposal for my consideration.</P>

      <P>The Air Corps fleet comprises 23 fixed wing aircraft and 14 helicopters.  The numbers and types are as follows: two CASA CN-235; one Gulfstream IV; one Beech Super Kingair; seven Siai-Marchetti SF 26OW; six Cessna; six Fouga Magister CM-170; five Dauphin SA 365F; two Gazelle and seven Alouette III.</P>
      <P>Most of the aircraft mentioned are involved from time to time in a training function but some, for example the Marchetti, Fouga and Gazelle types, are obtained specifically for training purposes. All of the aircraft have been maintained to a fully airworthy condition through scheduled overhauls and regular servicing and will continue to be kept operational apart, however, from the Fouga type.  Further extensive overhauls of the Fouga aircraft which arise in the near future would be uneconomic and they will gradually be withdrawn from service.</P>
      <P>Pending the outcome of the ongoing review of the Air Corps which is being undertaken with the assistance of consultants, proposals for the provision of new equipment for the Air Corps will not be formalised or decided on.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Advisory Committee on Safety is a standing committee of the Defence Forces tasked with advising Defence Forces personnel on all matters concerning safety in the Defence Forces and in particular overseeing the implementation of all aspects of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  The committee is part-time selected and appointed by the Quartermaster-General on the basis of the expertise of the members in the specific area of safety and other specialist disciplines such as engineering, medicine, law and science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is continuous co-operation between the Defence Forces Advisory Committee on Safety and the Health and Safety Authority and in the <Col N="798" /> initial stages of the committee's work, an official from the Health and Safety Authority sat with the committee to guide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service fleet consists of seven allweather patrol vessels, comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  These undergo regular planned maintenance and repair to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.</P>
      <P>In this context European Union fishery protection programmes have facilitated certain planned maintenance and refitting to extend the service life of the vessels on a part-cost recoupment basis. Three of these vessels &mdash;<i>LE Emer, LE Deirdre</i> and <i>LE Aoife</i>&mdash; were refurbished at the naval dockyard in recent years and another, <i>LE Aisling</i>, is currently undergoing a major overhaul at the same location to replace and refurbish obsolete or deteriorated equipment and extend its operational life.  This work is due for completion by end January next.  The three remaining vessels &mdash;<i>LE Eithne, LE Ciara</i> and <i>LE Orla</i>&mdash; will undergo similar refurbishment during the next three years, starting with <i>LE Eithne</i> in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the European Union fishery protection programme 1996-2000 provision has <Col N="799" /> been made for the acquisition of an additional fishery protection patrol vessel (FPPV) for the Naval Service.  The cost of the vessel, excluding VAT, will qualify for EU subsidy in the range of 50 per cent to 65 per cent.  This rate is subject to negotiation on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I had the pleasure of signing a contract with Appledore Shipbuilding Ltd., of Devon, England, for the supply of this new vessel. The tender competition for the new vessel was conducted in accordance with the relevant EU Public Procurement Directives.  The contract value is STG£15.75 million which at the prevailing rate of exchange amounts to about IR£17.9 million.  As VAT will be payable on delivery to this country the total price, inclusive of VAT, will be about IR£21.65 million.  The new vessel is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>
    <P>Further details regarding the vessel, such as crewing and accommodation, are expected to be settled shortly.</P>

      <P>Ear plugs are issued to members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí on a personal issue basis.  Responsibility for hygiene in their use is, therefore, a matter for each individual.  Ear muffs, which are not provided to members of FCA and Slua Muirí on a personal issued basis, are held by unit commanders for issue to the members, including the members of 17th and 25th Infantry Battalions, as and when required for use on firing ranges.  Unused hygiene pads are issued for use with the muffs.</P>
      <P>The ear plugs and ear muffs together with the hygiene pads that are on issue to the FCA and An Slua Muirí are the same as those that are on issue to members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The hygiene pads on issue to the Defence Forces meet medical standards and are a standard feature in civilian life in employment where ear muffs are pooled and issued as and when required.</P>

      <P>I expect full completion of the process to take some 12 to 18 months.  As the Deputy will appreciate this is the first such White Paper on Defence in the history of the State and I am anxious to ensure that this necessary planning work is carried out as carefully as possible.  That work is principally concerned with ensuring that all of the relevant issues are identified, and that appropriate communications and consultation is provided for.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, implementation of the Defence Force review implementation plan covering the first phase of the reorganisation process in the Defence Forces for a more effective and efficient Defence Forces is proceeding.  In addition, ongoing consultation with the Defence Forces representative associations is taking place in the normal way on all issues of concern to them.</P>

      <P>The last rotation of personnel to UNIFIL was completed in November 1997 and met requirements.</P>
      <P>The current agreed establishment of the Irish UNIFIL contingent is 619.  There is currently a total of 612 personnel serving with UNIFIL.  The shortfall of personnel is due to a number of factors, chiefly, unanticipated repatriations where volunteers had to return home for domestic reasons and a small number of personnel of the 81st.  Battalion (which returned home in October-November), who had initially indicated their intention to remain on for a further tour of duty but later changed their minds and returned home.  The current shortfall of seven personnel is insignificant and I am satisfied that it has no implications for the operational efficiency of the contingent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Air Corps provides certain facilities and services to other Government Departments.  These include ministerial air transport, air ambulance, search and rescue, fishery protection and Garda air support services.  In addition aerial support for operations in aid of the civil power, including aerial surveillance of the Border area, is provided by the Air Corps.  The provisions of these services does not involve an annual transfer of moneys between the Votes of the various Departments involved and the Vote for Defence.</P>
      <P>The ministerial air transport service is provided by the Air Corps using a Gulfstream IV jet aircraft which is dedicated to this function.  A Beech Super Kingair 200 turboprop aircraft is also made available from time to time mainly to a limited number of destinations in Europe.  While Air Corps helicopters are not part of the ministerial air transport service they are occasionally used for the transport of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Air ambulance missions are flown by the Air Corps by arrangement with the Department of Health and Children.  These missions may be categorised as (i) inter-hospital transfers of patients at the request of ambulance controllers or hospital matrons, using helicopters, mainly Alouettes; (ii) transport of patients to hospitals in Great Britain for transplants of vital organs using the Beechcraft and; (iii) organ harvesting missions which involve transporting teams of specialist personnel to various hospitals in the State to remove vital organs from recently-deceased donors.  Different aircraft types are used depending on the type of mission, numbers, etc. involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Search and rescue services are provided by the Air Corps to the Irish Marine Emergency Service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources which has statutory responsibility for the provision of such services in the State.  The following Air Corps resources are available for search and rescue purposes as part of the overall search and rescue arrangements:- An Alouette III helicopter and crew of three, located at Baldonnel for daylight search and rescue operations. In addition, a Dauphin helicopter and crew of <Col N="803" /> four based at Baldonnel is committed to night search and rescue operations on the East Coast; a Dauphin helicopter and crew of four, is located at Finner Camp, County Donegal, on 24 hour call for search and rescue.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing and subject to operational commitments and serviceability, additional Air Corps helicopters and fixed wing aircraft may be available for search and rescue operations.  In particular, two CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft with their particular radar systems can support marine search and rescue operations when available.  The Beechcraft aircraft can also be used, if available, in the transportation or logistics support role if the situation demands.</P>
    <P>While the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has primary responsibility for fishery protection, the Naval Service has operational responsibility for carrying out sea fishery protection patrols.  Naval Service fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  In addition, inshore and estuarine fishery patrols are provided to the Central Fisheries Board using Cessna aircraft which are also used from time to time to conduct river and lake surveys at the request of the same agency.</P>
    <P>Garda air support is provided using two aircraft, a helicopter and a fixed wing aircraft, recently purchased by the Department of Justice which have been placed on the military register. The helicopter is an AS 355N Squirrel and the fixed wing aircraft is a PBN Defender 4000. Other Air Corps aircraft are also used to provide assistance to the civil authorities as required.</P>
    <P>During the winter months in particular, the Air Corps provides relief services to islands cut off from the mainland by inclement weather.  Relief has also been provided from time to time to farmers during bad weather by providing fodder drops to livestock.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, storage space in an aircraft hangar at Gormanston is provided free of charge to the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The cost of these services in any one year in respect of individual Government Departments can be calculated by reference to the direct cost per flying hour of the aircraft involved.  These are the costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown.  It is not possible, however, in the time available to calculate the various costs attributable to each Department in respect of the various facilities and services provided. The current estimated direct costs per flying hour of the aircraft in question are as follows:- Gulfstream IV &mdash; £1,320; Beech Super Kingair &mdash; £405; CASA &mdash; £550; Cessna &mdash; £100; Fouga &mdash; £500; Marchetti &mdash; £200; Dauphin &mdash; £1,200; Alouette &mdash; £400; Gazelle &mdash; £350.  With regard to the recently acquired Garda support aircraft, the Defender 4000 and the Squirrel, <Col N="804" /> these have not been in service long enough to compile sufficient statistical data to permit of the calculation of accurate flying hour costs.</P>

      <P>As a private limited company, it was the board of the Crafts Council of Ireland which took the decision to consolidate its administration function in Kilkenny.  This decision, an internal matter for the company and not one in which I have any direct function, was approved by the board last June.  I understand, however, that it was taken with a view to achieving cost savings which will be used to promote the council's primary objective of developing the crafts sector in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It was agreed at the review plenary session of the multi-party talks on 2 December that, as a means of facilitating progress, it would be valuable to establish a sub-group to seek to identify the key issues to be resolved in the negotiations and the formats in which those issues might be addressed. The sub-group reported back to the review plenary yesterday, 16 December, that it had been unable to reach agreement on these matters.</P>
      <P>It would, of course, have been desirable for the negotiations to have made more headway by Christmas.  Nevertheless, the work of the past few weeks has been valuable in establishing a substantial degree of common ground among the participants and in laying the basis for intensive negotiations on the core issues when the talks resume on 12 January.  Moreover, despite the undoubted difficulties, the atmosphere continues to be positive.  It is important to emphasise that all participants are committed to returning in January to work intensively at fleshing out the details of the core issues.  This will be done in the three strands format already in place under the rules of procedures.  The chairman of the plenary, Senator Mitchell and his fellow chairmen, Prime Minister Holkeri and General de Chastelain, who have been of invaluable assistance this far, will have a key role in facilitating the work ahead.</P>
      <P>In light of the statement by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister signposting a critical ten week period ahead, I believe that we are entering in January the most intensive and decisive phase of the peace process so far.  It continues to be the view of the Government that, given this goodwill, imagination and hard work, it will be possible to achieve our goal of a comprehensive and balanced overall agreement by the target date of May 1998.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy's question is broad-ranging, I propose to concentrate on major energy infrastructural projects.  State capital funding was not provided for any major energy projects during the period 1992 to 1997.</P>
      <P>EU funds, totalling £104 million were paid to major energy projects in that period, including the Ireland-UK gas interconnector and work related to the extension of the national gas network.</P>
      <P>In addition to this support, non-fossil fuel projects availed of EU capital grants, primarily under the THERMIE programme, and to a lesser extent under the Valoren programme during this period. The total EU funds secured for Irish non-fossil fuel projects in that period amounted to almost £9.3 million.</P>
      <P>It is an over simplification to say that switching to carbon free or carbon neutral sources of energy is hampered by high costs.  There is a multiplicity of factors which must be taken into account in arriving at energy supply decisions.</P>

      <P>The target of 10 per cent of the installed electricity generating capacity being renewable energy based by the end of 1999 is premised on a number of different technologies of which waste-to-energy is one.</P>
      <P>The second Alternative Energy Requirement, AER II competition was launched in December 1995 with the aim of securing an electricity generating plant of between 10MW and 30MW using various forms of biomass or waste as a fuel.  Having accepted the recommendation of an independent agency, ETSU, which was appointed to run the competition, the winning consortium of Foster Wheeler Power Systems Inc.  and ESB Power Generation was announced in February 1997.  Of the eligible fuels, the winning project proposes to use municipal solid waste to generate electricity.</P>
      <P>The proposed waste-to-energy facility is not an incinerator.  It does, of course, involve combustion in the same way as electricity generation from other fuel sources does.  The developers will be required to comply with all planning and environmental licensing requirements and, as the project is Dublin based, it will have to be compatible with the relevant provisions of the Dublin Waste Management Strategy when it is finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AER III competition, launched last March, aims to secure an additional 100 Megawatts of electricity generating capacity from renewable energy sources (wind, hydro, waste, biomass and wave).  An independent agency, <Col N="810" /> ETSU, appointed to conduct the competition on behalf of my Department, is currently assessing proposals received and I expect to be in a position to announce the results early in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said during the Adjournment Debate last Wednesday, a huge amount of taxpayers' money is at stake and we must ensure that every effort is made to contain this expenditure while at the same time having regard to the legitimate claims of those serving and former members of the Defence Forces who may have been genuinely injured. However, the State does not accept the current level of quantum because it believes that this is too high.  Furthermore, a rapid settlement policy whether by a tribunal or some other scheme would be effectively an unwarranted admission of liability.  This would in turn have the effect of inducing many more claims.  The present strategy of running selected cases is in fact producing results.  A number of cases, albeit small, have been dismissed by the courts and more importantly the overall level of quantum has been reducing, particularly in this last legal term.  Pending the production of the Irish handicap assessment system by the Department of Health it is my view, and that of the Government, that current <Col N="811" /> strategy should be continued at least in the short-term, for as long as it yields such results. The Expert Group of Ear, Nose and Throat Consultants and an Audiologist, convened by the Department of Health and tasked with developing an Irish hearing handicap assessment system has now met.  It is hoped they will be in a position to report early in the new year.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department met with representatives of the Law Society on Tuesday, 9 December 1997 and had a useful exchange of views on the whole question of hearing loss litigation. They proposed to the Society that solicitors handling these cases reduce their fees by 50 per cent in view of the volume of litigation being processed.  The representatives said they would take this back for consideration.  A further meeting to work out a common approach to solving this problem was agreed.  They were also told of my concern in relation to solicitors' advertising and the role this plays in fuelling this problem. The Government yesterday decided to examine this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Again I emphasise that the Government is prepared to compensate those who have suffered a genuine injury and who are suffering a significant handicap.  What it is not prepared to do is waste taxpayers' money on compensating individuals whose hearing is normal for their age or whose handicap is so small that they did not notice it until they spotted an advertisement in the paper inducing them to make a claim.</P>

      <P>The provision for official military entertainment in 1997 was £50,000.  The main components of expenditure in this regard are in respect of foreign naval vessels visiting Irish ports, foreign visits by Irish naval vessels, commissioning ceremonies, wings ceremonies, passing out parades, expenses incurred in relation to entertainment for St. Patrick's Day by Irish personnel serving with United Nations missions and allowances for official entertainment held by certain military appointment holders and which are generally expended on entertainment of visiting members of the Oireachtas, the press etc. and other occasions such as official visits by members of foreign Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>On 9 December last, during the course of a shoot in the Glen of Imaal involving two mortars, a misfire occurred on the firing of the sixth high explosive mortar bomb.  Misfire drills were successfully carried out.  As a precautionary measure, the weapons were inspected after the firing of each of the next ten rounds.  As nothing unusual was reported it was decided to resume the shoot and from then on to inspect the weapons after the firing of the fifth round from each one.  Another misfire occurred on the firing of the twenty fourth mortar bomb.  The misfire drills were carried out but the bomb remained in the barrel.  Because of declining light the Ordnance Officer decided to remove the bomb from the barrel the next morning and this was successfully done.  Misfires are not uncommon and are provided for in the mortar training syllabus.  The second misfire in this case was somewhat unusual only in that the bomb was not successfully removed from the barrel during the initial misfire drill.  An Ordnance Officer was on site to deal with any matters arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the incident in the Glen of Imaal and that which occurred at Kilworth Firing Range, County Cork, occurred on the same date viz.  9 December <Col N="814" /> 1997.  The weapon type was the same in each case. The mortar bombs were the same type and lot number in each case.  It should be noted that between 1 October 1997 and 8 December 1997, 416 mortar bombs of this lot number were fired and only one misfire was reported.</P>
    <P>A Court of Inquiry has been established which will inquire into the incident at Kilworth and will make recommendations on all relevant procedures relating to the firing of the weapon.  Safety procedures for military exercises are constantly reviewed and the current regulations were in place during these exercises. These regulations provide for the testing of personnel in basic skills before firing.  They include safety precautions and misfire drills. Pending the outcome of the Court of Inquiry referred to previously, no firing exercises using the weapon type involved in these incidents will be conducted by the Defence Forces.</P>

Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances come within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers, RACO and may be processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  The rates of uniform allowance are intended to reflect the actual cost to the officer of such articles of uniform and the rates payable are determined following negotiation and agreement with the representative associations.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan <Col N="818" /> 1996 which was adopted by Government in March 1996, made no provision for the closure of barracks during the period covered by the plan. It did, however, provide for a study of military accommodation to be undertaken during the life of the plan.  It is proposed that this study should commence in mid-1998.</P>
      <P>The Price Waterhouse study for the EAG concluded that there are too many barracks, many unsuitably located for military needs, many in very poor condition with unacceptably high upkeep costs and that barrack management and administration takes up an unduly large element of military manpower.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged that the question of barracks rationalisation, and more particularly their closure, is a very sensitive local and national issue.  It will need careful study from a number of perspectives.  The precise terms of reference and the <i>modus operandi</i> of the proposed study will be drawn-up as part of the implementation process. It is clear however that such a study must address the future infrastructural needs of the Defence Forces having regard to the security situation, the required disposition of military resources and the progress in relation to re-equipment and increased mobility.  The study must also take full account of the economic and social implications of any proposal.</P>

      <P>A number of years ago a grading structure was established for accommodation for single living-in personnel. Accommodation which is constructed, decorated and furnished to a very high level is described as &ldquo;standard accommodation&rdquo; and personnel in occupation, within a defined occupancy level, are required to pay a small charge by deduction from pay.  Some accommodation, while in reasonable decorative order and having limited furnishings, may be heated by open fire or gas heater or may have ablutions and toilet facilities separate from the rooms.  This type of accommodation is defined as &ldquo;substandard&rdquo; and no charge is payable by the occupants.</P>
      <P>A third category of accommodation was defined as &ldquo;emergency accommodation&rdquo; and the name suggests it is not regarded as appropriate for long-term use.  No charge is made in the event that personnel may be required to be billeted there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>It is intended that certain changes to the disadvantaged areas headage schemes, which form part of the Partnership 2000 agreement will come into effect in 1998.  The changes are as follows: a ceiling of £3,024 per applicant will apply.</P>
      <P>The eligibility criteria for receipt of the high (£84) rate of grant for beef cows under the cattle headage scheme in more severely handicapped areas and the beef cow scheme in less severely handicapped areas will be brought into line with the eligibility criteria for suckler cows under the suckler cow premium scheme.  This in effect means that the high rate of grant will no longer be payable on non-beef breed cows or on in-calf heifers.  These animals will continue to be paid the lower £40 or £33 rate of grant.  This change will lead to a streamlining and simplification of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cross-compliance between the ewe premium/rural world premium and sheep headage schemes and environment requirements will apply in certain areas.  This means that sheep farmers with commonage land in areas classified as overgrazed including such commonages in areas designated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands as special areas of conservation as required under the EU Habitats Directive, will be required to participate in an approved agri-environment programme in order to qualify for ewe premium/rural world premium or sheep headage payments.  The areas regarded <Col N="840" /> as overgrazed are in commonages in some district electoral divisions in certain counties along the west coast.  The application of these cross-compliance measures will be dependent upon the introduction of a new rural environment protection scheme for the areas concerned in 1998. Negotiations on the introduction of this package are ongoing at present.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas headage schemes are 65 per cent co-financed by the EU.  Such co-funding cannot be made available in respect of farmers who are in receipt of a non-means tested pension. Certain farmers who have contributed to the PRSI scheme for the self-employed introduced by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in 1988, will qualify for a contributory old age pension if they reach 66 years by 1 January 1998.  Headage payments to such farmers cannot be co-funded by the EU.  While headage payments will continue to be made to such farmers it is necessary for my Department to identify all farmers, both under and over 66 years of age, who are in receipt of a pension other than a means tested pension in order that the payments made to them are not included for co-financing by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that a formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of negotiations in 1994 on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to the measures represented too high a percentage at 62 per cent of the overall allocation of the structural improvement and rural development element of the Operational Programme.  These changes arise from recommendations made in that evaluation.</P>
    <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with a number of broad recommendations and, following consideration of their report, the proposals as outlined above for amendment to the schemes were put to the Commission in early 1997.</P>

      <P>I have always been of the view that no restrictions should be applied to the export of livestock from Ireland on the basis that this trade provides an important competitive element in the Irish cattle and beef sector, while complying with strict animal welfare conditions.  In 1993 and 1994, during my previous term as Minister for Agriculture, live cattle exports amounted to 381,263 heads and 406,378 heads respectively.</P>
      <P>As I have explained on a number of occasions, following my meetings in Cairo in September, the Egyptian authorities agreed to consider a proposal for a trial shipment of live cattle from Ireland.  The formulation of a proposal which would allay the concerns of the Egyptian authorities, necessitated a veterinary and engineering assessment of quarantine and slaughtering facilities in Egypt.  This was completed in early November and a detailed proposal, drawn up by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Livestock Exporters' Association was forwarded by me to Dr. Wally on 20 November.  This proposal is now being considered by the Egyptian authorities. Pending a response, it is not appropriate for me to predict the outcome.</P>

      <P>In the period since 1 January 1997 some £733 million has been paid to farmers under the various headage, premia and arable aid schemes of which over £480 million relates to payments made under the 1997 schemes.  Some 1.409 million payments have been made of which 903,136 represent payments under the 1997 schemes, including payments made under the various BSE and agrimonetary compensation schemes.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1997 disadvantaged areas' headage schemes commenced on 28 September 1997 and to date over £109.7 million has been paid. In fact over £124 million has been paid under disadvantaged areas schemes since 1 January 1997.  Payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October, the earliest possible commencement date under EU regulations and some £85 million was paid to 94 per cent of applicants within one week of commencement of payments. The current position is that over £90.8 million has been paid to 90 per cent of applicants.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1997 special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes commenced on 1 November and 3 November respectively. The EU regulations provide that these payments cannot commence until 1 November and that only 60 per cent of entitlement can be paid.  To date over £131.7 million has been paid under these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that this year priority was accorded to making payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme in view of the very severe harvest conditions which affected some parts of the <Col N="847" /> country.  It is also the case that almost 4 per cent of 1997 cattle headage beef cow and suckler cow applications cannot be processed for payment at local office level because they are under query with the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>Payments are continuing to issue to farmers under all premium and headage schemes.  While the requirements of the land parcel identification system which is fully operational in 1997 under EU rules had been a complicating factor in processing the various premium and headage applications this year, it is expected that remaining eligible applicants will be paid before Christmas.</P>

      <P>The position is that the vast bulk of payments under all 1997 schemes have now been made.  In most cases the payments have been based on fully digitised mapping.  In a minority of cases the digitising exercise has been rescheduled for completion before issue of balancing payments in 1998.  This means that all but intractable cases will be paid before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>It is not normal practice when seeking tenders to indicate the tender price that is expected.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 185 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>The reduction in tax relief from 100 per cent to 80 per cent of the qualifying investment in films was introduced in the 1996 Finance Act following an extensive review of the section 35 film relief by an independent consultant.  The reduction to 80 per cent relief for investors was balanced by several improvements to the relief in terms of increased limits for corporate investment and reduction in the holding period for the investment in films for capital gains tax purposes from three years to one year.  The section 35 relief, which now includes several new modifications introduced by the 1997 Finance Act with regard to the levels of finance which can be raised in respect of a film, corporate investors' investment limits and an incentive for post-production in the State, is specifically designed to be cost efficient from the Exchequer point of view, while at the same time assisting film production in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of services at St. Ita's Hospital is administered by the Eastern Health Board.  The board's current development plan in relation to the St. Ita's Hospital campus provides for the closure of old wards in the main hospital block in line with a reduction in patient numbers in the psychiatric service and mental handicap service of St. Ita's. The development plan envisages the main hospital closing as a residential facility.  This will be facilitated by the provision of purpose built residential facilities in the community and on the hospital campus for residents with a mental handicap, and the transfer of long-term older psychiatric patients from the main hospital block to more modern accommodation on the hospital campus as vacancies arise.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the board adopted a development plan &mdash; St. Ita's Mental Handicap Service Development Programme 1997-98 &mdash; which provides for the replacement of the older facilities in the hospital by the commissioning of four community residences and two village complexes providing a total of 85 places in the community. Implementation of the plan is under way with capital funding of £650,000 and revenue funding of £625,000 being made available this year by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently met the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to discuss the development of St. Ita's and the measures required to implement the remaining elements of the board's plan for the overall development of <Col N="850" /> the campus.  I also paid a visit to St. Ita's on 28 November 1997 to view for myself the facilities and services provided at the hospital.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the board are fully committed to the implementation of the overall development programme which will continue in 1998.</P>

      <P>Regulation (EC) 258/97 provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved/authorised before being placed on the European market.  Foods and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia</i>, within the scope of the regulation. <Col N="853" /> The regulation also contains provisions for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients. Regulation (EC) 258/97 came into force in May 1997.  Prior to that date, there was no legislation in Ireland concerning the genetic modification of foods.</P>
      <P>I understand from industry that it is unlikely that infant formula currently on sale in Ireland contains genetically modified ingredients. However it is possible that in the future infant formula may be manufactured from genetically modified soya, which received approval to be placed on the market under Directive 90/220 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified orgnisms before the novel foods regulation came into force.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is at present considering, in consultation with the member states, the labelling and consumer information aspects of, <i>inter alia</i>, this genetically modified soya.  While awaiting resolution of this discussion at EU level, guidelines on the labelling of such genetically modified products are under active consideration by the Irish food industry.  I understand that if, in the future, infant formula sold in Ireland contains such ingredients, such products would come within the scope of these guidelines.  My Department is continuing to discuss the matter with the industry to ensure that the consumer is appropriately informed.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services in the north side of Dublin is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.</P>
      <P>In September 1996 the Eastern Health Board established the regional orthodontic department in St. James's Hospital.  The orthodontic consultant and her staff based there provide orthodontic services for the Eastern Health Board region.  The board is consolidating and extending its orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and service of high quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the regional orthodontic department in St. James's Hospital the Eastern Health Board provided orthodontic <Col N="854" /> services on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis partly by the employment of private practitioners working three hour sessions in North Strand Health Centre.</P>
    <P>As part of the service development the board intends to phase out sessional arrangements by private practitioners in North Strand Health Centre and assign patients on the waiting list to the regional orthodontic department at St. James's Hospital for assessment and treatment by the consultant and her staff.  Satellite clinics of the regional orthodontic department will be held at North Strand.  The position regarding North Strand will be kept under review as the services develop, particularly in relation to the proposed second regional orthodontic department at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Eastern Health Board that a site has been identified within the campus of Beaumont Hospital as suitable for the construction of this regional orthodontic department. Work is now at the planning stage and the board proposes to commence construction in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203, 204 and 210 together.</P>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's query, the £4 million additional funding allocated to the mental handicap services in 1997 by this Government was capital funding and is provided through the Department's subhead I1.  Additional funding of £16 million is being provided for services to persons with a mental handicap in 1998.  This includes additional revenue funding of £7 million for the provision of new residential-respite and day places and £3.75 million to strengthen the existing services.  Sustained capital investment is needed to support these developments.  I recently announced the establishment of a £30 million capital programme to be provided over the next four years to develop the mental handicap services including day, residential and respite places for persons who have been assessed as in need of such places.  As part of this programme £5.25 million capital funding is being provided in 1998.  The additional revenue funding for 1998 will be provided through subheads B1 and B4 and the capital funding through subhead I1.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing residential and day places for persons with a mental handicap may vary significantly from case to case.  A range of estimated costs for each service is required to take account of the level of staffing required by the different levels of handicap.  Persons with a mental handicap who also display challenging behaviour require a high staffing ratio and this represents a higher cost.  The average costs in 1997 were £18,000 in respect of new residential places and £8,000 in respect of new day places.  The health boards and the mental handicap agencies are currently discussing the precise services to be put in place in 1998 with the additional funding which has been provided to them and I expect to have their proposals by early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The following table supplies the information requested by the Deputy for the period ending 30 September 1997.  I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998. Of this amount, I am allocating £9 million immediately.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing the situation in relation to cardiac waiting lists.  As soon as I have completed this task I propose to allocate the remaining £3 million to this and other priority areas.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the arrangements for application of waiting list funding and I have taken the following initiatives to improve the effectiveness of the system:</P>
      <P>*Where applicable, agencies have been notified in their Determination of Net Expenditure for 1998 of the level of funding available to them for waiting list work.  This will give agencies much earlier notice of the money available than in previous years and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly.</P>
      <P>*Each agency's service plan must now specify targets for waiting list activity during the year.  It will then be the responsibility of the chief executive officer or hospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action if necessary as the year proceeds.</P>
      <P>*Agencies have been instructed to focus increasingly on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention.</P>
      <P>*Where agencies have not already done so, they have been requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work within the agency and as a contact point with the Department.</P>

      <P>There are currently 1,079 (whole-time equivalents) social workers employed in the health services.  Additional funding has been allocated for 1998 to implement further measures under the Child Care Act, and will probably give rise to extra numbers of social workers.  However, the number required will not be finalised until the agencies provide service plans in early 1998. There are 248 students currently enrolled on social work courses.  I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that the number currently in training is not sufficient to meet demand. However this number is subject to regular review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are responsible for the delivery of health services in their respective functional areas, including the provision of care to persons <Col N="862" /> presenting with eating disorders.  However, I am concerned at preventing these conditions arising in the first instance.  Consequently, the Health Promotion Unit of my Department is actively involved with the Department of Education and Science in the promotion of healthy nutrition in schools and in programmes which foster self-esteem and positive body-awareness.  The unit has also produced a leaflet on eating disorders which is available from my Department and which is being widely distributed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of a request by the Irish Eating Disorders Association for funding from my Department.  However, grants totalling £6,000 will be paid this year to another support group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Sofia Protocol, ratified in 1994, Ireland was required to stabilise NO x emissions at their 1987 level, estimated to be 105,400 tonnes, by the end of 1994.  The latest national emission figure was 114,669 tonnes (1996 provisional).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport is the largest source of NO x, with vehicles accounting for over 40 per cent of national emissions.  The power generation sector is the other major source but the upward trend in emissions in that sector is being addressed by the introduction at all major generating stations of <Col N="863" /> low NO x producing burners.  The difficulty to date in meeting Sofia Protocol requirements is significantly attributable to the growth of the transport sector in recent years.  However, the impact of successively more stringent vehicle emission controls, notably the fitting of catalytic converters, is expected to bring about significant NO x reductions over time.</P>

The report for last year (report to the European Commission on the Quality of Bathing Waters in Ireland for the 1996 Bathing Season) indicates that the quality of bathing water in Ireland is generally very good, with 96 per cent of the 124 sampling points complying with the mandatory standards of the Directive for the main health-related and aesthetic parameters. In addition, over 88 per cent of the sampling points complied with the more stringent guide values for these parameters contained in the Directive which are used, together with criteria concerning general beach management, availability of environmental information and visitor facilities, for the determination of awards under the Blue Flag for Beaches scheme.  A copy of the agency's report on 1996 is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The annual bathing water results furnished to the European Commission are also made available to the Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe which is responsible for the Blue Flag scheme and to its affiliated national organisations which administer the scheme in individual countries.  A total of 70 Irish beaches secured Blue Flags in 1996, the highest number awarded in any year.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is currently finalising its returns to the Commission in respect of the 1997 bathing season.  I understand that these will show results broadly comparable with those recorded in 1996 and will again confirm the general good quality of our bathing water.  I will arrange to have a copy of the agency's report placed in the Oireachtas Library as soon as it is available in early 1998.</P>
      <P>It is a matter in the first instance for local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency in so far as activities licensable by the agency may be concerned to deal with inputs of pollutants that may affect bathing water quality.  Extensive statutory powers are available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990 and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to support these bodies in their respective roles.</P>
      <P>Relevant advice on preventing pollution from agriculture is available to farmers from Teagasc and in codes of good agricultural practice, such as the code to protect waters from pollution by nitrates, issued jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food in 1996.  In addition, farmers may participate in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme and avail of grants towards a series of measures, including the preparation of a waste storage and fertilisation plan, aimed at preventing water pollution.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236 agus Uimh.  237 le chéile.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions No. 3 of 23 October 1997 and Nos. 340, 341, 342, 343, 344 and 346 of 2 December 1997.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the proposals put forward for discussion by Ireland will increase the protection for whales by bringing all legal whaling under the control of the Commission and by making illegal whaling more difficult.  This will reduce the number of whales killed.</P>
      <P>Questions on the position adopted by Ireland at the recent meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Monaco must be set in the context of the current impact of whaling operations on the whale species generally.  The current moratorium on commerical whaling has had qualified success.  The reality of the situation is that despite the moratorium, Japan and Norway are taking an increasing number of whales legally &mdash; under the provisions for scientific whaling in the case of Japan and under objection to the moratorium in the case of Norway.  This has resulted in an increase in the number of whales taken from 380 in 1992 to almost 1,050 in 1997. Indeed, I understand from newspaper reports that Norway has decided to increase its quota for 1998.  This indicates the limitations of the current moratorium and the proposals put forward for discussions by Ireland are designed to address these limitations.  The proposals represent a method of strengthening, not weakening, the protection regime for whales under the International Whaling Convention.  The proposals address the threat posed to whale populations by continued uncontrolled whaling operations for commercial and scientific purposes.  As such, they do not seek to address directly other threats posed to whale populations such as environmental pollution, etc. However, I can confirm that environmental threats are the subject of deliberations by the IWC which is conscious of the need to ensure that such threats are taken into account in calculating quotas under the revised management scheme (RMS).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> The Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan are currently not parties to the Whaling Convention and are not members of the IWC.  I am satisfied that the proposals put forward by Ireland would reduce the incentive for those countries to engage in whaling.  By providing for a ban on trade in whale meat, our proposals should remove the major market (Japan) for whale meat.  This should greatly reduce the economic incentive to any nation, including those already referred to, to engage in whaling.  The Republic of Korea is a member of the IWC and will be a party to any agreement reached on the Irish proposals.  Before a quota could even be sought by an IWC member, there would be a requirement to carry out costly surveys and this, with other substantial compliance costs, would further reduce the potential profit from whaling.</P>
    <P>The proposals made by Ireland to the IWC have not then been the subject of any communications by me with either the Secretariat, or the Standing Committee of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.  The proposals have been put forward for discussion with the objective of reaching agreement by consensus within the IWC on the control and regulation of whaling.  If such consensus can be reached, the intention is to draft suitable texts within the legal ambit of the International Whaling Convention.  I am advised that this is the appropriate legal mechanism but my Department is willing to look at any opinions on this matter.  At this point the Irish proposals provide only a framework for discussion and agreement and much work remains to be done.  There is as yet no agreement, but we would be encouraged by the fact that the proposals have, in general, been considered for what they are &mdash; an honest attempt to reach agreement by consensus.  I am satisfied that the proposals, providing as they do for the phasing out of lethal scientific whaling, will reduce the number of whales killed and, by controlling and regulating all whaling, will ensure that any whaling operations that do take place will not impact adversely on whale populations.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that Ireland's proposals would encourage illegal activity.  I have already informed the House that our proposals include satellite monitoring, DNA tracing of meat and international observers on whaling vessels.  These proposals provide for improved monitoring of whaling operations under the RMS which can only restrict, not encourage, illegal whaling practices.</P>
    <P>While no formal statement has been received from either Japan or Norway that they will leave the IWC if the Irish proposals do not succeed, I understand it is the view of many observers that Japan and Norway will leave if a ban is imposed on all whaling, in spite of any scientific opinion that might indicate that limited whaling is sustainable.</P>

      <P>Amendment of the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders would not provide a solution in this case.</P>
      <P>The non-award of a pension to the applicant in this case arises not from the provisions of the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders but from the fact that the applicant was not lawfully married to the member at the time of his death.</P>
      <P>An amendment of the Pensions Orders to cater for this particular case could have the effect of depriving a lawful spouse of the entitlment to receive a pension on the death of a former member.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have expressed concern, and I share that concern, about providing the detailed information sought by the Deputy on the grounds of security and in the interest of crime prevention generally.  I propose, therefore, to provide the details on a district basis.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the current Garda strength (as of 31-11-1997) of the district in question is 58 members (all ranks). The Garda authorities have informed me that the local divisional officer is satisfied that the best possible Garda service is being provided for the particular district with the current deployment of Garda personnel.  However, I am assured by the Garda authorities that the deployment of personnel to particular stations is continually reviewed by them and changes made accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249 and 250 together.</P>
      <P>A copy of the new procedures for dealing with applications for refugee status was placed in the Dáil Library last week.  In addition, copies of the procedures were circulated to all Deputies on 11 December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it has been determined, under the provisions of the Dublin Convention <Col N="873" /> (Implementation) Order, 1997, that an asylum application falls to be dealt with by another member state of the European Union, then the appropriate mechanisms are put in place to effect the applicant's transfer to that State to have the asylum claim dealt with there.  This does not involve returning an asylum seeker to the country of origin, but rather to the relevant EU state which has accepted responsibility for processing the application in accordance with its national provisions.</P>
    <P>If, following full consideration of an application for refugee status in accordance with the new procedures to which I have referred, it is determined that the applicant is not a refugee within the meaning of section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, unless there are exceptional reasons the person should be permitted to remain in the State that person will be asked to leave.  In the event of failure to comply with such a request, arrangements will be made for the return of the person to his or her country of origin.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the general prohibition against <i>refoulement</i> at section 5 of the Refugee Act.</P>
    <P>There are no specific provisions for the detention of asylum seekers as such.  Such persons are subject to the laws of the State generally, in the same way as any other person within the State. Where any person is the subject of a deportation order but does not comply voluntarily with the requirement of the order to leave the State, then he or she may in accordance with the law be detained for the purpose of carrying out the order.</P>
    <P>In so far as the provision of legal advice for asylum seekers is concerned, the Refugee Act makes no specific provision in this area. However, the present position is that my Department provides £120 per case for asylum seekers to present their cases to the appeals authority.  This amount is paid to the legal representative, who is engaged independently by the asylum seeker, on certification by the appeals authority that the representative has acted in the case.  The fee of £120 is the same as that paid by the Legal Aid Board under its private practitioners' scheme for legal services provided for certain District Court family law cases.  I am considering the question of legal assistance as part of my ongoing review of the asylum issue.  In this regard, I am availing myself of the advice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  I hope a suitable scheme will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>In the matter of training, the UNHCR has given a commitment to continue to provide training in asylum law and practice designed to meet the needs of officials involved in the asylum process. An internal course for new staff to the Asylum Division of my Department was held in September, 1997.  A UNHCR official recently stationed here at my request has been providing additional training modules for staff members over the past few weeks.  Furthermore, a number of other specialised courses have been organised by my Department, and the third such course this <Col N="874" /> month is being completed today.  As recently as the end of last month, officials of my Department met the UNHCR Representative to Ireland to finalise details of a comprehensive training programme for existing staff and for new staff who will be assigned to my Department shortly.  I personally met Ms Hope Hanlan, the UNHCR Representative today and confirmed that this comprehensive programme would commence in the second half of the month of January, 1998.</P>
    <P>With regard to those provisions of the Refugee Act which are not yet in effect, I would refer the Deputy to my statement of 11 December on the adjournment of the House in which I emphasised that a review of the Act has been necessitated by the large increase in applications over the past year.  When the Act was drafted, it was envisaged that applications would be of the order of a few hundred per annum, not thousands as has turned out to be the case.  When the number of applications began to increase last year, it was decided that the Refugee Applications Commissioner position should be changed from a part-time appointment to a contract of employment for three years.  With current numbers, even this solution will be unworkable.  The Act provides for only one commissioner, with no powers of delegation. One person could not cope with the number of applications on hands and the current backlog situation would only be exacerbated.</P>
    <P>The level of new applications has begun to fall over the past few months.  If this level of decrease continues and if the new arrangements result, as is the intention, in the backlog being cleared, then it may well be possible to implement the provisions of the Act pertaining to the commissioner as currently drafted.  If not, I will bring forward fresh proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that new accommodation has been obtained to house the Asylum Division of my Department.  It is proposed that the Eastern Health Board's Refugee Unit, the UNHCR and a proposed legal advice service for asylum seekers will be accommodated in the same building.  This will be a one-stop-shop for asylum seekers, and should be ready in spring 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the number of persons in custody having been convicted of sex offences varies from week to week.  However, at the end of last month there were approximately 255 sentenced sex offenders detained in our prisons system.  Sex offenders are accommodated in all of the closed institutions with the majority being held in Arbour Hill Prison, approximately 70, the Curragh Place of Detention, approximately 95, and Wheatfield Place of Detention, approximately 51.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently two forms of therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the prison system.  Both are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their offending behaviour.  The first is individual counselling from my Department's clinical psychology service or from the probation and welfare service. This service is available in all prisons, with the temporary exception of the Curragh where it will be available as soon as possible.  The second is an intensive offence focused group work programme available only in Arbour Hill prison at present.  It should be noted that both forms of treatment are entirely voluntary.  In the region of 60 sex offenders are released from custody each year. All of those released would have had access to individual counselling but not all of them would have availed of it.  Ten offenders have been recruited to the dedicated treatment programme in each year since its introduction in 1994.  It takes about 11 months to complete the programme. <Col N="876" /> This may seem like a small proportion but a large number of those released would not be candidates for the treatment programme due to disinterest, or because they are serving short sentences.</P>
    <P>I am keen to expand treatment programmes for sex offenders and my Department is acvively examining the possibility of increasing the number of group treatment places available by locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh.  However, in view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme, it will take some time to put a new programme in place there.</P>
    <P>At present, offenders who have completed their sentences cannot be compelled to accept supervision from the probation and welfare service. There is, however, a small number of offenders (who have completed the Arbour Hill programme) now under mandatory supervision by the probation and welfare service on foot of court orders which included one year periods at the end of their sentences suspended under these conditions.  These are progressing satisfactorily. My Department is in the course of finalising a discussion paper on sex offences and this will contain a detailed section on the question of mandatory supervision following release from prison as well as a range of other issues, including whether there should be a register of sex offenders and the tracking of such offenders.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that, as I said in response to Parliamentary Question No. 104 on 11 December last, I am <Col N="877" /> aware of the concerns of residents in the area surrounding Mountjoy Prison.  The number of offenders on renewable temporary release from the prison can vary substantially from week to week and as such the number required to report to the prison on any one day can actually vary between 30 and 50.</P>
      <P>The granting of temporary release to offenders is a statutory function of the Minister for Justice under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 and has been exercised by every incumbent since that Act came into force.  In all cases where renewable temporary release is granted, a precondition of the release is that the offender must report back to the prison from which he or she is on release on a specified date to have his or her temporary release renewed.  In most cases it is also a condition of renewable temporary release that offenders report at their local Garda station on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Once the new prison accommodation becomes available every effort will be made to reduce the level of renewable temporary release.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that where renewable temporary release is granted to an offender it can be renewed only by the governor of the relevant prison in consultation with the prisons division of my Department.</P>

In line with standard procedures, payment of the grants is subject to the centre providing specific documentation and information confirming that the development carried out complies with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  On the basis of the documentation submitted, an amount of £23,882.95 was paid to the centre in June 1997.  My Department wrote to the centre in September, 1997 outlining the outstanding documentation required in order for further payments to be made.  Before final payment can be made, a deed of trust must also be executed. This is currently being arranged by the Chief State Solicitor's office and the solicitors acting on behalf of of the centre.</P>

      <P>I am aware that an application for a remedial service has been made to my Department in respect of the cluster of schools to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
      <P>These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>

      <Col N="879" /> I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area, including current responses to medical needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional allocation of special supports which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>The ordinary fees for entry to the 1998 certificate examinations have been increased from £46 to £48 for the leaving certificate, including leaving certificate applied and from £43 to £45 for the junior certificate.  The entry fee payable in respect of a recognised pupil who remains at school with a view to repeating the leaving certificate examination has been increased from £125 to £130.</P>
      <P>Candidates who are not attending school may enter personally for the leaving certificate examination as external candidates.  The ordinary fees payable by external candidates for entry to the leaving certificate examination have been increased as follows: £46 to £48 for one subject, £91 to £95 for two subjects and £134 to £140 for three or more subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> The maximum fee payable by an external candidate who has not previously sat the leaving certificate examination is £48 which has been increased from £45.</P>
    <P>While there has been a modest increase in the fees payable I have also provided significantly increased funding to alleviate examination fees. This year students who hold a current medical card or are dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card are not liable for examination fees at all.  The new provision will exempt an estimated 40,000 students altogether and replaces the existing scheme of fee alleviation for ordinary candidates, leaving certificate repeat candidates and candidates participating under the vocational training opportunity scheme and analogous courses.</P>
    <P>In light of the significant improvement I have made in relation to fee alleviation I do not propose to reconsider the fee increases.</P>
    <P>I should point out for the Deputy that all adults returning to second chance education who are covered by the medical card scheme will likewise not have to pay examination fees.</P>

      <P>Media studies is fully integrated into the junior certificate English syllabus.  Students are given opportunities to study a variety of media forms including newspapers, advertising, magazines, films and radio and television programmes. Examinations at all three levels &mdash; higher, ordinary and foundation &mdash; contain full sections on media studies.  Reports from the chief examiners indicate that media studies is one of the successes of the syllabus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While media studies will not form a specific section in the new leaving certificate syllabus, the study of the various media will, in fact, form part of students' work.  The syllabus states that &ldquo;The <Col N="882" /> experience of language in the media in all forms, visual, aural and print, needs to be recognised as a prime shaping agency of student's outlook&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the leaving certificate applied one of the four modules in the English and communication course is entitled the communications media.  This module provides opportunities for students to become aware of, and critically analyse the influence of mass media on their lives.  The final examination for English and communication contains an audio-visual component.</P>
    <P>Given the integration of media studies into existing and new syllabi, it is not the intention of my Department to introduce media studies as a separate subject in the second-level curriculum.</P>
