      <Quest>the contribution of increases in food and drink prices to inflation over the past six months.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Consumer Price Index is designed to measure the change in the average level of prices paid, inclusive of all indirect taxes, for consumer goods and services by all private households in the country.</P>
      <P>The CPI was compiled on a quarterly basis in respect of the middle Tuesday of the months February, May, August and November each year up until the end of 1996.  From January 1997 onwards the CPI is being complied on a monthly basis. March 1997 is the latest month for which the CPI is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions of changes in the levels of prices paid for food and alcoholic drink to the All Items CPI since August 1996 are as follows.  In the seven months August 1996 to March 1997 the <Col N="2" /> Consumer Price Index went up by 0.693 per cent of which the food contribution was minus 0.011 per cent and alcoholic drink contribution was plus 0.109 per cent.  There is a difficulty in giving figures for the past six months because up until the end of last year the CPI was compiled on a quarterly basis.  That is why I am giving figures for a six months and seven months period.  In the six months from August 1996 to February 1997 the Consumer Price Index increased by 0.584 per cent of which the food contribution was minus 0.047 per cent and the alcoholic drink contribution was plus 0.113 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it significant that no member of the Government Front Bench appears to be available for Question Time?  I am not casting any aspersion on the Minister of State, but that is most unusual.  The Minister of State should promote himself to the Front Bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's reply that since January there has been a change in the compilation of the CPI from a retrospective six monthly basis to a monthly basis.  The Minister of State is aware that the value of the punt against sterling has declined from IR£1.02 to 95p, a fall <Col N="3" /> of approximately 7 per cent.  That currency decrease is not reflected in the food and alcoholic drink prices he quoted.  Is forward purchasing causing the fall in the value of our currency against sterling not to be reflected in the Consumer Price Index in terms of food prices?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fall in the price of food as reflected in the CPI is accounted for by two food items, vegetables and beef.  Those two food items when factored into the Consumer Price Index account for the zero factor in the seven monthly and six monthly periods in question.  Apart from those items, other items in most cases show a slight increase.  Even allowing for the aggregate figure for inflation over the full year, we still meet the convergence criteria for European Monetary Union qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is welcome and so too is the fact the consumer price index in relation to food has not increased, with the exception of the two items the Minister mentioned.  The question concerned the fall in the value of the punt against sterling of up to 7 per cent and the fact it is not reflected in the consumer price index.  Why has this drop not been reflected?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <Quest>the amount of Exchequer and EU money allocated under the URBAN initiative in each year since its inception; and the amount received in each area.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some £21 million will be spent on the implementation of URBAN Operational Programme, 1996-99.  The Structural Funds, European Regional Development Fund and ESF, will provide 75 per cent of the funding and the Exchequer will provide the balance.</P>
      <P>The three areas in which URBAN is being implemented are Ballymun-Finglas-Darndale, Tallaght-Clondalkin and the northside of Cork city.  Over £10 million has been allocated to Ballymun-Finglas-Darndale and £5.5 million to each of the other two areas.  The action plans for the three areas were developed during 1996 and, with the adoption of their strategies by the URBAN monitoring committee last January, the first draw down of funds for the steering groups arose in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> Some £5.708 million has been provided under subhead F3 of this Department's Vote for URBAN in 1997.  This includes the provision to match the EU contributions, which are received as appropriations-in-aid.  To date, only the north Dublin steering group has drawn down any funding &mdash; it received £200,000 last month.  The operating budgets for 1997 have been submitted by the other two steering groups and the administrative arrangements for the handling of these funds are being finalised.  It is expected that funds will be released shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect funds will be released shortly.  Why was there undue delay in allocating funds to the other regions?  Was the delay caused by the Minister's Department or was it on the part of those making the submissions?  The Minister said it is expected allocations will be made shortly.  I fully understand that because they will be used as election ploys.  Which groups are expected to receive money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the £5.7 million earmarked by my Department in 1997, I expect most of the money will be drawn down by the three groups this year.  I accept it has taken some time for the structures to be put in place to develop the action plans for each of the three areas, but it has been time well spent.  URBAN is an initiative which calls for new ways of working.  To be successful, it is vital that a clear strategy be developed and agreed and that a firm foundation be established in each case.</P>
      <P>Community development related activities have started in each of the three areas and it is expected that the activity levels will progress steadily over the coming months.  Representatives from my Department and the EU on the monitoring committee were anxious to ensure that we were not simply providing funds to replace plans in the pipeline by other authorities, but to ensure it was additional and that it would meet the specific objectives set out for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify where the money will be allocated between now and the election, which is obviously what is intended, or has a decision been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ballymun-Finglas-Darndale area will receive over £10 million and £5.5 million will go to Tallaght-Clondalkin and the northside of Cork city.  Some £5.7 million of that will be spent this year and it will depend on the readiness of the three areas to draw down the funds and how far advanced their plans are.  The URBAN initiative is 75 per cent European-funded and it operates across the EU.  To suggest this is in any way connected with the election is a distortion which we have come to expect daily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this plan is to meet the needs of communities in terms of employment and enterprise development, training and education, community infrastructure, children and youth programmes, environmental improvements and <Col N="5" /> community development.  I, as Minister, and the monitoring committee were anxious to ensure this complemented the work of partnerships, where in place, and the local authorities.  That is the reason it has taken time.  We are not prepared to allocate money to the first application.  All applications have been monitored and carefully worked out to ensure they meet these objectives effectively.  In meeting those objectives, they will help to counter the long-term causes of disadvantage and long-term unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister will select projects carefully &mdash; there is no doubt about that.  Will he list the projects which submitted applications and which are being considered? When does the Minister intend to confirm that projects have been lucky?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing lucky about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is being done objectively. Three areas were selected based on submissions made.  They set out a number of proposals to meet the criteria I listed, including employment and enterprise development and so on.  A steering group, led by the local authorities and including area partnership companies and other relevant organisations and groups, such as county enterprise boards, F¡S, the vocational education committees, Forbairt, Tallaght regional technical college and Dublin City University, analysed a series of proposals put forward.  These have been developed into a comprehensive plan.  I will be happy to send the Deputy a copy of the plan, all of which are quite detailed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of an adequate level of service in respect of all offshore island communities is central to ensuring the long-term viability of the islands.  In this regard, the development of access services to islands has been given priority by the Government.  Programmes of priority access works, prepared by each of the relevant local authorities, are being implemented.  To date, I have approved grants of almost £1 million towards the cost of priority access projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned that the issue of support for those islands, not currently in receipt of subsidised access services, should be addressed.  I have written to each of the relevant local authorities requesting that their island committees carry out <Col N="6" /> a detailed examination of the current levels of access to their respective islands.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have also asked their island committees to carry out an assessment of the improvements required to meet the particular needs of each island concerned.  The information provided by the local authority islands committees will be submitted for assessment to the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development.  Following consultation with Comhdh·il Oile·in na h…ireann, the interdepartmental committee will make recommendations to me on how best the issue of access to islands, not currently in receipt of subsidies, may be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept there is an anomaly between Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht islands?  What steps is he taking to remove the anomaly and to provide the same level of assistance to all islanders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When appointed by the Taoiseach to this office I was aware of the inequity between Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht islands and was able to persuade the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to allocate an additional £1 million to help offshore island communities.  The report commissioned by the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, was completed.  In that, emphasis was placed on infrastructural access in the early years.  Substantial funds have been given especially for Pontoon Pier in Cork, on which £328,000 has been spent and it is due to be completed this year.  Almost £200,000 has been allocated for Whiddy Island pier and almost £40,000 for Dursey Island for access improvement.We are moving in the right direction.  We await the considered view of the local islands committees on access to non-Gaeltacht islands, whether ferries serving those islands need subsidies and the degree to which they require them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept there is an additional and considerable cost to the communities in non-Gaeltacht islands in the supply of provisions and, for example, the movement of livestock to the mainland?  It has gone beyond the stage of reports.  The islanders want to know when the Minister of State will put a package together to have the same assistance available to all islanders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The local islands committees are comprised of representatives from local authorities contiguous to the islands.  In the Deputy's constituency, the seven Cork islands are represented on the local islands committee and the islanders can express their views there.  Full knowledge of the travel requirements of people on offshore islands is available.  When the plans are with the Department, I will ensure they are expedited quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The communities on Sherkin Island, Clear Island, Long Island, Whiddy Island, <Col N="7" /> Bear Island and Dursey Island want the level of support and assistance given to the Gaeltacht and they want to know when the Minister of State will be in a position to provide that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the local islands committee.There has been a suspicion for a long time among islanders that local authorities had no interest in their development.  I have succeeded, together with Comhdh·il Oile·n na h…ireann in developing a partnership.  I rely upon the thrust of partnership and community development for progress in this matter and it will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State any information on which ferry operators serving islands off the Donegal coast receive a subsidy and which await receipt of one?  I understand a report is to be published but does the Minister of State have a timescale from the various island committees on when it started and when it will end?  That would give a timescale to those who are seeking a subsidised ferry service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy Deputy Keaveney asked me about this because Donegal County Council is the most prompt.  A group of officials there have full knowledge of what is happening on offshore islands.  I am certain I will receive the Donegal report first.  The council has been first in many other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been very successful in its application this year.  I am certain Deputy Keaveney knows that both Tory Island and Aran Island have been given substantial grants to improve their roads this year, which I am sure the islanders will appreciate, especially during 1997.</P>

      <Quest>when the long-promised legislation to outlaw below-cost selling of newspapers will be presented; the drafting difficulties, if any, which have arisen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>A legislative prohibition on below cost selling of newspapers is one of a number of recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which I have been examining.As already indicated to the House, I am concerned that any legislation containing provisions to prohibit below cost selling would be both robust and safe from legal challenge while proving effective and workable.  The Deputy will be aware that, given our membership of the EU, <Col N="8" /> any legislation in this area must be compatible with the EU Treaty and with European Court of Justice decisions.  Accordingly, any proposals in this area must apply in a non-discriminatory way to all newspapers sold on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>I continue to obtain the best advice on the complex legal and economic issues involved.  The issues involved relate to, among others, definitions, including defining cost, revenues and newspapers, compatibility with EU law, consideration of exclusions or exceptions and compliance and enforcement.  This detailed consideration of complex legal and economic issues is proceeding apace.  In addition, I have had meetings with newspaper interests on an ongoing basis about the commission's recommendation on below cost selling.  These contacts are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>What specific difficulties have the Minister, his officials or the experts he has engaged encountered to explain the long delay in producing legislation?  It is almost 12 months since the commission reported in May last year. Since then, both Deputy Harney and I have asked questions on the issue at various times.  Each time my party leader asked the Taoiseach, he was told it would be before Christmas.  At Christmas, it was to be before Easter.  When is it to be?</P>
      <P>Who are the Minister's experts and what difficulties are they encountering?  The Minister stated on several occasions the legislation was to be robust.  It has not yet been published.  Does the Minister intend to produce this legislation within the next few weeks or has this been a mechanism whereby he has attempted to gain kudos for actions to be done when he has not introduced anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are matters of considerable difficulty surrounding complex issues such as the definition of what costs and revenues would be included in a ban on below cost selling, ensuring compliance with EU law, especially Article 30 of the EU Treaty and consideration of what exclusions might be permitted.  Considerable progress has been made and, at this stage, I have sent draft proposals to the Attorney General's office on which legal advice is being sought.  The legal experts are appointed in the normal way by the Attorney General and I would not name individuals in such a context.  We are putting in a great deal of work and we hope to have robust heads which we can bring to Government as soon as possible.  However, I do not see legislation being published in the next few weeks and I did not indicate that it would be, when this was discussed on the last occasion in the D·il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not have, but the Taoiseach did on two separate occasions speaking on behalf of the Government.  I do not have the references with me but they are on the record of the D·il in the October to Christmas period last year and the Christmas to Easter period this year.  He said in both sessions that it would be introduced in that term.  Therefore, it is <Col N="9" /> on the record that legislation was to be introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was to engage experts &mdash; not the Attorney General &mdash; to help his Department in drafting the legislation. Everyone understands the Attorney General engages outside people to examine the legal complexities.  Who are the outside officials who have been engaged?  It is clear that this legislation was never meant to be introduced before the election.  I am glad that is now evident.  The Minister may not have said so but others have.  The Taoiseach and the spin doctors have said it is about to be introduced.  Has the Minister got the heads of the Bill?</P>

I have already indicated that we have draft proposals on which we are seeking legal advice.  We will proceed as soon as possible.  There is no point in proceeding until one is satisfied that complex issues such as compatibility with EU law and the workability of the definition applied have been properly dealt with.  The Deputy's expectations of our not being able to deal with this before the election suggest that she has information about the timing of an election which I do not have.</P>

      <P>This takeover falls to be dealt with under the EU Regulation on the Control of Concentrations.  This takeover is not referable to myself due to the size of the enterprises involved. The transaction was notified to the European Commission on 1 April and under the terms of the regulation the Commission has until 5 May to decide whether to initiate proceedings or to declare the proposed acquisition compatible with the common market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials from my Department met with Commission officials on Friday, 11 April to discuss this <Col N="10" /> case.  Among the issues discussed was the possibility of the Commission referring this transaction to the competent authority in Ireland for examination under the terms of Article 9 of the regulation.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of Article 9 the Commission may, at its discretion, refer a case to the competent authorities in a member state where it considers that &ldquo;a concentration threatens to create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded on a market within that member state, which presents all the characteristics of a distinct market, be it a substantial part of the common market or not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While it could be argued that the market in this State has &ldquo;all the characteristics of a distinct market&rdquo; the takeover would not be regarded by the Commission as a concentration which &ldquo;threatens to create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which competition would be significantly impeded&rdquo;.  Having regard to the terms of the regulation and the meeting on 11 April with EU officials I have decided that there would be no benefit in seeking an Article 9 referral in this case.</P>
    <P>On 26 March I met with the chief executive of Tesco plc and the managing director of Power Supermarkets, trading as Quinnsworth.  At that meeting I received certain undertakings which were subsequently confirmed by letter on 4 April. These undertakings are as follows.  Tesco has acquired the Power Supermarkets business with the intention of growing the business and enhancing its value to Tesco and to the Irish economy. These objectives will be achieved through continuing investment and by the addition of resources and expertise to the Irish business by Tesco.</P>
    <P>Existing commitments to Power Supermarkets Ltd. employees in terms of pay and conditions will be fully honoured.  Tesco conventionally adopts a partnership approach in its relations with its employees.  Tesco intends to continue that policy in Ireland and to honour the spirit of partnership that is valued in Ireland between the social partners and between employers, employees and their trade union representatives.</P>
    <P>The level of beneficial resources on purchasing and technology in Ireland available to Irish suppliers will be enhanced with a view to ensuring that the amount purchased will be maintained and increased.  It is intended that a buying facility will remain in Ireland as a base for purchasing goods for the Irish and other European markets of Tesco.  Tesco's experience in doing business with the Irish food industry over many years has been entirely positive and they look forward to enhancing that relationship over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Tesco will adopt a developmental approach to foster new and emerging Irish suppliers in accessing the Irish and wider European market for own brand and branded products purchased by Tesco.  Initiatives will include mentoring, quality enhancement and other support for SMEs. Tesco will, in consultation with Forbairt and Bord Bia, develop other initiatives including supplier <Col N="11" /> assistance and supplier recruitment programmes, the details of which will be developed jointly with those agencies.  Tesco would also propose to invite relevant business representative groups to participate in this process.</P>
    <P>As business requirements in Ireland evolve, there will be ongoing consultation with distributors. Tesco is aware of the existing supportive approach of Quinnsworth/Crazy Prices to the Irish food supply chain and in the distribution sector.  Tesco will remain cognisant of those relationships as its business in Ireland evolves.</P>
    <P>Tesco will honour all legal obligations arising from its entry into the Irish market including those set out in the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, and particularly those relating to credit terms and below cost selling. Arising from these undertakings, arrangements are being made involving officials from my Department, the relevant State agencies and Tesco, to set up the structures necessary to ensure that these commitments are implemented.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that Tesco will play a full, responsible and positive role in adding business to Irish producers.  As in life, change brings challenge and opportunities.  Tesco is a merger opportunity for Irish suppliers but this change must be nurtured and maintained so that Ireland, Irish producers, the Irish consumer and Tesco all benefit.</P>
    <P>In this regard.  Forbairt is pursuing, on my behalf, a number of initiatives with Tesco including a supplier development programme, a management training initiative and a benchmarking initiative.</P>
    <P>I and my Department will continue to monitor progress with a view to ensuring that the concerns of Irish suppliers are borne in mind by the Commission in their decision-making process.</P>

      <P>That is a load of gobbledygook.If the Minister believes that he will believe anything.  Like IBEC, RGDATA and other concerned groups.  I believe that the Minister has sold the pass.  No one is suggesting that Tesco cannot come to Ireland.  That would be like King Canute trying to hold back the waves.  However, if there is to be an agreement it is up to the Minister to ensure watertight conditions so that future inevitable incursions by other groups will meet similar conditions.</P>
      <P>In the UK, Tesco uses 50 per cent own brand products, while Quinnsworth's share is 15 per cent.  What assurances did the Minister receive that the 15 per cent would not increase to 50 per cent?  I received the same letter as the Minister and I do not think he received any such assurance.I met the representatives of Tesco and Power Supermarkets on the same day as the Minister and I was not reassured by what I was told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What written assurances did the Minister receive on the method of distribution and the Irish buying office?  The Minister has given us vague assurances.  They feel and sound good but they are not for real.  In one of the Saturday newspapers the Minister stated that he was meeting <Col N="12" /> Tesco representatives again.  If the Minister was assured by what he had already heard, why is he seeking reassurance?</P>
    <P>Ireland has been ill-served by the Minister's judgment on this matter.  If he has not seen fit to ask his officials to lodge a complaint with the European Commission under the merger controls, it will feel that there are no grounds on which it can act.  I support the views of IBEC, RGDATA and other groups who are voicing concerns in public.</P>

      <P>In respect of water-tight provisions, the Irish Government sat down with Tesco who have given firm, solid commitments which include some very important ones, such as to have a buying office in Ireland, to enhance the amount of resources the company puts into working with Irish suppliers to ensure that they, in turn, can increase the volume of sales in the Irish market.  Tesco has agreed to bench-mark those commitments and agreed to their regular auditing, to ensure demonstrable progress in increasing sales of Irish suppliers.  Tesco has that firm commitment, in addition to another related to elements of a development programme devised specifically for Irish suppliers which includes elements of management development, mentoring and so on.  Furthermore, company representatives engaged in discussions with Forbairt and An Bord Bia on which very significant progress <Col N="13" /> has been made.  Representatives of Forbairt were in the United Kingdom last week developing those proposals.  I am confident we shall obtain substantive proposals to the benefit of Irish suppliers.</P>
      <P>It is only right that the concerns expressed by many, including Deputy O'Rourke, that Tesco honour the terms of the Groceries Order &mdash; in respect of which the company has given a voluntary commitment &mdash; be addressed to ensure there will be no-below cost selling or unfair competition in the processes undertaken by the company.These are solid commitments which will guarantee the development of Irish sub-supply in this area.</P>
      <P>Whenever businesses are established here, in the nature of business, it is not possible to stipulate criteria the Deputy might like to see binding a party for all time.  We are in a changing business world within which businesses change and will have to evolve and grow.  However, in so far as we can obtain clear, firm commitments, they have been secured.  I engaged in discussions with Tesco to ensure we obtained substantive proposals underpinning those commitments.  I intend to ensure that we do.  Substantial progress has been made already and I foresee us obtaining substantive proposals.</P>

      <P>The day the Minister agreed to issue a joint press statement with Tesco was the day on which he undermined the public good in respect of this matter.  It was a grave political mistake for him to engage with Tesco, in a joint press statement, welcoming this merger, in other words &ldquo;selling the pass&rdquo; on his very first meeting with the company.  I do not know why the Minister did so, I was most surprised at this action.  In so doing, he did not fulfil his ministerial remit and it was a grave political mistake against the public interest.</P>
      <P>Does he agree the most important issue amidst all of the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor or soft words being addressed to him by the company is that there is no ground for explaining the absence of any guarantee that Quinnsworth-Crazy Prices &mdash; which company had 15 per cent only of &ldquo;own brand&rdquo; on its shelves &mdash; will be taken over by a company carrying 50 per cent &ldquo;own brand&rdquo; products, thereby cutting margins substantially, picking and choosing among suppliers.  I am well aware that, as times change, challenges come to the fore but the Minister failed to meet that challenge.It appears his officials were overwhelmed by Tesco representatives on the day they visited the Minister's Department.  Why did the Minister issue a joint statement following that first meeting rather than hold his brief close to his chest, make a strong point and continue to emphasise what he wanted to see done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have absolutely no plans to impose limits on market share controlled by any one company in the retail grocers trade, nor in any other sector of the economy.</P>
      <P>The Competition Acts 1991 and 1996 do not adopt such an approach nor does the competition law of the European Union.  The approach favoured by domestic and European legislation in this area concerns abuse of dominance.  Section 5 of the Competition Act, 1991 outlaws the abuse of a dominant position.  In 1996, I strengthened the Competition Act, 1991 by giving substantial enforcement powers to the Competition Authority, the power of self-initiation and, also, expanded their professional staff.  Abuse of a dominant position is now subject to substantial criminal and civil sanctions.</P>
      <P>The imposition of limits on market share, as suggested in the Deputy's question, would be anti-competitive and contrary to the Single Market.Such limits would also constrain the capacity of businesses to grow to their potential and be hostile to business development; they would be inimical to consumer interests arising from reduced competition and undoubtedly promote inefficiencies.  The imposition of limits on market would be a retrograde step.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of dominance within the Irish retail sector does not arise at present, there is no party dominance but there is a large number of suppliers within that sector.  If and when a party became dominant and abused that position, it would be subject to competition law. That is the approach adopted in Irish law following on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty; in other words, it is not an offence for a company to grow large by successful business conduct but it is an offence for it to abuse that position.  That is a very clear line drawn in Irish law and is the correct approach we should adopt in respect of matters such as these.</P>

      <P>How does this differ from the Statoil take-over of Jet about which the Minister expressed concern last year in relation to market dominance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Statoil case differs considerably from this case.  In the first instance, it fell to be considered within Irish law, not within EU competence.  Secondly, Statoil proposed to enhance the market share of an individual player. That issue was a cause of considerable concern. This case is not proposing to enhance the market share of an individual company but rather a new company is taking over an existing company.  The prime issue is that it falls into competence outside the State and does not fall for competence here. The approach adopted in Ireland of banning abuse of dominant position is the correct one.  It ensures we have a vibrant and competitive market where companies can compete fairly and succeed.Equally, if, for example, Quinnsworth or Tesco propose to acquire further market share, as in the case of Statoil, that would fall due for assessment under Irish law, if the company they were proposing to acquire fell below the thresholds.In other words, the expansion by merger is restricted in Irish law but the expansion by good business is not restricted unless the person involved abuses a dominant position.</P>

These are solemn commitments to Government.  No company of the nature of Tesco, who is seeking to make a future in the Irish market, is likely to ignore such commitments.  I am confident the commitments being made and which are being underpinned by agreements entered into with Forbairt and An Bord Bia will be substantial and real.

Naturally Forbairt, representing the development side of support to Irish producers, and An Bord Bia, representing the marketing support to Irish producers, would be well placed to develop the details of such programmes to ensure they are effective.  Also, they have worked out the volume of purchases being <Col N="17" /> secured by Quinnsworth from Irish suppliers and are agreeing targets for the future which, in turn, could be benchmarked to see the progress being made.  It is important that Forbairt and An Bord Bia act <i>in loco</i> of individual small sub-suppliers to ensure the systems developed are real, substantive and worthwhile.</P>

Irish Life is subject to financial supervision in accordance with the insurance Acts, 1909 to 1990, in common with other direct insurers.  In accordance with the requirements of those Acts and the Regulations made under them, Irish Life demonstrates on an annual basis that it is solvent.

In the course of that question I asked if he would seek to intervene, bearing in mind on the last occasion he told me he would not intervene &ldquo;right now&rdquo;.  Given that ten weeks have elapsed will he seek to intervene in a case where 360 mature people are out of work?  Since they are continuing to stay out of work and are not satisfied with points put to them there must <Col N="18" /> be some fault on the other side.  That was the matter on which I sought to table the question and I would be pleased to elicit an answer from either of the two assiduously reading Ministers opposite.</P>

      <P>I am.  The subject matter of the dispute has been before the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission.  It might be regarded as a surprise that the proposals that emerged from the Labour Relations Commission, on its own initiative, were not successful.  That they were not successful is indicative of the depth of feeling on the part of the people in dispute. Having utilised the machinery established by the State, it is regrettable the dispute is proving intractable.  I ask both parties to the dispute to make a final effort, either to avail of the resources of the State machinery, in terms of a dispute resolution, or the employer labour conference.  In either case it is time to bring the dispute to an end.  Both parties have a responsibility to do that and certainly the State machinery is available to assist them in any positive direction.</P>

I would be glad if the Minister of State would convey to his fellow party member, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, that the workers who have been out for ten weeks are not receiving social welfare.  It will be recalled that special regulations were made for Irish Press and Dunnes Stores workers.  In both those cases there was a dispute as to whether staff were locked out, sent out or whatever but in any event special social welfare regulations were made whereby they could enter into the social welfare code.  That has not been done for Irish Life staff.  I tabled a Special Notice Question and sought to raise a question on the Adjournment, both of which were not allowed.  I ask the Minister of State if his colleague would see fit to bring in special social welfare regulations to deal with this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a meeting with the committee representing the former Irish Steel workers on 11 March 1997 to discuss re-adaptation aid.  Since then I have carefully considered the issue and I have recently been in correspondence with the chairman of the committee on the matter.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the EU re-adaptation aid approved by the EU Commission &mdash; 627,000 ECU for 209 former Irish Steel workers &mdash; represents the best possible aid available and is a significant improvement on the original offer from the EU Commission in terms of the amount available, the conditions of payment and the number of workers eligible.  I am also satisfied that the extra statutory redundancy payments received by the former Irish Steel workers constitute the matching funding requirement.  This concurs with the EU Commission's position and with the position which pertained in 1985-86 when former Irish Steel workers also received re-adaptation aid.  In these circumstances, the question of additional matching funding does not arise.</P>
      <P>The re-adaptation aid funding was recently received by my Department from the European Commission and arrangements are being finalised to make the payments to the 209 eligible former workers immediately.  Each former worker will receive 3,000 ECU which, using the appropriate exchange rate, amounts to £2,175.80.</P>

      <P>The committee put its views on the matter to me.  I assessed those views and have satisfied myself that these are the maximum terms available.  Under the 1991 agreement between the European Commission and the Irish Government, the maximum re-adaptation aid payable is 3,000 ECU and the maximum amount is being paid in this case.  That is a considerable improvement on the original EU Commission offer of 2,000 ECU per worker.  It is also an improvement in that it is paid in a lump sum rather than over a 15 to 18 month period.  The Deputy will be aware there was a dispute about the matching funding.  However, the precedent is clear and the extra statutory redundancy paid in 1985-86 was the matching funding.  That is the approach that was adopted in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 12 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on human resource development is one of the key national strategy papers that will constitute the framework and focus for employment policy into the next century.  I am anxious, therefore, to ensure that the strategies and actions proposed in the White Paper are cohesive and realistic.  The process of consultation, analysis and drafting has been lengthy and time consuming.  I have circulated the draft White Paper to my colleagues and the Government is currently considering the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the White Paper is to enhance competitiveness by developing the potential and skills of our human resources.  The White Paper aims to promote in-company training, recognising that the development of those in employment is vital if companies are to remain competitive in this age of technological advancement.It also contains strategies aimed at ensuring an innovative training system which operates to world class standards, and strategies designed to integrate the unemployed into jobs through effective progression routes.</P>
      <P>In the course of preparing the White Paper I engaged in a lengthy process of consultation with many groups and organisations which have had an interest in the development of our human resources.  I have met the board of F¡S, employer and worker representatives and many others to discuss various aspects of the White Paper.  From the outset I recognised that the practical experience and expertise of these interests would be invaluable in planning a new human resource development policy which will bring us into the next century.  I am satisfied due recognition has been given to the views received during the process of consultation.</P>
      <P>When the Government reaches a decision on the proposals, I will make them known to the public and I will implement the proposals in consultation with all concerned parties.</P>

      <P>It is the current Government that is miserable.  The T·naiste, Deputy Spring, says he has a misery list.  One thing the Minister can never call me is miserable, whatever about members of the Government. The Minister promised the White Paper in January 1995 and, in his best dilatory tradition in doing business, two years and four months have elapsed.  Will legislation be required to implement the proposals in the discussion document which the Minister brought to Cabinet?</P>

The Deputy will have an opportunity to discuss the issues involved in the House.  Many of the proposals will coincide with her own view of the approach that needs to be taken to human resources development to ensure we continue to be to the forefront in skills development in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am but no organisation is beyond change and improvement.  The purpose of the White Paper is to take a step back from the day to day operations of a specific organisation and to look at the strategic directions that we need to take.  It will indicate initiatives and the directions on which we should focus attention. <Col N="23" /> Changes will follow from this.  The Deputy's question, therefore, is not focused correctly.  In developing proposals, it is not a question of being unhappy with a particular organisation but of wishing to be up to date with modern developments in this area.  There is no doubt that in the 21st century it will be human resources issues and the way it organises skills that will set a country apart in terms of competitiveness rather than the traditional fixed plant and machinery.</P>

      <P>Land in IDA Ireland ownership is largely sold to client companies of the IDA and Forbairt as part of a package to promote industrial development and to create industrial undertakings, either foreign or indigenous, which will provide employment, in accordance with the Industrial Development Acts, 1986 to 1995.  In addition, land swops with local authorities are agreed when this is in the interest of the different development mandates of both organisations. Land is also sometimes disposed of to support industrial infrastructure as, for example, to the ESB for the provision of electricity sub-stations. In these circumstances, the issue of public auction does not arise.</P>

      <P>I tabled this question because of what I came across in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, last week.  This is also the subject of another question on the Order Paper in the name of another Deputy for written reply.  I was surprised to learn that land which had been intended to be used for the purpose of industrial development was privately sold without anybody in the area being aware of it.  Will the Minister agree that it is an unacceptable practice that land in the possession of a public body should be sold on this basis?</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority may dispose of land in its ownership in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Development Acts, 1986 to 1995, section 16 of which provides that, for the purpose of facilitating the provision of sites or premises for the establishment, development or maintenance of an industrial undertaking, the IDA may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of property vested in the Authority.That is what occurred in this instance.  The IDA was approached in respect of a proposal for a recycling industry which the company involved proposed to develop.  The IDA agreed to the sale subject to planning permission which was granted by Roscommon County Council and subsequently appealed to An Bord Plean·la.  I understand the board has found in favour of the company and the IDA is bound by its contractual commitments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal was assessed by the IDA which judged that it was an industrial undertaking within the meaning of the Act which governs its activities.  I understand it is a recycling industry, the purpose of which is to manufacture particular products for sale.  The IDA does not see its role as that of a planning authority deciding environmental and amenity issues which are raised subsequently.  The planning authority was Roscommon County Council which supported the application as did An Bord Plean·la on appeal.  I am aware of the considerable concerns expressed locally but the issues fall to be examined by the board and the county council.  That is where they were examined and decisions taken.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it will be much more difficult to market the remaining IDA land at this location because it seems this particular facility, worthy though it is, is not appropriate to an industrial park? Will he agree it has been opposed by one of the major companies in the area because it believes it is incompatible with its product?  That being the case, what plans does the IDA have for the remainder of the land?  Will the Minister accept that it will be more difficult for it to find suitable projects?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have specific answers to those questions but it is my understanding that the board and the county council, in their decisions, have deemed that the proposal and the way the industry will be run as a business are in compliance with the industrial designation of the land and, given the restrictions agreed, as set out in the planning Acts, are in the best interest of the development of the area.  Clearly, they have expressed satisfaction with what has been proposed and will enforce the conditions which have been attached to the planning permission to ensure the industry is operated in such a manner that it will not damage the amenity or adjoining lands or the opportunity to develop other industrial activities.</P>

The IDA is bound by the contractual commitments it made to the company involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the statement issued on my visit to Galway early last month in the context of the announcement for Boston Scientific Corporation, IDA Ireland has been asked to press ahead with the implementation of a new regional policy for employment growth in location outside of the larger urban centres.  However, I should emphasise that this policy stems entirely from the statutory obligation IDA has under the Industrial Development Act, 1986, to foster the national objective of regional industrial development.</P>
      <P>The new IDA Ireland policy is as follows: financial incentives will now be biased in favour of smaller regional locations, with higher grant levels, as appropriate, in each individual case; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations and, working in partnership with local authorities, to have available quality serviced sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.  In addition, the IDA will devote additional resources at senior executive level to oversee this new focus.</P>
      <P>This announcement was made against a background where Dublin has been fortunate to secure a large proportion of inward investment over the last number of years.  The record growth for 1996 reported by IDA Ireland in terms of its national performance is substantially due to the exceptional capability of the eastern region to attract such a high proportion of mobile investment.This region now incorporates one of the major high technology business environments in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 the net growth in jobs in companies supported by the industrial development agencies in Dublin was 6,014, an improvement on the 1995 performance of 4,789 and dramatically ahead of the 1994 figure of 1,140.  According to the annual series of CSO labour force surveys average annual employment growth in Dublin during the period April 1994-April 1996, at 19,300 per years, was four times that of the previous two years, while the average annual rate of jobs growth in the Dublin region during the same period at 5.2 per cent was well ahead of the job <Col N="26" /> growth rate nationally, 4.4 per cent, over the same period.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement of enhanced IDA incentives is not in any way intended to, nor will it, disadvantage Dublin or any other major population centre in Ireland in attracting new inward investment.  It is an attempt to improve the attractiveness of some of the major regional location which have not directly benefited from the success of the IDA's efforts in recent years.</P>
    <P>Specific incentives will have the greatest effect with smaller investors whose needs can be fully realised in a smaller community rather than in major population centres.  In any one year IDA Ireland would interact with a number of smaller entities without the absolute requirements of a large sub-supply base or need for immediate access to, for example, a third level institution or an international airport.  It makes total sense from the perspective of such clients to locate within a community of appropriate scale and capability to suit its needs.</P>
    <P>The impact and resultant benefit to a regional community of such an investment is equally positive.The recent announcement was an attempt to highlight and promote the inclusive industrial policy of the Government.  Our emphasis is to ensure that firms locate in areas which cater for their range of requirements and in the process facilitate balanced industrial and employment growth across the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister's announcement was welcomed by people in areas outside Dublin it incensed Dublin Deputies from all parties.  I am sure he has learnt the lesson that announcements do not always have the effect one wishes.  I would welcome a restatement of the provisions of the 1950s IDA legislation.  There are huge pockets in large urban centres which have not benefited from the Celtic tiger syndrome.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the IDA grant system will be biased in favour of smaller regional locations, with higher grants, as appropriate, paid in individual cases.  What guidelines will be used in determining the level of grant payable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the guidelines will be flexible.  The IDA does not publish negotiating guidelines.  It would not be in the interests of the IDA or the country to publish these guidelines as they contain material which may be used by our competitors in the race to attract mobile investment.  Not only is there a bias in terms of the grant level but more resources have been allocated to pursuing such investment. In recent times there has been some growth in the number of mobile engineering projects which are suitable to regional locations.  In addition to creating the environment in local regions to attract inward investment, we are also successfully focusing on mobile investment suitable to those regions.  By adopting this two-pronged approach I am confident we can deliver results. We have seen results in counties Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan and other locations in recent months.</P>

      <P>I would reiterate the views of others, particularly the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, that there is no necessity for any enterprise to engage the services of others, especially those who require an upfront fee, in making application for grant support or any other form of assistance provided by the European Union.</P>
      <P>I would advise any company seeking information about eligibility for an EU grant or any form of assistance from public funds to go the direct route of approaching one of the State bodies such as the county enterprise board in their area or Forbairt to seek advice about funding sources.</P>
      <P>A good start for any interested business would be to call the Enterprise Link on 1850 35 33 33. This service, which is operated by Forbairt staff and which can be accessed by members of the public from anywhere in the country for the price of a local telephone call, provides information and advice on a range of EU and State-backed schemes to promote the establishment and development of small business.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently updating its information leaflet for small business which will provide easily accessible information and contact points.  The agencies of my Department are participating in a series of nationwide briefings which are currently being organised by the regional authorities in conjunction with the EU Structural Funds Information Office.  These information days will provide the general public, students, business and interested groups with up-to-date information on all types of EU financial support. The format for the days will include an exhibition and workshops.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if giving telephone numbers in the D·il is the proper way to deal with this problem.  Such hoaxes have been perpetrated by companies in Portugal, Switzerland and Nigeria.  While I accept that it should be a case of <i>caveat emptor</i>, these companies put persuasive cases to firms that they are eligible for funding about which they did not know and that they can obtain it faster for them.  This problem has been going on for the past two years.  I understood from a statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on television that there would be liaison with the Garda fraud office to ensure that such cases were dealt with in a firmer way.  However, there does not seem to have any increase in the protection afforded to companies against such fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> In a related case many people, including me, were asked to send business cards to a terminally ill child in the UK.  The Royal Mail received millions of cards but there was no such child. However, that is a related issue and my concern relates to firms which are losing money.

      <P>The bulk of the companies brought to the attention of my Department are not operating illegally.  However, they are offering a service which is not worth paying for and, in that sense, are obtaining money which wise investors would not pay.  To the extent that there are reports on such cases, most people have expressed dissatisfaction with the services of the company they engaged, which did little more than provide them with application forms they could have got elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy's previous question, I share his concern about proposed developments in the companies concerned.  As also indicated then, Ireland is not immune from the pressures of open market competition and we must expect a certain level of negative as well as positive change in the numbers employed in individual companies as they react and adjust to these pressures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent announcement of an additional 129 jobs in Pauwels Trafo in Cavan town is, however, a positive development for the area and, to enhance the attractiveness of the area to potential investors, IDA Ireland is progressing the following developments from within its property budget.  Negotiations have recently concluded between Cavan County Council and IDA Ireland to acquire a 40 acre site in Cavan town.  IDA Ireland intends to make an application for planning permission for site development works on the 40 acre site for the development of a new business park in Cavan town &mdash; the application for planning permission will be submitted in the near future.  A privately <Col N="29" /> financed advance factory will be constructed on the business park.  Tendering for this work is expected to commence shortly.</P>
    <P>On 3 March last the Taoiseach announced that the Carton Group, which currently employs over 400 people in various locations in Cavan and throughout the country, was approved for assistance by Forbairt towards an expansion of its activities.  This expansion will enable the group to compete effectively with imports in a highly competitive free trade environment and to increase its penetration of export markets.  The success of this strategic investment is crucial to the future of the whole Carton Group.  This development plan is projected to increase group employment by approximately 100 over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Last week I announced the creation of 315 jobs in 11 different companies in the north-east region. The total Forbairt backed regional investment in new and expanding industry is approximately £10 million.  One of the companies involved is Foamalite Limited, Lough Gowan, County Cavan.  This was established in January 1997 and produces freefoam PVC sheeting for sale in both the Irish and UK markets.  It will employ 38 people in Lough Gowna.</P>
    <P>These are examples of positive industrial developments in County Cavan.  I recognise the need for this positive trend to continue and be reinforced in the county.  I have asked the development agencies under my Department to do everything they can to exploit all opportunities that arise for further development and employment creation.  Allied to projected growth in tourism and other service sectors, I am confident that recent losses will be more than offset by job gains in the period immediately ahead.</P>

      <P>I have noted the findings of a recent survey by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, and of a similar survey by the Small Firms Association, in relation to the recruitment of employees by member companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following these reports, I asked my Department to initiate a process that would investigate the precise position concerning recruitment patterns.Accordingly, my Department convened meetings with F¡S, ISME and the SFA.  It was agreed that both SFA and ISME would circulate questionnaires to their member companies seeking details and specifications of all existing vacancies.In respect of each completed questionnaire the following process is being followed. Each company listed is being contacted by the local F¡S representatives.  Companies that indicated no vacancies are also being contacted to determine if their views assist this process.  All vacancies listed are being considered by F¡S and possible candidates submitted to the companies. <Col N="30" /> All candidates are being tracked to establish if they were suitable for calling for interview and if not, why not.  If called for interview, did they attend?  How did they perform?  If offered a position, did they accept or turn up and, if not, why not.  If they took up a position, how did they perform?</P>
    <P>This exercise, which is currently in progress, should be completed in a matter of weeks.  It will be a valuable exercise for all concerned in establishing proper empirical evidence on recruitment patterns.  It should also foster a better understanding between employers, their representative bodies, F¡S and potential employees of the various opportunities and threats that exist in a dynamic labour market.</P>

      <P>The association's main remarks centred on its recruitment difficulties.  I would not agree with some of the remarks but, nonetheless, they reflect the views of the business organisation in regard to recruitment difficulties.  The Department's response is to obtain empirical evidence of the nature of those recruitment difficulties.  It will focus on the reality on the ground rather than the more colourful descriptions of the reality we have heard in this debate.  The progress being made in the survey we are currently conducting in a systematic way with both of the small firms associations should highlight the real evidence which will be useful for the future.  I will not be led into commenting on some of the colourful phraseology used.</P>

      <P>While the Minister's survey is welcome, will he not accept it is the tax wedge that makes it unattractive for so many to take up work?  In the light of what the Minister for Finance confirmed here two weeks ago, that a person earning £167 per week lost £10 per week when they got a £20 per week pay increase, will the Minister accept that the manner in which the tax and welfare systems operate, particularly in relation to low pay, act as a disincentive for people to take up jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this has always been a problem in the economy. She will also recognise that considerable progress has been made in this regard.  For example, the tax burden on the average industrial wage has been reduced by five percentage points, in other words, the net take from average wages is down five points.  That is a considerable reduction in the tax wedge for PAYE workers.  In addition, the employers' PRSI element has been reduced, with two-thirds of employees now on the new low rate of employers' PRSI.  They are significant changes, <Col N="31" /> the benefit of which we have seen in the strong employment growth.  On the other side of that equation, the Minister for Social Welfare introduced a number of schemes that have assisted those people who faced disincentives to going back to work.  For example, the family income supplement has been substantially improved and over 20,000 people are currently availing of the back to work allowance scheme.  These initiatives are working to remove those disincentives for many people on low pay.  I am aware also that approximately 37 per cent of the people recruited by IDA and Forbairt companies were previously unemployed.  There is a significant flow in the numbers coming off unemployment registers and unemployed people are benefiting from the creation of job opportunities.  That is clear in the falling levels of unemployment.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent statement from a major insurance company of a projected steep increase in motor insurance premia; his views on such an increase at a time of very low inflation; and if he will make a statement on the way in which he proposes to deal with this matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns regarding possible increases in motor insurance costs particularly during a sustained period of low inflation in the economy and the fact that non-life insurance business is, in general, a profitable pursuit.  I recently met both the Irish Insurance Federation and the market leader.  While it is true the industry has suffered underwriting losses for many years and traditionally, insurers will aim for underwriting break-even, this target is seldom if ever achieved by most insurance companies. Exceptionally, both Guardian PMPA and Hibernian insurance company recorded underwriting profits in the Insurance Annual Report for 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on insurance costs suggested that the Supervisory Authority might review the relevancy of investment income in the context of insurance premium levels and underwriting targets set by the insurance industry.The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that, in aiming for underwriting break-even, insurers may be setting premium levels without taking into account their overall profitability when investment returns are taken into account.  In making this conclusion Deloitte &amp; Touche referred to the 1982 MacLiam report into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance which addressed, <i>inter alia</i>, the treatment of investment income by insurers in their accounts and by the supervisory authority in its examination of these accounts. The MacLiam report was critical of the rule of thumb adopted by the National Prices Commission at that time that underwriting break-even should be the main criterion in establishing premium rates.  The report argued very cogently that investment income was as much a part of an insurance company's income as its premium <Col N="32" /> income and that it was unsound practice, in principle, to separate the results of a company's underwriting account from the results of its investment activities.</P>
    <P>The recommendation in that report, that investment income should be taken into account, should be examined, and I have asked my Department to undertake this examination.  In this regard it is noteworthy that the Annual Insurance Report for 1995 shows motor insurance business for some companies, who are major underwriters, to be profitable with premium and investment income considerably exceeding underwriting losses.  This outcome would suggest that this class of business may be considerably healthier as a class of business than Government and the Insurance Supervisory Authority had previously been led to believe.</P>
    <P>The level of investment income varies from company to company, reflecting differences in investment strategy, mix of business and market share, with some smaller insurers failing to earn sufficient income on their claims reserves to offset their underwriting losses.  Nevertheless, the preliminary indications are that, overall, the motor insurance industry is showing a surplus of investment income over underwriting loss over the ten year period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the more immediate issue of further increases in motor insurance premia in the course of 1997, I recently met representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation and Guardian/ PMPA, who underwrite the largest share of the Irish motor market and who issued the statement on possible further increase in premia alluded to by the Deputy.  On foot of these discussions I understand the insurers claims experience has improved somewhat in respect of the first quarter of this year.  As a result, that company has now assured the Minister that no further general increases in motor insurance premium rates are envisaged provided the improving trend continues.I hope other insurers will also take account of developments in their assessment of premium rate levels in the coming months.  While recognising that insurers may need to make adjustments in claims provisioning to reflect increases in frequency and cost of claims, likewise any favourable developments in relation to reduced claims frequency and in returns on investment of premium income should be taken into account in the ongoing assessment of premium rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the huge increase in the volume of traffic on the roads one would have thought that, instead of substantially increasing insurance premia, insurance companies would be reducing them.  Could the Minister not do anything other than just exhorting other insurance companies to adopt a more realistic approach? What is the present position regarding the much-vaunted proposition that the courts system should be changed and a tribunal set up to deal with insurance claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is increased traffic on the roads and buoyancy in the motor market as a <Col N="33" /> result of the very positive state of the economy. However, insurers argue that is a contributory factor to the increase in the number of accidents and claims in recent times.</P>
      <P>On the question of exhorting insurers to adopt a more realistic approach, I suggest to Deputy Ahern that I have done more than that.  I met the leading player in the market place, GRE, the company that made the public remarks about an anticipated further increase of 5 per cent this year.  They have assured me they do not now believe an increase will be warranted, and that it is not envisaged that such an increase will apply.</P>
      <P>On the question of changing the courts system, what Deputy Ahern is referring to is the fact that the Deloitte &amp; Touche report recommended the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal where liability is not contested.  Such a tribunal would provide speedier, more flexible and cheaper access to a disputes resolution mechanism outside the formal courts structure.  On receipt of the report in question I put in place an expert group to advise me on the establishment of that personal injuries tribunal.  I understand I will get the expert group's report later this week and that it recommends a mechanism for the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal where liability is not contested.  It is the intention of the Government to act on that as speedily as it can.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister exhort GRE to make any special provision for young drivers who face huge insurance costs which have got to such a pitch that insurance costs them more than a car?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with this a number of times in the House.  The position relating to young drivers is an inherently more difficult one. Insurance companies simply argue that the premia which young drivers attract are a direct reflection of the claims pattern, and the claims pattern for young drivers everywhere is notoriously higher than for other age groups.  In Ireland this is particularly the case.  In fact Ireland, for some reason, is disproportionately severe on the imposition of high premia on young drivers because of the claims pattern.  With the Minister for the Environment, I am seeking to do a number of things along the lines of the Ontario model of which I have spoken on a number of occasions, and generally trying to encourage greater safety because the insurance industry will simply provide prudentially for anticipated claims from young drivers.  As a result they are loaded more severely than drivers in other categories.</P>

The order has been prepared on the basis of an agreement reached with the Whips, including the Progressive Democrats Whip.

On behalf of 3,000 public health workers who are on strike, I wish to register my protest that, as Opposition spokesperson on health, I have been refused permission to raise the matter by way of Private Notice Question because it is deemed by the Ceann Comhairle not to be urgent or important.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any specific legislation promised, but as the Deputy will be aware, a charter of rights for victims of crime, which deals in particular with the rights of rape victims, has been published on a non-statutory basis.  The important provisions of that charter should be given an opportunity to work.  As the Minister stated, there are a number of reasons for the under-reporting of rape cases in this and other jurisdictions, some of which can be dealt with by statutory means and others which, unfortunately, <Col N="38" /> are not susceptible to being dealt with in that way alone.</P>

      <P>45.  That D·il …ireann approves the terms of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their member states, of the one part, and the State of Israel, of the other part, which has been laid before the D·il on 31 May 1996.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>46.  That D·il …ireann approves the terms of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Morocco, of the other part, which has been laid before the D·il on 31 May 1996.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>47.  That D·il …ireann approves the terms of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their member states, acting within the framework of the European Union, of the one part, <Col N="46" /> and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part, which has been laid before the D·il on 12 February 1997.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>48.  That D·il …ireann approves the terms of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the European Communities and their member states, of the one part, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, of the other part, which has been laid before the D·il on 12 February 1997.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>D·il approval of the terms of these agreements is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution which stipulates that &ldquo;The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D·il …ireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum setting out the terms of the agreements has been provided for the information of Deputies through the Whips' offices.  Copies of the agreements have been laid before the D·il on 31 May 1996 in the case of Israel and Morocco, and on 12 February 1997 in the case of Slovenia and Uzbekistan.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper on Foreign Policy which I brought before the D·il in March last year, the Government identified a number of major challenges facing the European Union as it moves towards the 21st century.  Among these is the challenge to the Union of equipping itself to play a role commensurate with its responsibilities on the European continent and in the wider family of nations, in pursuit of its essential interests and in the furtherance of its most fundamental values. Many of the issues associated with equipping the Union to play this role are under discussion among member states at the current Intergovernmental conference; the agreements before the D·il today are a practical expression of the Union's willingness to assume such a role.</P>
    <P>The agreements are of different kinds, reflecting the complexity and variety which now characterise the Union's relations with third countries.  The agreements with Israel and Morocco are Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements and arise in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which was adopted at Barcelona in November 1995.  The Euro-Mediterranean process involving the Union and 12 Mediterranean partners is intended to support the Mediterranean countries in their efforts progressively to transform their region into a zone of peace, stability and prosperity.  Bilateral agreements between the Union and the individual Mediterranean partners are complementary to the multilateral framework of the Euro-Mediterranean process.  In addition to their other provisions, the association agreements are essential to the gradual construction of the EU-Mediterranean free trade area by the target date of 2010 which is a central part of the Euro-Mediterranean process.</P>
    <P>The completion of the network of bilateral association agreements between the Union and its Mediterranean partners is now well under way. In addition to the agreement with Tunisia, which was approved by D·il …ireann in December last <Col N="47" /> year, and the agreements now before the House, an interim Association Agreement has also been concluded with the PLO on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.  A draft agreement has been initialled with Jordan and negotiations are at an advanced stage with Egypt and Lebanon.  A negotiating mandate has been agreed in the case of Algeria and preliminary talks have taken place with Syria.  The importance of concluding at an early stage the network of bilateral agreements was emphasised on all sides at the Euro-Mediterranean follow-up meeting I attended in Malta last week.</P>
    <P>The agreement with Slovenia is a Europe Agreement.  As such, the agreement acknowledges the European vocation of Slovenia and its wish to play a full part in the process of European integration.  Slovenia participates already in the Union's pre-accession strategy for the Associated States of central and eastern Europe and has applied for membership of the Union.  As the House will recall, Europe Agreements have already been concluded with nine other central and eastern European countries and these have been approved by D·il …ireann at various stages between 1992 and 1996, most recently when the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were before the House.  The Europe Agreements with Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have already entered into effect.</P>
    <P>The Agreement with Uzbekistan is a Partnership and Co-operation Agreement.  Agreements of this kind, or PCAs as they are called, were initiated by the Union following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  As their name indicates, PCAs are intended to assist the newly independent states, in partnership and co-operation with the European Union, in meeting the challenges of fundamental political and economic reform.  D·il …ireann approved Partnership and Co-operation Agreements with nine newly independent states, including Russia and Ukraine, in May last year.  I advised the House at that stage that it was the aim of the Union, circumstances permitting, to conclude PCAs with all of the former Soviet Republics in due course.  A further PCA, with Turkmenistan, is under negotiation.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, a note on the agreements for the information of Deputies has already been circulated.I have also indicated that the various types of agreement: Euro-Mediterranean Agreements, Europe Association Agreement and Partnership and Co-operation Agreement, their content and background, will be familiar to Deputies, having been discussed in detail on previous occasions in the House.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements, arising from the decisions of the European Council at Lisbon in 1992, and at Essen in 1994, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, involving the 15 EU and 12 Mediterranean partners &mdash; Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority, was initiated at Barcelona in November 1995.  The declaration adopted at the meeting established a <Col N="48" /> comprehensive partnership between the participants through strengthened and regular political dialogue, the development of economic and financial co-operation and greater emphasis on the social, cultural and human dimension.  The partnership is based on a common commitment to respect for international law, human rights and democratic principles.  In the economic field the Union has expressed its readiness to support the harmonious development of the region.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with the individual Mediterranean partners are wide-ranging and cover political dialogue, the progressive liberalisation of trade and capital movements and sectoral co-operation.  Relations between the parties are to be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles.  The trade liberalisation elements of these bilateral agreements will constitute important preparatory steps towards the realisation of the eventual Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area which is envisaged in the Barcelona Declaration.  In the case of Israel, free trade in industrial goods with the Union is already in place on the basis of the 1975 EC-Israel Co-operation Agreement.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Agreement with Israel are the provision of an appropriate framework for political dialogue and, in the economic sphere: the reciprocal liberalisation of the right of establishment; further progressive liberalisation of public procurement; free movement of capital; intensification of co-operation in science and technology; encouragement of regional co-operation with a view to the consolidation of peaceful co-existence and economic and social stability; and the promotion of co-operation in other areas of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides for the reinforcement of the existing free trade area between the Community and Israel subject to WTO disciplines. Appropriate anti-dumping and safeguard measures are provided for.  Although restrictions on sensitive agricultural produce will remain, the Community and Israel shall progressively establish a greater liberalisation of their trade in agricultural products of interest to both parties.</P>
    <P>The parties agree to widen the scope of the agreement to cover the right of establishment and the provision of services.  The agreement also contains provisions relating to capital movements, payments, public procurement, competition and intellectual property.  There are detailed arrangements set out in the agreement for intensifying scientific and technological co-operation.  The agreement contains provision for wide-ranging sectoral co-operation, including regional and industrial co-operation and co-operation with regard to agriculture, financial services, standards, customs, environment, energy, information structures and telecommunications, transport, tourism, drugs and money laundering.</P>
    <P>The agreement with Morocco has similar objectives.  These are: to provide a framework for political dialogue; to lay the foundations for the progressive liberalisation of trade in goods and services as well as capital movements; to ensure the development of balanced economic and social exchange and, in particular, to pursue the goal of <Col N="49" /> Morocco's development; to encourage intra-regional co-operation; and to promote economic, social, cultural and financial co-operation.</P>
    <P>Political dialogue between the parties at ministerial and official level is provided for in Article 3 of the agreement.  The objectives of such dialogue include the consolidation of security and stability throughout the Mediterranean region and in the Maghreb in particular.</P>
    <P>The agreement will establish a free trade zone in industrial products between the EU and Morocco progressively over 12 years.  Appropriate anti-dumping and safeguard measures are provided for. There are also provisions for the importation into the Community of selected agricultural and fishery products and the parties aspire to the further liberalisation of trade in agricultural and fishery products.The Agreement contains a commitment to widen its scope to include, at an unspecified date, the right of establishment and the provision of services by firms.  Provisions governing payments and competition rules to prevent market distortion are also set out.</P>
    <P>Broad ranging economic co-operation is provided for with the aim of supporting sustainable economic and social development in Morocco.  It will include regional and industrial co-operation, co-operation with regard to education and training, science and technology, the environment, investment promotion and protection, standardisation and conformity assessment, approximation of legislation, financial services, agriculture and fisheries, transport, telecommunications and information technology, energy, tourism, customs co-operation and statistics.  Specific provisions for co-operation against money laundering and in the fight against the production, supply and trafficking of drugs are included.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Mediterranean agreements with Israel and Morocco cover, in addition, the conditions attached to the movement of workers from the associated countries within the Union. They provide for non-discrimination for legally employed workers and for the co-ordination of social security systems.  This is the case also with regard to the Europe agreement with Slovenia. As a result of this and the provisions of the agreements relating to customs co-operation, which apply also in the case of the PCA with Uzbekistan, extra costs could arise to the Exchequer.  It is considered, however, that such costs will be minimal.</P>
    <P>The association agreements with Israel and Morocco are part of the bilateral component of the Euro-Mediterranean initiative of the Union. They are intended to consolidate the EU's involvement in the Middle East peace process which last year's Florence European Council declared a fundamental interest of the Union. The association agreements will complement the ongoing political and economic co-operation established at Barcelona.  The Barcelona process is an important forum for political, economic and cultural co-operation within the Middle East region and for the region's relations with the European Union.  Although not directly related to the Middle East peace process, the enterprise <Col N="50" /> is inculcating the habit of co-operation between the Mediterranean partners which is a precondition for a lasting peace settlement in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>This was clearly evident at last week's second Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting in Malta, at which I represented Ireland.  Although there were long and difficult discussions, which threatened to leave the meeting without an agreement concerning the reference to be made in conclusions to the current situation in the Middle East, the sense of common responsibility that has developed among Arabs and Israelis alike for the future of the Euro-Mediterranean process combined to ensure that the main issue was resolved. I will report to the House what I said on this developing Arab-Israeli co-responsibility in my intervention at the Malta meeting, namely, that the success achieved through the Euro-Mediterranean process in creating structures of co-operation, founded on trust and mutual respect, is an encouragement and an incentive to all concerned with the central conflict in the region.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognises the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, reflecting as it does the growing interdependence of the two regions.  It also recognises the strategic importance of the relationship between the parties for the future well-being, security and development of the EU and its Mediterranean partners.  Efforts to advance the partnership were an important priority for our Presidency of the Union.  We can recall with some pride our success in securing the adoption of the MEDA regulation under which 3.42 billion ECU is to be expended by the Union in financial co-operation with the Mediterranean partners in the period up to the end of 1999.  During our Presidency also there was an intensive schedule of events in the context of the activity programme attaching to the Barcelona Declaration, while considerable progress was made in the negotiations on the various bilateral agreements.</P>
    <P>The agreements with Israel and Morocco were signed on 20 November 1995 and 26 February 1996, respectively.  The agreements will assist in the further development of Ireland's trade and economic relations with the two countries.  In the case of Israel, trade has shown sustained growth in recent years, rising from £40 million in 1988 to £145 million in 1996.  Exports to Israel have increased more than threefold since 1992, when they stood at £33 million to £100 million last year. Main exports in 1995 were food preparations, meat and meat preparations and computer parts. Imports from Israel, mostly vegetables and fruit, fertilisers and clothing, were worth £45 million in 1996.  Exports of agricultural produce to Israel are of increasing importance, ranging from £30 million in 1994 to £44.5 million in 1995.  Exports included 12,000 tonnes of frozen boneless beef in 1995 and an estimated 13,000 tonnes in 1996. There are also a number of significant joint ventures and partnership supplier arrangements between Irish and Israeli firms, particularly in the high technology sector.</P>
    <P>In the case of Morocco, trade has also increased from £40 million in 1994 to £59 million <Col N="51" /> in 1995.  Exports increased from £11 million to £18 million and imports rose from £29 million to £41 million.  The main items exported in 1995 were general industrial machinery, essential oils, perfumes, textile yarn, power generating equipment and computers.  Main imports were fertilisers, computers, and fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>Although the Government is recommending for ratification today agreements with a number of countries, the main focus of my address will concern the association agreement with Israel because of the considerable public interest which this measure has generated, as reflected in the recent comprehensive debate on the agreement which took place at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It may be suggested that given the recent deterioration in the peace process, now is not the time to conclude an association agreement with Israel.  I will make a number of points in this respect.</P>
    <P>First, the agreement with Israel and the interim association agreement with the PLO, as well as the whole Euro-Mediterranean process, is intended to underwrite the EU's commitment to the Middle East peace process and, as stated in the Barcelona Declaration, contribute to its success, grounded in common support for the realisation of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region based on the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace.</P>
    <P>Second, the peace process is a long-term exercise which has made great strides since the Madrid conference in October 1991.  It requires courage on all sides, including ours, to make commitments and not to be deflected from our course by setbacks.  We must undertake measures, in so far as it is open to us, which will help to ensure the success of the Middle East peace process.Third, we believe the Euro-Mediterranean exercise will enable Israel to feel less threatened and more at ease with its neighbours.  The Euro-Mediterranean partnership is the only forum outside the UN which links the Union, Israel and a number of Arab states, including Syria and Lebanon which currently are not full participants in the Middle East peace process.  The Mediterranean partnership can have an important function in helping Israel develop the confidence in its neighbours which it needs to continue the peace process; boycotts and the exclusion of Israel will not achieve this.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the interim trade agreement between the EU and Israel, which gives Israel all the practical commercial benefits of the association agreement, has already been in effect since January 1996.  Ratification of the association agreement by the European Union will give it the benefits of a closer political dialogue with Israel and a basis on which to raise human rights and other concerns. The success of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Israel will, in the medium to long-term, fundamentally depend on Israel's lasting commitment to the Middle East process, particularly its Palestinian track and on Israel's upholding of acceptable standards in human rights and humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> As regards the question of Israel and the peace process, the recent Hebron agreement was a significant step that should have helped to unblock a negotiation that had been stalemated for several months.  The EU's historic side letter of assurance to President Arafat was approved by both Israel and the Palestinians.  This was the first time Israel had admitted that the EU could have a role in the negotiations between itself and the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>The Hebron agreement included a reaffirmation of Israel's commitments to move towards the full implementation of existing agreements between Israel and the PLO, including troop redeployments, free passage between Gaza and the West Bank, the realisation of major infrastructural projects in those areas, such as the Gaza port and airport, an avoidance of measures that would prejudge the permanent status negotiations and an earnest and timely resumption of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these commitments remains a priority for the EU special envoy and we hope to see action in this regard at an early date.  Unfortunately the limited deployment announced by Israel on 7 March fell well below expectations and the decision by Israel to build a new settlement at Har Homa undermined what remaining confidence the Palestinians had in the peace process and led to an upsurge in street violence.The bombing in Tel Aviv on 21 March, the first such bombing in a year, was also a grave blow to confidence on the Israeli side.</P>
    <P>I would not wish anyone to conclude that EU ratification of the association agreement represents a change in the Union's total opposition to Israel's settlements policy.  The European Council in Dublin last December stated that settlements are contrary to international law and are a major obstacle to peace.  Settlements violate the provisions of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war, which prohibit the transfer of civilian populations into occupied territory.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt that Ireland, along with its EU partners, believes that settlement construction and its attendant actions, such as the annexation and expropriation of land and the expulsion of previous inhabitants and destruction of their homes are a serious breach of humanitarian law and Palestinian human rights, and are issues which must be fully addressed in the political dialogue which will be set up with Israel under the terms of the association agreement.</P>
    <P>Israel's policy of settlement construction in Jerusalem is a particular concern.  It infringes the Fourth Geneva Convention.  It alters the demographic balance of the city to isolate and reduce its Palestinian population and to confiscate their property.  One third of what was Palestinian territory in East Jerusalem has passed into Israeli hands since this policy began to be systematically practiced after Israel gained control of Jerusalem by force in 1967.  Israel's Jerusalem policy is now being applied more intensively in the run-up to the permanent status negotiations where the issues of Jerusalem and settlements are to be dealt with.  Israel is withdrawing the Jerusalem residents permits of Palestinians on the slightest <Col N="53" /> of pretexts.  As a result of this policy the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem has fallen to 160,000 and Palestinians now constitute a minority in East Jerusalem.</P>
    <P>Israeli denial of Palestinian political rights is matched on the economic front by its continuing draconian blockade of Gaza and the West Bank. The GNP of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has plummeted; unemployment and poverty are rampant and are forming a breeding ground for extremism.</P>
    <P>The Israeli blockade is undermining the peace process in two important respects.  First, many Palestinians, seeing no visible improvement in their social and economic situation, are susceptible to calls for extremist solutions.  Thus Israel in seeking, through the blockade, to enhance its security is creating the conditions for attacks on its own citizens by disaffected and impoverished Palestinians.  Second the blockade of the territories is counteracting the substantial international donor effort, including that of the EU, and is stifling private investment which is indispensable for the establishment of a viable Palestinian economy.</P>
    <P>The Government again urges the Israeli authorities, in the words of the Dublin European Council, to remove all restrictions except where Israel's legitimate security interests are manifestly engaged, as in the case of acts of terrorism.  Economic and social development in the Palestinian territories requires first and foremost the total and rapid lifting of the blockade of the West Bank and Gaza, and of all obstacles to the free movement of persons and goods between Israel and these territories; within the West Bank and Gaza, including East Jerusalem; between them and other countries, in particular with Egypt and Jordan, in accordance with the Protocol on economic relations between Israel and the PLO, which is a part of the Declaration of Principles signed between Israel and the Palestinians in September 1993.</P>
    <P>The economic blockade is damaging the implementation of the recently adopted EC/PLO interim association agreement.  The European Council instructed the EU's special envoy to the peace process to promote concrete and immediate measures to address a number of issues concerning Palestinian social and economic development. That work is ongoing through a joint EU-Israeli mechanism led on the EU side by its special envoy.</P>
    <P>In addition to the peace process, the second major area in which the Union's political influence will be strengthened as a result of ratification of the association agreement concerns human rights and humanitarian law.  It may be suggested it is unbalanced to concentrate on Israeli practices.  There are two reasons for doing so. First, Israel considers itself as belonging to the Western democracies and wishes to be treated on the basis of its professed commitment to the highest ideals of human rights.  Israel is a state of law, as exemplified by the current controversy in that country over the appointment of a former Attorney General.  Second, Israel has occupied <Col N="54" /> foreign territory and this continues contrary to Security Council resolutions.  Israel is indisputably engaged in the violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in that territory. We are concerned at continuing incidents of unlawful imprisonment, torture and ill-treatment of detainees by Israel.  This is contrary to the provisions of the UN Convention against torture, to which Israel is a party.  The Government has expressed its concern at decisions taken by the Israeli Supreme Court in recent months that Israeli secret service investigators can use enhanced physical pressure in the questioning of Palestinian detainees.</P>
    <P>It may be asked how the provisions of the association agreement can bring about changes in Israeli policy given the shortcomings in Israel's human rights performance I have outlined.  In answer to this, I would like first to reiterate that for the Union a common adherence to the principles of democracy and respect for human rights is a fundamental prerequisite in the process of deepening relations with our Mediterranean partners.The human rights clause is now a standard provision of all new generation Euro-Mediterranean association agreements.  This clause states that relations between the parties, as well as the provisions of the agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guide their internal and international policies and constitute an essential element of the agreement.  The importance of the human rights clause and extent to which it underlines all subsequent commitments is shown by the fact that it is placed almost at the beginning of the agreement, as Article 2.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to address the scepticism expressed recently in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs concerning the effectiveness of the human rights provision in this and other agreements.  It is important to make the point that these agreements are not human rights instruments, in the sense of setting standards to which acceding states must comply, as in the case of United Nations conventions for instance. However, nothing in the association agreement with Israel, or the comparable clause in other agreements, releases the signatory state from its obligation to comply with fundamental norms of international law.  Israel is a party to the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates parties cannot in any circumstances derogate from a number of rights, such as freedom from torture.  Israel is also a signatory to the Geneva Conventions of 1949.</P>
    <P>Although not an agreement setting up human rights standards, the association agreement is important for the political leverage in respect of Israeli practices which its political dialogue provision offers the Union.  The agreement places both the EU and Israel under a treaty obligation to conduct their relations on the basis of common respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  The political dialogue established by the agreement deepens and intensifies our relations. It follows that this binds Israel into a relationship which allows the EU to engage with it on its human rights policies.  Israel's ratification of the <Col N="55" /> agreement means it must respond fully to our approaches.  I, therefore, see the agreement in a positive way: permitting the Union to bring our interests to bear on Israeli policies.</P>
    <P>The Government, like our EU partners, is determined that the human rights provisions of the new association agreements should not be window-dressing.  On assuming the EU Presidency, we proposed to our partners we should start work on preparing the Union for the political dialogue which is a central part of the new relationship between the Union and Mediterranean countries.  The Union, therefore, commissioned collective reports from the Head of Missions of the EU in the three states which had signed association agreements with the Union: Tunisia, Israel and Morocco.  These reports, which remain confidential under the procedures of common foreign and security policy, have provided useful surveys of the human rights situation in the countries concerned.  They provide a collective focus for all 15 partners and have already served as a guide for action.  Following an Irish Presidency proposal, it was agreed by member states that these reports should be a precursor for a regular, active monitoring of the implementation of the human rights clause once the agreements are ratified.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from this that the Council has for some time been gearing itself for the serious responsibilities the Union faces in ensuring the human rights clauses of the association agreements are effective provisions.  Debates which have taken place in national parliaments and in the European Parliament have demonstrated that these concerns are shared by the executive and legislative branches of government.  I appreciate the deep interest and concern on the part of Members of the Oireachtas in the EU-Israel Agreement, as evidenced at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which included a submission from Amnesty International.I hope our exchange today will to some degree meet this concern and underline the importance the Oireachtas attaches to the need for serious and continuing attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>Continuing on the theme of how we can ensure an effective political dialogue with Israel in the framework of the association agreement, I would also like to inform the House of another innovation launched by the Union under the Irish Presidency that directly concerns the issue of Israeli human rights practice.  We proposed at the outset of our Presidency that a mechanism be established which would provide for EU monitoring of all Israeli settlement activity.  This initiative was subsequently expanded to include Jerusalem. More recently, during the Dutch Presidency the EU has agreed to establish a further mechanism to monitor human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territories by both Israel and the Palestinian authority in the areas under their control.</P>
    <P>I also recommend the ratification of the association agreement with Morocco.  Ireland favours the constructive role which Morocco, and notably <Col N="56" /> His Majesty King Hassan II, has played in Arab councils, particularly on the question of the status of Jerusalem.  This constructive moderation also characterises Morocco's participation within the Euro-Mediterranean process.  It mirrors the continuing and careful strategy of political reform under way in Morocco, notably the revision of the constitution, the creation of a second chamber of parliament and the establishment of local and regional councils.  Through these reforms, Morocco is responding to the spirit of a political dialogue in the association agreement based on respect for democratic norms.  However, we are concerned at well documented claims of illegal detention as well as reports of ill-treatment in Morocco which violate international human rights and humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>The Government remains concerned about the situation in the western Sahara, where unresolved differences between Morocco and the Polisario Front regarding voter eligibility have delayed the convening of the referendum in the region, which was a central element in bringing about the ceasefire between Morocco and the Polisario in 1991. The initiation of the bilateral negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario is an encouraging development and we are also pleased by the Secretary General's appointment of former US Secretary of State, James Baker, as his special representative for the western Sahara.  Both parties have demonstrated good will in their approach to the situation, notably through a joint release of prisoners, and we urge them strongly to move forward towards the resolution of outstanding questions.</P>
    <P>We should ratify these agreements with Israel and Morocco because they are a step into the common future which the EU and the Mediterranean countries are building together.  It is the Union's aim to create trust and confidence among the countries of the region, so that the Mediterranean can be made a zone of peace and prosperity, which will contribute to peace in the Middle East and the region as a whole.  It is the Government's intention that the agreement's human rights provisions shall not remain merely an aspiration but shall be given practical expression.  We should not, however, in respect of agreements between states, assume that we can construct watertight monitoring and compliance mechanisms which will automatically enable us to sanction each and every breach.  What we can and will do is to keep Israel constantly aware of the force of our concerns, monitor its human rights behaviour closely, and exert as a Union a collective pressure on our Euro-Mediterranean partners to comply with their undertakings and accept that they must account for their human rights behaviour.</P>
    <P>The European Union was built upon the belief that trade, co-operation and increased prosperity make war less likely.  These agreements represent a historic attempt to extend that philosophy to the whole Mediterranean region.  We now have the opportunity to contribute to making the Middle East peace process irreversible.  As part of our contribution we should help Israel to expand its economy and consolidate its democratic <Col N="57" /> institutions.  Our relations under this agreement assume a commitment to the peace process and support for human rights and the rule of law. A peace process driven by democratic principles and institutions is, in my view, the only guarantee of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the agreements with Slovenia and Uzbekistan.  The Europe Agreement with Slovenia, signed on 10 June 1996, provides a broad and comprehensive framework for relations with the EU.  It provides for structured, high level political dialogue, phased movement on an asymmetrical basis towards free trade and an intensification of economic co-operation.  The agreement recognises Slovenia's wish to participate in the process of European integration and to accede to the European Union.  Slovenia applied for EU membership on 10 June 1996 and now participates in the Union's pre-accession strategy for countries of central and eastern Europe, including in the structured dialogue.  The Europe Agreement with Slovenia, like those with other countries of central and eastern Europe, is based on the principles of respect for human rights, democracy and the market economy, which form the basis of the association.  It provides for the establishment of a free trade area over a transitional period of at most six years.  There are also provisions relating to movement of workers, right of establishment, provision of services, payments and movement of capital, competition rules and public undertakings, protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property, access to public contracts, and the approximation of Slovenia's legislation to that of the Union.  Economic, financial and cultural co-operation are provided for, as well as co-operation in the prevention of illegal activities, such as illegal immigration, drug trafficking and organised crime.  Pending ratification of the agreement, its trade and economic co-operation provisions are being implemented by means of an interim agreement.</P>
    <P>We are now on the threshold of enlargement of the Union to include countries of central and eastern Europe.  Accession negotiations are to commence six months after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference, taking its results into account.  In the interval between the end of the Intergovernmental Conference, which is due to take place at the Amsterdam meeting of the European Council in June, the European Commission will make available its opinions on the various applications for membership.  The Commission will also issue a number of important reports which were called for by the European Council at Madrid in December 1995.  These will include a study of the impact of enlargement on the Union's common policies and a paper on the future financing of the Union in the perspective of enlargement.  Ireland welcomes the prospect of enlargement as both a political necessity and an historic opportunity which will enhance stability and confidence throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Since its emergence into independence in 1991, upon the break-up of the former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, Slovenia has, by any standard, been highly successful in reorienting <Col N="58" /> its political and economic systems on the basis of democratic and market economy principles.Its per capita GDP, which is estimated at over $9,000, is the highest in the region.  Our trade relations, while small in scale, have been growing steadily in recent years.  In 1995 our exports were worth £10.5 million against imports valued at £5 million.</P>
    <P>The Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Uzbekistan was signed on the occasion of the European Council at Florence on 21 June last.  The PCA with Uzbekistan, like those with the other countries of the former Soviet Union, is founded on respect for human rights and democratic principles as essential elements in its relations with the European Union.  The agreement will govern political dialogue between the Union and Uzbekistan, as well as economic and trade relations.  It contains provisions relating to trade in goods, labour conditions, conditions affecting the establishment and operation of companies, trade in services, payments and capital, and intellectual property.</P>
    <P>The agreement also provides for economic, financial and cultural co-operation, co-operation on matters relating to democracy and human rights and co-operation in preventing illegal activities, including money laundering, the fight against drugs and illegal immigration.  Pending ratification of the PCA, its trade and economic aspects will be implemented by means of an interim agreement, similar to those already signed with other former Soviet republics.</P>
    <P>The European Union is in the process of evolution.Momentous steps will soon have to be taken with regard to economic and monetary union and enlargement, in addition to the complex issues under discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference.  We are, I believe, on the threshold of significant developments which will determine the shape of Europe for some considerable time to come.  To many people outside, the European Union is a beacon of hope. Whether they be citizens of countries which await anxiously the opportunity to join the Union, whether they be living in what to us may be a distant part of the former Soviet Union or whether they be citizens of the Mediterranean countries which seek a new relationship with us and with each other, the Union today exercises a strong attraction on countries and regions far beyond our shores.</P>
    <P>From the destruction wrought on our continent 50 years ago, the European Community has established peace and prosperity among its member states.  The values which we stand for, which include democracy and respect for the rule of law and for human rights, protection for minorities and market economy principles in accordance with the prerequisites of social justice, may not yet be shared fully by all of our third country partners.  However, those values, which are central to the European Union, are being communicated through the role now being played by the Union on the wider international stage.  The varied agreements before the House today confirm the strength and influence of the European Union for countries of different political, economic, <Col N="59" /> social and religious backgrounds.  I commend the agreements with the four countries concerned to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Kitt.  I thank the T·naiste for his detailed statement.  We are particularly concerned about the agreement between the EU and Israel.  Eighteen months ago I attended the election in East Jerusalem.  This was a great experience for the Palestinian people who, for the first time, were receiving recognition in international agreements. However, the experience creates a serious doubt in my mind about how effective our agreements with Israel can be and how much emphasis we can place on human rights in Israel.</P>
      <P>I was accompanied at the polling stations by Lord Allenby, after whose great grand uncle the famous bridge over Jordan was called, and Senator Cotter.  The Israeli police and military showed a diabolical lack of respect for us as EU representatives.  There was a strong attempt to stop Palestinians voting in East Jerusalem.  The Israelis used the technical excuse that Palestinians could only vote in a post office.  This was because their votes would constitute a postal vote to the Palestinian lands.  This was a disaster.  Most Palestinians were not registered.  In some instances people were turned away because they did not have complete identification.  They were intimidated by the police not to vote.</P>
      <P>At a post office near the Damascus Gate I saw a young Palestinian pass a comment to some Israeli soldiers.  Fourteen soldiers savagely beat this man with rifle butts and batons in front of us. His face was turned to pulp within five minutes. Congressman Gallagher from the US also witnessed this incident.  He was so irate he tried to intervene.  We had to restrain him as he would have been the next victim of those rifle butts and batons.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Israeli officer in charge of the area about this incident.  I asked him what the young man had done and was told that he had a knife in his possession.  We could all see that he had no knife in his hand, nor did he attempt to pull a knife from his pocket.  He simply passed a remark which was sufficient reason to beat his face to pulp.  I understand that he was later charged with carrying a concealed weapon.  I have never seen such viciousness.</P>
      <P>One of our duties as observers was to escort the postal votes to the Palestinian side of the border.We were to follow directly behind the van carrying those votes.  On two occasions we were rammed off the road by an Israeli police jeep. There was no concern shown for damage to ourselves or the car.  That frightened me as we were international observers.  No respect was shown for us in that capacity.  If there is no respect for international observers then what respect will be shown for those the Israelis do not want in their country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about how effective our agreement will be with Israel.  I condemn all Palestinian violence.  However, as the T·naiste rightly said, <Col N="60" /> the treatment of the Palestinians is a breeding ground for more vicious terrorism.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention two cases currently being investigated by Amnesty International.  First is the case of a man called Hamdieh who was arrested on 3 April 1997 on suspicion of connection with a Hamas cell.  He is being interrogated at the prison formerly known as Ashkelon Prison. His lawyer was unable to see him until 16 April due to a security order.  Since then he has obtained details of alleged torture and ill treatment.Part of this torture involves the continual shaking of a suspect.  This is being used more widely, as was proven in a 1995 case.  We have seen similar behaviour in this country where babies are shaken by brutal fathers because they will not stop crying.  This results in brain damage.  This man was made to squat for long periods even though he suffers from rheumatism.  His interrogators pushed him into a squatting position when he could not get into it himself.</P>
    <P>He said his wrists and ankles were swollen from having been handcuffed and that, at night, he was held next to an extremely cold air conditioner.</P>
    <P>I note the Israeli courts allowed a differentiation to be drawn between what they termed &ldquo;torture&rdquo; and &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; to be exerted on a suspect.It would be sad if we were to begin to allow such little slippages within our interrogation sustem or Garda practices.  No doubt we would be castigated by the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>There was also the case of another man, Ayman Mahmud Hassan Kafisha, arrested on 5 April last on suspicion of involvement in a Hamas bombing in Tel-Aviv in March last.  He was held at Shikma Prison, formerly Ashkelon Prison.  His lawyer, Mr. AndrÈ Rosenthal, working with the Israeli human rights organisation, was denied access to him by the same general security service order until 19 April.  He appealed for access to his client to the Israeli Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court, on 8 April.  The appeal was heard on 9 April but denied on security grounds.</P>
    <P>If Israel wants to be considered as a western democracy, it must act like one.  The Barcelona declaration states specifically that those rights must be afforded citizens of its signatory countries.What I fail to understand is that a people, so badly treated themselves in the course of the Second World War, and beforehand, can suddenly begin to treat others in almost similar fashion.  I should have thought that they, above all people, would have learned that cruel, inhuman treatment of others is not tolerated worldwide and certainly does not advance one's case.</P>
    <P>On 10 April last Mr. Kafisha's lawyer lodged a petition to the Israeli High Court requesting that the general security service &mdash; GSS &mdash; be obliged to explain why it was not applying Article 277 of the penal code of 1977 which prohibits the use of physical force during interrogation, requesting an interim injunction against its use.  The High Court heard the case on 16 April but denied the petition.The response of the general security service only heightened Mr. Rosenthal's concerns that his client was being tortured under interrogation. This led to his lodging another petition requesting the High Court to oblige the general security service <Col N="61" /> to explain its actions.  He also requested an interim injunction preventing the use of physical force during interrogation, which petition was submitted on 17 April but has not yet been heard.</P>
    <P>Surely these represent urgent actions which should be taken forthwith.  The lawyer also requested the Appeal Court for a reduction in a 30-day detention order on his client.  These are practices perpetrated by a people so badly treated themselves who, in turn, now take to treating others extremely badly.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for the Palestinian people who held so rigidly to the terms of the Peace Accord, who had such high hopes of it.  Equally, I say to Europe and to our Government that we are being hypocritical in this respect.  We have signed an agreement with them, including Article 2 which specifies that human rights must be respected.  It appears we have no intention of implementing its provisions or taking any action thereunder but, unless we do, we shall be unable to perform a proper role within the Mediterranean area.  The European Union must protect the rights of those less well off, in the case of the Palestinians, a people struggling for a homeland of their own, for a place in which to govern and the right to do so.  Surely we Irish should understand that right, that they are entitled to govern themselves and not be treated as they have been by a military regime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Davern for sharing his time with me and welcome the opportunity to debate this motion.  Our spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Raphael Burke, is unavoidably absent.  He has raised many of the important issues contained in the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements on several occasions here, most recently on 19 March, when he tabled a parliamentary question to the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, requesting him to confirm as a matter of urgency there would be no derogation from the upholding of human rights in any circumstances, but specifically in relation to the EU-Morocco Association Agreement and, more generally, in relation to all EU-Mediterranean association agreements.</P>
      <P>On the same day Deputy Raphael Burke asked the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to take the advice of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which, on 26 February last, urged him to clarify the supremacy of Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement relating to human rights over Article 76 in relation to security in order to avoid interpretation of that agreement in any manner which could undermine the upholding of human rights or derogation therefrom.</P>
      <P>I urge the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs again to confirm that there will be no such derogation in any circumstances from those articles on human rights contained in these agreements before ratification.  Let there be no confusion: the EU-Israel and Morocco Association Agreements must not be ratified until their far-reaching human rights have been satisfactorily clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> Twenty-seven Foreign Ministers attended the Barcelona Conference on 28 November 1995 which officially launched the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.  The declaration adopted at that conference covered three major topics aimed at political and security partnership with the objective of creating a common area of peace and stability, an economic and financial partnership designed to establish a common zone of prosperity, notably by the gradual introduction of free trade and a social, cultural and human partnership designed to increase exchanges between the civil societies of the countries signatories to the partnership.</P>
    <P>The Barcelona declaration established a multilateral framework for the development of relations between the EU and 12 Mediterranean countries, the intention from the outset being that that framework should be complemented by a network of bilateral agreements between the EU and those Mediterranean countries involved.</P>
    <P>The first Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Tunisia was ratified by the D·il on 17 November 1996, those in respect of Israel and Morocco being debated today.  The EU-Israel Association Agreement contains certain key articles which have become routine in all these association agreements.  Since the EU-Israel Association Agreement also contains ambiguities and presents interpretative problems common to all such association agreements it is essential that the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs obtains clarification of its following key articles in order to underpin the strength and integrity of international human rights and humanitarian law as envisaged by EU policy declarations since 1991.</P>
    <P>It must be established beyond all doubt that the term &ldquo;respect for human rights&rdquo;, referred to in Article 2 of the EU-Israel Agreement incorporates the duties and standards of international human rights and humanitarian law ratified by the parties thereto and applies to the full scope of domestic and international practices of the parties; second, the persistent violation of Article 2 by either party to the agreement constitutes a material breach of the agreement, giving rise to the need for corrective action, as specified by the European Commission; third, that the ratification of this and all other association agreements, containing a human rights clause, does not imply that current practices satisfy the requirements of Article 2; fourth, that Article 2 governs all other provisions of the agreement, including in particular Article 76 and, fifth, that these standards of human rights apply uniformly to all existing and future Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements.</P>
    <P>On 6 February last Deputy Raphael Burke questioned the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on the ambiguous human rights content of the EU-Israel Association Agreement and the consequent need for clarification, particularly in the light of Israel's human rights record and the legalisation of torture, in certain circumstances, in that country.  Amnesty International has referred to the human reality of legalised torture operating in Israel.  The Minister in a reply said: &ldquo;It is clear that Israel enshrines respect of human <Col N="63" /> rights in its legislation.  It has ratified a number of relevant UN instruments, including the international covenant on civil and political rights and the convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fianna F·il believes it is not sufficient to simply ratify such conventions but it is vital to actively and practically vindicate their content through their implementation.  Israel and Morocco have failed in this respect.</P>
    <P>Before the agreement is ratified the Government and the EU must seek assurances from the Governments of Israel and Morocco that they intend to correct their human rights policies which continue to perpetrate breaches of international law and human rights agreements.  Furthermore, the Israel and Morocco association agreements must include a joint declaration, stipulating that the term &ldquo;cases of special emergency&rdquo; referred to in Article 76 means a case of material breach of the agreement by one of the parties.  On the same date, 6 February 1997, the Minister stated the intention of the Irish Government and the EU as a whole that the human rights clauses contained in the EU Mediterranean association agreements should be regularly monitored and strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government and the EU to ensure a public and transparent human rights monitoring and reporting mechanism is established at EU level without further delay to give effect to the stated objective of such agreements, namely, that they should improve compliance by the parties with international human rights and humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>Israel has reimposed total closure of the occupied territories.  Israel's closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and its frequent obstruction of the passage of Palestinian exports through Israeli controlled ports denies the right of the Palestinian people to full and equal participation in the Euro Mediterranean process via the interim association agreement with the PLO. Morocco has occupied Western Sahara since 1975.  The UN has been calling for a referendum to determine the political future of Western Sahara since 1966. No such referendum has been called and the Moroccan Government continues to perpetrate serious breaches of human rights and international law in the territory.  Should this House ratify the EU Israel association agreement while the Israeli Government continues to obstruct the conduct of Palestinian external trade, making a nonsense of the EU PLO interim agreement? Should the House ratify the EU Morocco association agreement despite its failure to distinguish between the kingdom of Morocco and the occupied Western Sahara?  Each of these issues whether relating to human rights, trade or self-determination must be considered carefully.  The EU Israel and EU Morocco agreements must not be ratified until the serious implications of both agreements have been satisfactorily addressed and, where necessary, clarified.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the Europe agreement with the Republic of Slovenia.  Fianna F·il is committed to the process of phased enlargement of <Col N="64" /> the European Union to enhance the stability and prosperity of Europe.  As a vital element of that process, to date nine east European countries &mdash; Poland, Hungary, the Checz Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania &mdash; have signed Europe agreements with the Union.  These agreements recognise the aspirations of certain east European countries to join the European Union.  Europe agreements are formed on the understanding that the signatories fulfil basic conditions with regard to democratic principles and transition towards a market economy.Slovenia has fulfilled these conditions.  Slovenia declared its independence in 1991 and was recognised as an independent state by the European Union in 1992.  Since then the Slovenian economy has made a remarkable recovery as the country peacefully underwent its transition to a democracy.  The growth rate of the Slovenian economy soared from minus 0.7 per cent in 1991 to just below 5 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>I call on this House to ratify the Europe agreement between the EU and the Republic of Slovenia.As regards the partnership and co-operation agreement with Uzbekistan, the initiation of this agreement represents a vital element of EU policy with regard to the countries of the former Soviet Union.  The objective of partnership and co-operation agreements is to assist the process of political dialogue and economic reform in newly independent states, also to enhance peace and stability on the continent of Europe and to open new channels for dialogue and the development of closer relations with such countries.</P>
    <P>Some nine partnership and co-operation agreements were ratified by this House last year.  I call on the House to likewise ratify the latest such agreement, the EC Uzbekistan partnership and co-operation agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that earlier, on the Order of Business &mdash; while I was not present &mdash; the Government indicated it would not agree to the four motions we are discussing, being voted on separately.  That is monstrous.  It was made clear by the Progressive Democrats' Whip, and I understand also by the Democratic Left Whip, at the Whips' meeting last week, that they wanted to speak with their respective parties and spokesmen about the voting procedure and nothing was agreed.  It is noteworthy that the proposal on the Order of Business is that these motions would be moved and debated together, there is nothing about their being voted on together.  I ask the Chair to put the vote on each motion separately. They are four separate countries, four separate agreements and are entirely different.  The reason I say this is that my party proposes to vote against the Israeli agreement and we want the opportunity to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to vote against the Europe agreement with Slovenia which I support.  I have no objection whatever to the partnership agreement with Uzbekistan and while I have some misgivings about the agreement with Morocco, because of human rights issues there and in particular its relationship with the people in Western Sahara and the long delay in the holding of a referendum <Col N="65" /> among the people of Western Sahara, I do not propose to vote against it because Morocco is at least moving in the right direction and is paying attention to what the United Nations has to say.</P>
    <P>However I want to vote against the most important of these agreements &mdash; the Israeli agreement.  I claim the right to be allowed vote against it alone and not to have it lumped together &mdash; in a way that was never intended and does not appear from the Order Paper &mdash; with three other entirely separate agreements.  I presume we will be allowed that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Of these four agreements, by far the most important is the agreement with Israel.  The agreement is of great benefit to Israel and gives substantial duty free access to the European Union market for a wide variety of goods and commodities and allows access for investment, free movement and various other things which are substantially to Israel's advantage.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the European Union would take a critically objective view of Israeli conduct towards the Palestinian people.  This is essential when it is remembered that the United States is frequently prepared to turn a blind eye to the unhelpful attitude of Israel towards the peace process.  The peace process which began at Oslo, and for which there were high hopes, now lies in shreds and a substantial proportion of the blame for that must be laid at the door of the policies of the Netanyahu Government in Israel.  Particularly regrettable is its provocative decision to build an Israeli settlement in Har Homa in the greater Jerusalem area for the purpose of encircling Jerusalem with Israeli settlements and seeking to cut it off from the remainder of the West Bank.  This settlement is within the alleged boundaries of Jerusalem only because the Israelis redrew the boundaries after they occupied east Jerusalem by force in 1967.</P>
    <P>What is particularly reprehensible is the failure of Israel to honour its obligations under the Oslo accord by imposing and maintaining a complete economic blockade on the area now under the control of the Palestinian authority.  It is not widely realised in Europe that it is impossible for the Palestinians in either Gaza or the West Bank to export or import goods.  Palestine has no exports and the only imports allowed are those from Israel.  This policy is designed to subvert the Palestinian administration.  It is impossible for the Palestinians to develop their economy when they are not allowed to trade with the outside world and when the West Bank is effectively cut off from Gaza by a virtually total blockade.  This is not just a blockade on goods but a blockade on people.  There is no free movement of people between Gaza and the West Bank although Israel agreed to allow such freedom under its agreements.</P>
    <P>I saw the impact of that blockade when I was in Gaza last December.  I had the honour and pleasure of meeting President Arafat on that occasion and, when I asked him about a port in Gaza for the import and export of goods, he walked to the window behind where I sat.  He pulled back the curtain and invited me to look <Col N="66" /> out the window.  On the beach behind his headquarters there was a line of small boats.  They reminded me of what one might see in the west of Ireland because they were little bigger than currachs.  That was Palestine's fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>He also showed me a pile of rocks dumped on the beach.  He explained that the Palestinians had started to build a pier but, as there is no rock in Gaza, they had to bring it from Hebron on the West Bank.  The Israelis would not allow them to import the rock from the other part of Palestine. As a result, the Palestinians do not even have a small pier for fishing boats, let alone a pier for the import or export of goods.  That is deplorable. When President Arafat returned to his seat, he pointed to a lovely arrangement of flowers on the table and said: &ldquo;we could sell those flowers in Europe; we grow many of them.  However, we cannot sell them because we cannot send them out&rdquo;.  &ldquo;What do you do with them?&rdquo;  I asked.  &ldquo;We feed them to the goats&rdquo;, he replied.</P>
    <P>That is the result of Israeli policy and its breach of its obligations under agreements and under international law.  What are we supposed to do today?  We are supposed to condone that policy. I agree with nearly everything in the T·naiste's speech but its logical conclusion is that we should tell Israel to wait and put its house in order <i>vis-‡-vis</i> the Palestinian people.  Until then we cannot give it a sign of approval, which is how Israel will interpret the ratification of this agreement. Deputy Davern made a strong speech on this subject, but will his party vote against ratification of this agreement?  I hope so.  I hope the Government will withdraw the agreement until the time is more opportune.  However, we should ratify the other three agreements.</P>
    <P>While Israel is a genuine democracy, and is to be much commended for that fact, it likes to say it accepts and adopts western standards.  Unfortunately, it fails to live up to its own rhetoric.  Its legislation of torture and the judicial approval of torture by its highest court is unacceptable in a country with a developed democracy.  The ratification of this agreement with Israel by each member state of the European Union will be construed in the Middle East as a mark of approval for Israel and its present policies <i>vis-‡-vis</i> the Palestinian people.  That mark of approval should not be given.  D·il …ireann should decline to ratify this agreement until such time as Israel acts in a more reasonable way towards the Palestinian people and honours its obligations under the Oslo accord and under international law.</P>
    <P>Ratification of this agreement will be construed as indifference on the part of this country to fundamental human rights.  Israel has infinitely more to gain from the agreement than the European Union and, from its position of strength, Europe should insist on the vindication of the rights of the Palestinian people who are now so grossly downtrodden by their oppressors.  The European Union is the only hope of the Palestinian people because the United States will not intervene in an effective way against Israel, whom it appears to regard as a major ally in the region and whom it supports in almost all circumstances, no matter how blatantly Israel breaches its obligations. <Col N="67" /> Apart from the Oslo accord, the principles set out at Barcelona and in the Dublin declaration have been ignored by Israel.</P>
    <P>I ask the D·il to join my party in voting against this agreement.  The agreement itself is unsatisfactory because of the obvious conflict between the provisions of Article 2 and Article 76.  While Article 2 purports to guarantee protection for human rights.  Article 76 allows virtually any measure to be taken if it is claimed to be done in the interests of state security.  We are aware of the barbarous acts the Israelis frequently justify in the so called interests of state security.  If the agreement is ratified, Article 2 will be ignored by Israel on the grounds that it is operating within the parameters of Article 76.  In the case of a country such as Israel, which espouses democratic respect for fundamental human rights, Article 76 should be removed from the agreement to prevent it being used in this way.</P>
    <P>It is inopportune to ratify an agreement containing that article when we know, courtesy of Amnesty International, that two Palestinians, lyad Abu Hamdieh and Ayman Mahmud Hassan Kafisha, are being held in Israeli custody in Shikma prison, are being denied access to their lawyers and are apparently being tortured.  The Israeli High Court has refused to intervene on their behalf even though the court has been told that the men are believed to be subject to torture and that the assertion does not appear to be disputed.This is in addition to many other such cases in Israel in the past few years.</P>
    <P>This agreement, therefore, should be voted on separately and the D·il should ask itself what it is doing before it decides to ratify it and to give a pat of approval to Israel notwithstanding its conduct and the fact that what we are talking about are not historical events that happened, say, one, two, three, five or ten years ago, they are happening now.  The two men about whom I have spoken are in prison, have been denied access to lawyers and are subject to torture.  A man died in the prison in recent months as a result of torture.  When his lawyers, on behalf of his family, made an application to the Israeli Supreme Court, it approved of the treatment by the Israeli security authorities which led to his death.</P>
    <P>On the other agreements we are being asked to ratify, the agreement with Uzbekistan is similar to other partnership and co-operation agreements signed with other countries of the former Soviet Union.  It is not of great significance and I see no objection to it.  Uzbekistan is no better or no worse than many of its neighbours with whom similar agreements have been signed.  I hope that in that part of the world things will settle down, that it will become more democratic and that a normal market economy will be allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Slovenia is greatly to be welcomed and I hope we will see the day in the not too distant future when Slovenia becomes a full member state of the European Union.  It is a country that is entitled to great credit for the economic and political progress <Col N="68" /> it has made since its independence in 1991. It is a small country but one which is now firmly rooted in the democratic tradition and which has become economically successful in a short period. I wish it well and look forward to its eventual accession to full membership of the European Union for which it will be eminently suitable shortly.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Morocco is somewhat more problematic, particularly because of the Moroccan attitude to the people of the Western Sahara.  I hope the United Nations and the Baker mission can overcome these difficulties and a referendum can be held shortly in the Western Sahara so that the people there will have the opportunity to express their views on the question of self-determination.  The matter is somewhat complex but, at least, genuine efforts are being made to move in the right direction and the violence which was a feature of that dispute in earlier years is, happily, at an end.  I hope it will be possible to resolve it.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to these three agreements but I reiterate my objection to the ratification at this time of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Israel for the reasons I gave.  I listened to the speeches by the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Davern with which I agree.  They should follow the logic of what they said and vote not to ratify that agreement.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot deplore and condemn what is happening in Israel <i>vis-‡-vis</i> the Palestinians and, at the same time, give the Israelis a pat on the head, tell them they are bold boys and that we do not like what they are doing but we will give them official approval and draw them closer to us.</P>
    <P>Since that agreement with Israel was signed, a similar agreement has been signed with the PLO, on behalf of the Palestinian authorities, but it is not worth the paper it is written on because there can be no trade with Palestine, no freedom of movement of people and goods and no exchange of information.  The money being given to Palestine by the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and various other donors is being wasted to a great extent through no fault of the Palestinian people because it is impossible for them to utilise that assistance in the ways that should be open to them.</P>
    <P>Visiting the Gaza Strip is a sobering episode in anyone's life.  I hope to go back and when I do I hope things will be better.  It is a small, narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast.  It is so small that one would wonder how more than one million Palestinian people can live there. Approximately 40 per cent of the land within it is still occupied by Israel, either by military encampments or settlements.  The remaining 60 per cent is occupied by over one million Palestinian people, many of whom are living in very bad conditions through no fault of their own.  They are poor people and they are getting poorer every day because of the economic blocade imposed illegally by Israel.  Do we want a country that does that to those people to be our favoured trading partner?  If we vote yes, we are saying we do. There should be a rethink about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that these agreements, following direct representations to the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the passing of a resolution at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, are being debated in the House. In other parliaments throughout the European Union they went through on the nod.  Members of Parliament were not permitted to express the gravest of reservations about the infringement of human rights in Palestine, the occupied territories and the Gaza Strip to which other speakers have referred.</P>
      <P>When I visited those territories to ascertain how Irish taxpayers' money was being spent by the United Nations Relief Agency, in the distribution of food to hungry Palestinians and the provision of medicare to the sick and those in need I was accosted by the Israeli authorities almost as if I was interfering in the internal affairs of another state.  It was a humiliating experience. Other Members have had similar experiences, including Deputy Byrne.  It is almost impossible to represent one's own parliament, the Euro-Arab parliamentary group or the United Nations, either as an observer or as part of a humanitarian mission, because of the attitude adopted by the Israeli authorities.</P>
      <P>Due to their actions up to and including yesterday, many Members have grave reservations about the need for the Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Israel.  This State, as past President of the European Union and member of the Troika, has an international obligation, arising out of the meeting in Barcelona, to endorse it and the other agreements.  This debate gives us an opportunity to send the strongest possible message to President Netanyahu and the Israeli authorities that there is cross-party support for the Palestinians and their right to self-determination and that their present actions and attitude to the Palestinians are unacceptable.  We were involved for many years in moving the peace process forward and were euphoric when agreement was reached between the two sides.  I am sorry that Israel is moving back from that position.</P>
      <P>The continued building of settlements by the Israeli authorities in occupied territories which have been designated by the UN as legitimately belonging to the Palestinians has one motive, to make these areas untenable, unsustainable and uneconomic. This is warfare by another name.  As the previous speaker said, it is almost an attempt to strangle the Palestinians.  We had the honour to meet President Arafat and if we are to help him in delivering something to his people after all these years then we have an obligation to avail of every opportunity to express our concerns about the actions of the Israeli authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Israelis badly want this agreement. However, we want the agreement the Israelis made with the Palestinians, which started with the Oslo Accord, to be honoured to the letter.  This agreement, which is recognised internationally, was supervised by the American authorities and aspired to by the European Union.  However, by ignoring it and international and European opinion, the Israeli authorities risk bringing instability <Col N="70" /> to an area which all of us hoped was beginning to emerge from its dark history of intimidation, assassinations and unwelcome violence on all sides.</P>
    <P>The EU agreement with the Palestinians is not worth the paper it is written on as that country has no ports or airports and cannot export its fruit products.  The checkpoints and ports are manned by the Israelis and Palestinian producers have to unload their produce which can be left to rot in the sun for days.  Following its agreement with the EU, Israel's trading position improved.  However, if Israel continues to build these settlements and does not stop its present atrocities then it will be treading on very dangerous ground.</P>
    <P>I am glad the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined his concerns about the encroachment on human rights.  Regardless of whether they are defined under the Geneva Convention or UN resolutions, human rights must be maintained.If we do not alert the Israeli authorities to our concerns about their abuse of human rights then they will believe they have support for their actions which they regard as necessary from the point of view of security.  However, the security of a state cannot justify some of the actions which have been taken.  Arab ambassadors recently confirmed that the Lebanese authorities had given a commitment to secure the borders for Israel if it moved out of southern Lebanon.  There is an inbuilt dread about the security of the state and we can assure the Israeli authorities that we are also concerned about this matter.  However, it is important to be conscious of just how neglected the other side in this equation is.  We need to be assured that this agreement will give us the additional power to influence the Israeli authorities &mdash; with whom we have honoured our agreement &mdash; to move back from the precipice into which they are pushing us.  This is not overstating the case; it is a fair interpretation of the present position.</P>
    <P>There has been a reference to Morocco.  As the ambassadors to that country, including Ambassador Tad Laoui, have said, the agreement to the appointment of James Baker and to holding a proper referendum in western Sahara have allayed to some extent the concerns about possible infringements of human rights in that country.However, what movement has there been in the state of Israel <i>vis-‡-vis</i> its attitude to the Palestinians and recognition of their right to self-determination and right, under EU agreements, to survive as an economic unit?  Does anyone seriously believe that this is not a problem for all of us?  I hope the ratification of this agreement will give us an extra lever to use in our dealings with these people who need to be pushed forward on all fronts if human rights are not to be contravened in the future.  If they want to be a party to agreements with Ireland and the EU then they must abide by the rules and regulations, international and otherwise.  I have grave reservations about this agreement and hope the Government takes these on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have grave reservations about the ratification of this agreement as it <Col N="71" /> might send out the wrong signal to Israel at what must be recognised as a delicate point in the Middle Eastern peace process.  I am afraid that the agreement may be viewed in the Middle East as effectively rewarding Israel for the numerous human rights abuses which have occurred in recent months.  The agreement has one saving grace in that Article 2 bases the agreement as a whole on the party's, that is Israel, &ldquo;respect for human rights and democratic principles&rdquo;.  As we know from experience, such clauses are all too often included in agreements and then forgotten. This clause should be used by the EU as a positive instrument in pressuring Israel into complying with international human rights norms and delivering on the various issues which have been negotiated in the peace process.</P>
      <P>The Israeli commitment to that peace process must be in some doubt.  In recent months, Israel has stepped up land confiscations and the construction of settlements and has resumed closures in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  Under pressure from his own right wing party, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been playing ducks and drakes with the already fragile peace process.  The victims of that are ordinary Palestinians whose human rights are violated on a daily basis and whose economic prospects are being undermined by the continuing programme of land confiscations, and all that entails, including the construction of settler bypass superhighways.</P>
      <P>Economic rights and human rights cannot be separated because economic rights are human rights.  The development of civil society in Palestine depends on a sound economic infrastructure in the region.  Unfortunately, we are all too aware that that development is being systematically thwarted by the Israeli activities and by the international community's tacit acceptance of those activities.</P>
      <P>In 1986, the European Community undertook to allow Palestinian exports preferential access to EC markets comparable to that enjoyed by the Israelis.  The reality, however, is completely different.  Israel's closures of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the regular obstruction of Palestinian exports passing through Israeli controlled ports, and Israel's routine practise of certifying goods produced in illegal Israeli settlements and by subcontractors in the occupied territories, which are labelled as originating in Israel, combine to militate against Palestinian exporters.  The playing field is anything but level.</P>
      <P>Palestinians are not the only victims of Israel's behaviour.  The economic obstacles placed in the way of Palestinians have wider implications for the whole region.  The culture of repression adopted by Israel also militates against the security of Israeli citizens, who are being forced to exist in a permanent state of civil war.  It is an obscenity to see 15 year old Israeli girls carrying weapons around their necks as they walk the streets or go to dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two questions need to be answered when considering ratification of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements.  First, what will be its impact on the peace process as a whole and, <Col N="72" /> second, will the Palestinians be able to participate in the European-Mediterranean process as equal partners?  Ratification of the agreement must be contingent on Israel agreeing to abide by the human rights clause.  It must also be made very clear that there will be a price to pay for Israel's repeated infringements of the peace process ground rules.</P>
    <P>I urge the T·naiste to press for the European Commission to establish a politically independent and transparent monitoring and reporting mechanism charged with periodically reviewing Israel's compliance with Article 2 of the agreement.  Such a mechanism should be established on the explicit understanding that any breach by Israel of Article 2 will result in a suspension of the agreement. With regard to Palestinian participation, it is clear they will be unable to participate on an equal footing until Israel removes the economic road blocks that have been placed in their path.  Pressure must be brought on Israel to level this economic playing field.</P>
    <P>There is another broader question that must be considered, namely, to what extent should all association agreements, concluded between the European Union and other party countries, be human rights audited?  Israeli human rights infringements regularly make headlines, but what about the numerous human rights abuses by the Moroccan regime, for example, which is also party to one of the agreements we are debating today?  What about all the other countries, many with appalling human rights records, which concluded association agreements with the European Union?</P>
    <P>Association agreements are generally billed as mere trade and co-operation agreements but they are far more than that.  They put a gloss of respectability on dubious regimes, and that should be borne in mind when negotiating and ratifying such agreements.  I am aware such agreements provide the international community with a carrot in its efforts to persuade countries to abide by international human rights norms but, unfortunately, the stick is often missing.</P>
    <P>European Union foreign policy is often dictated by trade rather than human rights considerations.The Irish Government, and in particular the T·naiste, has an enviable track record of commitment to human rights.  I urge the T·naiste to do everything in his power to ensure continuous human rights monitoring of agreements concluded between the EU and other states.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I have had occasion to visit Palestine and the occupied territories.  I respect the state of Israel and applaud its major achievements, including its democratic structure which allows political forces to compete.  I congratulate a small political party similar to my own, the Meretz Party, which is struggling against the tide of sectarian tensions within the region, and the endeavours of the progressive forces in the state of Israel which are also struggling against that tide.</P>
    <P>I condemn the political culture in Israel which allows the harassment of ordinary Palestinians.  I am aware of an incident in the east Jerusalem region when the former American President, <Col N="73" /> Jimmy Carter, who was monitoring the Palestinian elections, was blatantly intimidated by the Israelis.  The Palestinians and European Union monitors were also intimidated and harassed by the Israeli forces.  I was in the Janin region when three Palestinians were shot dead at a road block. The Israelis tried to gloss over that shooting; reports indicated that AK47 rifles had been seized and that three Palestinians had been killed as a result.  An Irish monitor in the area witnessed that incident and no such weapons were used.</P>
    <P>We all remember the treatment of Jacques Chirac when he visited the region.  The harassment of such a statesman was deplorable.  I want to send a message to Israelis who might be listening to this debate &mdash; I am sure they are monitoring it &mdash; that their diplomats are the worst I have ever encountered and their treatment of visiting parliamentarians is a disgrace.  If Israel claims to be a mainstream democratic state, it must learn to abide by the courtesies normally bestowed upon visiting parliamentarians.  It is in their own best interest that they should learn that the arrogance which they display does nothing for their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that these very important agreements, covering four different countries, have come before the House for approval.  I listened to the debate not just with astonishment but with sadness.  Most of the contributions from Members, other than the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have dealt in emotive and unbalanced language with the problems of the Middle East and, in particular, with the problems as they affect the Israelis and the Palestinians. The debate has shown an extraordinary lack of balance and understanding of and insight to the complexity of the problems that need to be addressed.  I would have expected more from Members and I would say to them to be cautious in accepting particular lines from one side or the other in the context of the different protagonists in the Middle East and, parrot-like, repeating them in this House.  It ill behoves a member of any European Parliament to simply condemn, in a straightforward and simplistic way, the Israelis or the state of Israel as if they are the only state or group in the Middle East who are creating difficulties, and act on the assumption that if only the Israeli Government changed its policies the problems in the Middle East would be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If nothing else we should have learned from our own peace process in this State the difficulties of moving a peace process forward, the need to put building blocks in place and to build trust between people as they move from a position of antagonism into a position of co-operation and, in the long-term, friendship.  We on this island have discovered that peace processes are extremely complex.  The peace process in the Middle East has complexities undreamed of even on this island.  Also, we should be careful about lecturing others about their peace process when we cannot get our own in order.  We should also be cautious and careful in how we treat the Middle East peace process to ensure that this State has a moral authority that will be taken seriously in contributing to resolving the problems of the <Col N="74" /> Middle East.  We should act in a constructive way, have the confidence of both sides and not merely be seen to be beating a partisan drum on one side of the debate.</P>
    <P>It was not originally my intention to devote much of what I wanted to say purely to the association agreement between the European Union and Israel.  It is an important agreement as it affects Morocco, Slovenia and Uzbekistan. However, in the light of the nature of the debate, I will confine my remarks to dealing with the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with the state of Israel.  That agreement, like the other agreements, is part of the European Union's commitment to the Mediterranean area to encourage a zone of peace and prosperity there.  This area is strategically important to Europe, and it would be self-defeating if the European Union did not go ahead with programmes which it planned and has been developing over the past few years.  The Mediterranean agreement provides a unique forum in which political dialogue can take place between European union member states and states that, for many years, were enemies within the Middle East, and provides a basic framework for economic co-operation between Europe and the Mediterranean states and between the Mediterranean states themselves within the Mediterranean region.</P>
    <P>It is also of importance in the context of the development of the peace process.  It provides a basic forum within which, at times of difficulty, states in the Middle East may find an opportunity to talk to each other where they are unable to engage in dialogue in other venues.</P>
    <P>In the context of Israel, the agreements are not unique.  We now have &mdash; and I very much support it &mdash; an agreement between the European Union and the Palestinian authority and an association agreement between Israel and the European Union.  It is regrettable that the agreement as it affects the Palestinian Authority is not before the House for approval as well.  It may be that for technical reasons this is not necessary, because the Palestinian authority does not at this moment represent a state.  However, if the two agreements were debated together, they would have provided an opportunity for a more balanced and understanding debate in the context of the difficulties of this region.</P>
    <P>Let us not paint simplistic pictures of the difficulties.In the context of the Palestinian Authority and the state of Israel there are politicians and individuals who have previously been at war with each other, and populations who are mutually suspicious of each other trying to find a way forward.  Listening to the debate in this House one would think that nothing had happened in the past eight or nine years.  Who, eight or nine years ago, would have expected a peace treaty in place between Jordan and Israel?  Who, eight or nine years ago, would have expected that the agreement between the Israelis and the Egyptians would have worked as well as it has.  Of course there have been blips along the road, but both agreements are working.  Who would have expected even five years ago to have seen Yasser <Col N="75" /> Arafat as President of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the Palestinian people moving, I believe inevitably, towards a Palestinian state? Who would have anticipated that any of that was possible without even greater bloodshed than we have seen in the region?  It is possible, and there is a danger in looking at events through a very short telescope and not standing back and seeing the progress that has been made.</P>
    <P>I listened to colleagues who have visited Israel. From my perspective either as chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or as a Member of this House, I would not pretend that I am happy with the policies of the present Government in Israel.  However, if we seriously want to contribute to the peace process, let us not have the type of unbalanced debate we had here this evening.  The Oslo Accord first ran into major difficulties when bombs went off in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in February and March 1996 blowing apart men, women and children, bombs inspired by the Hamas movement, sponsored and paid for by the Iranians whose sole objective was to destroy the Middle East peace process.  The population of Israel saw the Oslo Accord as providing not just the possibility of peace but the possibility of an end to murder and mayhem within the state of Israel itself.  Those bombs produced a political reaction which resulted in the current Government being put in place.  I wonder whether, if Loyalists from Northern Ireland were coming down to Dublin or to Cork to blow people apart, there would be criticism of the Garda SÌoch·na or the Army for putting in place stringent security measures to prevent further bombs, or if there would be criticism if they failed to do that.  Only within the last two and a half weeks there was another bomb in Tel Aviv which blew apart a pregnant woman and children.  There was no mention of any of that here this evening.</P>
    <P>There are people within the Middle East who have a vested interest in destroying the peace protest.  They are sponsored by Iran, funded and encouraged by Iran.  If we want to get on our moral high horse in this parliament we should bear in mind that for a long time this State turned a blind eye to the meddling of Iran in the Middle East peace process; it suited us to do so because we wished to sell beef to the Iranians.  It is only now that, as a result of a decision of the German courts, and because the Iranians have ceased buying our beef, that we are suddenly becoming a bit more critical of the repression in Iran.</P>
    <P>What we were doing until some weeks ago &mdash; and I did not hear any of the Members in this parliament who spoke so bitterly about the state of Israel this evening mention it &mdash; was engaging in what is euphemistically called critical dialogue with the Iranians.  What that meant was that we chatted pleasantly to them about human rights issues and then went on to ignore them and hoped they would buy our beef.  There are Members of this House who went on a delegation to Iran two years ago shortly after the Iranians held a rejectionist conference opposing the steps towards peace being taken by the Prime Minister <Col N="76" /> of Israel at the time, Mr. Ytshak Rabin and President Arafat.</P>
    <P>Let us have a balanced debate.  The problems of the Israelis and Palestinians need to be resolved in a number of ways.  There must be a restoration of trust and dialogue.  The spirit of Oslo must be applied by both sides in implementing the terms of the Oslo agreement &mdash; that applies to the Palestinian and the Israeli sides.  The violence and terrorism which results in people being blown apart in the state of Israel must be brought to an end.  I do not regard as acceptable some of the methods used by the Israeli security forces or the Palestinian Authority police when holding people in detention.  As Deputy O'Malley may recall, that matter was raised when he and I and other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs visited Gaza.</P>
    <P>Let us not pretend all the fault and difficulties are on one side, with none on the other.  At European Union level we must move the peace process forward by making a constructive contribution to improving the economies of the countries in the region and encouraging the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government into constructive dialogue to ensure what was agreed at Oslo comes to fruition and that further discussions of a constructive nature take place to bring permanent peace and security to that region, both within the Palestinian Authority administrative area and the state of Israel.  The speeches by most Deputies this evening, with the exception of that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will not make a whit of a contribution towards achieving that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I wish to refer to the proposed Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Morocco.  Those of us who sought, as individual Members and as members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, to have these matters debated are heartened by the fact that we have an opportunity to do so today.  Too often agreements such as these go through on the nod or are put down as motions to be agreed without debate.  I thank the Government Chief Whip for meeting the many views expressed in support of allocating sufficient time to debate the motions.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak on the proposed agreement with Morocco on the basis of evidence given last year to the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation by representatives of the Saharawi people and people both here and abroad who have been concerned for many years about the treatment of the people of the former Western Sahara.  That country was reneged on by the Spanish, while the Mauritanians and Moroccans tried to divide it and the Moroccans tried to take total control of it.  There has been much frustration at the lack of progress in reaching a solution through the auspices of the United Nations and the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand why the European Union is trying to reach agreement with our nearest neighbours in the Mediterranean region, the type of agreement reached with our prospective partners in Eastern Europe.  In respect of Morocco, I am concerned that clarification should be given that the <Col N="77" /> agreement applies to the state of Morocco as it is recognised internationally.  The territory of Western Sahara is disputed and I would not like to think that the agreement recognises the claim Morocco makes over this territory.  It is important that a distinction be made between the kingdom of Morocco and the occupied Western Sahara. Moroccan sovereignty over this territory has never been recognised.  The Western Saharan question is a decolonisation issue, as has been recognised by the United Nations which put in place a peace plan, on which very slow progress has been made.  Much dissatisfaction was expressed internationally at the lack of progress by the former Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Gali, in implementing that peace plan.  I am somewhat heartened by the efforts of Mr. Annan, the new Secretary General, in this regard and particularly by the appointment of a special representative, Mr. Baker who, I hope, will help to make progress on this issue.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the International Court of Justice expressed the view that there was no evidence of territorial sovereignty over Western Sahara by neighbouring countries, including Morocco and Mauritania.  They gave full support to the principle of self-determination.  I would like clarification that this agreement applies only to the state of Morocco as recognised internationally and that the political dialogue clauses in the agreement will be used in the strongest possible way to force Morocco to co-operate with the international community in its renewed efforts to achieve self-determination for the people of Western Sahara. Much of the difficulty is focused on allegations that Morocco has tried, by subterfuge, to register ineligible people to vote in Western Sahara and has tried, through human rights abuses, to prevent eligible people from registering.  Irish military personnel are engaged in observing the ceasefire there.  A number of Irish people, including gardaÌ, have served with the United Nations force in the area, which gives us a leading role in trying to achieve a solution to this long-running problem.</P>
    <P>Under the EU-Morocco agreement what mechanisms will be put in place to ensure human rights abuses, of which we have heard evidence, perpetrated by Morocco in Western Sahara are recognised by the European Union?  What channels will be used to persuade Morocco to bring them to an end?  The evidence we heard from people living in camps in Algeria of the treatment meted out to them within their own territory in Western Sahara and of lack of support from the international community for their plight was shocking.  I ask the Minister, in providing for future aid allocations, to ensure that the plight of these people, particularly the need for education and health facilities and the development of women's rights, is recognised.</P>
    <P>It has been put to me that the best way to get action from Morocco in this instance is to delay ratification of the agreement.  I have considered the agreement carefully and it contains provisions which, if used properly, monitored correctly and reported to the European Union common foreign <Col N="78" /> and security policy mechanism and individual states, will allow us to push Morocco in the direction we wish it to go.  I do not accept the agreement should not be ratified.  We should, however, give the necessary assurances to the people of the Western Sahara that the agreement covers only the state of Morocco as recognised internationally and that the opportunities for human rights monitoring, observation and reporting will be used to the fullest in the case of the Morocco agreement to ensure their right to self-determination is upheld by the European Union and that we will use our voice at the United Nations to do so.</P>
    <P>In the context of the EU entering political dialogue with Morocco, we should use our voice as an independent state to push Morocco in the desired direction.  We should use our aid budget to ensure the natives of the western Sahara, who are in refugee camps mainly in Algeria, are assisted in maintaining the best possible standards of education and social welfare for their people.  We should assist them in their efforts to be recognised as a people and a state and, in particular, we should work with the UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan and his representative, Mr. Baker, to put pressure on the Moroccans to abide by what the international community has expressed in words, but not followed up in deeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and I have noted the comments made, particularly those on the question of human rights, and we will bring them to the attention of the T·naiste and the Department.</P>
      <P>The European Union's commitment to become more actively involved in the socio-economic development of the countries of the Mediterranean region is at the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership launched in Barcelona in November 1995.  Ireland supports the initiative as an essential recognition of the interdependence of the two regions.  Links already forged by geography and history are now continued by links in such areas as environment, energy and migration.</P>
      <P>The basic Iong-term objectives being pursued by the European Union and its 12 southern partners is to transform the Mediterranean region into a zone of peace, stability and prosperity.  The success of this will be measured by the willingness and capacity of the EU to encourage the necessary economic and social reforms and by the determination of its partners to implement the required changes.</P>
      <P>The agreements are wide-ranging and cover political dialogue, liberalisation of trade and capital movements and sectoral co-operation.  They also stipulate that relations between the parties are to be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles.  The importance of these and other similar agreements in terms of the overall effort of the EU to support the political and economic development of its southern neighbours has been set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the differing views on the EU-Israel Association Agreement, Deputies were united in their concern about the future of the Middle East <Col N="79" /> peace process and Israel's human rights behaviour.The gravity of the current position and the need to get the peace process back on track was a theme common to all interventions.  A number of Members underlined forcefully their concern that Israel may evade its obligations under the political dialogue provision of the agreement, and that the EU, under the terms of the agreement, may be unable to compel Israel to comply with its human rights obligations.</P>
    <P>Obviously, a major concern of Members is the economic plight of the Palestinians and the negative consequences of this for the future of the Palestinian track.  The Government shares all those concerns.  As Deputy Shatter requested, we will also ensure that a fair and balanced approach is adopted when dealing with the problems in the Middle East and the Government and the European Union will pursue any flagrant human rights infringements without fear or favour.</P>
    <P>Our priority is to do what we can during the current downturn in the peace process to restore the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on the basis of the principles agreed at the Madrid Conference in 1991 and the agreements reached between the two sides so far.  We believe the association agreements with Israel and the PLO can complement these negotiations.  By assisting the economic development of the region they can underpin a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>In the past, the role of the EU in the Middle East peace process consisted mainly of setting out the broad principles in declarations on which a solution could be reached, giving support to the parties and to the US in its quest for a solution and financially underwriting Palestinian development efforts to help with the emergence of a new Palestinian identity.  The EU became the largest donor, but did not have a direct political influence on the parties commensurate with its economic input.  This produced considerable frustration, especially when the peace process lurched to a crisis which began with the suicide bombings in Israel in February and March last year.  The EU was unable to lend the direct political assistance to the peace process it would have liked.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency of the EU we set out to rectify the imbalance between the EU's economic and political roles by creating the mechanism of Special Envoy.  With the establishment of the Special Envoy, the EU has begun to achieve its ambition of having a more active role in the peace process, complementary to that of the US.  At the time of the Hebron Agreement in January, it was agreed for the first time that the EU had a direct role in overseeing the implementation of an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>In a letter from the Netherlands Foreign Minister, Mr. Hans Van Mierlo, President of the Council of Ministers, to the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Madeleine Albright, the EU recently proposed a basis for the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian <Col N="80" /> negotiations and the relaunching of the peace process.  This would involve both parties reaffirming their adherence to the principles of Madrid and committing themselves to implementing agreements already signed.  To strengthen Israeli-Palestinian co-operation, a permanent committee on security would be created which should not break down under any circumstances.Both parties would commit themselves not to take actions that could prejudge permanent status issues.  This would imply Israel suspending construction activities in Har Homa-Jebel Abu Ghneim.  The parties would also resume their negotiations on the final status of the Palestinian territories and the closure of the territories would be eased without delay.</P>
    <P>As regards implementation of agreements already signed between Israel and the Palestinians, Ireland, with our EU partners, wants Israel to take positive steps to alleviate the economic plight of the Palestinians, including the early lifting of the closures, to give a guarantee of safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank, to lift obstacles to international aid efforts and to complete infrastructural projects, such as Gaza Airport and Gaza Harbour.</P>
    <P>The recent debates within the bodies of the Council and this House, as well as in other EU parliaments, will underline to our Mediterranean partners the seriousness with which the EU approaches the political dialogue provisions and the human rights clause in the association agreements.For Ireland's part, I hope Members will accept that the activism we showed, during our period in the Presidency, regarding the need for the EU to prepare for the political dialogue established by the association agreements underlines our commitment to the maintenance of democratic standards.  We enter this new stage of our Mediterranean partnership with a positive intention to contribute to the stability and prosperity of the region and in a spirit of optimism for its future, but determined that this can be achieved only on the basis of a common respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  Approval by D·il …ireann of the terms of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with Israel and Morocco will constitute an important and necessary step in the overall process of transformation of the Mediterranean region.</P>
    <P>In regard to the European agreement with Slovenia, assuming the successful conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in June, the commencement of negotiations leading to a further enlargement of the European Union is now in sight.  We are on the threshold of developments which are of historic and fundamental importance to Europe, the European Union and its member states, including Ireland.  The necessary preparatory work including the preparation of Commission opinions on the applicant countries, the assessment of the impact of future enlargement on the Union's common policies and the study on its future financing post-1999 in the perspective of enlargement, is under way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> Approval by D·il …ireann today of the European Agreement with Slovenia will give an important and timely signal to that country, which is one of the most economically advanced countries of central and eastern Europe, of Ireland's positive approach to future enlargement and of our support for its efforts aimed at the consolidation of democracy and economic reform.</P>
    <P>There are 150 million people waiting to join European Union.  The GNP of the 11 countries in which those people live would probably add up to the GNP of the Netherlands.  We face an enormous challenge, but we also face a great opportunity. In the first half of this century 60 million people lost their lives in Europe in two World Wars.  The European Union has ensured peace and stability in western Europe and unprecedented prosperity. If we can extend that peace and stability across Europe, the prosperity we have come to take for granted in western Europe will continue and it will be extended to our neighbours in central and eastern Europe.  That is good news for our children and grandchildren as we approach the next millennium.  We welcome this great challenge. We will turn it into a great opportunity &mdash; no greater one have we faced this century.  It should not be seen simply in terms of what it will cost us or what we will have to share.  There is a huge market waiting for developed economies like ours to reap the benefits of these additional markets, <Col N="82" /> but there is also a great opportunity for us to share peace, stability and prosperity with our neighbours in Europe.</P>
    <P>I commend the agreements with the four countries concerned to the House for its approval.</P>

      <P>That D·il …ireann, recognising the arbitrary and unfair way in which national lottery funds are currently distributed, the lack of openness, transparency and accountability in the process, and the lack of any set application or qualification criteria for the making of lottery grants, calls on the Government to:</P>
      <P>(a)  review current procedures for the disbursement of lottery funds;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The national lottery was designed to be a new source of funding for projects in sport, the arts, culture and community health. Unfortunately, it has been used instead to substitute for Exchequer financing and that is its problem.The distribution of lottery funds is subject to political control and decisions can be made by Ministers on an arbitrary basis.  No organisation is responsible for disbursing lottery money.  There are no set application procedures and no set qualifying criteria.  The system, as it currently operates, lacks openness, transparency and accountability.  As a result, public confidence in it is low.</P>
      <P>Our solution is that an independent charitable trust must be established to take responsibility for the distribution of lottery funds.  This trust would distribute the available surplus equally across four designated areas and equitably across the country.  The four areas we have specified are: sport and youth, arts and culture, national heritage and voluntary groups.  The Minister for Finance would appoint trust members from nominees of sporting, cultural and voluntary groups. The trust would establish common procedures for grant applicants and ensure that clear qualifying criteria would be satisfied.  The new system would help ensure lottery money was used to provide badly needed social, sporting and cultural facilities for the areas of greatest deprivation.</P>
      <P>The Irish national lottery has been in operation for more than ten years and has been, by any standards, highly successful in commercial and operational terms.  It has gained widespread public acceptance, has raised more than £1 billion and has helped thousands of good causes.  Despite this success, it is clear the lottery has not lived up to original expectations.  There is grave public concern about how lottery funds are distributed and the means by which beneficiaries are selected. The Progressive Democrats believe it is time for a comprehensive review of the lottery legislation with a view to making the system more open, transparent and accountable.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the national lottery ten years ago was widely welcomed by all sections of Irish society.  This was reflected by the fact that the legislation which established it was supported at the time by all parties in the Oireachtas.  The new lottery was welcomed because it was perceived to be serving a worthy purpose.  It was clearly understood by those who supported the legislation back in 1987 that the lottery surplus would be used to fund activities and developments in a number of designated areas.  Section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986, specified these as: sport and recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, arts and health of the community.  Hopes were high at the time that, with the availability of dedicated finance from the new national lottery, it would be possible to make up for years of underfunding by the State in those areas.  There was a strong belief at the time that our sports facilities, which were extremely poor by international standards, would be significantly upgraded and brought into line with those in other European countries.  I remember sport funding as one of the main selling points of the original lottery proposal.</P>
      <P>The concept of additionality was also a key principle for the original promoters of the idea of a national lottery.  Any lottery funding going to the designated areas would be in addition to existing financial contributions from the State. There was a general acceptance that lottery money would not be used to substitute for Exchequer support.  Ten years on, it is abundantly clear that things have worked out very differently and that the way in which the national lottery surplus is now distributed is not what was envisaged in the original plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the current system.  The national lottery surplus is now used almost like a political slush fund.  Those of us who are lobbied by various community and sports groups in our <Col N="85" /> constituencies are well aware of this.  We know money is distributed on a largely arbitrary basis by the Government.  Ministers have more personal discretion over how lottery money is spent than they have over the funds voted to their Departments by the Oireachtas.  This is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory organisation with overall responsibility for the distribution of lottery funds, no set application procedure for those seeking lottery money for specific projects and no set qualifying criteria to determine which projects qualify for lottery funding.  There is no financial report on how funds are spent and whether or not we are getting value for public money.  There is no political accountability with no Government Minister being answerable to the Oireachtas.  No other tranche of public money is disbursed in such a cavalier fashion.  This is clearly a most unsatisfactory state of affairs, which should not and cannot be tolerated in any parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, and totally at odds with what was originally envisaged, the lottery surplus is now widely used to substitute for Exchequer funding. Lottery allocations are used to finance spending commitments across a range of Government activities under almost every departmental heading.The 1986 legislation contains a clause which allows the surplus to be spent not just on the designated good causes but also &ldquo;for such other purposes as the Government may determine from time to time&rdquo;.  The flexibility provided by this clause is being abused.  Instead of being a source of dedicated funding, the lottery surplus is now so widely disbursed, it has had little real effect in any of the areas specified in the original legislation.</P>
    <P>There are system failures and the inadequacies of the existing system have done much to erode public confidence in the lottery concept.  The current arrangements have given rise to serious problems which must be addressed.  The first relates to political favouritism.  It is wrong that lottery grants should be made on this basis.  Ministers responsible for sport especially have often been unable to rise above parochial politics and have clearly favoured their constituencies. Another difficulty is unfair distribution.  It is wrong that the poor should be asked to subsidise the lifestyles of the rich.</P>
    <P>It is seen as a scandal that lottery money is given to golf clubs.  This money could provide much needed recreational facilities in disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>When the lottery was first proposed in 1984, it was envisaged that funds would be channelled solely into sport.  Today sport receives less than 15 per cent of the lottery surplus and remains heavily under-funded by European standards. Lottery funds could be used to support flagship public projects which might not otherwise be viable.  This has not happened.  The lottery bonanza has produced no great stadium, museum or cultural centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> These factors have not deterred the public from playing the lottery.  Punters play out of a desire to win, this week the jackpot is £2.5 million.People do not play out of altruism.  However, the disbursement of funds has contributed to the growing cynicism about politicians, the political process and the institutions of Government.  If we are to rebuild public confidence in the political process the national lottery is a good place to start.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that it is time the principles of openness, transparency and accountability were applied to the management and disbursement of the national lottery surplus. We will seek to have such a commitment included in the 1997-2002 programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The process for the disbursement of the national lottery surplus must be firmly placed on a statutory footing.  The National Lottery Act, 1986, did not adequately deal with the administrative arrangements governing the disbursement of the surplus.  That legislation must be amended to stipulate that the surplus can be used only to fund projects in four specific areas, with each being guaranteed 25 per cent of the total allocation.In the interests of equity these areas should be sport and youth, arts, culture and the Irish language, national heritage and voluntary groups.  With regard to voluntary groups, the emphasis should be on assisting groups which provide help to the poor, the sick, the disabled and the elderly.</P>
    <P>This statutory framework would ensure that the money went where it was supposed to go. Each of the four areas would be guaranteed an annual subvention of approximately £25 million. The flexibility clause in section 5 of the 1986 Act must also be deleted.  This will prevent the abuse of the system whereby lottery money has been used to substitute for Exchequer funding and disbursed across the spectrum of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>These reforms will not be sufficient on their own.  If we are serious about restoring public confidence in the system we must recognise the need for a totally new set of legal and administrative arrangements for dealing with the disbursement of lottery money.  This means depoliticising the process.  The 1986 Act must be amended to provide for the establishment of an independent, charitable trust which would have the sole responsibility for all aspects of the disbursement of lottery funds.  The members of that trust could be appointed for a five year term by the Minister for Finance from nominations submitted by designated bodies in the areas of sport, youth, culture, heritage and the voluntary sector.  The trust would rationalise the administration of the lottery surplus and would be required to ensure common application procedures.  This would mean that all applicants would compete for funding on a level playing field with everyone completing the same form.</P>
    <P>All applications in each of the four designated areas would be assessed against the same qualifying criteria.  A fully audited annual report would be submitted to the Minister for Finance giving <Col N="87" /> full details of all receipts and expenditure.  Value for money audits should be carried out on a periodic basis to confirm that public money is being properly and prudently expended.  The Chairperson of the trust would attend before a public session of an Oireachtas committee at least once a year to account for their stewardship and to answer questions from elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Such a system would bring openness and transparency to the disbursement of lottery money. Taking lottery money out of the world of political favours would also move us another step away from clientelist politics.  It would confirm confidence in the body politic which is under such attack.</P>
    <P>We could achieve a great deal with lottery money if it were properly targeted.  Investment in sporting facilities would help provide a real alternative to the drugs and crime culture which prevails in areas of social deprivation.  Investment in heritage projects would improve our built environment and boost our tourism industry.  Investment in the voluntary sector would be a cost-effective way of delivering help at community level to those who need it most.</P>
    <P>The full potential of the national lottery will not be realised while we persist with our present scatter-gun approach, disbursing relatively small amounts of money across different areas on the basis of political favouritism.  We need a fresh start.  The bulk of lottery money should go towards providing badly needed social and cultural facilities, particularly in deprived areas.  The Progressive Democrats want lottery money to be properly used to provide recreation and diversion in the disadvantaged areas where they are so badly needed.  Young people in these areas have practically no facilities.  There is a direct link between facilities available to young people and the dangers for those who have no place to go.</P>
    <P>One of our primary target areas is youth and sport.  The value of sport is incalculable.  It is critical to give young people the types of facilities which are so badly needed in a comprehensive and cohesive way.  We have a new Sports Council and sport is finally being addressed.  If we are to grasp this opportunity it is essential that we provide proper funding.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the involvement of girls in sport.  At a meeting I attended today dealing with sport I heard a frightening statistic, that only 2 per cent of girls in the over 16 age group take part in sport.  This is surprising when one considers how critical it is for the health and well-being of our children and shows how much we need to address this issue.  There are many other issues in which we are falling down.  This has been one of the scandals of the disbursement of lottery funds.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we have twice as many golf clubs as playgrounds.  Our children deserve a better deal and we deserve a better method of disbursing national lottery funds.  I do not want to have to write begging letters on behalf of clubs on the off chance that I will gain the ear of the <Col N="88" /> relevant Minister.  That is totally inappropriate in any democracy when dealing with public funds contributed in all good faith.  Neither do I think the public is properly aware of the manner in which national lottery funds are disbursed.  That must be brought to its attention, which is the reason my party has set out the appropriate parameters within which we foresee this being done.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to learn that the Fianna F·il Party intends supporting our motion.  In what I believe to be its penultimate days in office the Government cannot really hold up its head and say it honestly believes in its amendment to this motion, which is a total sham.  Unless we have transparent, accountable methods of disbursement of national lottery funds we shall be doing our people a total disservice and no Government should have that on its collective conscience.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that we should have to rely on the strength an individual Minister can muster to provide funding in particular areas.  Nor do we want to hear about the type of nod-wink politics, with people sniggering about Ministers going around with cheques in their pockets for various deserving causes.  That is not the manner in which business should be conducted; it should be totally above board.  No moneys should be used as any part of some type of political slush/re-election fund.  It is essential that, in all our public dealings, we are and be seen to be above board.  Public confidence in the disbursement of national lottery funds, to some extent, should restore confidence in the body politic and politicians in general, a very good place to start with public representatives being held in such disregard.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to reconsider its attitude to this motion and support us in the interests of those principles they claim to favour, openness, transparency and accountability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and the views expressed by Deputy Keogh.</P>
      <P>The purpose of our motion is to re-emphasise and restore accountability in the system through which national lottery funds surpluses are distributed by the powers that be to various projects.</P>
      <P>The national lottery is now very well established and is a very enjoyable feature of Irish life, with much goodwill on the part of our citizens. Notwithstanding its undoubted success and the people's real enthusiasm for it, ten years on it is important to re-examine the intentions of the then Government on its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of the national lottery can be traced back to 1979 when the then Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Jim Tunney, first floated the idea of a sports lottery, the original intention being that it fund sporting activities.  Yet it is disappointing to note a distinct degree of discontent across a broad range of our people, that sport, rather than being the principal beneficiary, is perceived to be only one of many, with insufficient focus being devoted to or benefit bestowed on sport generally.That view is often expressed to public representatives by members of the general public, <Col N="89" /> who will say to us at our clinics, or when we meet them in pubs or at sporting events that with all of the goodwill surrounding the establishment of the national lottery, it was an awful pity that sport had not been seen to be the main beneficiary.  The public sees through this maladministration, that its funds are being disbursed in a scattered, indiscriminate fashion across a plethora of good causes.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to re-read the debates at the time the National Lottery Bill was going through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For example, in 1982, before its introduction, the then Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, sent a memorandum to the then Taoiseach formally proposing a national lottery for sport, which was dispatched immediately to the Departments of Finance and Justice for examination as to its feasibility.  A national lottery was first formally proposed in the then national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> published in 1984.  Unfortunately, a section of that Bill, which introduced flexibility <i>vis-‡-vis</i> its beneficiaries or the causes on which its funds could be expended presented problems, which has led us to our present position, affording, as it does, the Minister flexibility to use those funds for general good causes as distinct from the aims specified in the original Bill.  While it is clear that national lottery funds were intended for sport in general gradually other ministries promoted their portfolios. For example, art was included &mdash; which I welcome &mdash; but, because of that catch-all section which allows the Minister discretion to determine other good causes, allowing those funds to be disbursed over a wide range of areas, its original focus has been lost.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Government Information Service announced that the beneficiaries of the national lottery would be sport and recreation, arts and culture, including the Irish language, and the health of the community.  The Bill was passed in July 1986.  Section 5 specified that the proceeds of the national lottery be applied in such amounts as the Government may determine for the purpose of sport, recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, art and the health of the community and for such other purposes as the Government might determine from time to time. That last clause is the source of all our problems.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Bill Members foresaw problems in relation to the open-ended capacity of any Government to use the funds &ldquo;for such other purposes as the Government may determine from time to time.&rdquo; For example, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, as reported at column 1238 of the Official Report of 25 June 1986, said:</P>
    <P>Into the greedy coffers and the avaricious jaws of the Government's tax purse will go the punts and shillings of the ordinary punter.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed that too much power was being vested in the Minister of the day, that it was unclear what projects would benefit from the proceeds of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> At the time Deputy Leyden of Fianna F·il and Deputy Liam Cosgrave of Fine Gael proposed that the matter be taken entirely out of the hands of Government, arguing that its funds be administered on a non-political basis by a non-political group, including representatives of sporting and national organisations.  They argued that the distribution of its funds should be undertaken by an independent group and should not be used as a top-up by the Departments of Finance and Education, which arguments were dismissed.</P>
    <P>In the course of Committee Stage a clear commitment was given that there was no intention to use national lottery funds for general Government purposes, that its entire proceeds would be accounted for in a completely visible manner, as reported at columns 1857-1861 of the Official Report of 1 July 1986.  This all-purpose section was challenged in the House.  Therefore, it was clear from the very beginning that there were concerns in both Houses that its overall administration and management was much too loose, was open to political favouritism, to lack of transparency and accountability with, of course, the overall matter of additionality being crucial.  It was claimed that those funds should be additional to Government moneys and not a substitute.</P>
    <P>Despite the outstanding success of the national lottery, I am very disappointed at the residual feeling of discontent with it among the electorate. It is clear from any analysis of lottery spending that sport has been a poor relation and that a whole variety of undoubtedly good causes have been the beneficiaries of particular allocations. There is no specific pattern of allocations.  Funds are not neatly channelled into individual Government Departments.  Different Government Departments may receive lottery money under one, two, three or four of the broad categorisations.So numerous are the various Departments in receipt of lottery funding, it is easier to indicate those Departments who do not use lottery funding &mdash; Justice, Marine, Enterprise and Employment and Equality and Law Reform.  Apart from those Departments all other Departments use lottery funding.  They use it instead of, and not in addition to, Exchequer funding, to which they are entitled and about which there is, at least, transparency.Lottery allocations are spread over 13 Votes and 13 subheads.</P>
    <P>Sport is important.  The Government has devoted considerable resources to it.  The recent report, targeting sporting change in Ireland, states that sport is an essential element of the balanced lifestyle which is necessary for healthy living, enjoyment and socialisation.  Sport and sport services were stated to be the greatest preventive element in the fight against crime and drugs.  A national plan has been announced for sport.  It is high time sport was recognised as a major contributor in diverting young people in disadvantaged areas particularly, and in all areas, away from drugs and other mischief.</P>
    <P>The Minister who commissioned this glossy and worthy report is the same Minister who presides over the improper disbursement of lottery <Col N="91" /> funding.  This is a source of great concern to the public.  All Members know it is used for political favouritism.  It is noticeable that more money is spent in constituencies where there is a Minister. That is not good enough.  It is not transparent and it flies in the face of openness to which this Government espouses.  There are no flagship sporting projects.  We should be able to point to particular sporting flagship projects.  For example, it would be marvellous if we were able to say the special Olympics could be hosted in Ireland in the year 2003.</P>
    <P>The special Olympics Ireland provides sports training and competition programmes for all people with a learning disability.  This is an important service provided on a low annual budget of £350,000.  Only 11 per cent of funding comes from the public sector, lottery funding.  In other words, 89 per cent of its funding has to be raised by sponsorship and constant fund raising by the dedicated group of people who work with handicapped people and people with a disability.</P>
    <P>This is a 32 county organisation.  There are 26,000 people with a learning disability in Ireland, 12,000 of whom are involved in the special Olympics.  What greater flagship than to guarantee proper funding for such an organisation?  Our athletes in the special Olympics did extremely well this year when they competed in America.  If funding could be guaranteed, it would be a great tribute to those athletes with special disabilities.</P>
    <P>The motion, as my colleague has outlined, seeks to put in place a completely new and revised structure, introduces focus, transparency and accountability, all of which are aspirations we hear about regularly and on which the Government claims to have a strong mandate.  I support the motion and look forward to hearing the contributions of other Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;D·il …ireann, acknowledging the contribution made by the National Lottery towards the funding of areas such as sport and other recreation, arts and culture, youth and welfare, notes:</P>
      <P>(a) that over the period 1987-1996 allocations of National Lottery funds totalling approximately £700m have been made for the purposes approved under the National Lottery Act, 1986;</P>
      <P>(b) that details of National Lottery allocations are contained in the annual Estimates Volumes and Appropriation Accounts; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) that a National Lottery Review Group is currently examining the allocation of Lottery funds with a view to ensuring maximum transparency in the <Col N="92" /> allocation of the Lottery surplus with particular reference to the allocations of financial support for voluntary (for example, sporting and community) agencies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The national lottery recently celebrated ten years of successful operation.  I welcome the opportunity for the House to consider some of the key issues related to the lottery.  I have no hesitation in saying the national lottery has been a success.</P>
    <P>Already it has provided over £700 million for activities such as sport and youth, arts and culture and has supported initiatives in favour of the health and welfare of the community.  Without the existence of the national lottery, this funding would not have been possible.  As with many successful developments, the benefits of the lottery today are quite different from what it was possible to envisage at the outset.  There was general support for its establishment and this confidence has been vindicated.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall the origins of the lottery in the undertaking in 1984 in the Government White Paper &mdash; Building on Reality &mdash; which indicated the Government of the day was anxious, despite the financial situation at the time, that additional funding should be provided for sport.  The Government decided a national lottery should be established, part of the proceeds of which would be allocated to the promotion of sport.  The success of lotteries in other countries indicated substantial amounts could be raised from a national lottery here.</P>
    <P>As I shall discuss later, it is the very success of the national lottery in generating funds for the beneficiary categories which has given rise, from time to time, to issues of controversy.  As might be expected, demands for lottery funding consistently exceed the resources available and it is natural that those who apply and do not receive funding will be disappointed.  This in itself should not be misconstrued as unfairness or mispropriety in the disbursement of lottery grants which are subject, in all respects, to similar controls as apply to public spending generally.  Nonetheless, it is important the lottery's players and the public should have confidence in the methods by which funds are allocated and that there would be maximum transparency.</P>
    <P>To this end the Government has appointed a national lottery review group with an independent chairperson and two other independent members as well as representatives of the main Government Departments which administer lottery funding.  The chairperson is Mr. Niall Greene and the other two independent members of the group are Mr. Richard Burrows of Irish Distillers and Dr. Kathleen Lynch of UCD.  The group is expected to submit its report to the Minister for Finance shortly.</P>
    <P>It is clear public trust and confidence are of paramount importance to the operation of a national lottery.  The National Lottery Act, 1986, contains comprehensive provisions to protect the public interest and secure the integrity of the national lottery on behalf of the players.  The <Col N="93" /> experience of the past ten years demonstrates the national lottery has been operated by the national lottery company, a subsidiary company of An Post, with absolute integrity and has continually maintained the confidence of all.  There has always been justifiable concern regarding the purposes to which the lottery surpluses might be applied.  The allocation of the lottery surplus is a matter for Government, subject to the provisions of the National Lottery Act 1986.  The surplus represents about 33p in every pound spent by the players.</P>
    <P>In the course of the passage of the National Lottery Bill through the Oireachtas in 1986, the Oireachtas approved the decision to provide specifically for the qualifying categories while including provision for additional purposes should Government so decide.  Section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986, provides for the use of the proceeds of the lottery for:</P>
    <P>the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time.</P>
    <P>When lottery sales spectacularly exceeded original expectations, the following were added to the original list of qualifying categories: youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.  The Government also approved the allocation of lottery moneys, on a once-off basis, to the Dublin Millennium in 1988 and EXPO '92.  It should be clear therefore that lottery moneys may only be used for the stated purposes.  It should be appreciated, however, that lottery funding, as decided by successive Governments, exists side by side in many cases with general Government funding, for example, in the case of publicly funded initiatives supporting the health and welfare of the community.</P>
    <P>To acknowledge this fact is not to deny the vocation of the lottery to provide additional funds for specific purposes.  It is a recognition that when the lottery surplus was many times greater than originally envisaged, successive Governments have naturally had to establish priorities for lottery funding in the context of overall public and social expenditure priorities.  One of those Governments included the Progressive Democrats.It is also the case that, but for the lottery, it would not have been possible to maintain funding for many discretionary grant schemes.  Moreover, many lottery funded schemes have secured increased allocations which compared favourably with the general trend of public expenditures.</P>
    <P>From the outset, the proceeds of the national lottery considerably exceeded expectations.  I will briefly outline the main developments which indicate the growth of the national lottery over the past ten years.  In 1987, the first year of operations &mdash; when the National Lottery Company was selling <Col N="94" /> scratch cards only &mdash; sales amounted to £102.4 million, compared with an estimate of just £22.5 million included in the 1987 budget, that is, nearly five times as much as estimated.</P>
    <P>In the following year &mdash; April 1988 &mdash; the lotto game was introduced with one draw each week on Saturday nights.  It was originally based on a 36 number matrix and was an immediate success.  By 1990, lotto sales had outgrown the sale of instant tickets.  In May 1990, a second lotto draw, the midweek draw, was introduced on Wednesday nights.  The lotto matrix was increased from 36 numbers to 39 in August 1992 and to 42 in September 1994.  In 1996, the turnover of the national lottery amounted to almost £308 million per annum, of which approximately two-thirds were lotto sales and one-third instant ticket sales.  A sum of £101 million, which corresponds to about one-third of all sales, was contributed to the national lottery fund for distribution to the beneficiary fund.  Sales have steadily grown, but the spectacularly rapid increases of the early days are unlikely to be repeated.  Spending on lottery products is tending to even out at about 0.7 per cent of personal consumer spending.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has been a highly successful generator of funding for a wide range of projects in sectors such as sports, youth, arts and culture, and the health of the community.  In this way there is a tangible return to the community.  The benefits have been spread from national organisations catering, for example, for youth and sport or for the arts, to community and voluntary bodies at local level.  The common denominator in all lottery funding has been a valuable contribution to a deserving cause, an injection of funding made possible by the success of the lottery.  I will briefly outline some of the main schemes shortly.</P>
    <P>It was decided in 1990 that allocations of lottery funding should be shown in specially designated national lottery subheads under the relevant Votes in the annual Estimates publications. This was intended to provide a clear presentation of the relevant allocations in the context of public expenditure provisions.  A table showing all the subheads in the Estimates which include national lottery funded projects, together with the actual amounts provided in the subheads, is included as an appendix to the Estimates volume, thus bringing the lottery funded items together in a single place for information.  The amounts are also shown in the Estimates for the various Departments concerned.  If an activity is financed both from the lottery and from Exchequer revenue, there are two separate subheads in the relevant Estimate to make this clear.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for the operation of the national lottery, in accordance with the National Lottery Act, 1986, the Government decides the lottery allocations.  In practice, these decisions are taken in the context of decisions on the annual Estimates.Each Minister is answerable to the D·il for lottery funded expenditure within his or her functional area.  Lottery funding for youth and sport, for example, is administered by the Minister <Col N="95" /> for Education.  In practice, the Government considers provisions for lottery funded subheads during the annual Estimates process in the same way as it considers the spending Estimates generally.Spending Departments propose how much should be allocated to lottery aided subheads and the Government makes reductions if the amounts sought exceed the available resources.</P>
    <P>When departmental allocations under the subheads have been settled by Government, it becomes largely a matter for the spending Departments to allocate the funds within the approved subhead provision among individual projects or schemes in accordance with the terms of those schemes.  Lottery funding is limited to the designated categories as opposed to being available for general Government spending purposes.This is entirely in line with the approach taken when the lottery was being established. However, the allocations policy which evolved under successive Governments allowed a somewhat wider application of the lottery surplus than might originally have been envisaged in so far as, soon after 1989, the lottery sales had so greatly exceeded the initial estimates that the funds available to the Exchequer as a result were very much greater than when the initial policy decisions were taken.</P>
    <P>There was a major retrenchment in public spending during the late 1980s.  To ease the impact of the reductions in public spending, certain items were transferred to lottery funding. This helped to cushion the impact of the reductions in public spending, while nonetheless allowing additional spending at a considerably higher level than was envisaged when the lottery was introduced.</P>
    <P>There have been various reports into the operation of the national lottery and the distribution of the surplus.  It is interesting to look briefly at some of the main findings in so far as they can contribute to better understanding of the main issues in lottery funding.  I will refer first to the report of the all party working group of 1988-89. The group's main recommendation was that the allocation of funds among the eligible categories should continue to be determined by the Government.This position has been maintained by successive Administrations, including the one in which the Progressive Democrats participated, on the grounds that this framework is evidently the most suitable and contributes to the greatest degree of parliamentary accountability.  I will return to the independent board later.  The all &mdash; party group also recommended that lottery funds should not be used to substitute for funding previously provided from normal Exchequer sources to finance core programmes which are the responsibility of Government Departments.  This recommendation was not accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies inquired into the National Lottery Company in 1990.  While the joint committee was primarily concerned with the <Col N="96" /> commercial operations of the National Lottery Company, it made suggestions for improved public information regarding the many uses to which lottery surpluses are directed.  This is a practical issue on which considerable progress has been made in recent years and to which the present Government is strongly committed.</P>
    <P>The joint committee considered that the existing range of beneficiary categories was sufficiently broad and recommended against any widening of the list which would result in spreading the level of support too thinly and losing the impact of the fund.  Some members of the joint committee expressed concern about the adverse publicity which surrounded some decisions on the disbursement of moneys from the lottery.  It recommended that more information be published on projects assisted from the lottery and the publication of clearer information for the benefit of applicants on application procedures. The committee recommended continuous monitoring of the social impact of the lottery.</P>
    <P>Arising from its examination of the 1991 appropriation accounts, the Committee of Public Accounts requested the Comptroller and Auditor General to undertake a detailed examination of the arrangements for the administration of lottery grants.  This examination made a number of general recommendations aimed at ensuring a transparent and equitable system.  While the investigation indicated some shortcomings in adherence to standard procedures, it did not find any evidence of impropriety in the administration of grants in any of the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts made recommendations aimed at ensuring as far as possible that there were standard application forms, clear criteria for making grants and adequate procedures for follow-up to ensure the funds were spent as intended.  The detailed recommendations included the following in relation to the applications and decision-making process for lottery grants: there should be a standard application form for lottery grants which, apart from the normal details, as a minimum sets out the purpose for which the grant is being sought, the number of people who benefit from the work of the organisation seeking the grant and the sources of the organisation's funding, separately identifying sources of State funding to prevent possible overlap or duplication; there should be a structured process to ensure objectivity in evaluating competing applications for funding by reference to agreed predetermined criteria; the recommendations of the line section in the Department should clearly show the justification for the grant and its amount.</P>
    <P>Following the Public Accounts Committee report, the Department of Finance issued a revised, updated and consolidated circular to Departments covering all aspects of administration of national lottery grants.  The guidelines were designed to ensure that clear criteria apply for each discretionary scheme, that all interested <Col N="97" /> persons will have due opportunity to apply for the funding available and that all applications are treated on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>Monitoring to ensure the funds have been used for the purpose approved is an important feature in all lottery funding.  This is particularly so where funds are issued to an organisation which may not have had much experience in handling public funds.  In practice, all lottery funded spending, as allocated by Government, is authorised by the relevant Minister for services operated under the aegis of their Departments, including, in many cases, voluntary and community groups.  All these areas such as eligibility criteria, method of submitting applications and availability of information are being investigated by the National Lottery Review Group.</P>
    <P>The main lottery funded schemes under the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht are the grant-in-aid funds for Bord na Gaeilge, Ciste na Gaeilge, the Heritage Council and An Chomhairle Ealaion, the Arts Council.  Up to the end of 1996, £171 million had been provided for projects in the categories of arts, culture and the national heritage.</P>
    <P>Lottery funding for youth in sport is administered by the Minister for Education.  Full details of grant-in-aid from lottery funds to help support and promote the development of sport are given in the Department of Education's annual report Sport in Ireland which acknowledges the substantial sports funding made possible by the sustained success of the lottery.  Grants are paid to the national governing bodies of sport to assist with costs of administration, coaching, specialist equipment, athlete support, increasing participation and raising standards.  Capital grants are paid towards the provision of sport and community recreational activities, comprising the major facilities scheme and the recreational facilities scheme.</P>
    <P>In the youth area, there are a number of schemes at national level to support the operations of recognised voluntary youth work organisations and at local level, mainly through vocational education committees and youth organisations, to support information services and special projects for disadvantaged young people.  The allocation in the current year for youth and sport and recreation and amenities amounts to almost £30 million.  Approximately £232 million was provided during the period 1987-96.</P>
    <P>Lottery funding for recreational facilities development is administered by the Department of the Environment for the provision of swimming pools and libraries.  The 1997 allocations amount to £3.5 million for swimming pools and £2.68 million for libraries.  In support of developments in social housing, lottery funds make a valuable contribution through the scheme for the installation of communal facilities in voluntary housing for which just over £1 million is provided in 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> Under the Department of Health, grants are paid to voluntary organisations or groups under the respite care grant scheme and the national lottery grant scheme for community-based projects under the headings of mental and physical handicap, the elderly, psychiatric services, child care services, women's refuges and personal social services, including information and counselling services.  The balance of national lottery funds allocated to the Department of Health fund ongoing services and the capital programme.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare operates a mix of once-off grant schemes and programmes of support for community and voluntary activity. Details of all schemes are set out in the Department's information booklet SW85.  There is also a separate leaflet on the community development programme, CDP.</P>
    <P>Lottery funded schemes focus on the most disadvantaged groups and communities.  To be eligible, groups must subscribe to a self-help, community development ethos and involve intended beneficiaries in management and design of the project.  In my own part of the country, community and voluntary groups which do worthwhile work such as South West Wexford Community Development Association, the Coolcotts Community Development Programme, the Windmill Therapeutic Training Unit, Piercetown and the New Ross Community Hospital all benefited from lottery funding in 1996.  The community has also benefited from allocations to the Ferrybank swimming pool and the libraries in Wexford and Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the above description, the benefits of the national lottery reach into many areas of the community.  There have been calls from time to time for the provision of detailed information on lottery grants in a single volume. At the end of 1996, my Department, with the assistance of the other Departments involved, produced a compendium of national lottery grants, a copy of which was sent to each Deputy. It provides a comprehensive listing of lottery funding and grants.  So far, it covers the period 1987-94.  Information in relation to 1995 will be published shortly.  Information in relation to 1996 will be published as soon as possible following publication of the 1996 Appropriation Accounts.</P>
    <P>Wearing my other hat on behalf of public service customers, while the compendium contains all the details and all funding is accounted for, it is not user friendly.  If one is looking for specific information, it is difficult to trace it quickly.  It is a question of layout more than anything else.  The design and layout could be improved.  While there is no question of lack of transparency in spending lottery funds, it is not idiot proof, if one is looking for specific information in a hurry.  I make this point to be objective.  In rebutting criticisms from the Opposition by way of the amendment, I am personally not satisfied that the compendium is user friendly, although I applaud the concept.  It should perhaps be redesigned to make it easier to find what one is looking for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> There have been suggestions from time to time that it would be preferable to have an independent board which would be charged with deciding the distribution of the lottery surplus.  The case generally made for such an arrangement is that it would be free from political interference.  It is also argued that an independent board would facilitate achievement of openness and transparency in lottery funded expenditure.  While the concept of an independent board may appear attractive, it would be naive to consider that such a board would find a magic formula to reconcile demand for and availability of lottery funding. There will always be criticism and cribs as long as all applicants cannot be satisfied.  That will always be the case.  Experience in other jurisdictions shows that taking the decision out of the Government arena is no guarantee that disputes and controversies will be avoided.  It is imperative that spending on beneficiary programmes should conform to the highest possible standards of public accountability and transparency.  The Government is firmly committed to this principle.</P>

      <P>Fianna F·il supports this motion as it believes it is time for a root and branch review of the national lottery and the disbursement of funding.  I am disappointed with the Government amendment as I thought it would refer to a new initiative.  However, it merely asks Members to note that £700 million was spend over the period 1987-96, that details of the allocations are included in the annual Estimates Volumes and Appropriation Accounts and that the National Lottery Review Group is currently examining the matter.  This amendment is an insult to Members. The Government is paying no heed to points made in the House or to the motion tabled by Deputy Keogh on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>There is need for a public watchdog to oversee the allocation of national lottery funding.  People do not believe that the funds are being distributed fairly or evenly.  I accept the points made by the Minister about the role of the Department of Finance and other Departments in the allocation of national lottery funding, but there is a clear view among the public and voluntary organisations that this funding is not being distributed in the way originally intended.  There is much disagreement about the purposes for which the funding is allocated.  Regardless of how evenly the funding is disbursed, once it is contained totally within Government services, is ultimately under the control of the Department of Finance and is subject to the needs of the national Exchequer in the first instance then the public will not be happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for a public watchdog to oversee the allocation of national lottery funding and to <Col N="100" /> immediately lift the cap on the prizes which can be given by charitable lotteries and to compensate these lotteries.  The Government has been repeatedly made aware of the unfair position of charitable lotteries, even to the extent that the Opposition introduced a Private Members' Bill on the matter, yet it has turned a deaf ear to the problems of these organisations.  This merely serves to reinforce people's fears that the Government will not listen to their views.</P>
    <P>There is no point referring to the position in 1979, 1986 or 1987, we must deal with the present position.  While much national lottery funding has been allocated and accounted for, the public wants a better level of information on how the money is spent.  An independent national lottery trust with power to oversee the allocation of funding would reassure the public on this point. In addition people would have an opportunity to debate its annual report which would detail how the funds are spent and make recommendations on priority areas.</P>
    <P>While the present structure ensures that many worthwhile activities receive considerable support from the national lottery, the public must be able to see that allocations are made on the basis of need and are distributed in an even handed way.  It is also important that voluntary organisations are represented on the review group.  The Minister referred to the three people on the review group.  I accept that they are excellent people but the voluntary sector has no representation on the group.  The voluntary sector plays a major role in the life of the country and its partnership is very important in the development of economic and social plans.  It is important for it to be represented on the review group so that its views can be heard and considered.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it was necessary to bolster routine departmental expenditure during the early days of the national lottery but it is time to take a fresh look at the adequacy of the allocations to sporting and disadvantaged groups and to other important areas and to consider the provision of a designated sum to voluntary organisations so that they can meet their needs and set priorities. I hope the review group takes this point on board.</P>
    <P>Even though much valuable work has been carried out during the past ten years there is much trite comment about the national lottery.  When the national lottery was established in 1986 there was not adequate money to maintain or improve many services and there were growing needs which could not be met.  It was, therefore, natural to meet these needs by allocations from the national lottery.  However, we have moved on from that and it is time to do away with this arrangement and to ensure national lottery funding is used for additional developments and services.Obviously some of these will remain as they were additional and special, but in other cases the money was used to make up extreme shortages. Given experience over the past ten years and in the knowledge that the national lottery has been <Col N="101" /> very beneficial, we should ensure that the funding is used for the purposes originally intended.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment in recent years about the building of an Olympic size swimming pool.  The intentions in this regard were very good at the start and an independent committee was set up to look at suitable locations etc.  However, it did not prove possible in the long run to build this pool.  This was not the fault of the Department of Finance or Government of the day. Nevertheless, it is time to consider where we should go from here and to recognise the ability of voluntary organisations to set their own priorities in many instances.  We should make a particular sum available to them for which they would have to account.  They should be given that degree of flexibility.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly critical of the Government's inaction in regard to removing the cap on the prize funds offered by charitable lotteries, currently fixed at £10,000 per week.  It is totally inexcusable that the cap remains at that figure.  I often support the Rehab lottery, the main lottery in this area, in my local shopping centre.  It is almost impossible for these lotteries to operate when they are tied to a national prize fund of £10,000 per week.  This situation has developed over the years and is now at crisis point.</P>
    <P>The Government's own advisory group recommended that the cap should be removed from these charitable lotteries.  The Select Committee on Legislation and Security has also recommended its removal.  The chairman of that committee, Deputy Flanagan, has been very vocal in the House on this matter, although I have not heard him speak about it recently, which bothers me.  He has stated that the cap should be removed, and that everybody was in favour of its removal.  The Oireachtas committee was unanimously in favour of removing the cap, having taken advice and considered the matter for some time.</P>
    <P>The Government's way of dealing with this issue has been to refer the report of the advisory group to yet another committee, and so we go from committee to committee.  With the new management proposals, Government will simply become a matter of committees; nobody will actually do anything.  The PR people will be very happy because they will merely have to talk about committees, the matters they are considering and how long they will sit.  This Government has probably produced a record number of committee reports.  Perhaps that is to its credit but it would be far more to its credit if action was taken in addition to the workings of these committees. It would be to the Government's credit if even one Minister examined one report and took action on it, rather than have committee reports piling one on top of another.</P>
    <P>There is an uneven playing pitch in the lottery market as far as the charitable lotteries are concerned.They are literally being wiped out by the twin steamrollers of the Irish and British national lotteries.  We had PR statements earlier to the <Col N="102" /> effect that the issue of the British national lottery was being dealt with.  I was sceptical about that at the time, and rightly so, because it was not dealt with.  With our national lottery it is trying to wipe out the charitable lotteries in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the country's best known organisations, Rehab, has seen the turnover from its lottery reduced by two-thirds, from £12 million to just over £4 million, in the past five years, yet the Government is doing nothing about it.  That organisation is catering for deprived and disadvantaged people, yet the Taoiseach, the T·naiste and the Minister for Social Welfare will hold hands tomorrow and tell us they have a national anti-poverty strategy.  They should come back down to earth, meet some of these people and do something to help them.  They should stop producing documents for a while and take action instead.  We will see another charade tomorrow in regard to a national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>The Government discovered crime a number of weeks ago.  The T·naiste stated recently that crime is a major problem.  Where has he been? He should visit my constituency.  Crime has been a major problem for a long time.  We need action, not PR statements, and that applies to the strategies for tackling disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Charities like Rehab make a vital contribution to training, community care, resource centres, respite care, home supports and other vitally important social services for people with disabilities.They meet people every day, give them training and help them in other ways, yet the Government has stood by and allowed Rehab's turnover to be reduced from £12 million to almost £4 million.I do not understand that.  I cannot believe a Government can be so cruel and hard-hearted.</P>
    <P>This is a Government of centralised thinking. The Taoiseach is hardly involved in it.  He is dictated to by Minister De Rossa who has bureaucratic, centralised ideas.  That is the reality.  If that were not the case, this Government would co-operate with the voluntary organisations and recognise they are the people doing the work.  It would support them and ensure the lottery fund assists them in two ways &mdash; through the Departments, as it is currently doing, and by giving them money and allowing them decide their own priorities.</P>
    <P>These charitable lotteries are very professional. They should be given money to get on with the job.  The Government should not try to centralise everything, but perhaps it is incapable of doing otherwise.  There is much more I would like to say on this topic but I want to share my time with Deputy Keaveney.  I ask the Government to re-examine the PD proposal and support it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  We all accept that the national lottery has been a great success and has aroused the interest of a large percentage of the population.  The manner in which the funding is disbursed is an issue that raises a similar level of interest among the public.  As previous speakers <Col N="103" /> said, after ten years it is realistic to review the lottery.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the targeting of all national lottery funding and its value to communities.  In the past year, I have spoken to many people from varying backgrounds and interests.  Prior to becoming a Member I was a teacher in a large secondary school in the heart of Creggan, in Derry city.  Within that school structure there was a large investment in music resources, in terms of instruments and teachers, with the aim of having a permanent class based staff.  As a result, children had in-school and after school activities, choir, band, ensemble or individual tuition.  They participated in feiseanna, musicals and various cultural events, both inside and outside the school.  These events were often linked to charities and benefited local communities.  The children were learning a sense of discipline, the value of working together, pride in their grouping and in their background.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea, for coming here to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>I am very angry at having to raise the very serious matter of youth homelessness tonight.  I have been involved in trying to resolve the issue of three boys in Clondalkin, the subject matter of this debate.  These boys have had very poor care in terms of counselling and little or no accommodation or emergency accommodation.  It is because I have exhausted all possible avenues open to me to deal with this matter at a local level in Clondalkin and through the Eastern Health Board that I felt compelled, because of the seriousness of the situation, to raise it in the House.</P>
      <P>There are two different families involved.  Two of the boys are members of one family and the third boy belongs to a different family and is unconnected.  Five years ago one of the families found itself in serious difficulty and suffered a serious break-up with the result that an 18 year-old daughter felt compelled to move out of home. She was accommodated by the local authority in an alternative house in her own right.  Having achieved that, she took a number of her siblings with her to care for them.  It must be remembered that this was an 18 year-old girl taking on the responsibility of caring for a number of her siblings in very difficult and distressing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past five years she has done a tremendous job on this task with the benefit of support <Col N="104" /> from a number of mothers in the area who were sympathetic to her case and who have consistently helped her over those five years to cope with the situation in which she found herself. Through time some of the boys for whom she was caring needed specialist care.  However, child care services in this area of Clondalkin, for which the Eastern Health Board is responsible, are not adequate to deal with such a crisis.  I have found, for example, that these two boys needed counselling and assistance and this was not properly and freely available to them as they required it. They also required residential accommodation when they were unable to remain in the house to which I referred, and that was not available to them either.  They were unable to gain access to the services which should be available to them under the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>We have heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, on the amount of resources he has managed to invest in the child care area.  If that is the case, it has not made a whit of difference in the Clondalkin area because nothing has improved.  In the Clondalkin area in which there are serious problems, the delivery of child care services has deteriorated and when problems are brought to the attention of the most senior officials involved in child care in the Eastern Health Board responses are not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The third boy in question is aged 16.  He has also been out of home for the past few weeks and is essentially gravitating towards the city centre. No proper residential accommodation is accessible to him and no counselling of any kind except in a haphazard way.  He is being told by health board officials that in order to get accommodation he must go, night after night, to the out of hours service, an emergency service for young people finding themselves suddenly out of home with no proper accommodation.  This service was never intended to be used or abused in this way, blocking up the system for other young people who find themselves out of home in a crisis.</P>
    <P>If what the Minister reads to the House tonight is different from my version, I will not accept it as being accurate.  I ask the Minister of State to investigate these three cases and report back to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I will attempt to deal with the issues as best I can.</P>
      <P>It is important to state at the outset that due to the current dispute involving paramedical grades in the health services &mdash; which include social workers &mdash; the information available to my Department is more limited than would normally be the case.  I would also like to clarify that issues such as these are primarily a matter for the local health board, in this case the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to these reservations, the position in so far as the Department of Health is aware is that two of the children involved from the first family <Col N="105" /> were made the subject of a Fit Persons Order in 1992.  One was placed in residential care and the other went to live with a relative following short-term foster placements.  Initially both placements were satisfactory but subsequently problems emerged with both children running away. Recently, both children were living with relatives and social workers have been in touch with them. Social workers have been told by both boys that they are happy with these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The second case concerns a 16 year old boy who has had difficulties at home and is now out of home.  He was placed by the Eastern Health Board in an emergency hostel and arrangements are being put in place to attempt to deal with some needs which have been identified.</P>
    <P>I stress that this may not be the most up-to-date position, and my colleague, Deputy Currie, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for child care, will contact Deputy Flood further if it emerges that the situation has changed significantly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, recently outlined the general position in regard to homelessness in response to a D·il question tabled by him on 25 March 1997.  Overall, since 1993, the Government has approved the development and expansion of child care and family support services, including the further expansion of services and facilities for the young homeless at a cost to date of £40 million on an annualised basis.</P>
    <P>The extent and nature of the problems of homeless children varies between health boards and between community care areas.  Health boards have taken a series of initiatives to address the problem locally with due regard to the particular nature of the problem in their areas.  These include the provision of emergency short-term places, emergency carer's projects, day projects for children who would otherwise be roaming the streets, supported lodgings, supervised accommodation and social work services.  In addition, the Eastern Health Board is recruiting foster parents to care specifically for homeless children.  Each board has arrangements in place to facilitate access to its services by out of home children in emergency situations, and the Eastern Health Board has been particularly active in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my constituency colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is the largest acute hospital in the north-east.  It is a voluntary hospital with a great reputation for health care in County Louth.  In recent times the transfer of the hospital from voluntary status to be the responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board has been agreed but not finalised.  A letter proposing major cutbacks at the hospital has led to serious concern at staff level and among those who use the hospital on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> The proposed cutbacks will devastate the level of service available to the hospital's catchment area.  When negotiations for the transfer took place, was the budget readjustment mooted at that stage?  The Medical Missionaries of Mary have given outstanding service to the counties of Louth and Meath and further afield, and the proposed cutbacks would have serious implications for staff and public alike.  This debate will afford the Minister of State at the Department of Health an opportunity to clarify his Department's intentions and allay many fears in the Drogheda area. The town of Drogheda has suffered seriously because of sluggish industrial development.  Our Lady's Hospital is the largest single employer in the town and any cutback in staff would have serious implications for the local economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this matter.  I endeavoured to raise it by way of Private Notice Question but it was ruled out of order because the matter was not considered urgent.  I also received representations from paramedical staff about their strike and, unfortunately, that question was also ruled out of order.  I am beginning to wonder how we can raise issues of immediate concern to our constituents.  Because of the insistence on rules, one wonders if the D·il is becoming more irrelevant.  If the Government wanted those questions to be answered it would have provided for that.  When we were in Government we allowed Private Notice Questions practically every day.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the points made by my colleague and wish to quote from a letter I received which states:</P>
      <P>The management team have met the Department of Health on two occasions on this matter and they have stressed that no further funding will be made available to our agency in the current year.  The Department are insisting that the hospital now submit a service plan.  The board of management have instructed the Chief Executive Officer to implement whatever measures are necessary to meet the requirements of the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Included in the proposed reductions are that a five day medical unit would be closed, theatre activity would be curtailed to one session per week in each specialty and GP referrals would be reduced for x-ray, laboratory and physiotherapy services.  Other proposals are also listed in the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will probably say that a meeting took place between the Medical Missionaries of Mary, the North Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health and that this letter has been withdrawn, but that will make me very suspicious.I would welcome withdrawal of the proposals, but the Department has in recent weeks insisted that no further funding will be made available and that the hospital is to reduce its level of service to the 1995 level.  Was the letter <Col N="107" /> withdrawn on the basis that we are approaching a general election?  Will the Minister indicate whether the Department will be willing to make available in the Library the terms of the agreement reached between the North Eastern Health Board, the Department of Health and the Medical Missionaries of Mary on the sale of the hospital?  I have no doubt that as the part of the negotiations the Department of Health and probably the North Eastern Health Board insisted that any shortfall would have to be met before the transfer could take place, otherwise there would be a reduction in the amount of money involved.</P>
    <P>Despite the substantial amount of money put into the health services between 1992 and 1994, waiting lists are as long as ever.  Are events in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital a forerunner of what will happen throughout the country, simply because the Government has spent much money in other areas?  The cuts should be prioritised, with cuts in the area of spin doctors and advisers, on which £34 million was spent in one year, before proposing cuts for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reassure the Deputies that there are no serious difficulties arising from the transfer of ownership of the International Missionary Training Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, to the North Eastern Health Board as has been suggested.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Health made an announcement on 15 April 1997 that the Government had agreed to the transfer of ownership of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, to the North Eastern Health Board for a consideration of £5.5 million.  Negotiations between the Congregation of the Medical Missionaries of Mary and the North Eastern Health Board, on the basis for the transfer of ownership, have been ongoing since November 1996 and were successfully concluded recently.  The Government decision to authorise the transfer of ownership will enable the parties to complete the transfer, which is expected to be finalised by the end of May 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital, in common with all other agencies, was notified by the Department in December 1996 of the requirement to produce a service plan within budget for 1997.  Following a tripartite meeting yesterday involving the Department of Health, the North Eastern Health Board and the IMTH, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, a formal collaborative working relationship has been established between the hospital and the health board in order to address the issues relating to the hospital's service plan for 1997.  The hospital and the health board have set to work immediately to agree a service plan within allocation, in line with the requirements of the Department's letter of determination.  Furthermore, they have given assurances to the public that a high quality, comprehensive service will <Col N="108" /> continue to be provided and that the challenges currently facing the hospital will be overcome. The health board has reiterated its guarantees that all staff contracts will be honoured.  The Minister has been advised that there is active consultation between the health board and staff representatives to address any concerns they may have in this regard.</P>
    <P>The hospital and the North Eastern Health Board share a mutual concern for the achievement of excellence in the delivery of health services and have been working over the past four years to develop an integrated service for the Louth-Meath region.  The first step in this process was the establishment in 1993 of the Louth-Meath hospital group, comprising the three hospitals in the region, located at Navan, Dundalk and Drogheda.  The transfer of ownership of the hospital to the health board offers a unique opportunity to consolidate the partnership which has existed for many years between the two health agencies.  The consolidation of the Louth-Meath hospital group under unified management will serve to enhance the status of each of the participating hospitals, as well as deliver a high quality service to the people of the region.</P>

      <P>I express my appreciation at being given the opportunity to voice my opinion on what I consider to be a very important topic concerning the nursing profession.  Within the next 12 months Irish girls will, for the first time, qualify from university with a degree in nursing &mdash; the year will begin in October 1997 or January 1998. Those young girls have been studying for a diploma for the past three years, during which time they received a grant and payment of course fees from the Department of Health.  The difficulty will arise when they go to university and the Department will not pay their fees.  As far as I am aware, they are the only undergraduates who must pay university course fees.  The Department of Health claims this is a matter for the Department of Education, but that Department claims it is a health matter.  Irrespective of who should deal with it, the girls are under the impression they will have to pay their fees.</P>
      <P>When the nurses went on strike a few weeks ago it was suggested the nursing profession is the most caring in the world.  Their younger sisters are now being penalised when trying to secure a degree in nursing.  The Department pays regional technical college and university course fees for other young people who take up courses with those institutions, but nurses must pay their own university fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most nurses in general practice are females, but I am sure that is not the reason for this discrimination.However, one could be forgiven for thinking that because they are members of the weaker sex they are being asked to pay their own fees. <Col N="109" /> Will the Minister consider this matter in an understanding manner?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it affords me an opportunity to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The traditional apprenticeship model of preregistration nursing education and training is currently in the process of being replaced by a new registration-diploma programme.  The new programme is operated by schools of nursing in association with third level institutes.  Student nurses who successfully complete the registrationdiploma programme will be awarded a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institute and will be eligible to be registered as a nurse with An Bord Altranais which, in turn, will render them eligible for employment as nurses.</P>
      <P>The objective of the transition to the new model is to enhance nursing education and training.This is in line with key recommendations in the report The Future of Nurse Education and Training in Ireland, published by An Bord Altranais in 1994.  The new programme was introduced on a pilot basis in 1994 and considerable progress has been made since then to extend the programme to the various schools of nursing.  The Government is firmly committed to the programme and to providing the necessary resources for its full implementation in all disciplines at the earliest possible date.  An additional £7 million has been provided for the programme this year, bringing to £13 million the amount that will be spent on the programme in 1997.  The available funding will meet the roll over costs of the operation of the programme to date and ensure that substantial further progress will be made in extending it to additional schools of nursing.  The Minister for Health will soon be in a position to announce the new sites at which the programme will commence during 1997.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the developments in pre-registration education and training, the associated third level institutes, in accordance with the normal procedures applying to such institutes, are developing one year programmes leading to the award of a Bachelor of Nursing Studies degree. Since such a degree programme will be optional, nurses will be responsible for making their own arrangements for admission to, and attendance at, such programmes, including the payment of course fees.  I emphasise that the possession of a degree in nursing will not be, and was never intended to be, a requirement for employment as a nurse.  The requirement for employment as a nurse for those participating in the registration-diploma programme will be satisfied at the point of registration with An Bord Altranais, at which stage the successful candidates will be awarded the diploma in nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rationale behind the development of a degree programme is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level with an opportunity to do so by means of a one year <Col N="110" /> part-time programme.  However, a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment.</P>

      <P>The Government has acted in a dishonourable and insulting manner in regard to the paramedics and health care professionals currently on strike.  It is trying to shred the long-standing agreement on pay links between nursing grades and paramedics which has existed since the 1940s.  Documentary evidence is available to support those pay links.  The link was copperfastened in 1979 by the then Government.  By its intransigence, the Government is flying in the face of every pay agreement, labour court recommendation and arbitration finding concerning paramedics in those years.  It is ironic that Governments during those years continuously and voluntarily defended the pay links and resisted any attempt to change them.</P>
      <P>The workers have a right to be angry, having been treated in such a shabby and unprofessional manner.

      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, added insult to injury by describing the workers as &ldquo;greedy and jumping on the bandwagon&rdquo;.  He should retract those comments.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, must ensure an agreement is reached that will respect the long-standing link with the nursing grades and recognise that the health professionals are no less valuable to the health service now than they were a few weeks ago.  In the public interest, the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission could intervene.We will support the Minister in whatever decision he makes to resolve this problem, but he should honour the long-standing agreements.  The dispute must be resolved speedily to ensure the thousands of patients and children with special needs are given appropriate professional and medical care.</P>

      <P>This dispute is causing intense pain and suffering for many patients in hospitals and care facilities.  As we saw in a report last night, many of the most vulnerable in our society and their carers are being affected.  Because of the dispute some patients have been sent home to families who are not in a position to cope.  Other patients making progress under the direction of paramedic staff are experiencing set backs.  In <Col N="111" /> physical terms, some may be set back for weeks because of the dispute, while the psychological impact of breaking with their routine or treatment for an extended period will devastate confidence and hope.</P>
      <P>The dispute underlines the importance of paramedical staff in providing treatment and care. Like our nurses and ambulance personnel, they are taken for granted and the absence of a strategic development plan for their careers and education is a major weakness in our health service. This dispute is another indictment of the Minister's handling of the health portfolio.  Rather than attempting to broker a settlement the Minister is clinging to a statement that does not have a basis in fact.</P>
      <P>It was acknowledged by Government that what was submitted by the union representing paramedical staff to the Labour Relations Commission is not in dispute.  What is in dispute is whether the Government claims made under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> that old pay links hold good is in fact the case.  The health employers who are instructed by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, have claimed that in this situation old pay links do not hold good.  However, a written agreement between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Department of Finance made at the time the PESP was negotiated, confirms that pay links and-or pay relationships will and can be maintained where a grade chooses to do so.  That agreement was drawn up in 1991 during the PESP negotiations when, for the first time, pay deals in the public service were linked to productivity, flexibility measures and co-operation with change.  The agreement carried through in the context of the PCW restructuring clause.  It is incorrect for the Minister to claim there are no grounds for a linked grade, such as paramedics, to seek the same improvements in pay as a marker grade provided the improvements are matched by changes in structures and-or working practices equivalent in value for both groups.</P>
      <P>The Government is wrong to bury its head in the sand and maintain the basis of the claim is flawed when that is factually wrong.  It is a dangerous strategy and it means a unilateral decision is being taken by the Government to break well established pay links without the agreement of the union concerned.</P>
      <P>An attempt is being made to divide health workers after the claims of two groups have been settled.  The Minister for Health should get directly involved before more disruption and hardship is caused to patients and their families. As the dispute will have to be resolved at some stage, it might as well be sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paramedical staff have been very dedicated and progressive health service employees.  They do not want to be on strike and resent the argument put forward by the Minister for Health. Before further damage is done to the social partnership process by the rainbow coalition Government <Col N="112" /> steps should be taken by the Minister for Health as a matter of urgency.  The paramedics should be engaged as stakeholders in the health service by the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>IMPACT on behalf of paramedic professions, with the exception of medical laboratory technicians, MLTA, and radiographers, SIPTU, pursued pay claims under Clause (2) (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The negotiations were processed under the auspices of the Health Service Employers' Agency and were complex from the outset.  In most instances, it was clear that the professional groups involved were open to some redesign of their roles, leading to greater service effectiveness from their professional input.  Also, many of the professions concerned are involved in aspects of the service which are going through rapid change and development, obviously under-pinned by significant new investment.  In those cases some opportunities exist for restructuring and adjusting pay rates and for addressing recruitment difficulties.  The grades involved are physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, dieticians, occupational therapists, audiometricians, social workers, chiropodists, orthoptists and child care workers.</P>
      <P>Union-management contact continued since late last year on an informal basis.  A formal meeting took place in Dublin Castle on 27 March 1997.  The union requested that the &ldquo;value of the nurses' deal&rdquo; be passed on to all paramedic professions who have an historic pay relationship with the staff nurse-ward sister and that negotiations be recommenced based on a percentage increase of approximately 17 per cent.  The union was told this was not possible and management went on to outline the facilitation, adjudication and Labour Court process available.  The matter was referred to the Labour Relations Commission on 17 April 1997, but the talks were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>If the IMPACT paramedic professions were to be awarded the nurses' deal, the pay bill would be in the region of £13 million.  If other linked paramedic grades are included, the figure reaches £20 million.  The Government's position is that the nurses' settlement was unique and claims made by other grades must be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the PCW.</P>
      <P>Radiographers and medical laboratory technicians, represented by SIPTU and MLTA, are also engaged in negotiations under the auspices of the HSEA and are pursuing the restructuring option.  Negotiations are slow and complex and were ongoing until recently at which point both unions opted to ballot for strike action.  However, management-union meetings took place with both professions within the past three weeks and it was made clear by both unions that they are rejecting the 5.5 per cent offer and will not accept anything less favourable than that offered to nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> Management and union met at the HSEA this afternoon concerning the provision of emergency sleep-over cover for residential centres in the mental handicap and child care services.  The meeting was adjourned on the basis that IMPACT will give the matter further consideration over the next day or two.  In those circumstances, I am sure the Deputies will appreciate it <Col N="114" /> would be inappropriate for the Minister or me to make any further comment at present other than to say every effort is being made to resolve this dispute and informal contacts are being maintained.</P>
    <P>The D·il adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 on Wednesday, 23 April 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the entry into force of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, on 13 May 1996, responsibility for the licensing of moneylenders resides with the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Previously the licences were issued by the Revenue Commissioners on foot of a certificate granted by the appropriate Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>Section 93 of the Act governs the granting of licences and in particular subsections (3) (a) (iv) and (v) require that a would-be applicant must provide an itemised statement of the proposed total cost of credit, that is, APR and details of collection and all other charges not included therein; subsection 8 (e) and (f) provide that the licence shall contain an itemised statement of the APR and details of collection and other charges not included therein; and subsections (10) (g) empowers the director to refuse a licence on the grounds that the proposed cost of credit would be excessive.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology has been informed by the Director that he granted 74 moneylenders' licences during 1996.  The maximum APR which the Director has allowed licenced moneylenders to charge is 214 per cent. It should be noted that this rate applies in only a small number of cases.  The majority of lenders licensed charge considerably less.  By virtue of section 151 of the Act, the public can now inform themselves of the rates being charged by each licensed moneylender.  A public register for this purpose can be inspected at any of the Director's offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to section 47 of the Act which provides that a consumer or someone acting on behalf of a consumer can challenge the cost of credit in the courts if it is considered to be excessive.In any such case the court is obliged to take into account specific factors such as the interest rates prevailing at the time, the age, business competence and level of literacy and numeracy of the consumer, the degree of risk involved to the creditor, the creditor's costs and the level of competition for the type of credit provided.  To date there has been no cases initated under section 47. Section 48 goes on to state that if the court finds the total cost of credit is excessive, it may reopen the moneylending agreement.  This could result in the consumer being given a refund of any excessive <Col N="116" /> costs paid or in the agreement being wholly set aside.  It also allows the Director to revoke or suspend the moneylending licence.</P>

      <P>Shaping Our Future is an advisory report on the possible future development and direction of policy to the year 2010 over a wide range of areas spanning the interests of my Department and other Departments.</P>
      <P>In relation to my Department and agencies, the report is a valuable resource on matters such as enterprise strategy, services policy, skills shortages and competitiveness.

      <P>Forf·s is in the process of establishing a reporting system to periodically evaluate, from its own perspective, progress made under different readings.  I would see no problem in making such reports available to facilitate debate and decision making on important policy and strategic issues which Shaping Our Future encompasses.  In this respect, however, I would stress that, in the final analysis, responsibility for making the choices and taking the decision involved rests with Government and the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to impose limits on market share controlled by any one company in the retail grocers trade, nor in any other sector of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996, do not adopt such an approach nor does the competition law of the European Union.  The approach favoured by domestic and European legislation in this area concerns abuse of dominance, and section 5 of the Competition Act, 1991, outlaws the abuse of a dominant position.  In 1996, I strengthened the Competition Act, 1991, by giving <Col N="117" /> substantial enforcement powers to the Competition Authority, the power of self-initiation and I expanded their professional staff.  Abuse of a dominant position is now subject of substantial criminal and civil sanctions.</P>
    <P>The imposition of limits on market share, as suggested in the Deputy's question would in my view be anti-competitive and contrary to the Single Market.  Such limits would also constrain the capacity of business to grow to their potential and be hostile to business development; they would be inimical to consumer interests arising from reduced competition; and they would undoubtedly promote inefficiencies.  The imposition of limits on market would be a retrograde step.</P>

      <P>Jobstart is a recruitment subsidy scheme I introduced last summer and is aimed at enticing employers to take on those who are three years or more unemployed against a background where such persons are often by-passed when it comes to filling vacancies.</P>
      <P>There are currently just over 1,200 people on the programme and our target is to reach 2,000 by the end of the year.  Progress in terms of take-up was initially slow but has steadily improved. In that regard, past experience has shown that recruitment incentives require a lead in time before becoming established.  This is particularly so with Jobstart given that it is targeted at the most disadvantaged of the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>In order to raise the profile of the programme and boost its take-up rate F¡S have arranged high profile regional launches and advertised extensively on local radio, local magazines and newspapers as well as on local cable television. In addition presentations have been organised for regional-local employer bodies and mail shots have been sent to companies.</P>
      <P>All of these activities have helped boost the take up rate in recent months and I am confident that F¡S will achieve the target of having 2,000 long-term unemployed people engaged in employment under this programme by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 225 together.</P>
      <P>The community employment programme is targeted at a particular severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, that is, those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other social welfare means tested payments.  Limited resources, unfortunately, do not make it possible to provide community employment for all unemployed people. It is necessary, therefore, to target the programme at those most in need.  The eligibility criteria for community employment is a fair, objective and cost effective way of achieving that target.</P>
      <P>To satisfy the eligibility criteria, persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension or deserted wives' benefit can apply to transfer to one parent family payment in order to become eligible to participate in community employment.  In addition, married unemployed people can swop their social welfare entitlements in order to qualify for participation on the programme.In this way, a married person who meets the eligibility criteria can transfer their entitlement to a spouse who is not on the live register, in order for that person to qualify for participation on community employment.</P>
      <P>The eligibility criteria for community employment only came into effect last year following a detailed review of community employment and in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment.  They were designed to target the programme at those priority groups already referred to.  I have no plans at present to widen the eligibility criteria. However, I keep all programmes under constant scrutiny in so far as their objectives and effectiveness are concerned.</P>
      <P>All unemployed people, including married women who wish to return to the workforce, are eligible to participate in F¡S mainstream training-specific skills training programmes.  Also from time to time F¡S offer return to work courses for women who wish to return to the workforce.</P>

Following a major recommendation in the Report a special working group was established to advise the Government on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. The Working Group has consulted all the relevant representative bodies and groups and is finalising its report on this aspect of its work.  The Group will then proceed to the second stage of its assignment i.e. to look at alternative systems to the tort system of delivering compensation for personal injury.</entry>

The survey data is collated on a county by county basis.  While I am not in a position, therefore, to provide employment data on a sub-county basis, I can inform the Deputy that job loss figures for County Cork in the period 1994 to 1996 amounted to 4,936.  The Deputy should also be aware, however, that in the same period, 7,427 new jobs were created in companies assisted by Forbairt and IDA Ireland. This positive performance in terms of new job creation led to a net increase of 2,491 jobs in County Cork in the period.</P>

      <P>The published report on the 1996 labour force survey contains two tables relating to the duration of unemployment.  Table 38 shows the number of unemployed persons, also males and females, who were unemployed for less than one year and for one year or more for the years 1991 to 1996.  Table 39 gives an age breakdown for 1996 according to the age groups 15-24, 25-44 and 45 years or over.  Other tables on age by duration of unemployment, with a more detailed age breakdown, have also been compiled and are available, on request, from the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An age by duration analysis of the live register is also compiled, twice per year, in respect of April and October.  The age groups used in this <Col N="129" /> analysis are: under 20 years, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-59 and 60-64 years.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, the Government has to strengthen the mechanisms whereby the public interest is represented in Government decision making on a day-to-day basis in view of the limited public interest role set out for itself by the Office of the Attorney General in its recently published Statement of Strategy, 1997-99.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be misleading to suggest that the office of the Attorney General's Statement of Strategy, 1997, seeks to limit the public interest role of the Attorney General or his office.  Section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, vests, <i>inter alia,</i> in the Attorney General &ldquo;the administration and business generally of public services in connection with the representation ... of the public in all legal proceedings for the enforcement of law, the punishment of offenders and the assertion or protection of public rights and all powers, duties and functions connected with the same respectively,&rdquo;. This important function is fully acknowledged in the office of the Attorney General's Statement of Strategy.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, although important, this public interest role is, in a democracy, of necessity a limited one.  In a democracy, the primary guarantor of the rights of the citizen must be the legislature, which acts with a mandate from the people.  The role of the courts, and of the Attorney General in seeking to enforce public rights, is to supplement rather than to supplant the democratic system; the State should be governed by the rule of law rather than the rule of lawyers.  The courts are entitled to intervene where laws, although democratically enacted, are oppressive of the rights of any citizen, but in a democracy this is a power which should be used sparingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing mechanisms whereby the Attorney General can and does assert the public interest are effective and adequate.  The Attorney General has power to move the courts to restrain interference with public rights.  When the Attorney General advises the Government in relation to legislation it proposes to ask the Oireachtas to enact, or any other course of action it wishes to follow, he will always have in the forefront of his mind the question whether that legislation or action would be upheld as lawful by the courts if challenged.  To that extent, the Attorney General's role must always take account of public rights, particularly where there is a strong tradition of vigilance by the courts to protect the rule of law.  In my view, the existing mechanisms for the protection by the Attorney General of the public interest and the assertion of public rights strike the correct balance.It is of interest to note that, while the Constitution <Col N="130" /> Review Group considered the Attorney General's public interest role, it did not recommend a change in the present position.</P>

      <P>A total of 13 task forces have been established arising from a recommendation in the first report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs. Twelve of these are in the greater Dublin area, while there is one in north Cork city.</P>
      <P>The Government has set aside funding of £10 million out of a total of £14 million in 1997 to fund the non-mainstream elements of anti-drugs plans which are being developed by the task forces to tackle the drugs problem in their areas. These plans are expected to contain comprehensive anti-drugs strategies for the areas concerned, involving proposals in relation to treatment, rehabilitation and prevention.  The mainstream elements of the plans will be funded by relevant Departments and statutory agencies from their available resources.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, I have continued to meet various local groups and individuals involved in tackling the drugs problem.  They have conveyed to me the new sense of hope which the establishment of the task forces, along with other measures which are being taken have given to their communities.  It is essential therefore &mdash; the task forces are fully conscious of this &mdash; that the momentum and sense of hope which has been built up in recent months is not lost through a delay in bringing forward the local anti-drugs strategies.</P>
      <P>In view of this, while there is no formal deadline for the submission of the plans, as I indicated to the leader of the Opposition in response to a D·il question last week, the task forces are expected to submit their plans, or at least the priority elements of them, by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>When the plans have been received and evaluated by the national drugs strategy team, recommendations will be made to Government regarding the allocation of funding to support their implementation.  When this has been decided, an announcement will be made regarding the amounts allocated and the projects involved.</P>

      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum was established in 1993 by the Government to develop economic and social policy initiatives, particularly initiatives to combat unemployment, and to contribute to the formation of a national consensus on social and economic matters.</P>
      <P>With the wide ranging reports and opinions it has published to date, the forum has had a considerable influence on the development of public policy in a number of key areas as was already evidenced in the forum's first periodic report. This has been widely acknowledged.  For example, the forum has made a significant contribution to the ongoing development of policy in the areas of long-term unemployment, local development, income maintenance strategies, the delivery of social services, job creation initiatives and equality issues.</P>
      <P>The forum has produced a report and two opinions on long-term unemployment.  This report led directly to the establishment of the local employment service which is now functioning in 14 areas and will be extended to a further four areas this year.</P>
      <P>The forum has also made an important input in the development of both the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and Partnership 2000.  It has also been to the fore in the development of social partnership.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that many of the groups represented on the forum were, prior to its establishment, outside the consultative process altogether.Now these groups are themselves parties to the new agreement.  The forum has been given a role in monitoring the new agreement by providing opinions at six monthly intervals on the development of the provisions regarding social inclusion and equality.</P>
      <P>Finally, the forum has produced two reports so far this year titled &ldquo;Early School Leavers and Youth Unemployment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rural Renewal &mdash; Combating Social Exclusion&rdquo;.  These are currently being examined by interdepartmental working groups, chaired by the Departments of Education and Agriculture, Food and Forestry respectively, and will be reporting back to Government before the end of May.</P>

      <P>The Irish Immigration Centre, Boston, is one of many organisations in the US providing excellent advice and information services to Irish immigrants.  The fact that, since 1990, grants amounting to US$1.6 million have been paid to such groups from the Vote for Foreign Affairs is evidence of our recognition of and support for the valuable services they provide.  The Irish Immigration Centre, Boston, received grants of $25,000, $34,500 and $35,500 in the past three years.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the importance of Irish Government grants to these organisations and £150,000 of the £165,000 provided for in subhead C of the Vote for Foreign Affairs this year is intended for further grants for them the balance, being for organisations in Australia.  An application from the immigration centre, Boston, for a grant in 1997 will be carefully and sympathetically considered.In the context of the prevailing budgetary circumstances, I will continue to look as sympathetically as possible at the level of overall funding in the future.</P>
      <P>Through the Embassy in Washington, I am monitoring the effects on Irish immigrants of the recent reforms in welfare and immigration legislation in the US.  In consultation with the voluntary organisations and with our many friends in Congress, the Embassy, as well as the Consulates-General in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco, are seeking to have the immigration legislation amended so that it will continue to be possible for Irish people already in the US to regularise their legal status without having to leave the country.</P>

      <P>The open clerical assistant (typist) competition, advertised in November 1996, attracted 2,453 applications. This competition was required to establish four panels of suitably qualified typists to fill vacancies in the Dublin area.  In addition to the main panel, the competition provided for three additional panels for specific categories to be established as follows: (1) for those who were registered or entitled to be registered with the National Rehabilitation Board, (2) for those who had served in the Civil Service and had resigned their position on or before 1 October 1996, and (3) for those who are fluent in Irish.</P>
      <P>The competition comprised three stages consisting of a written clerical aptitude test, a typing test for those who obtained the required standard in the written test and finally a competitive interview for those who reached the required standard in the typing test.  The first stage was attended by 1,366 applicants of whom 626 reached the required standard and progressed to the second stage; 533 attended for the typing test and 199 reached the required standard.  These candidates have been contacted regarding an interview and while 94 candidates have been interviewed to date it is anticipated that the remaining candidates will be interviewed in the near future.</P>
      <P>No assignments have been made as yet but it is anticipated that assignments will begin to be made from this competition in late April.  There is currently a backlog of clerical assistant (typist) vacancies to be filled.  As it is not anticipated that the number available from these panels will be sufficient to meet demands for typists towards the end of the year, a further competition was advertised in April 1997.  The recently advertised competition will also provide for some provincial panels.</P>

      <P>Sections 226 and 227 of the Finance Act, 1992 provide for the automatic return to the Revenue Commissioners of certain information from financial institutions where they pay deposit interest without deduction of tax.  In 1992 the Revenue Commissioners issued a statement of practice to the effect that returns by financial institutions need be made only of amounts paid or credited in excess of £500.</P>
      <P>There has been no recent change of practice by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the taxation of income from shares or deposits held in credit unions.  Therefore credit unions are obliged to make a return to the Revenue Commissioners only where the amount of deposit interest paid to the depositor in the year exceeds £500.  However, dividends and interest paid by credit unions are chargeable to income tax in the hands of the recipients at the rates relevant to those recipients, including the higher rate where appropriate.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a previous parliamentary question by Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; see Official Report of 27 June 1996 &mdash; a study group within my Department, comprising officials who deal with banking issues, was examining the general issue of dormant accounts held in credit institutions.To facilitate this examination they had been in contact with the industry, including representatives of the Irish Bankers' Federation and the Building Societies Association.  My officials have since completed their examination and have reported their findings to me.  Given the amounts likely to be involved and the administrative and other difficulties associated with establishing an operationally viable system to deal with dormant accounts, I have decided that further action in the matter at this time would be unlikely to be cost effective from an Exchequer viewpoint.</P>

    <P>(1)  The numbers shown for PAYE employees and self-employed are tax units.  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(2)  The numbers of self-employed tax units are the numbers on the tax record who were requested to complete Self-Assessment tax returns in each of the years in question.  An additional number of tax units are on tax record as having been notified by inspectors of taxes that a tax return is not required from them until their position is further reviewed because their current incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability.  It is not possible to establish the numbers of these units who are appropriate to individual tax offices.</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General, in his audit of the Appropriation Accounts of Government Departments, has a role in identifying and reporting to D·il …ireann on instances where he perceives loss, waste or uneconomic expenditure. This role was given statutory effect in the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Appropriation Accounts each year highlights such instances which are followed up with the accounting officers by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 of Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993 also empowers the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out specific examinations as he considers it appropriate in relation to economy and efficiency in the use of resources by a Government Department, or person, or by the manager of a fund; the effectiveness of certain management systems &mdash; the systems procedures and practices employed by a Department to evaluate the effectiveness of its operations &mdash; may also be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  These examinations <Col N="139" /> are generally known as &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; examinations.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has completed and published 12 reports of such examinations.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General, an independent constitutional officer, was granted wide-ranging powers under the 1993 amendment Act to draw attention to instances of financial waste.  The reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; on the Appropriation Accounts and the &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; examinations &mdash; are available to the general public.  I consider that the present arrangements for identifying instances of financial waste in Government Departments and other bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and for making the information available to the general public, are satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The income tax rates and the bands in operation from the 1983-84 tax year to the current tax year, 1997-98, are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period in question the level and number of tax rates have been reduced.  In more recent years, tax changes have primarily centred on increasing personal allowances and exemption limits and widening the standard band.  Such measures, combined with the introduction of the new £80 per week PRSI-free allowance and the 1 per cent reduction made this year in both the <Col N="147" /> standard income tax rate and the main rate of employees' PRSI, have focused assistance toward those on lower to middle incomes, while also significantly raising the thresholds at which income becomes liable to the 48 per cent tax rate.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I wish to take Questions Nos. 51, 57, 58 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and environmental health officers, similar to all other paramedical professions, have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various national pay programmes over the last number of years.  The relative position of these professions, in terms of remuneration, has been maintained with those of their colleagues in other paramedical disciplines.</P>
      <P>IMPACT, on behalf of these professions, has been pursuing a pay claim under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  These negotiations are complex and are being handled by the Health Service Employers' Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A conciliation hearing at the Labour Relations Commission on Thursday, 17 April 1997 was not <Col N="150" /> successful and IMPACT opted to commence strike action among several of the paramedical professions &mdash; including physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists &mdash; with effect from Monday, 21 April 1997.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at present other than to say every effort is being made to resolve this dispute and contacts are being maintained between the parties involved.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Radiotherapy services are currently available in St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin and in Cork University Hospital.  Due to the nature and very high cost of radiotherapy it is necessary to confine the resources available for the service to a limited number of locations.</P>
      <P>St. Luke's Hospital is currently being developed as a national centre of excellence in the care and treatment of cancer patients with a sum of over £20 million being invested on improving treatment services and a complete refurbishment of ward facilities.  To date, a sum of £3 million has bene spent on additional radiotherapy equipment which includes two new linear accelerators.  In relation to improvements at Cork University Hospital, a design team has been commissioned to design an expanded and upgraded radiotherapy department at the hospital.  The work of this design team is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The question of locating a third radiotherapy centre in the western region was considered in the context of the National Cancer Strategy.  The expert advice available was that there must be a sufficient volume of patients for the service in order to maintain the high level of medical and technical expertise needed for such a high-technology unit.  The National Cancer Strategy concludes that there may be scope for developing radiotherapy services in Galway at a future stage. However, it would not be feasible to contemplate commencing the service until the major capital project to upgrade certain aspects of University College Hospital, Galway has been completed. The contract for this project was signed recently.</P>
      <P>I will keep the question of locating a radiotherapy service in the western region under review.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I announced a major action plan last month giving details of how the National Cancer Strategy will be implemented.  The plan will be phased in over a period of three years, commencing this year, and involves extra running costs of £22 million when fully operational in 1999.  In addition, the capital costs arising from the strategy will amount to an estimated £3.25 million.</P>
      <P>The timing of the capital expenditure will depend on the requirements of the services as developments are put in place.  To date, I have approved a capital grant of £300,000 for the refurbishment of the premises in Eccles Street which will accommodate the headquarters of the national breast screening programme.  I will make capital grants available under the National Cancer Strategy for equipment and other costs in the areas of oncology, haematology, palliative care, breast screening and for the implementation of guidelines on the administration of chemotherapy which I published with the strategy.</P>
      <P>In addition to the capital provisions being made specifically under the National Cancer Strategy, I have also made provision for capital funding for other cancer related developments. These include £2.5 million for a purpose built nursing unit and hospice facility at Milford Hospice and the ongoing development of facilities at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin.  To date a total of £3 million has been spent on additional radiotherapy equipment at St. Luke's.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): A study on the effects of the indicative drug target scheme in the general medical services scheme, on the quality of patient care was commissioned in May, 1995, by the Southern Health Board in conjunction with my Department.The study, which is chaired by Professor Michael Murphy, professor of clinical pharmacology, University College, Cork was commissioned in the context of ensuring that the best management practices, both medical and administrative, are or will be followed with respect to the scheme and to provide the Department and the health boards with a qualitative overview of the effects of the scheme.

      <P>While I have received no specific proposals from the Irish College of General Practitioners in regard to an initiative on prescribing, I understand that the college, in the context of ensuring quality care in general practice, is considering undertaking an examination, on an ongoing basis, of the overall effects of cost effective prescribing, including the impact of the indicative drug target scheme and taking account of the &ldquo;Murphy&rdquo; study.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The plan for women's health which I recently launched commits my Department and the health boards to measures to improve the health of women and to make the health services more women friendly over the three years, 1997-99.As the Deputy will be aware, work is under way on the extension of the breast cancer screening programme this year to include all women of the relevant age in the Eastern Midland and North-Eastern Health Board areas.  A national screening programme will be in place before the end of 1999.  A national screening programme for cervical cancer will be established in 1999.  A committee has recently been established to oversee the establishment, implementation and monitoring of the cervical screening programme, which will be piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be announcing the establishment of a women's health council to develop a centre of expertise on women's health issues, to foster research into women's health, to evaluate the success of the plan for women's health and to advise me generally on women's health issues.  My Department will shortly be writing to health boards inviting them to outline the steps they intend to take to implement the plan at regional and local level.  Those boards that have not already done so will be asked to prepare and adopt a regional plan for women's health, taking account of the priorities of the national plan.  I hope to receive an early response from the boards.</P>
      <P>I am making a sum of £75,000 available to the National Women's Council of Ireland over the three years of the plan to ensure the effectiveness of the council's involvement at national and regional level as a partner in the implementation of the plan.  It is not possible at this stage to give a detailed indication of the cost of implementation the plan.  Much of the cost will arise under the headings of cancer, health promotion, management development, family planning and family support services.</P>

The North-Western Health Board is committed to providing a much enhanced epidural service and in this context a full review of the service in Sligo General Hospital was initiated and is now almost complete.  It has involved discussions within the hospital in order to ensure that adequate and safe levels of medical cover are provided for the service.  It is planned to recruit additional junior anaesthetic staff from 1 July 1997 and this will result in a modern epidural service being available to mothers in the Sligo catchment area.  A similar review of epidural services has been initiated in Letterkenny General Hospital and a development plan for the Letterkenny service is being completed.  It is the board's overall aim to provide a modern epidural service at both its general hospitals in Sligo and Letterkenny.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I assume the Deputy is referring to E.coli:0157.  Separate figures for E.coli:0157 are not available as it is reported under the category &ldquo;Food poisoning (bacterial other than salmonella)&rdquo;.  Recent media reports of food poisoning <Col N="155" /> in hospitals were not related to E.coli:0157.</P>
      <P>My Department has recognised the potentially serious implications of the E.coli infection and has taken steps to increase awareness of it.  A report on the matter by the Food Safety Advisory Committee was circulated to all health boards in October 1994 with an instruction that it should be brought to the attention of all officers engaged in food control operations.  A reminder to this effect was issued in July 1995.  A further reminder issued in December 1996, this time to all directors of public health in the health boards.  The directors were asked to remind doctors and laboratories to be particularly vigilant in reporting cases of food poisoning, with a view to identifying any possible cases of the E.coli infection.  More recently, following advice from the Food Safety Advisory Board, the Health Promotion Unit of my Department has prepared a leaflet for distribution to the general public on this matter.</P>
      <P>I have accepted the need for a national communicable disease surveillance unit to provide a comprehensive broad-based approach to the prevention of disease, including food borne diseases. The Department of Health is considering the organisational and structural issues involved in conjunction with the relevant agencies and professional interests.  My Department will shortly be meeting with the Food Safety Advisory Board on the matter.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy of my strong commitment to the question of food safety.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has agreed to the establishment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which will be dedicated to ensuring compliance with the very best food safety and hygiene standards.  The preparation of the necessary legislation is under way but, meanwhile, the interim Food Safety Authority of Ireland is proceeding with putting in place the necessary structures and administrative systems to ensure the statutory board will be able to make a strong and immediate impact in this area.</P>

On receipt of the pathology report, the coroner decided to hold an inquest.  The inquest commenced on 15 June 1995 and was adjourned by the coroner so <Col N="156" /> that he could seek an independent expert view of the medical evidence given by the pathologist and doctors.  On 20 March 1996, the inquest was resumed before the jury and an independent consultant haematologist was present at the request of the coroner and gave evidence.  The family were represented by senior counsel.  The jury brought in a verdict of death by misadventure.  In the circumstances, I am not aware of any implications for the blood supply.</P>

      <Quest>the services or facilities, if any, which are available from his Department for people with disabilities who do not qualify under the means test for a medical card, particularly in relation to public health nursing, incontinence pads, medication, hospitalisation, home care, nursing and personal assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief <Col N="158" /> executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Non-medical card holders are entitled to a board range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charges.</P>
    <P>In the main, a wide range of community services are available free of charge to people with disabilities, including those who do not hold medical cards.  These include respite care, residential accommodation, day services, home support services and provision of certain aids and appliances.  The provision of public nursing services for people with disabilities who do not qualify under the means test for a medical card is a matter for health boards in the first instance.  The public health nursing service aims to provide a comprehensive community nursing service for all groups, free of charge, where a nursing need has been identified and the public health nurse can seek out people in need of nursing and social care through her knowledge of local communities. When people in need of nursing care do not have a medical card they normally have to pay for home help.  The supply of incontinence wear is a matter for the health boards and I understand that the boards assess applicants on an individual basis taking into account the applicant's needs and circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.  Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the eligibility criteria currently in place and the existing range of schemes available to persons with disabilities who do not qualify for a medical card.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The information in the format requested by the Deputy is not readily available to my Department.However, the Cystic Fibrosis Association estimates there are approximately 830 people in Ireland with cystic fibrosis.  Neither my Department nor the Cystic Fibrosis Association have information on the number of families with multiple cases of cystic fibrosis.  However, it is an inherited disorder which has a one in four chance of manifesting itself in a child both of whose parents carry the gene.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future,</i> recommended the establishment of a database on the health service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities to provide a firm basis for planning services.  This would include the needs of people with cystic fibrosis. The review group recommended that a database development committee be established to prepare detailed proposals for the development of the database.  It is my intention to establish this committee later in the year when the first report from a pilot physical and sensory disability database currently being initiated in three health boards is available.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): On 16 April 1997, the Blood Transfusion Service Board responded to my letter requesting it to outline its approach to liability in hepatitis C cases.  The BTSB informed me <i>inter alia</i> in its response that it had decided that it will admit liability for negligence in court proceedings where claimants were directly or indirectly infected with hepatitis C through Anti-D Immunoglobulin supplied by the board.  In such proceedings and in other court proceedings where claimants allege infection with hepatitis C from blood, blood components or derivatives supplied by the board, the board informed me that it will admit the findings of fact contained in the report of the tribunal of inquiry.  I have been informed by the BTSB that prior to this decision it had admitted liability in six cases.  The board has informed me that it is not in a position to decide whether aggravated or exemplary damages should be awarded in any case, as this is a legal issue which falls to be judicially determined.</P>
      <P>In those cases (28 persons to date have been diagnosed antibody positive for hepatitis C virus who received blood or blood products between February 1991 and September 1991) arising out of the facts described in Chapter 6 of the report of the tribunal of inquiry concerning the failure to agree to the introduction of hepatitis C screening between February 1991 and September 1991, the State proposes to admit liability.  In addition, the State also proposes to admit liability in those cases, if any, which are attributed to the inadequate recall procedure as outlined in Chapter 13 of the report.  As these cases identify themselves the State will admit liability at the earliest opportunity.</P>

I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort is made to complete the compilation of the figures as soon as possible after the end of the period in question and I will write to the Deputy with the information requested as soon as it is available.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): In the case of all recipients identified and traced by the BTSB under the targeted lookback programme either the recipient or the recipient's GP has been advised that the recipient may have received a potentially infected blood or blood product.</P>
      <P>Under this programme there are currently 59 persons who have been identified by the BTSB as recipients of potentially infected blood or blood products who have not been traced to date for various reasons.  Considerable effort to ascertain the current location of these persons is being made as a matter of urgency in order to advise them through their GPs that they may have received a potentially infected product and offer testing.  This approach is in line with the main priority and the principal focus of the resources being applied under the targeted lookback programme which is to ensure that all recipients who were exposed to a potentially infected product are identified, traced and offered testing.  Due to the demands on the BTSB, it has been necessary to give priority to tracing and informing living recipients.</P>
      <P>To date, the BTSB has not sought to inform relatives of deceased persons that their deceased relatives may have received potentially hepatitis C infected units in the course of treatment.  The BTSB is currently reviewing this matter in the light of the experience and evidence acquired in the lookback programme and particular attention is being addressed to the extremely small number of cases where hepatitis C may have contributed to the death of the deceased.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the 1970 Health Act, the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services and prescribed drugs and medicines for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility.  However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  In view of the discretionary powers of chief executive officers to issue medical cards to those whose income exceeds the guidelines, I do not consider it justifiable to extend automatic entitlement to a medical card to any particular group without any reference to their means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a <Col N="167" /> particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition such as MR with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Deputy will be aware that I made an announcement on 15 April 1997 that the Government has agreed to the transfer of ownership of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, to the North-Eastern Health Board for a consideration of £5.5 million.  Negotiations between the Congregation of the Medical Missionaries of Mary and the North-Eastern Health Board, on the basis for the transfer of ownership, have been ongoing since November 1996 and were successfully concluded recently.  The Government decision to authorise the transfer of ownership will enable the parties to complete the transfer, which is expected to be finalised by the end of May 1997.</P>
      <P>On the question of funding and service planning issues, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, in common with all other agencies, was notified by the Department in December 1996 of the requirement to produce a service plan within budget for 1997.</P>
      <P>Following a tripartite meeting yesterday involving the Department of Health, the North-Eastern Health board and the IMTH, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, a formal collaborative working relationship has now been established between the hospital and the health board in order to address the issues relating to the hospital's service plan for 1997.  The hospital and the health board have set to work immediately to agree a service plan within allocation, in line with the requirements of the Department's letter of determination.  Furthermore, they have given assurances to the public that a high quality, comprehensive service will continue to be provided and that the challenges currently facing the hospital will be overcome.  The health board has reiterated its guarantees that all staff contracts will be honoured.  I have been advised that there is active consultation between the health board and staff and staff representatives to address any concerns they may have in this regard.</P>
      <P>The hospital and the North-Eastern Health Board share a mutual concern for the achievement of excellence in the delivery of health services and have been working over the past four years to develop an integrated service for the Louth-Meath region.  The first step in this process was the establishment, in 1993, of the Louth-Meath hospital group, comprising the three hospitals in the region, located at Navan, Dundalk and Drogheda.</P>
      <P>The transfer of ownership of the hospital to the health board offers a unique opportunity to consolidate the partnership which has existed for many years between the two health agencies.  The consolidation of the Louth-Meath hospital group under unified management will serve to enhance the status of each of the participating hospitals, as well as delivering a high quality service to the people of the region.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, his Department has made in relation to the four key recommendations of the January 1995 policy document launched by the National Federation of Women's Refuges, in particular the recommendations that the Government devise a national policy on the provision of refuges for abused women and their children and establish procedures for greater co-operation between agencies who deal with the victims of the violence, that the Government provide 100 per cent funding for all existing refuges and for the establishment of a new refuge in every county where there is none already in existence, that all refuges are professionally staffed and training is provided in the specialised services they provide, and a national education programme be implemented to challenge society's attitude to violence against women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date the role of the health services for victims of domestic violence has been to support refuges for women, and children, subjected to violence in the home and to provide crisis support and counselling.  It has been recognised that the issue of domestic violence is extremely complex and cannot be tackled by any one Government Department in isolation. Accordingly, the Government decided to assign responsibility for co-ordinating policy on women and violence across Government Departments to the Office of the T·naiste.  The office established a Working Group on Violence Against Women chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, in October 1996 on which both my Department and the health boards are represented.The working group is due to report to Government shortly.  The issues outlined in the Deputy's question are all examined in detail in this report.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for assistance under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, an applicant must, <i>inter alia,</i> satisfy a means test to determine whether his or her disposable income and disposable capital are within the limits as set out in the Civil Legal Aid Regulations, 1996.  While the income of a husband and wife would normally be aggregated for civil legal aid purposes, the regulations provide that they are treated separately where the parties are in conflict with each other, or where they are living separately or apart.  The effect of this rule is that in a very high proportion <Col N="170" /> of matrimonial cases a wife will qualify for legal services, even if her husband is financially secure.</P>
      <P>Disposable income is the income which remains when specified deductions are made from the total income received from all sources, per annum.  These deductions, which are set out in the 1996 regulations, include the following</P>

    <P>For the purpose of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, capital includes money in the applicant's bank, credit union, building society or post office accounts, or the applicant's house and normal household chattels, property or land.  Disposable capital is the value of capital after making such deductions as specified in the 1996 regulations. These deductions include the full amount of any outstanding loan, mortgage or debt, and the expenses which would be incurred in realising assets.  Where the capital resource consists of the applicants home and normal household chattels, it is reckonable as disposable capital only to the extent that the unencumbered value of the house and such chattels exceeds £45,000.  The capital value of any other house property in which the applicant has an interest shall be the full market value of that interest.  Where the capital resource consists of land, including farm land, its value shall exclude any amount which is attributable to the family home.</P>
    <P>Present eligibility limits for receipt of services under the 1996 Act, as set out in the Civil Legal Aid Regulations, 1996, are £7,350 per annum disposable income and £200,000 disposable capital. No capital contribution is payable in respect of that portion of an applicant's disposable capital which is under £2,000.  While a person whose disposable income does not exceed £5,060 per annum would be required to pay a contribution of £4 for legal advice and £23 for legal aid, a person whose disposable income exceeds £5,060 but is not greater than £7,350 would be required to pay a larger contribution, up to a maximum of £64 for legal advice and £595 for legal aid.  Also, the 1996 regulations provide that, in circumstances where the maximum contribution payable by an applicant is assessed at £23 and the board considers that it would cause that person severe <Col N="171" /> hardship to pay the maximum contribution, the board may either waive the contribution or accept a lower contribution.</P>

Prior to 1994 there was no money at my Department's disposal that could be used for this purpose.  In 1996 the scope of the scheme was extended to include voluntary organisations providing counselling to children whose parents have separated. Five counselling organisations in County Louth have benefited under the scheme each year since it was instituted, as follows:</P>

      <P>My Department is not responsible for the dissemination of documents published by the European Commission, which has offices in all member states.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal practice, my Department initiated a consultation on the draft Framework Directive on Water Quality, soon after its publication on 25 February 1997, which involved relevant Government Departments, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Geological Survey of Ireland and two local authorities which had been represented at the consultative conference organised by the European Commission in May 1996.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice for ENFO to hold separate copies of internal Commission documents or draft proposals for EU legislation.  The ENFO library does however have available copies of the Official Journal of the European Communities, through which access to Commission proposals can be had in due course.</P>

      <P>Road grants have been fully allocated this year and there are no additional moneys at my disposal from which a further grant could be made to any local authority.  While Kilkenny County Council received a grant allocation of £900,000 in 1997 for eight projects under the EU co-financed grants scheme, their application for funding for road realignment at Rower Village was not successful.However, it will be open to the council to consider whether to resubmit this application for consideration for funding in 1998.  Decisions in relation to projects selected for funding under the EU co-financed scheme depend on compliance with strict EU eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, the demands from local authorities generally and the overall funds available.</P>

      <Quest>if she will have a review of the school catchment area in south Kilkenny carried out without delay in view of the fact that 66 students currently avail of privately hired transport into the Waterford post-primary centre and in view of the fact that the N9 is not in the Waterford catchment area and where, from an operational point of view, Bus …ireann would have no difficulty in providing public transport if the catchment area could be extended.</Quest>

      <P>The position generally is that for the purposes of the post-primary education transport scheme the country has been divided into catchment areas each of which has its own post-primary centre. Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside are eligible for transport to that centre.  Eligible pupils who attend school at a centre other than that which caters for the catchment area in which they live may be allowed the concession of transport from the catchment boundary of the centre attended, provided there is room for them on a bus serving that centre.  They are responsible for getting to the catchment boundary.</P>
      <P>The actual definition of catchment areas is determined on educational rather than transport grounds.  If it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Department's planning section that there is a need to review existing catchment boundaries on educational grounds, such a review would be considered.However, the alteration of boundaries would only take place after consultation with all interested parties, including the relevant school authorities and the Transport Liaison Officer. Any amendments to catchment boundaries would have a knock-on effect on transport services which operate in accordance with those boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> I understand that there are a number of catchment areas in south Kilkenny, from which pupils travel to Waterford city.  The Deputy might confirm the particular area he has in mind so that the matter can be considered further by my Department.</P>

      <P>Post-primary pupils who wish to attend school outside of their catchment area may be allowed transport only from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to there being space accommodation available on the service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.</P>
      <P>The pupils to whom the Deputy is referring live outside the New Ross catchment area and are, therefore, entitled to catchment boundary transport only, under the terms of the school transport scheme.  As such they must fit in with existing transport arrangements subject to the above conditions.</P>
      <P>To provide additional transport for these pupils as requested by the Deputy would constitute an encroachment into another catchment area, and would be in breach of the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the existing arrangements are the most that can be provided in this case.</P>

      <P>The question of providing physical education facilities at St. David's CBS, Artane, Dublin, which is not one of the schools listed on the capital programme, can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demand for additional classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country.  I am not in a position at this stage to state when physical education facilities will be provided in this particular case.</P>

      <P>Under the 1996 ESF Maintenance Grants Scheme, independent mature students are <Col N="190" /> defined to be mature students who are not ordinarily resident at home with their parents.  Their entitlement to a grant is assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>The address of independent mature students for the purpose of determining the rate of grant payable is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is within 15 miles of the college, the adjacent rate of grant is payable.If the address is more than 15 miles from college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable. However, where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more that 15 miles from the college, that address can be regarded as the normal residence of the student.</P>
      <P>I understand from City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee that the student in question is attending college in Galway and has not provided satisfactory evidence that he is maintaining an address in Dublin.  If the student can produce conclusive evidence that he is maintaining a residence in Dublin, his entitlement will be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a school-based psychological service provided by my Department for all second level schools and for approximately 400 primary schools.  My Department currently employs a total of 36 inspectors of guidance-psychologists. Of these, 20 are working mainly in second level schools, 13 are in primary schools, and there are three psychologists in a supervisory, senior, capacity.</P>
      <P>A psychological service for individual pupils and support for guidance services have been provided to second level schools for a number of years.  Every second level school has a psychologist assigned to it.  Psychological support is provided as time and resources allow.</P>
      <P>The policy outlined in the White Paper on Education envisages the expansion of the schools psychological service to all schools as a function of the proposed education boards.  This development will take place on a phased basis.  As resources become available the particular needs of children and of schools in various areas will be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>In practice, the expansion of the psychological service has begun already.  In 1990 four psychologists were employed on temporary contracts to work on a pilot project in primary schools.  These psychologists were established permanently in early 1994.  A further ten psychologists were appointed in 1995 to initiate a Department of Education psychological service for primary schools.  These are assigned, as a matter of priority, to schools serving disadvantaged areas. These are in Dublin, Cork city and in Limerick city.  In addition, the original pilot service in South Tipperary and in West Tallaght/Clondalkin is being continued.  Psychological support is provided to these primary schools as resources allow. Further expansion was not possible during 1996 because of the need to limit recruitment to the public service.</P>
      <P>At present, it is the responsibility of the appropriate Health Board Director of Community Care to arrange for psychological assessments for children in national schools where such are deemed necessary.  It has been drawn to my attention that in recent years some of the health boards and voluntary bodies have ceased to provide assessments for what they consider to be purely educational purposes.  This has increased demand for a schools psychological service.</P>
      <P>As stated earlier, it is the intention that a school psychological service should eventually be universally available, but future developments must take place in the context of government decisions on public sector numbers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The allocation of ex-quota posts to second level schools in respect of guidance is determined by the enrolment in the school.</P>
      <P>The teacher allocation for the County Meath Vocational Education Committee for the 1996-97 school year includes an allocation of 0.2 whole-time teacher equivalents in respect of guidance in Longwood post-primary school.  An additional ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance for this school is not warranted at this time.</P>
      <P>I understand that an allocation has also been made to the school in respect of pastoral care. The question of allocating further teaching resources to the school from within the overall approved teacher allocation for the vocational education committee scheme is a matter for the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of allocating a resource post to the school, the position is that in 1995 I allocated an additional 56 resource posts to second level schools to cater for the needs of handicapped pupils.  The posts were allocated on the basis of information supplied by individual schools on a specially designed application form.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to allocate a post to Longwood post-primary school on that occasion. However, the position of the school will be considered when next it is possible to allocate additional resource posts.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government has recently announced its decision to provide £30 million for a project to develop the integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in first and second level schools.</P>
      <P>The project titled &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo; will run over five years until the year 2001.  It will involve the development and implementation of an exciting programme to support every Irish school in making the best possible educational use of ICTs. The programme will build on the expertise and creativity which is already in evidence in Irish classrooms.</P>
      <P>The project will target actions in three key areas, i.e. teacher training and support, classroom resources and infrastructure and policy research.</P>
      <P>In line with the approach being taken in other countries, every effort will be made to enhance the effect of the Government investment in the project by encouraging the development of partnerships with the private sector.</P>
      <P>Details of the project will be communicated to schools in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Details regarding the accessibility of all 3,300 primary schools are not readily available and I could not justify assigning scarce staff resources to their compilation.  All new primary schools built since 1992 have full access and facilities for disabled pupils in accordance with the building regulations.  The provision of facilities for disabled pupils in existing school buildings is grant-aided by my Department as the need arises. When a school enrols a disabled pupils and they do not have the required access, it is open to them to approach my Department for grant-aid towards the provision of such access.  If the Deputy has a query about a particular school, I will be happy to provide as much information as I can.</P>

      <P>The scheme for the payment of grants towards the building of recognised primary and secondary schools operates equally for schools of all denominations.</P>
      <P>Likewise, in allocating funds to primary schools for running and staffing costs, my Department makes no distinction on the basis of denomination.</P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools, most of which are managed by religious orders, receive financial assistance towards their running costs under the terms of the free education scheme.  The Department meets the cost of teacher salaries and allowances and makes an annual <i>per capita</i> grant towards the recurrent costs of these schools.  In addition, these schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme including grants for the employment of caretakers and secretaries, purchase of school books and certain curricular support grants.  These schools may not charge fees.</P>
      <P>The Department meets the costs of salaries and allowances for teachers employed by fee charging schools.  However, these schools are generally not eligible to receive the <i>per capita</i> grant in respect of their students, support for the employment of secretaries and caretakers or the various other grants for current expenditure to which schools in the free education scheme are entitled.</P>
      <P>A small number of schools of the Protestant tradition are eligible for all grants payable to schools and pupils in the free education scheme with the exception of the <i>per capita</i> grant.  A block grant is paid to the secondary education committee for distribution among needier Protestant children to enable them to attend a Protestant school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with the commitment in the White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, I have established a steering group, representative of the education partners, which will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector.  Following the enactment of the Education Bill, it is intended that schools will have statutorily based entitlements to current funding on the basis of nationality based criteria.  However, I wish to emphasise that the central calculation and payment of the <Col N="199" /> Protestant block grant will be retained to suit the special needs of second level Protestant schools.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the need to rearrange certain district court sitting arose following queries raised in court in Milford, Co. Donegal, by a solicitor concerning planning requirements for the use of rented accommodation for sittings of the District Court and the subsequent decision of the District Court Judge in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> Before arriving at his decision, the Judge had heard the views of a solicitor representing Donegal County Council who argued that such permission was not necessary.  Following consultation with the Attorney General, other district court areas where court sittings have up to now been held in non-court accommodation, were rearranged so that hearings would be held in dedicated court facilities.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Donegal County Council, as the local authority, which has the statutory duty to provide court premises, has referred the question raised in relation to the need for planning consultation in these cases to An Bord Plean·la under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 for determination.  I am awaiting the ruling by An Bord Plean·la in the matter and it would be inappropriate for me to preempt their decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that at present there are on average not more than ten clients per day, or 50 clients per week, on supervision attending the Finglas Office of the Probation and Welfare Service.All clients assigned to officers based in Finglas would not necessarily attend at the Finglas office.  In some cases home visits are made or clients attend other offices which are more convenient to their homes.  The clients currently attending mainly come from the Finglas and Ballymun areas.</P>
      <P>While the number of clients attending the office will be determined by the numbers placed on supervision by the courts, the total supervision caseload dealt with by the Finglas office is currently 190 cases and not 300 as referred to by the Deputy.  At present there are approximately 65 clients who attend on a regular basis.  Persons serving community service orders usually attend the office on a once-off basis only and thereafter at the site where they are doing the work.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service must supervise all offenders placed on supervision by the courts.  Before the offenders is placed on supervision, the courts would have taken into account the nature of the offence and the risk element to the public in each particular case.  As all these cases remain under the jurisdiction of the court, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the type of offences or the number of offenders from each geographic area in the environs of Finglas who attend the Finglas office. I wish to inform the Deputy however that out of a total caseload of 190 clients for the Finglas office, there are two sex offenders who are on probation supervision by order of the court, each attending the Finglas office once a fortnight.  It should be borne in mind that most offenders on supervision in the community are not subject to any particular restriction regarding their freedom of movement and are therefore free to travel to any part of the city, including Finglas, at will.</P>

      <P>With regard to Garda pay, the Garda have, over the years, received all the general round pay increases awarded to the public sector.  They have also benefited from special increases, all of which were in <Col N="211" /> return for agreement to co-operate with change and to improve efficiency.</P>
      <P>Constraints on pay which are a vital ingredient in underpinning the overall strategy on targets of national programmes affect all public sector workers &mdash; not just the gardaÌ &mdash; and are in no way discriminatory towards gardaÌ.  Current Government pay policy for the public sector is contained in Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>It is important, however, to draw attention to the fact that a fundamental review of Garda efficiency and effectiveness is under way at present which, among other things, is examining the role of the force and how it is functioning.  I understand that the review group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Tony Barry, will make recommendations which will involve significant change.</P>
      <P>They are expected to draw attention to the fact that issues affecting the structures of Garda pay and allowances will be a very important element in the delivery of this change.  I believe that, should the Government accept the recommendations in the report, it would be reasonable that the restructuring of rewards would fall to be looked at in the context of delivering that change. I have already indicated in my speech at the Annual Delegate Conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors that there are no proposals to set up an independent commission on Garda pay.</P>

      <P>KIMSAC (Kiosk-based Integrated Multimedia Service Access for Citizens) is a part EU-funded research project under the EU's 4th framework programme.  My Department is one of ten partners in the project consortium, which includes a number of Irish and overseas research companies and universities.  The project runs for three years from September 1995 to August 1998.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the project is to investigate how emerging technologies in the IT industry might be used to develop new kinds of user-friendly computer interactions, enabling customers to gain easy access to information and services.  Involvement in the project will, therefore, enable my Department to progress one of its key business responsibilities, that of providing an efficient service, offering reliable advice and information, with full regard to customers' varying needs and circumstances.  Two user trials will take place during the project lifetime, and will be managed by my Department.  The first trial is currently operational in three Social Welfare local offices, where customers are being invited to use the KIMSAC system to inquire on their entitlements under the Social Welfare and F¡S codes.  They do this by using a touch-sensitive screen to select from a range of options which are presented to them using a variety of multimedia elements.</P>
      <P>The second trial is scheduled for early next year, and will build on the results of the first trial, and include an increased number of services.  The trial locations will be extended to F¡S local offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the project trials will feed in to my Department's future plans for service delivery.Should the trials be successful, and customers <Col N="214" /> react favourably to the kiosk experiment, my intention would be to make the KIMSAC technology available as widely as possible, both in the offices of my own Department and in other information-providing organisations.  Because the KIMSAC system is based on the developing worldwide Web technology, consideration would also be given to making the service available on the public internet.  The services provided by KIMSAC could also be integrated into a Government-wide package of kiosk-based services covering a number of state and public services.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance at the maximum personal rate of £64.50 per week.  She has been in receipt of unemployment assistance since 1 September 1991.</P>
      <P>In February 1997 her case was referred for review to a Social Welfare inspector.  She failed on a number of occasions to make herself available for pre-arranged notified interview.  The purpose of this type of interview is to establish if the person continues to satisfy the statutory conditions for continued receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When she failed to make herself available for interview or notify the Social Welfare local office <Col N="215" /> of her reason for failing to do so her payment was suspended.  However, she subsequently made herself available for interview and supplied certain information on the terms of which her payment was restored.  She has applied for an adult dependant allowance in respect of her partner who, up to recently, was in receipt of unemployment assistance in his own right.  She has been asked to furnish certain evidence in relation to his earnings so that the application can be decided.</P>
    <P>She has also inquired about the back to work allowance scheme.  Her entitlement under that scheme would depend on the rate of unemployment assistance to which she is entitled and, as soon as this is determined, her application for the allowance will be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 26 July 1996 and his case was referred to a Social Welfare inspector for investigation of this means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In calculating means a Social Welfare inspector must estimate the income which an applicant may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding <Col N="217" /> year.  The person concerned was requested to provide details of his income from self-employment as a carpenter and other details of his means.  He did not do so at that time and on 10 September 1997 his application for unemployment assistance was disallowed on the basis that he had failed to show that his means were within the prescribed limit for entitlement.</P>
    <P>On 4 October 1996 the person concerned provided details of his means to the Social Welfare inspector.  His case was referred to a deciding officer who, on the basis of the evidence available to him, estimated that his income from self-employment in the succeeding year would be an average of £100 per week or £5,200 per annum. His application was accordingly disallowed on the grounds that his means exceeded the statutory limit.</P>
    <P>On 24 November 1996 he appealed against the decision to the Social Welfare appeals office.  He submitted medical certificates from 25 November 1996 until 15 January 1997.  He did not have an entitlement to disability benefit and was paid supplementary welfare allowance at his local health centre until 11 January 1997.</P>
    <P>An oral hearing of his appeal against the disallowance of unemployment assistance was held by the appeals officer on 18 February 1997.  Having considered all of the evidence, including the medical evidence, the appeals officer decided that the earnings of the person concerned in the succeeding year from self-employment would be nil. Accordingly he allowed the appeal and awarded unemployment assistance at the maximum rate effective from 30 July 1996.  Arrears in respect of the period from 30 July 1996 to 23 November 1996 have been issued.</P>
    <P>In December 1996 the person concerned had also applied to the community welfare officer for mortgage interest supplement.  I understand that he was requested to furnish documentation from the building society but failed to do so and his application could not be processed.</P>
    <P>He commenced employment in January 1997 and he has not been the subject of any investigation by either the Social Welfare inspector or the community welfare officer since then.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned wishes to pursue his claim for mortgage interest supplement for the period involved he should contact the Community Welfare Officer who will re-examine the case if the necessary documentation is supplied.</P>
    <P>Based on the evidence available to me this case appears to have been dealt with at all stages in good faith.  However, if the person concerned wishes to discuss any other aspect of his case he should contact the Department's regional manager at Finglas social welfare office.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments such as invalidity pension.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 470,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost this year of some £32.6 million.</P>
      <P>A spouse of a qualified person may also avil of the scheme if accompanied by the pass holder. However, the scheme is subject to time restrictions and capacity constraints and its provisions were never intended to extend to the dependent childrent of pass holders.</P>
      <P>At the end of last year, there were some 12,713 people in receipt of invalidity pension from my Department who were claiming for both adult and child dependants.  It is estimated that the extension of the free travel scheme to include the estimated 25,561 dependent children involved would entail additional annual costs of the order of £1.8 million.  The cost of free travel for the adult dependants is already included in the figure of £32.6 million mentioned above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>Insurers on a world wide basis classify young and inexperienced drivers as a high risk insurance category relative to the more mature and-or experienced driver.  The availability of insurance cover for the young driver and the level of premiums charged for such cover reflect insurers' claims experience of young drivers as a higher risk category.</P>
      <P>In its analysis of young motorists' risk profile, the Deloitte and Touche economic evaluation of insurance costs, commissioned by the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology, confirmed that, in a European context, young drivers, as a group, and individual young drivers with poor safety records will have a limited choice of insurers and will face high premium costs throughout the EU.  The report found that for the 21 years age group, UK premium rates for comprehensive insurance cover exceeded Irish rates.</P>
      <P>Viewing the problem in a strictly Irish context, I understand a survey undertaken by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1993 found that, under both comprehensive and non-comprehensive cover, the frequency and average cost of claim in the 17-24 age group was significantly higher than in the higher age categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report provided further evidence of the high cost of claims associated with the young driver.  The consultants found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17-24 year old drivers is over twice that for the 36 to age group and that motorists in the 17-24 age group are responsible for over 3Ω times the average claims costs of motorists in the 36-40 age group.  In addition, the National Roads Authority <Col N="220" /> Annual Report of 1995 indicated that almost 38 per cent of the motorists involved in fatal and personal injury accidents in 1995 were young drivers and that 41 per cent of the road casualty victims in 1995 were between the ages of 18 and 34.  Given all the facts, it is not surprising that young drivers will experience difficulty in obtaining quotations for motor insurance and that insurers, from an underwriting and solvency perspective, must charge high premiums to young and inexperienced drivers.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report concluded that the inculcation of safer driving standards in young drivers and education in driving skills is the key to reducing their high accident rate and to obtaining lower premium quotations.  In that regard, I would draw attention to the specific recommendations by Deloitte and Touche in relation to the possible introduction of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers on the lines of an Ontario model.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is to undertake an examination of the Ontario model in the context of current law and practice in Ireland.  The Department of the Environment has also co-operated with the AA in the launch of an AA drink driving video aimed at young drivers.  I would also point out that an insurance incentive scheme has been established by agreement between the Irish Insurance Federation and the Driving Instructors Register whereby insurance discounts will be offered to young drivers who have completed an agreed number of driving lessons over a calendar year.  The National Safety Council is also working to produce course material on road safety to fit in with the new primary school curriculum and has recently adopted a five year road safety programme which includes the development of educational material in 1998 for transition year students in secondary schools. Some schools are also offering driving training courses on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>While the benefits of the above measures may not impact on motor insurance costs for young drivers in the short-term, I note that, in their recent adjustments to their motor insurance rates, the Hibernian group, the second largest under-writer in the Irish motor market, has incorporated a reassessment of young drivers' insurance risk profile resulting in a new insurance scheme which will take into account a young motorist's claims free experience as a named driver on his or her parents' motor insurance policy and offer a no claims bonus incentive to reward such claims free driving.  This initiative by the Hibernian group is a welcome development and perhaps the first indication that the series of initiatives I have listed above will, in the course of time, impact favourably on motor insurance premiums for young drivers.  The Hibernian group's initiative, in particular, is a positive step and one which I hope will be followed by other motor insurers in the Irish market.</P>

      <P>Last January, the Irish Bankers' Federation wrote to the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology to indicate that they welcomed the publication of the Credit Union Bill, 1996 and the updating and consolidation of legislation in this area.  In an accompanying submission, the federation indicated that they had major concerns about certain aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>While their submission included some detailed suggestions for amendment of the Bill, it dealt primarily with: the exemption given to credit unions from the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 and its continuance in the Credit Union Bill; the taxation of credit unions, specifically that of corporation tax and the tax treatment of dividends and deposit interest earned by credit union members on their savings; the additional services which credit unions would be enabled to operate upon the Bill's enactment.</P>
      <P>At the request of the federation, officials of my Department met federation representatives on 24 February to discuss their submission.  Aside from the issue of taxation which was indicated to be a matter for the Department of Finance, the federation were adviced that the Minister would take their comments into account in conjunction with the various other submissions which he had received on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, met the federation on 10 April last following the conclusion of deliberations by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on the Bill's detailed provisions.  The primary issues raised by the federation with him included: credit union taxation which he indicated was a matter for the Minister for Finance; the savings and loan limits which they argued were not stringent enough.  I disagreed; the exemption from the Consumer Credit Act.  The federation indicated that they would be asking the European Commission to withdraw the exemption of credit unions from the relevant directive with a view to their being fully regulated by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The Minister indicated that the exemption stood but that the Credit Union Bill does allow the Registrar of Friendly Societies to control credit union advertising; the general regulation of credit unions.  The federation argued that this was too lax.  The Minister indicated that one of the purposes of the Credit Union Bill was to improve the powers of the Registrar and additional staffing resources had been committed by the Government for that purpose and the role of the Irish League of Credit Unions where the Minister indicated that they were being given a statutory consultative role <Col N="222" /> under the Bill.  The Minister has had no contract with the federation on the Bill since that meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The small business task force made 121 recommendations in its report which was published in March 1994.  To date, 41 of the task force's recommendations have been fully implemented and substantial progress has been made with the partial implementation of a further 32 recommendations.  The following schedule gives details of the remaining 48 outstanding recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The systematic examination and implementation of these outstanding recommendations is being pursued by the small business and services division of my Department, which has assessed all of the recommendations and is actively pursuing <Col N="223" /> their implementation.  In addition, the small business and services forum which I established to advise me on policy issues concerning the development of small businesses and services, in consultation with the small business and services division, has examined those recommendations which remain to be fully implemented and has listed a number of the areas for priority attention during 1997, including administrative simplification and taxation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that significant further progress will be achieved this year in implementing the recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Schedule</P>
    <P Just="Center">Recommendations of the Task Force Report on Small Business which have not been implemented in full or in part.</P>
    <P>1.  Delete from the tax refunds for the new enterprise scheme the specific condition that &ldquo;applicants are disqualified if they hold more than 15% of the capital of any other company&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>2.  Devise a common format for the business plans submitted to CEBs.</P>
    <P>3.  If the proposal for the establishment of a campus venture capital fund progresses to fruition, the State should consider giving tax credits for investment in research and development by such companies.</P>
    <P>4.  Establish a &ldquo;Third Banking Force&rdquo;, its chief function being the provision of long-term loans to small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>5.  The PRSI allowance (£286) should be extended to self employed persons paying the higher contribution rate.</P>
    <P>6.  The Minister for Finance should appoint an expert group to devise a tax credit scheme to give employers rewards for risk and enterprise, such as personal tax credits for additional jobs created by them.</P>
    <P>7.  Re-introduce dividend relief for companies in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors, with appropriate modifications to counter the type of abuses which were practised by those who qualified for dividend relief prior to its termination in 1992 (because of abuse).</P>
    <P>8.  Rollover relief should be introduced for business assets acquired by inheritance or gift and subsequently re-invested in another business.</P>
    <P>9.  Court procedures should be streamlined in order to enable claimants to take action for non-payment of commercial debts more easily and effectively.</P>
    <P>10.  There is a need for a prompt simplified procedure for commercial debts of up to £5,000 on the lines of the small claims procedure for consumer action.</P>
    <P>11.  Withholding tax should not be deducted from payments for professional services to enterprises with a turnover of up to £1m per annum and in possession of a valid tax clearance certificate.</P>
    <P>12.  Withholding tax should not be deducted for payments to limited companies with a turnover of up to £1m per annum, whose Directors are on PAYE, should cease.</P>
    <P>13.  In the longer term, withholding tax should be abolished for payments for professional services to enterprises who are in possession of a tax clearance certificate.</P>
    <P>14.  Relevant contracts tax should be deducted at the standard (27%) rate of PAYE.</P>
    <P>15.  Payment of retirement gratuities to public servants should in future be taxed on the same basis as similar payments to other employees.</P>
    <P>16.  VAT should be recoverable on a broader range of business expenses.  At the time of the Task Force report, EU law stated that VAT should not be deductible on <Col N="224" /> expenditures which are not for business purposes &mdash; the Task Force considered that the interpretation of this restriction in Ireland was too narrow.</P>
    <P>17.  Increases in commercial rates should not exceed the increase in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>18.  Start-up business with fewer than 20 employees should be exempt from rates during the first two years of their operation.</P>
    <P>19.  The option of accounting for VAT on an annual basis should be extended to firms with an annual liability for the tax of up to £10,000.</P>
    <P>20.  Turnover limits below which annual accounting options are offered to businesses be raised to £5,000 for PAYE/PRSI.</P>
    <P>21.  The C2 form should not include a personalised photograph.</P>
    <P>22.  The onus for establishing the tax position and social welfare entitlements of employees should shift to the employee and the relevant Government Department, through the introduction of single ongoing record of the earnings, tax and social welfare position of every employee as well as for claiming benefits and recording details of the cessation or commencement of employment (a re-designed P45 might be suitable for this purpose).</P>
    <P>23.  Form P60 should be issued by the Revenue Commissioners, who would obtain all the information required to issue such certificate from the P35 return.</P>
    <P>24.  Abolish emergency tax in favour of a straight deduction of tax at the standard rate where the employee has not provided the appropriate revenue form.  Also, abolish the forms dealing with employees on emergency tax.</P>
    <P>25.  All current forms dealing with disability and occupational injury should be replaced by a single form.</P>
    <P>26.  Creation of a new category of limited liability for the first two years of operation of new businesses, total registration costs should be £100 and all companies would operate under a common memorandum and Articles of Association supplied by the C.R.O.  The promoters would only be obliged to state the company's principal object and its share capital.</P>
    <P>27.  Link audit requirement threshold to consumer price index.</P>
    <P>28.  Information obtained by one agency should, if required by another, be exchanged rather than being sought again from business.</P>
    <P>29.  An expert group should be established comprising representatives of the CSO, the main Government Departments that require administrative returns, and business in order to establish ways of removing the obstacles to the greater integration of administrative and statistical records and surveys.</P>
    <P>30.  Government Departments and agencies should be required to consult with the CSO when they are establishing new administrative systems or updating existing ones so that the statistical dimension is taken fully into account at the planning and design stage.</P>
    <P>31.  Voluntary CSO surveys should be clearly presented as such.</P>
    <P>32.  The annual statutory return of emoluments and numbers employed which companies covered by the F¡S training levy/grant schemes must complete should be replaced by a copy of the employer's annual P35 return, which should be amended to give a breakdown of the number of males and females employed (this information is required by F¡S).</P>
    <P>33.  Where an employer has fewer than 20 employees, the burden of proof under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 and 1993 should henceforth be neutral as between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>34.  The qualifying service period for eligibility under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 and 1993 should be two years for employees employed in enterprises with fewer than 20 employees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> 35.  Other than for maternity legislation, workers should qualify for the protections of labour legislation only when they work 18 hours or more per week.  The threshhold for maternity legislation should remain at 8 hours per week.</P>
    <P>36.  The Payment of Wages Act, 1991 should be amended to remove the entitlement of serving employees to payment in cash provided that the alternative payment method proposed by the employer imposes no additional cost on the employee.</P>
    <P>37.  Introduction of a permit system, which would be operated by the Health Boards, for &ldquo;cottage industries&rdquo; engaged in the making of basic foodsuffs.  The cost of such permits should not exceed £10 and would be valid for 3 years.  Structural requirements for compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations would also reflect the small-scale nature of the businesses concerned.</P>
    <P>38.  Manufacturing and international services businesses coming under the aegis of Forbairt, or the regional bodies of SFADCo and ⁄dar·s na Gaeltachta, should be allocated an executive in the relevant agency to serve as a contact point for their dealings with the State agencies as a whole.</P>
    <P>39.  Public sector bodies who do not have a qualified professional in purchasing should appoint one on an initial contract of 3-5 years duration.</P>
    <P>40.  Public Purchasing Officials should in future approach their role in a more active and dynamic fashion.</P>
    <P>41.  Due to an apparent inadequate understanding of EU public procurement directives, better and more training on EU law for purchasing officials is recommended.</P>
    <P>42.  Emphasising factors such as quality, value for money, reliability and after-sales service should be part of the criterion that applies to purchasing policy as opposed to the current criterion of lowest price which applies too narrow a perspective to purchasing policy.</P>
    <P>43.  Public sector contracts should be made more accessible to small firms, and work done by the DTI in the UK should be studied and emulated by the Department of Enterprise and Employment and by the new company recommended.</P>
    <P>44.  Increase public sector commitment to encourage and assist Irish suppliers to access public procurement.</P>
    <P>45.  Department of Enterprise and Employment to consult with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure VAT returns are used to develop a proper statistical profile of the broad spread of enterprises in this country.</P>
    <P>46. Department of Enterprise and Employment to undertake studies on business failures including causes.</P>
    <P>47.  Small Business Division, after consultation with the Small Business Forum, should prepare an annual report on small business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>48. Before legislative or other measures likely to affect small business are proceeded with, a full and systematic analysis of their impact on small enterprises should be undertaken.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>the progress, if any, there has been to establish a code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures in essential services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice on dispute procedures including procedures in essential services drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission was published in January 1992.  The code aims to ensure that disputes are resolved without recourse to industrial action by providing practical guidance on procedures for the resolution of such disputes.  The code places particular emphasis on the avoidance of disputes in essential services, and sets out additional procedures and safeguards for inclusion in agreements between employers and trade unions in such services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that adherence to the principles contained in the code is primarily a matter for employers and trade unions.  Considerable progress has been made towards improving our industrial relations and a significant contribution to that improvement has been adherence to the industrial peace clause contained in the recent national agreements.  The industrial peace clause in the current agreement, Partnership 2000, in common with the code of practice on dispute procedures, emphasises the necessity to utilise third party machinery in the resolution of industrial disputes.</P>
      <P>As part of its day-to-day work the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission brings to the attention of employers and trade unions the codes of practice promulgated under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>When so requested the advisory service assists employers and trade unions with the drafting of grievance and dispute procedures which reflect the terms of the code of practice on dispute procedures including procedures in essential services.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the IDA sold a portion of land for a waste site in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, in view of the fact that the usage of this land is totally opposed by the vast majority in Ballaghaderreen and it was sold by private negotiations without a public auction or public tender; and if he will have investigations made into the matter immediately and suggest to the IDA that they purchase back this site for industrial development.</Quest>

      <P>Land in IDA Ireland ownership is largely sold to client companies of IDA and Forbairt as part of a package to promote industrial development and to create industrial undertakings which will provide employment, in accordance with the Industrial Development Acts, 1986 to 1995.</P>
      <P>The procedure which IDA Ireland adopts when selling land for industrial undertakings is to set land prices based on recovery of purchase and development costs, taking account of current market values.  These prices are reviewed each year.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, as IDA is negotiating with clients who are establishing industrial undertakings the issue of tenders-public auctions does not arise as it is not a competitive situation.  The purchaser in question applied to Forf·s some time ago for space on a serviced site &ldquo;for recycling purposes&rdquo; in line with current Government conservation and recycling policy.  In the view of IDA Ireland this is an industrial undertaking meeting the criteria set out in the relevant legislation.  Markets have been identified for the final product both in Ireland and the UK.</P>
      <P>An irrevocable contract for the sale of this site has been entered into between IDA Ireland and the purchaser in respect of his industrial undertaking in Ballaghadereen.  Planning permission for the proposed development has been received from An Bord Plean·la and there is therefore no basis on which IDA Ireland could withdraw from its agreement.</P>

      <P>I have stated to the House on previous occasions in relation to industrial disputes, such as the dispute at Irish Life involving non-managerial sales staff, that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene.  This is because such intervention could only help to undermine the role of the State's dispute settling agencies.</P>
      <P>The Government has established the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court to assist parties in an industrial dispute situation to reach a settlement.  These agencies have the appropriate expertise and a proven track record in the resolution of industrial disputes.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the parties in the Irish Life dispute have availed of the services of both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  It is regrettable that, to date, the parties have been unable to reach a settlement in this dispute.  The responsibility for the achievement of a resolution to this dispute rests with the parties directly concerned.  I take this opportunity to urge the parties to renew their efforts to bring this dispute to a conclusion.</P>

The Connemara pony is designated as such a rare breed and accordingly attracts the available REPS payment of 100 ECU per livestock unit.  To avail of this payment applicants must be participating in REPS, be a member of the relevant breed society or approved conservation agency and participate in the programmes for the conservation of the breed.  There are no funds available to me to provide aid in excess of that provided under REPS.</P>

      <P>While I am committed to minimising delays in processing afforestation applications, I am also committed to ensuring that forestry development is compatible with the protection of the environment and must take the measures necessary to implement this.  Naturally this is having some impact on the time taken to process applications.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there are undue delays caused by the recent reduction in the EIA threshold for afforestation.  Furthermore local authorities are now consulted on applications over 25 hectares and they are given one month to furnish their comments, a time period which I believe is reasonable.  Cases awaiting approval longer than 120 days are not delayed for administrative reasons <i>per se</i> but usually involve more complex environmental considerations.</P>
      <P>The period for processing applications is continually monitored and shortened where possible.</P>
