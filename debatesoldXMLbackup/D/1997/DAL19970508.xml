      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday I raised with the Minister for Finance the undertaking in the programme for Government to examine the possibility of splitting the two roles currently exercised by the Attorney General as legal adviser to the Government and upholder of the public interest.  The programme also gives an undertaking to ensure that the holders of high office in the State are more answerable and accountable to the Legislature.  I asked the Minister for Finance if he would involve himself and the Government in the decision taken by the Chief State Solicitor's office, in conjunction with the Attorney General, not to appear before a committee of the House which had unanimously voted that the Chief State Solicitor or the Attorney General should be called before it to explain why the State adopted its approach in the Brigid McCole case.</P>

      <P>It is not a rehash of yesterday's proceedings as the Minister contacted me before 7 p.m. last night to tell me the Government would not waive its right of confidentiality on this issue. The Government is, therefore, refusing to meet the wishes of an all-party committee which unanimously decided that an officer of the State should come before it.  Why will the Government not waive its right of confidentiality on this issue?  It is working against a committee of the House.  I ask the Minister to answer my question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, as the respected Leader of the Chamber what protection the parties in the House have on this issue if a committee of the House, which is nominated at the start of each Dáil, unanimously decides to ask an officer of the State to appear before it but he decides, on the advice of the Attorney General, not to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only tell the Deputy that it would be audacious for the Ceann Comhairle to intervene or to be seen to intervene in the internal affairs of a committee of the House.  The committees are autonomous bodies and have their own chairmen, committee members and staff and, accordingly, it is for them to decide the matter.</P>

      <P>I understand your point, a Cheann Comhairle, but the Government can correct the matter by waiving the confidentiality right.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform who is taking the Order of Business today is an eminent legal person and he understands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not good enough for a Minister to say the Government has no say in this matter. If the Government waives its right, the officer of the State can attend the committee, which is the wish of the committee.  Will the Government order that?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If Members are dissatisfied with Ministers' replies, they have a remedy. There are many other ways of raising matters in the House and I advise Deputy Ahern to utilise some of those avenues of approach.  My office will assist him in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I take that remedy, is the Minister telling the House that the Government is refusing to intervene in this matter?  As I understand it, the Attorney General would have informed the Government that it was its decision as to whether the right should be waived.  This is a matter for the Government and if the Government has decided to refuse to allow the case to be made to this committee, that is a disgraceful decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal strategy was unjustifiable. That is the reason examination of the legal strategy was excluded from the terms of reference of the tribunal.  It is unfortunate that the Government has not waived this right because it must accept political responsibility in this matter. Given that Deputy Taylor is the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, and that he has expertise in the legal area, will he agree it is unjustifiable that there is no accountability in this matter and that the House cannot examine it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand cogent reasons were set out in the letter from the Chief State Solicitor explaining the position in this regard.  The committees operate in accordance with Standing Orders and the rules set down by the House.  That appears to be the position.</P>

      <P>I certainly will.  I realise the Minister for Equality and Law Reform had to take the Order of Business this morning, but I thought the Government Chief Whip would have brought him up to date on the current position in relation to this committee.  Is the Minister aware that, as a result of the meeting yesterday evening of the Select Committee on Social Affairs, it is within our Standing Orders, according to the Chairman &mdash; a party colleague of the Minister &mdash; to request these people to come before the committee to discuss the impact of the aggravated damages claim on the Health Estimate for this and subsequent years?  There is no question of the committee not having the power to deal with these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

As a legally qualified person, will the Minister confirm that is the case, and that the reason we are not progressing this issue before a committee is that the Government is allowing the cover up to continue?</P>

I appreciate that time is of the essence.  I cannot understand how the Government can refuse to accede to the request because the Brigid McCole case is settled.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Neglect of South West Region: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Martin on Wednesday, 7 May 1997:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" />&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its neglect of Cork City and the South-West, for its failure to ensure balanced economic development, to provide sufficient educational resources to tackle high unemployment, and to implement all aspects of the Land Use Transportation Study.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Government for the implementation of policies which have supported significantly improved economic and social progress in Cork City and the South-West, and supports the continued development of these policies to meet the needs of the city and the region.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Enterprise and Employment).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to support this motion.</P>
      <P>As Minister for the Environment between 1992 and 1994 I had a brief opportunity to take a number of measures aimed at supporting the development, enhancement and improvement of the economic circumstances in Cork city and surrounding areas.  It was the Fianna Fáil-led Government, in coalition with the Labour Party, that progressed funds for the Lee Tunnel.  It was the Fianna Fáil-led Government that decided to make the necessary improvements at Blackpool. The congestion and problems in that part of the city were acute.  However, that project has progressed very little since we left office.  A flats complex in that area, in which drug addiction and crime is rampant, is causing enormous problems for the local community.  When we were in office the local authorities, with the agreement of the Department of the Environment, were making arrangements to demolish those flats and rehouse the applicants throughout the northside of the city.  It is regrettable that project has been shelved.</P>
      <P>Even though environmental problems in Cork city had not escalated to the point of breaking EU legislation on smog levels, the then Government banned the use of bituminous coal in the city.  Reports since then indicate that the people of Cork welcome the improvement in air quality in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main context of this motion is the development of the educational facilities, primarily the enhancement and due recognition of the regional technical college in Cork.  It is regrettable that as we come close to a general election we see different treatment in different parts of the country depending on whether there is pressure on a particular seat.  Decisions about educational facilities, the universities, technical institutes and regional technical colleges should always be based on strict national criteria and whoever jumps the fence or produces the goods receives <Col N="10" /> the lolly.  It should not be a question of political aggrandisement.  Education and training can never be allowed to be developed in that piecemeal and political fashion.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for the marine and defence I have visited the regional technical college in Cork and met people engaged in research into aspects of the Marine.  We have turned our backs on the harvesting of the resources of the sea for long enough, but great work is being done there and initiatives have been taken, even with limited resources, to help any Government to understand better what must be done to harvest those resources, not only in regard to our fisheries and leisure pursuits but also seabed development and other aspects.  It is a shame that students and teachers of that college should have to take to the streets of Cork city or Dublin to express their frustration at the Government's selective decisions which were not based on proper criteria.</P>
    <P>I am proud to support this motion proposed by Deputy Martin, our spokesman on education.  In the past few years he has worked tirelessly to progress Fianna Fáil educational policy.  I compliment him, in particular, on the way he has tried to address the question of disadvantage.  Whether we are talking about disability, the need for remedial teaching, psychological support services or resource teachers, we all know that for a long time a percentage of our population, whether at primary, secondary or third level, has missed out and in many ways has been alienated from society because the opportunities to develop their talents and their personalities to the fullest extent did not happen owing to the necessary resources not being made available.</P>
    <P>In the context of what is contained in this motion, the primary aim is to deal with high unemployment and other problems of which Deputies who serve that part of the south are only too well aware.  I hope there will be some positive response from the Government to this genuine motion put forward in the interests of trying to make sure the right thing is done in relation to the regional technical college in Cork.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the motion but the approach of Fianna Fáil is the clearest case of the ostrich-like, &ldquo;head in the sand&rdquo; syndrome I have seen for a long time.  One would think from the motion that the Government had failed the people of Cork but the opposite is true.  The Government has reversed the neglect and deprivation which the region suffered under the Fianna Fáil-PDs Government.  How can those parties draw attention to the region, given their disgraceful record in the area?</P>

      <P>This Government worked to save the jobs and they have now been secured for the future.</P>
      <P>A pattern of growth, development, building and progress can be seen across Cork under this Government.  Urban renewal schemes have been initiated in Mallow and Cobh.  Hospitals in Youghal, Mallow, Cobh, Midleton and Fermoy have received major investment.  Waiting lists have been halved and there has been particular success in reducing waiting time for hip replacements. Some £300 million has been invested in roads.  The list of developments includes the Mallow road project, the Glanmire-Carrigtohill bypass, the Cork to Bandon road and the Carrigtwohill to Dunkettle section of the N25.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not list all the projects, I will leave some for Deputy Lynch.  Over £100 million was invested in national roads in Cork in 1995 and 1996, which is one-quarter of the national spending on roads in those two years.</P>
      <P>This Government has abolished third level fees.  I am amused Deputy Martin has the neck to contribute to this debate.  When his party was in power with us he welcomed that move, but when Fianna Fáil forced the collapse of that coalition he changed his tune pretty fast.  I could not help smiling at his comments on the need for a Minister for Cork.  If that is how easily he changes his mind on an issue of national importance, I hope he does not aspire to anything higher than the Opposition Front Bench, for he will surely be disappointed.</P>
      <P>My colleagues and I have demonstrated that this is a Government for all the people.  By tabling this motion and the motion on Dublin last week, Fianna Fáil has attempted a cynical divide and conquer approach.  However, this Government serves all the people and our record shows that includes the people of Cork.  Extensions have been provided for Scoil Gobnait in Mallow and Ballycotton national school.  Killavullan national school has been refurbished, as has Conna national school.  The list goes on.</P>

      <P>This Government has begun to undo the damage caused to our schools by the neglect of the PD-Fianna Fáil Government.  Just ask the parents of the pupils.</P>
      <P>I could go on forever listing what this Government has achieved for Cork.  I did not mention the £3 million water supply scheme for Cobh.  We have invested £4.5 million in the Mitchelstown sewerage scheme.  We have invested £2.7 million in the water supply scheme in Macroom and £3 million in a similar scheme in Schull.  The list goes on and on.</P>
      <P>The housing figures illustrate the deficiencies of the &ldquo;cut, cut, cut&rdquo; years of the Fianna Fáil-PD Government.  The public housing programme has increased by two thirds in Cork to 10,000 completions in 1996.  An enormous £22 million was spent in Cork on capital allocations and the remedial works scheme.  That is almost treble what the Progressive Democrats want to spend. Its policy is that those who cannot afford houses should not get them.</P>
      <P>I am proud of what this Government has achieved.  We have a strong record of delivery, achievement and service.  Where the Fianna Fáil-PD Government failed the people, we have righted those wrongs.  Deputies Martin, Walsh and O'Keeffe should hang their heads in shame at bringing this motion before the House.</P>

      <P>In November 1994, two and a half years ago, there were by-elections in Cork North-Central and Cork South-Central.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Michael Smith this morning talk about Fianna Fáil's input into Cork North-Central, which I represent as a result of that by-election.  He said Fianna Fáil had decided to demolish the Blackpool flats because of the social problems connected with them.  Blackpool is one of four villages which form the periphery of Cork city.  If people in Blackpool were asked what Fianna Fáil ever delivered to the area, they would say the only item it delivered was the Blackpool flats.  Deputy Michael Smith is now telling us that because of the many problems attached to those flats that he gave the go-ahead for them to be pulled down.  That is not the case as they are now being offered for sale on the private market.</P>
      <P>I hope the era of demolishing buildings and hiding problems as quickly as possible is long over.  The unimaginative solutions which Fianna Fáil presented to the people of Cork North-Central for almost 60 years are long gone.  At long last the people are beginning to see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Governments in power prior to that by-election forgot entirely about Cork city.  Even at local level they had deliberately abandoned the north side of the city, whether it was in respect of planning, job creation or education.  On a previous debate on education proposed by Fianna Fáil on Private Members' business, I quoted <Col N="14" /> frightening figures outlined in Patrick Clancy's paper entitled <i>Who goes to College?</i>, which has since been updated.  These indicated that only 1 per cent of the children of unskilled workers availed of third level education, while approximately 40 per cent dropped out in their first year for good reasons associated with the lack of social support, care, peer pressure, etc.  All these factors exist in Cork North-Central and while not all those who did not want to go to college live there, they did not go because of deliberate neglect.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with boasting; I do not care as long as action is taken.  I am glad to see that Fianna Fáil has at last got a conscience about the people it deliberately ghettoised and neglected. Nevertheless, we should deal with fact.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government its actions were based on fantasy, which appears to have become more prevalent within the party, even though it has been in opposition for only two and a half years.</P>
    <P>Since entering office, the Government has achieved a record rate of job creation of 7.6 per cent in the south-west, including Cork.  This represents 50 per cent more jobs than that achieved during the Government led by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, when the numbers of jobless in the south-west increased by almost 18 per cent.  This Government, which includes Democratic Left, has seen the unemployment figure in the Cork region plummet by 17.8 per cent. Unemployment in the region is below the national average.  When Fianna Fáil was in power, it was no great boast for anybody in Cork city to acknowledge that Cork had an above average unemployment rate.</P>
    <P>In 1996, 1,022 new jobs were created in Cork city and county.  An additional 1,400 jobs will be created in new projects which have been announced for the south-west region.  Over 800 jobs in the electronics sector will shortly be provided in the Cork city area.  Most people forget that Cork city and county is now the silicon valley of Ireland because of a good environment and a well educated young population able to take up the jobs.</P>
    <P>It can be very boring when statistics are thrown into the middle of a debate like this.  We should deal with facts.  With regard to consumer affairs, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe rightly pointed out that Cork is far from Dublin and that people do not have ready access, especially if there are complaints at the lower end of the scale.  Fianna Fáil promised an office of consumer affairs which did not materialise until Deputy Rabbitte became Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Similarly, at one stage people had to have constant recourse to money lenders because they could not manage on the pittance they were provided with until legislation and an infrastructure was put in place with regard to MABS, which started in Cork and has extended to virtually the entire country.  The credit union legislation will cater for a different sector.</P>
    <P>All these measures were put in place in two and a half years, not 60 years.  It involved recognising the problems and doing something positive about them.  I worry that people will start to <Col N="15" /> believe Fianna Fáil rhetoric, when they never have in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not what we will do, but what we have done.  That is the difference.  Fianna Fáil keep telling us what they will do, but they did not do it in the past.  We did not talk about it; we just did it.</P>
      <P>There is still a huge amount of work to be done in the area of education in Cork north central.  A most innovative and creative scheme, breaking the cycle, was introduced last year.  Everybody is aware of the statistics on people who leave school between the ages of 16 and 24 without qualifications. They will be unemployed and are likely to remain so.  Almost 4,000 children leave school annually without qualifications and they will be the unemployed of the future.  Generations of families in Cork North-Central are unemployed and this must be stopped.</P>
      <P>The breaking the cycle initiative and the early start scheme are two of the best programmes ever introduced to tackle unemployment in terms of life skills and how society will be ordered in the future.  Two schools, St. Mary's on the Hill and Gurranebraher, were omitted from the breaking the cycle scheme but nobody is sure why.  People who know the areas these two schools serve are aware that they would qualify irrespective of the criteria used to measure deprivation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin's solution to this was announced to great applause.  He said that, if he was Minister for Education, every one teacher school would receive a second teacher.  This type of scatter gun approach has left Cork north central and other similar areas needing the benefit of the breaking the cycle and early start schemes. How could one justify giving two teachers to a school that has ten pupils?  The Deputy did not mention Cork North-Central and schools which are hugely deprived.</P>

      <P>This Government has been in office for less than two and a half years.  In that relatively short time, it has achieved much for the country and for Cork.  I will refer to some of these achievements not in a complacent way, but to record the factual position, particularly in Cork.</P>
      <P>By now it is universally accepted that the overall performance of the economy is remarkable by any standard; it is without parallel in Europe. That sustained performance could not have occurred without the prudent management of the public finances and the policies and initiatives followed by this Government.</P>

The results have enabled us to make a positive impact on job creation, to reduce taxation and create the additional resources to invest in crime prevention, infrastructure, education, health and social welfare.  The future also looks bright.  That is the view not just of the Government but, more importantly, of the independent Economic and Social Research Institute in its optimistic forecast published last week.  This is a brief glimpse of the national position but how has Cork fared?  I have lived in Cork all my life and I cannot recall any period when there was so much confidence and optimism.</P>
      <P>Of course, there are exceptions and that always will be the case.  Much remains to be done and the two speakers who preceded me have referred to that. It is disingenuous of the Opposition to deny the spectacular improvements which have taken place in Cork within the very short lifetime of this Government, some of which I might now cite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the jobs front, more and more industrial jobs are being created in Cork &mdash; 6,500 in a little over two years &mdash; at Ringaskiddy, Ovens, Mahon, Pouladuff, Little Island, Model Farm Road, Fermoy, Youghal, Macroom and elsewhere.  This is only part of the picture as record growth continues to create jobs in every sector in Cork, particularly in services of all kinds, in construction <Col N="17" /> and in tourism.  For the first time in years unemployment is steadily reducing month by month.  It is forecast that between mid-1994 and mid-1997 the increase in the numbers of people at work in the south-west region will reach an unprecedented 25,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>The pipeline for new international investment in jobs is particularly strong.  I am aware that at least two major overseas companies are seriously examining the possibility of establishing plants in Cork, each with a job potential in excess of 1,000. Needless to say, these are not a reality until formal decisions are announced and I do not claim them to be such.  I mention them merely to emphasise the attractiveness of Cork as one of the best industrial locations for modern industry anywhere in Europe and to demonstrate the healthy level of inquiries in the pipeline for Cork.</P>
    <P>Another favourable indication of progress on the jobs front is the number of world-class, household names now locating in Cork, companies such as Eastman Kodak, Johnson &amp; Johnson and last week Warner Lambert, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>The contribution of IDA-Ireland in all of this has been very significant.  I want to acknowledge and thank that agency for all it is doing to bring top class international companies to Cork and to facilitate the expansion of existing international companies there which is just as important but which, to my astonishment, Members opposite seemed to decry as being some kind of inferior development.  Expansion of existing companies is the best vote of confidence in the future of Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must also emphasise the important and increasing contribution of our indigenous industries to the increased economic activity in the Cork region.  I should also like to congratulate and thank Forbairt for its success in that sector.  In addition, the four Cork enterprise boards are playing a most important part in the creation of additional jobs in smaller industries. Well done to them too.</P>
      <P>There is one other initiative on the jobs front to which I should like to refer especially, that is the announcement in the past week of the establishment of an enterprise zone on lands immediately adjacent to Cork Airport.  As Minister of State at the Department of Finance I have been involved directly in obtaining tax incentives for this very exciting development for Cork which has the potential to create several thousand well-paid jobs in the kind of specialised industries and services seeking to locate beside an established international airport.  This is a real breakthrough for Cork Airport which will bring not only direct jobs but provide much additional business for the airport itself.  It also has the prospect of bringing in its wake other desirable developments such as a major hotel and conference centre adjacent to the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very brief status report on the Cork <Col N="18" /> jobs front, a good story and one that provides real hope for the people of Cork in the years ahead. However, much remains to be done to reduce the unemployment figures further.  It can be done and, with this Government in office, it will be done.</P>
    <P>While the Government's primary aim is focused unashamedly on the creation of jobs, it certainly has not neglected investment in infrastructure, education, health, recreation and the arts in Cork.  The Government has secured enormous funds for Cork's infrastructure, particularly in the road system both around the city and throughout the county.  Investment in sewerage and water, though sometimes less noticeable, is nevertheless fundamental to a developing region and this Government has also invested heavily in these essential services throughout Cork.  There was a reference to two major road projects, the Blackpool bypass and the extension of the southern ring road to and around Ballincollig.  The Government is unequivocally committed to ensuring that these two essential projects are provided at the earliest practical date.  They were not provided for in the EU-funded programme up to 1999 negotiated by the previous Government, which is now loud in its condemnation of this Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to education, which is the key to much of our future, the Government as well as eliminating fees on third level education has supported fully the necessary expansion of facilities at both UCC and Cork regional technical college, soon to be the Cork Institute of Technology. This support will continue and grow in the years ahead if this Government is returned to office. We have also invested heavily in our schools, with a major new community college at Glanmire, a new special school at Fota and extensions to Our Lady of Lourdes, Ballinlough, Crab Lane, Ballin-temple, as well as a splendid new sports hall at St. Anthony's, Ballinlough.</P>
    <P>On the health front, the Government has provided up to £12 million for the construction of a major new facility at the Mercy Hospital.  Nothing comparable was invested in the health services in Cork during the lifetime of the previous three administrations, and that speaks for itself.  The Minister for Health has made the long-awaited decision to centralise maternity facilities at Cork University Hospital and has invested heavily in new equipment in all Cork hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the area of recreation and sport, the investment in three spectacular projects will change for the better the quality of life and enjoyment for many Cork people.  I refer to the fine, new regional pool at Bishopstown costing £2.5 million, the magnificent new racecourse at Mallow due to open very shortly and costing in excess of £8 million and the expansion in visitor and other facilities at Fota Wildlife Park costing £0.50 million.</P>
    <P>Arts and culture in Cork have been given priority by the Government.  A major new extension to the Crawford Art Gallery is under way and Cork has also been designated as a centre of <Col N="19" /> excellence for the visual arts.  As a tangible expression of support for that, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is investing with Cork Corporation in the provision of major new studios for working artists, which is one of the most exciting developments ever for the arts in Cork.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, for his efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>This three-party Government, working closely together, is totally committed to the future prosperity and well-being of the people of Cork city and county.  I claim without fear or favour that it has put its money where its mouth is at all levels over the past two and a half years.  I hope the forthcoming election will be fought on the record of this Government as well as on the programmes of the respective parties.  On that basis the people of Cork will endorse what we have been doing and give us the opportunity to continue to enhance our efforts on their behalf in the years immediately ahead.</P>

      <P>It is sad that, as we approach a general election, the Government does not even have a policy for Cork.  This debate about Cork is necessary and long overdue.  The Minister said last night that he heard only old slogans and that the Opposition lacks focus for Cork.  How often did he or any other Minister experience Cork's quality of life?  The answer is rarely, and the reason is that Cork is not represented at the Cabinet table.  I am a close friend of the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  We met long before we ever thought we would be in this House.  If allowed continue in office he would have made a significant and a major difference to the Cork area and the whole southern region.  He is a man of ability, integrity and capacity for work.  I doubt if this Government will be returned to office.  On 6 June the people will take a positive decision for change.  Because of the way the Government mismanaged the economy, a crisis is looming in the currency area.  After the election we will work from the Government side and Deputy Martin, who has ability and is academically qualified, will be in a Cabinet position.  He is Cork's dream for a future Jack Lynch.  I am not about to reiterate the facts which highlight the experiences of Cork under this Government.  That Cork got well below the national average for the IDA Ireland <Col N="20" /> jobs 1996 and Government targets in upgrading Cork regional technical college to an institute of technology status are symptoms of a serious malaise affecting the region's economy.</P>
      <P>I am only echoing the IDA report of 1996 which stated Cork did not get the required number of jobs in the south-west region.  The only statistics and information available to me and the only names I can suggest, with which the Minister is familiar, are Eastman Kodak in Youghal, which is practically in the south-east, the health company in the Ringaskiddy area, and Bergin in Fermoy. They are the only three major industries with which I can identify in the Cork region.  Cork has been totally neglected in the industrial development of this country.  Every day we hear announcements of job creation for Dublin and Galway but there is little or nothing for the Cork area.  I do not wish to be negative but to be positive but the IDA report of 1996 is the only information available to me and it justifies what I have said.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil proposed this debate to initiate a progressive social and economic policy that must be put in place for Cork immediately.  We ask the Government to expedite such a plan now but issue a warning that if it fails to do so, Fianna Fáil will put a plan in place.</P>
      <P>Cork, as a marketing centre, has a rich tradition which, if properly fostered, would allow Cork to function as the California of the south coast.  Cork led the way in butter marketing.  Why have we not continued to lead the way in marketing?  The first Ford factory built outside the United States was in Cork and I think the first tractors were built in Cork.  Cork was and still is the transatlantic gateway to North America and to Canada. The first emigrants left the shores of this country from Cobh.  We have not exploited the potential of that important facility.</P>

      <P>Cork has Silicon Valley potential.  I was glad to hear of the conversion to the Mrs. Thatcher policies of Democratic Left, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  The prosperous cooperatives of the south-west and the reputable tourism industry need to be sustained and expanded through a coherent strategy for Cork and the south-west.  I am committed to such a strategy and shall outline to the House a plan which, if acted on, would yield the necessary positive results.  We have to look at the potential of our food industry in the Cork region because Cork controls practically the whole food industry. It has the micro-electronics centre, tourism and other industries.  Cork city and county are identical to California on a smaller scale.  We have tourism, technology, food and all that goes to make up a good mix for a prosperous county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> Given its potential we should have full employment in Cork city and county but it has been neglected.</P>
    <P>My approach to a sustainable strategy for Cork comes under the following headings: Cork as a European city, Cork European regional innovation, creating opportunities for enterprise in the Cork region, and making Cork's transport clean and fast.  It is a Fianna Fáil priority to make Cork a thriving European city while retaining its uniqueness in an Irish context to enhance relationships through language studies, sport, holidays, culture, arts, music and other interests. It is necessary to renew and regenerate contacts and connections made in the sixth century by Irish monks and scholars abroad.  It was at this time that the currency of Irish culture was first circulated and it is in the interests of Cork that this historical partnership be developed.</P>
    <P>There are links by ferry to Wales and Swansea from Cork as well as Rosslare to Brittany and air links to Cornwall and other continental destinations from Cork International Airport.  These connections would complement a newly formed language centre in University College Cork and Cork could become the language centre of Ireland.  University College Cork could reveal itself in its micro-electronics research centre by fostering links with the finest universities of Spain, Italy and France.  As a centre of excellence for students of the English language, many of the 1993 post primary schools in Cork City and county could be encouraged to establish links with other European schools and adopt student exchange schemes.  Air links to Bordeaux in France and Bilbao in Spain should be established to develop an international reputation for Cork. In the field of sport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork is also unique in the area of film festivals, hotels and other forms of tourist accommodation and the conservation of our built and natural heritage.  Cork should be established as a model for innovation in the European Union.  The European Commission is preparing a policy on innovation which, <i>inter alia</i>, will address the use of innovation at a regional level to help small and medium sized industries.  The starting point should be the establishment of a national innovation centre in Cork.  The main work of the centre would be to identify international contacts; to identify or develop niche technology companies &mdash; we have not being doing that; to assist in the preparation of tenders and to lobby sources; to source the finance for the development of companies; to protect intellectual property rights with trademarks, patents and copyrights and to assist in the management of new and expanding companies. <Col N="22" /> The Minister of State referred to the last item but nobody believes him because it is not happening.  The IDA report does not bear out what the Minister of State has said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclusion of public and private bodies as well as research centres will be prerequisites to success.  Notwithstanding the initial need for EU funds, in the medium-term, such an innovation centre should become self-financing.</P>
      <P>The creation of opportunities for enterprise in the Cork region would be a further step to maintaining a progressive social and economic climate for Cork city and county.  The Cork region has a population of about 450,000.  The Government has not provided a fraction of the required inward investment needed to create a self-sufficient Cork.  Fianna Fáil considers that Cork must become an enterprising region to benefit the south-west.  As a starting point it is important to increase the general science and technology awareness of companies in the services and manufacturing sectors.  Technology is a major factor for success.</P>
      <P>To develop a plan for industry in Cork it will be necessary to designate Cork as a European region of innovation and establish there an organisation capable of integrating and developing local enterprise and attracting more business from multinationals in the Cork region.  This could be developed through the innovation centre to which I referred, a supplier-management organisation with professional expertise in the technical and commercial arena capable of working with the multinational companies and developing business by providing complete solutions to a supply base developed in the Cork region.  This concept has the backing of State agencies such as Forbairt.  However, such a framework can only be sustained into the next millennium with the development of an integrated information network in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quality of life is the overriding priority for my party which is a party of the people, of development, innovation and great success.  Fianna Fáil considers that the strategies identified in the Cork land use and transportation plan are necessary to bring Cork's transport quality up to a level enjoyed in other European cities.  The action required to achieve this includes a &ldquo;green audit&rdquo; of transport in 1998; quality bus and minibus systems in place by 2000; Blarney railway station to <Col N="23" /> be opened by 1998, the Midleton branch to open shortly and the Youghal branch by 2000; regional road widening and county road improvement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In looking to the future we should learn from the past.  The 1916 Proclamation refers to the Republic guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities to all citizens and to cherishing all the nation's children equally.  This Government has not taken the actions necessary to fulfil these worthy objectives in the Cork region.  Fianna Fáil's approach to Cork will be equitable and productive.  What I have said puts down a marker for Fianna Fáil in Government and for Cork's future.  We will not neglect Cork.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Mulvihill refer to Merril Dow in Killeagh, but I know what happened there.  The number of teachers in schools was also mentioned and Deputy Lynch said schools with ten pupils should not have two teachers.  We have a social conscience and we know what the people need. We will give them two teachers.  We will look at rural Ireland in that context.  Cork has a noble and proud tradition.  It is a city of learning and, as the UCC saying goes, &ldquo;Where Finbarr taught let Munster learn&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">

      <P>I support the condemnation of the Government for its neglect of Cork city and <Col N="24" /> the south-west region and its failure to ensure balanced economic development, to provide sufficient educational resources to tackle high unemployment and to implement all aspects of the land use transportation study.  Cork is a fine place and it could be finer if it received an equitable share of the national cake.  Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion in an attempt to restore a balance so that Cork and the south-west region would benefit from the tiger economy which the Government inherited from past Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
      <P>Cork is a university city and it has a regional college with institute of technology status.  Fair treatment would take some of the mushrooming growth from Dublin.  One of the saddest monuments to the Government is the overgrown site at Horgan's Quay which should now be a science park.  Cork deserves a premium science park, an equivalent of the Citywest business park in Dublin. Certain industries are attracted to Dublin thanks to Citywest and to Limerick thanks to the Plassey Technology Park.  There is a sufficiency of land and resources around Cork airport to site a top of the range science park for Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It had better be in place before 6 June because it has not been done to date.  If announcements alone could keep the people in jobs there would be no jobs shortage.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Citywest has no equivalent in Cork.  The incoming Fianna Fáil Government will initiate such a project immediately. That is the least Cork city, given its size, history and reputation, deserves.  The shenanigans in this House in relation to the Horgan's Quay site brought nothing but shame to the rainbow coalition Government.  Where are the people who sent faxes to say they were interested in developing the site several years later?  It was a charade which the Government would prefer to forget.</P>
      <P>University College, Cork, deserves every support and requires investment from the Exchequer and Structural Funds.  When in office I ensured that Structural Funds were provided for different faculties, particularly the food science faculty.  It is the only university in the country which produces graduates in dairy and food science and needs to keep up-to-date with developments in our most important indigenous industry in which there is a need for additional manpower and personnel resources.  There is a need for additional well trained managers with, for example, language skills in seeking the most remunerative markets worldwide for our products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> I welcome the moves to upgrade Cork regional technical college to institute status.  This will enable it to make a marvellous contribution in the development of industrial facilities.  As the Ministers of State opposite are aware, a number of industries have been attracted to Cork city and county and expanded because of University College, Cork and Cork regional technical college which are a vital link in developing our commercial and industrial infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In the south west region there is a need for adequate infrastructure.  I am glad the road from Cork city to Bandon has been considerably improved.  I look forward to the road from Bandon to Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry and Castletownbere being improved as one cannot have a policy on regionalisation if one cannot gain access to regional centres.  It is not possible to develop industries in rural areas if the road structure is inadequate.</P>
    <P>There are a number of top class co-operatives in west Cork, including Barryroe, Lisavaird, Drinagh and Bandon, which provide much needed employment for the farming community in the region.  The road to Barryroe in particular needs to be upgraded.  Drinagh co-operative is a major employer and serves the Mizen Head and Beara peninsulas.  It is the lifeline for their populations but Drinagh is linked to Dunmanway by a local by-road on which articulated trucks have to pull in to lay-bys to allow each other to pass.  This is not good enough at a time when the economy &mdash; the Celtic tiger &mdash; is thriving.  If we cherish all the regions equally, we need to provide arteries to those industries before it is too late.</P>
    <P>Castletownbere is a major fishery port.  If it was not so designated, the population of the Beara Peninsula would be dependent on social welfare payments and small time farming.  In 1981 a special concession was made to expend a limited amount each year on the road from Glengarriff to Castletownbere.  On many occasions trucks destined for the Continent have got bogged down having slipped into dykes along the side of the road.  It needs to be upgraded to national road status.  The road from Castletownbere to Kenmare also needs to be upgraded.</P>
    <P>In Question No. 76 on Thursday, 6 February, I asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the total number of jobs announced for the west Cork area.  He informed me in reply that in 1996 a total of 85 overseas companies indicated their intention to invest in Ireland and that of these 11 announced their intention to invest in the south west region of Cork and Kerry with an expected job creation total of 1,496.  However, none of these 11 announcements was for location in the west Cork area.</P>
    <P>It is a source of much disappointment to those involved in the fishing industry in Kinsale, Courtmacsherry, Schull, Union Hall and Castletownbere that the words &ldquo;fisheries&rdquo; or &ldquo;marine&rdquo; do not appear in the latest propaganda from the Fine Gael organisation issued on two occasions in <Col N="26" /> recent weeks which contains the photographs of the two Deputies for the area.

      <P>I give Deputy Walsh some credit.  Unlike some of his colleagues, he at least referred to the motion on the clár.  I wish to respond to some of the points he made.  The amendment commends the Government for the implementation of policies which have supported significantly improved economic and social progress in Cork city and the south west.  I will not list its achievements.  Last night the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, won that argument quite convincingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy. The motion refers to the Land Use Transportation Study.  I was Lord Mayor of Cork when the study was published and I introduced it to the city council.  Unlike some of the Deputies opposite, I took an active part in the discussions which preceded the publication of the study.  I am familiar with its contents and am happy that its aims have been adhered to in most cases.</P>
      <P>On the question of education, the reason Deputy Martin has been such an active Opposition spokesperson on education is that we have had an extremely busy Minister for Education. For example, she introduced the White Paper on Education and the Early Start and the Breaking the Cycle programmes.  These revolutionary programmes are aimed at primary education, which is where one should start.  We are working from the bottom up to ensure that all children have a fair chance.</P>
      <P>When dealing with education we tend to refer to second and third level education.  This is regrettable.  There has been no reference by the Deputies opposite to the abolition of university fees which has given many people an opportunity to attend third level education.  Many of my generation could not even contemplate going to university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense, it has not meant even one additional place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with access, not places.  It is disingenuous of the Deputy to ignore this point.  He is ignoring for his own reasons the achievements of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion refers to the neglect of Cork city and the south-west and the failure to implement all aspects of the Land Use Transportation Study. <Col N="27" /> This study does not refer to the south-west, it refers to Cork city and the greater Cork area.  On this basis alone, the Deputies opposite are working from a false premise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe assured me prior to the debate that he would be extremely positive in his remarks.  He referred to the Celtic tiger.  I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that he is better versed in the affairs of &ldquo;Babe&rdquo; and that species than he is in the Celtic tiger and should confine his remarks to matters with which he is familiar. He also referred to the rail network.  Deputy Martin is fortunate not to remember the decimation of the rail network.  Who closed the Macroom and Bandon lines?  The closure of these lines has given rise to serious transport problems in areas west of Cork city.  The year before these lines were closed by the then Fianna Fáil Government all the signal boxes, level crossings and equipment were downgraded so as to ensure that the arguments in favour of closure could be upheld.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Martin did not have a place at the Cabinet table in the previous Government. It has been stated that he is the second Jack Lynch.  I sincerely hope that this is the case but unfortunately I will not be around to give him the freedom of Cork city which I afforded to Jack Lynch on his retirement.</P>
    <P>University College Cork is bursting at the seams.  Unfortunately the college's bid for a convenient plot of land was not successful but thankfully it was successful in securing land beside the greyhound track.  Deputy Martin says no extra places have been made available but this is not the case.  Is it right that a university or other institution should close for six months of the year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not closed for six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and the Deputy should know that because his wife is at home during that time.</P>
      <P>I regret that Deputies chose to politicise the debate on regional technical colleges and institute of technology status.  A workable solution has been put forward and I sincerely hope that the criteria will be met.  Deputy Martin took over from me as chairman of the City of Cork vocational education committee.  It is a terrible indictment of the Deputy and Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who is on the staff of the regional technical college, that they should criticise the education system.  They have a central role to play in this area.  Education does not stop within the confines of University College Cork or the regional technical college.  I hope that institute of technology status will be allowed before long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access to the arts is very important in the context of education.  The Government has taken steps to increase access to the arts by allocating funding to the Everyman Palace, the Cork Opera House, Crawford Gallery, Blackwater Artists, <Col N="28" /> Cork Printmakers and Kino Cinema.  All these projects have been funded&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without the endorsement of the Minister this investment could not have taken place.  Never before in the history of Cork has there been such investment in the arts and I am very proud to be a part of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who participated in the debate.  If nothing else, the motion has placed Cork and the south-west on the Dáil agenda which is no bad thing.  It is important on the eve of the general election to focus on the needs of Cork and the future needs of its people. While I welcome the additional investment in the arts outlined by Deputy O'Sullivan, the operational programme for the allocation of funding to the arts, which is the key ingredient in all this, was negotiated by the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.</P>
      <P>If one compares the allocations to Cork and Dublin one will find huge disparities.  This huge disparity between the regions and Dublin has been well documented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We made the global allocation from Structural Funding but it was for the Minister and the Government to decide how it was distributed to the various areas.  It is proposed to spend £120 million on an arts centre in the docklands area of Dublin.  It is important to compare this with the paltry sum allocated to the Cork Opera House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £2.4 million was allocated to the Crawford Gallery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that there are still huge disparities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our central argument is that the Government has been engaged in a holding operation in regard to Cork and there has been no vision or strategic plan.  The Government reneged on its first commitment to appoint a Minister from Cork.  During the by-election campaigns in Cork North-Central and Cork South-Central Fine Gael said Cork would have a voice at the Cabinet table. However, this did not happen.  This is reflected in the number of industrial projects in the region. The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, spoke yesterday about the success of indigenous industries in terms of increased jobs.  The economy has been doing well in recent years.  The Government of 1987-89 sowed the seeds for the present economic regeneration.  It is a bit rich for this Government to claim all the credit for what is essentially the allocation of the <Col N="29" /> fruits of prudent fiscal management of our economy from 1987 to 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not claim that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality.  A large number of new projects have been set up in areas like west Dublin, particularly in the electronics area, but the south west has not benefited from the location of any major industry.  Sandoz in Ringaskiddy was one of the last major industries to be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about major projects offering up to 1,000 jobs.  We have not succeeded in attracting large scale industry to the south west in the past two and a half years, regardless of the significance of IDA Ireland's pipeline.  The south-west and Cork have not benefited to the degree they should have because we do not have the political muscle at the Cabinet table to ensure projects are set up in the south-west.</P>
      <P>In relation to education, access to third level education for undergraduate students is about points, not money.  The abolition of fees helped to ease the burden on PAYE workers sending their children to college, but nothing was done with the maintenance grant.  In Cork, for example&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  Tax convenants were abolished. That produced £40 million which was allocated towards the abolition of third level undergraduate fees.  I do not have any difficulty with that, but I have a difficulty with the disparities and anomalies that has created.  The regional technical college, the PLC colleges and the university are endeavouring to expand adult education. Low income and unemployed families have to pay £200 to £250 per year to access adult education courses in Cork and throughout the country.  Is that equality of opportunity?  Is that equality of access to third level education?  It is a complete nonsense.</P>

That is of particular relevance to Cork because approximately 2,000 students attend the College of Commerce, Colaiste Stiofán Náofa and St. John's Central College. We are actively seeking the advancement and expansion of those institutions.  All we have had from the Minister for Education in relation to PLCs is circulars endeavouring to limit their expansion in terms of the number of years in which they can develop courses.

I will challenge anybody in St. Patrick's in Drumcondra to a debate.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 deals with definitions and interpretation of this legislation which deals with a number of sensitive matters.  It states that unless the context otherwise requires &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; will have the meaning assigned to it by the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956.  How will the changes in this Bill affect the definition of &ldquo;civil servant&ldquo;? Civil servants can be dismissed only by the Government.  They are free to serve the State and their positions are secure.  Will this section change that?  Will a decision of the Government be required to dismiss only those above assistant principal grade?  The majority of civil servants are in lower grades.  Although the section states &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; will have the meaning assigned to it under the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, it will not have the meaning attributed to it in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no change in the definition of &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; under this Bill, particularly under the definition section to which the Deputy referred.  Changes will be set in train only by amendments to the Civil Service Regulation Act which will follow the passage of this legislation. A parcel of legislative change is required to roll out the strategic management initiative and to give effect to the Government's programme for change as outlined in Delivering Better Government.  On the point about changes in dismissal picked up by the Deputy, there will not be a change, even with the passage of this legislation, until the Civil Service Regulation Act is amended to give effect to it.  That will happen in conjunction and in consultation with all the Civil Service unions and bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The opening sentence in the Bill states its object is to create a new management structure for the Civil Service.  While we welcome that, I question why the Department of Defence is included, its inclusion will have serious implications. For the purpose of this Bill there is no need to bring the military branches into the definition of the Department of Defence.  There is an alarming potential for ambiguity and conflict between this Bill and the 1954 Defence Act, which is the basic code of military law of the Defence Forces.  Section 17 of that Act provides a system for control over the military, which is the epitome of democratic control.  That will be seriously undermined if we proceed on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> I have spoken to a number of Army personnel who are concerned about this.  They have raised their concerns with the Minister, but have not received a satisfactory response.  It appears that the Secretary of the Department will be empowered to exercise command and authority over Defence Forces personnel and will be able to delegate duties to the chief of staff, promote officers and issue regulations, but this is not the way to do business.  Will the Minister of State reconsider this position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising that point.  In relation to the latter part of it, we can discuss its specifics in more detail when we come to section 4 which deals with powers of dismissal and so on.  The definition of the Department of Defence used in the Bill derives from a combination of the 1924 Act and the Defence Act of 1954 which provides for three military branches of that Department.  This simply confirms the current position which is likely to be changed as a result of amendments to the Defence Acts currently being prepared by the Minister for Defence.  The fact that the crucial provision of the Bill set out in section 4 is subject to any existing Acts ensures that the full provisions of the Defence Acts in relation to the powers of officers and the operational autonomy of the Defence Forces remain intact.  I assure the Deputy his fears are not well grounded in this case and the point he made is well taken care of.</P>

      <P>On the question of the Civil Service Regulations Act, I take it that will come before the House after a period of consultation and for that reason this Bill will not be implemented until consultation has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the section will not be implemented, but this section deals with interpretation.  It covers the interpretation of a civil servant.  The Bill is about civil servants.  Presumably the rest of the Bill will not come into operation either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the Civil Service Regulation Act, even when amended, will not change the definition of civil servant.  It may not be the definition of civil servant with which the Deputy has a problem, it may be the responsibility and accountability that will be conferred on civil servants which might differ slightly from the <i>status quo</i>, but the definition of &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; is likely to remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="37" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That clarifies the position on the interpretation question.  It also clarifies the position on Deputy Power's point.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the definition of outputs.  The Bill states outputs in relation to a Department or a scheduled office means the goods and services, including standards of services, that are a consequence of the activities of the Department or scheduled office.  I take it such outputs include customers, their treatment and the delivery of services to them.  That would include old age pensioners.  Does outputs in that sense cover the delivery of services and practices in relation to services for, say, old age pensioners, widows or other groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Bill result in the delivery of a service to customers, who in the case of the Department of Social Welfare may be old age pensioners and others, being a matter &mdash; other than policy and strategy matters &mdash; on a day to day basis for the secretary general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the functions of this House is that Deputies who are dissatisfied with the service supplied to customers, like old age pensioners, can raise questions in the House with the Minister on day to day operations.  Will it still be possible for Members to ask questions and receive full parliamentary replies to such questions from the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised an interesting matter about parliamentary questions and what will or will not be in order when the changes outlined in this legislation are in place. The answer to the Deputy's question is yes.  Any question deemed in order by the Ceann Comhairle can be put to a Minister during Question Time unless the House changes its rules.  It would be disingenuous of me if I did not point out that when responsibility and accountability for operational matters are moved from a Minister to middle or senior management or the head of a team delivering a service, there may not be a subsequent change of rules on parliamentary questions because the Minister may not know the answer to a question about a matter that is being delivered with operational autonomy by a section within the service.  As of now the answer to the Deputy's question is yes, but that may not be the case if the rules of the House are changed.  I have no idea whether there are proposals to change the rules, nor has that been discussed with me, but it would seem to be logical that if operational autonomy and responsibility for operational day to day matters are moved from the Minister to the secretary general or another person in senior management in the Civil Service, that person should be answerable, probably through the committee system to Members of this House rather <Col N="38" /> than the Minister being answerable directly to the House.  However, I do not know the proposals for change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a vital matter because the constitutional function of the House is about people.  It is crucial that Members should be able to put questions to Ministers in certain Departments, particularly those involved in areas of caring such as the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  The Minister's reply was fair, forthright and honest but it is still alarming.  Once operational responsibility moves from a Minister, how can he or she be expected to be responsible and to provide the answers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If one is not responsible, one is not accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister said committees of the House may provide the solution but the legislation states that committees will only consider matters of strategy.  That is why I am concerned about the Bill.  I am in favour of what the Minister and Government are trying to do, but I am not sure it is being done in the right way.  The implications of not doing it correctly are substantial and great changes may result.  We will cover other aspects on later sections and amendments and I want to tease them out.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister says, it is likely and logical that a change will be made to parliamentary questions in the relatively near future.  This would be a great relief to Ministers as they would then have more time for broad matters of great national importance but it is the people who are of real importance, old age pensioners, widows, people with disabilities, etc.  We must have individual and personal concern for them.  Much of the detail has been removed and even more can be taken out by delivering better service but, by defining these outputs in the Bill, we are making it possible to change the position by doing away with the Minister's responsibility to the House without also making him or her responsible to a committee of the House.  The more I consider this legislation, the more I want a separate Report Stage in which the Minister can consider the points and see whether solutions can be found. That will not be possible in the time today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  This is an important issue and I was surprised it did not receive more attention on Second Stage because the impact this change may have on our system of parliamentary questions occurred to me at an early point. Change, if it happens, will evolve slowly in the Dáil.  It is likely to meet the new realities of the legislation once passed.  I do not envisage overnight a new set of rules for parliamentary questions being in order.  The Freedom of Information Act will give individuals access to information which currently can only be received by way of parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>As a former Minister for Social Welfare, the Deputy knows about pension and social welfare questions.  People matter, they are of primary importance in delivering a public service, because it concerns delivering a quality service to the public, the people, the customer or however one likes to describe the recipient.  The Deputy mentioned widows and pensioners who deal with the Department of Social Welfare, but he will be aware that an excellent TD inquiry system has been in place in that Department for some time.  I compliment those involved in providing that customer service because they have responded effectively and efficiently within the same timescale in which Deputies would receive information through the parliamentary question system in response to queries about constituents.  That was the pertinent point.  The complaints redress system, supplemented and augmented by the TD inquiry system, which will continue, should mean an efficient and effective resolution of problems in the Department of Social Welfare and across the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>In Dublin Castle tomorrow I shall launch a scheme entitled Quality Customer Service for Customers and Clients of the Civil Service.  This code of practice will apply throughout the Civil Service for delivery of service to customers, including internal customers like TDs and members of the public who receive a service, be they social welfare recipients, taxpayers, farmers, etc.  All of us in our day to day lives are customers of the Civil Service and public service in a multiplicity of ways.  Such is the importance of a quality, well-delivered public service that we take much of it for granted.  We are not aware of how it permeates our lives and the degree to which the public service is responsible for delivering our quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Deputy's point.  All sides of the House treasure the parliamentary questions system and he and I know that one of the few disadvantages of being a Minister is that one is denied the quick response of that system because one has back door or internal access to the Department to answer our questions.  Parliamentary questions are efficient tools of democracy.  While operational responsibility will be devolved to senior and middle management in the Civil Service and <Col N="40" /> public service under this Bill, political responsibility and accountability will always remain with the Dáil as per the Constitution.  I think the Deputy's fears are not well-grounded because a Minister will always answer a Deputy's question if it concerns political responsibility.</P>
    <P>I would be less than honest if I did not say that when the Civil Service Regulation Act has been amended, the Freedom of Information Act is in operation and the package of legislation associated with the document Delivering Better Government is in force, our parliamentary question system will probably change to reflect the realities of the operational responsibility of the Civil Service <i>visá-vis</i> Ministers on day to day delivery of public service.  That will be a matter for this House, not for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The way we define these matters is fundamental to what we will discuss subsequently and I have a duty to tease out what is involved. The position is reasonably clear and I would be uneasy about such a development in terms of parliamentary questions, the responsibility of the Minister to the House and the responsibility of the new Secretaries-General to committees of the House.  We will come to that later.  I know a great deal about the TD inquiry system because I was involved in a great deal of that.  However, the fact that those services can be greatly improved and that delegation can take place is separate from the whole question of ultimate responsibility.  The buck must still stop with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  We have clarified that matter as well as we can at this stage.</P>
      <P>The section also states that &ldquo;Secretary General&rdquo; in relation to a Department &ldquo;means the person appointed as the Secretary General of the Department&rdquo;.  We know who that is to be.  The Secretary General will be appointed on a seven year contract and will then do something else.</P>
      <P>The section further states that the strategy statement &ldquo;shall be construed in accordance with section 5&rdquo;.  The problem is that the strategy statement is the only matter which a Dáil committee will be able to examine.  In other words, the Secretary General will appear before a committee for the examination of the strategy statement, which is dealt with under section 5.  Is that all we are talking about when we talk about the strategy statement?</P>

      <P>There are more sections than that in the Bill.  This section states that the Minister is &ldquo;responsible for the performance of functions that are assigned to the Department&rdquo;.  However, in other sections the Minister is being excluded from various matters with which he or she will not have the power to deal on a day to day basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said on Second Stage that the Minister will continue to have legal responsibility. However, administrative responsibility is just as important as legal responsibility.  It is more important in day to day practices because those are the matters which concern people.  If an issue becomes a legal matter a person can go to the Ombudsman or other office and begin that process. However, we have a much more efficient system because, due to the responsibility of Ministers, there is a great urgency about getting to the bottom of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is in conflict with much of what we are saying.  It states that the Minister is responsible, and if that is the case, the Minister is answerable everywhere for that responsibility.  It also means that the Minister is responsible for <Col N="43" /> what the Secretary General is doing, which means that the Minister cannot be excluded from the Secretary General's actions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 11, after &ldquo;to the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;authority of the Government or a Minister of the Government in the exercise of the executive powers of the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to get to the core of the problem.  A constitutional question hangs over the legislation.  When considering section 3 we discussed the responsibility of the Minister. The Minister has an overall responsibility, which must be reflected in any new arrangements, and a duty to the public to exercise that responsibility and be accountable for it.</P>
      <P>The other officers referred to here are unelected officers of the State.  They are appointed civil servants who are then selected on contract to do a specific job.  The Constitution provides that the Minister represents the people. While there should be more delegation and more correspondence in the delegation between responsibility and authority, the Minister should not become merely a rubber stamp.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Secretary General may not be responsible to the Minister or the Dáil for day to day operations.  While I am in favour of delegation, I would not support the removal of the Minister from this area.  If the amendment is accepted, the relevant part of section 4(1) would read:</P>
      <P>Except as otherwise directed by the Government or provided by or under any other Act, the Secretary General of a Department or Head of a Scheduled Office, as the case may be, shall, subject to the authority of the Government or a Minister of the Government in the exercise of the executive powers of the State...</P>
      <P>This clearly includes the constitutional authority of a Minister.  At present the wording states that the Secretary General&mdash;</P>
      <P>...shall, subject to the determination of matters of policy by the Minister of the Government having charge of the Department ... have the authority, responsibility and accountability for carrying out the following duties...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section makes clear that, subject to the determination of matters of policy by the Minister, the Secretary General shall perform all other functions, <Col N="44" /> which will mean the exclusion of the Minster from them.  I do not want to see legislation to this effect.  The amendment would correct this by providing that the Secretary General would act subject to the &ldquo;authority of the Government or a Minister of the Government in the exercise of the executive powers of the State...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This provision must be included because to pretend otherwise in legislation is misleading and constitutionally unsafe.  Article 28.1 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The Government shall consist of not less than seven and not more than fifteen members who shall be appointed by the President in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>Article 28.2 states:</P>
    <P>The executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.</P>
    <P>Article 28.4.1º states:</P>
    <P>The Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Article 28.4.2º states:</P>
    <P>The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>Article 28.12 states:</P>
    <P>The following matters shall be regulated in accordance with law, namely, the organization of, and distribution of business amongst, Departments of State, the designation of members of the Government to be in charge of the said Departments, the discharge of the functions of the office of a member of the Government during his temporary absence or incapacity, and the remuneration of the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>This does not include the kind of matter mentioned in section 4, which gives to the Secretary General or the head of an office defined functions as set out in the subsections.  The only restraint on the exercise by a secretary general or head of office of these functions is set out in subsection (1), which makes their exercise subject to the determination of a Minister in matters of policy. Otherwise, the Secretary General or head of office would appear to be given a virtually unfettered discretion with regard to the discharge of these functions.  The authority of the relevant Minister or Government is at least circumscribed, if not stopped.</P>
    <P>Section 6 makes a Secretary General or head of office accountable to a Minister on a specific direction from the Government in respect of the functions set out in section 4.  Section 10 makes the Secretary General or head of office answerable <Col N="45" /> to a committee of Dáil Éireann, but only in respect of the strategy statement under section 5(2).</P>
    <P>By giving to a Secretary General or head of office functions which are undoubtedly within the remit of the executive of the State and withdrawing those functions from the control of a Minister or the Government, section 4 appears to offend Article 28.2 and Article 28.4.2º of the Constitution.  In addition, the matters set out in the subsections to section 4 are not any of the four matters which Article 28.12 permits to be regulated by law.  Therefore, Article 28.12 could not be invoked to justify section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which makes a Secretary General or head of office accountable to a Minister, makes no provision for the revoking or amending of an act done by a Secretary General or head of office under section 4.  I have tabled an amendment to that.  The executive nature of the act remains solely with the secretary general or the head of the Office.  The provision in the section for accounting merely envisages reporting with no possibility of further action by the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <P>The absence of accountability by a secretary general or head of an Office in respect of the totality of the functions transferred under section 4 to the committee of Dáil Éireann under section 10, combined with the absence of a provision in section 6 or elsewhere of a power for the Minister or the Government to interfere with, revoke or amend an act done by a secretary general or head of an Office under section 4, causes a problem. It places a question mark over the constitutional aspects.</P>
    <P>I tabled the amendment because I am concerned about this matter.  In practice the responsibilities of the secretary general under the Bill will include a range of issues.  Section 4 separates the role of the Minister and states that he or she will be concerned with the determination of matters of policy.  However, all the other matters will be determined by the secretary general.  The Bill states elsewhere that the Minister may give directions in writing to a secretary general about any matter.  However, that is inadequate.  It is too rigid and belated.  It would not be good in the context of the management of a Department as envisaged under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 4 covers issues such as the management of the Department, the monitoring of Government policies and the delivery of outputs determined with the Minister in charge of the Department. The secretary general will then have almost complete responsibility for those matters.  He or she will also have responsibility for preparing and submitting to the Minister a strategy statement, providing progress reports to the Minister on the implementation of the strategy and preparing an outline of how specific elements of responsibilities should be assigned.  He or she will also provide advice to the Minister and the Government, ensure that the appropriate arrangements are put in place to facilitate an effective response, ensure <Col N="46" /> that the resources of the Department or Office are used in a manner in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General Act and examine and develop means that will improve the cost effectiveness of the service.</P>
    <P>Section 4(1)(h) is particularly important.  It states that the secretary general will be responsible for managing all matters pertaining to appointments, performance, discipline and dismissals of staff below the grade of principal officer or its equivalent in the Department or Office.  Subsection (1)(i) states that the secretary general will assign responsibility for performance of the functions for which he or she is responsible to other officers.  Deputy McDowell is concerned about this matter because he suggests in amendment No. 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would not be difficult to hold up the House for that reason if I wanted to do so. However, I am not interested in doing that.  I am interested in the issues I mentioned.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that Deputy McDowell and the Progressive Democrats are concerned about removing the management of all matters pertaining to appointments, performance and discipline from the Minister.  This is in line with my concern about this area which is addressed in amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Consideration of amendment No. 1 involves the consideration of much of section 4.  The amendment covers the authority, responsibility and function of the Minister irrespective of the matters which are delegated.  The difficulty is that the Government is trying to remove these elements from the Minister and relieve him or her of the pressure and responsibility in that regard. This would leave the Minister free to do other things.  However, that cannot and should not be done.  Delegation can be effective but the Minister must remain constitutionally responsible for these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in question when one reads the Bill.  Good management practice is that the Minister delegates matters and is not involved in most areas on a day to day basis.  The Minister deals with exceptional issues which arise but he or she must remain sufficiently familiar with what is happening in the Department.  However, under the Bill all staff other than principal officers and <Col N="47" /> assistant secretaries will be directly responsible to the secretary general of the Department.  A Minister must be involved in consultations and know what is happening in the Department because that ultimately is his or her responsibility.  Will the Minister of State give the House the benefit of her wisdom on these matters?  They are fundamental issues in terms of how the Bill is drafted but perhaps the Minister of State can reassure me that my concerns are unwarranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Justice will not be done to the 12 amendments which have been tabled if the Deputy takes 25 minutes to explain the first one. I am bound by the Chair but it is strange that a Deputy could take 25 minutes to make a case for an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The intention of the amendment appears to be to put a stricter qualification on the scope of functions which will be formally assigned to secretaries general.  It appears the objective of the amendment is to ensure the executive powers of the State can only be exercised subject to the authority of the Government or a Minister.  The Constitution reserves to the Government the executive power of the State under Article 28.2.  Section 4 as it stands conforms to the Constitution in this respect.  What constitutes the executive power of the State has not yet been defined by the courts. However, one such power relates to the function of managing the national debt.  The National Treasury Management Agency, to whom this power has been delegated, exercises it on the authority of the Government.  That is a precedent.</P>
      <P>However, a Minister and his or her Department carry out many functions which are not part of the executive power of the State.  Under Article 28.4.1º of the Constitution the Government is collectively responsible for the Departments administered by its members.  The courts have recognised that Ministers exercise functions over and above those constituting the executive power of the State.  Thus, in Murphy <i>v.</i> Dublin Corporation [1972] IR 215, the court held that the function of the Minister for Local Government as adjudicating authority under the 1966 Housing Act was not a function which was part of the &ldquo;executive power of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> If the words proposed in amendment No. 1 were added to this section they could have the effect of subjecting the Secretary General to the authority of the Government and/or the Minister only when the function involved was part of the executive power of the State.  This could leave open the interpretation that, when the function was not of that kind, the Secretary General was free of ministerial control &mdash; if the Government or other statute had not otherwise directed &mdash; with regard to those functions referred to in section 4(1) which do not expressly require ministerial agreement.</P>
    <P>While the presumption of constitutionality could well negate such an interpretation, the very inclusion of the reference to the Secretary General acting subject to the Government's authority in the exercise of the &ldquo;executive power of the State&rdquo; and the absence of any mention of other form of ministerial control over the remaining functions might be considered too specific to allow the presumption of constitutionality to apply.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill was prepared the method of implementing and delivering better Government was considered by a committee with a legal member. Each section, and the Bill as a whole, was vetted diligently by the Attorney General's office. Throughout the Bill there are reservations and protections to ensure that Ministers and the Government call the shots.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's fears are unfounded.  The intention of the Bill is to provide for greater efficiency and effectiveness in respect of the assignment of authority and responsibility and, accordingly, in relation to accountability.  In so providing the Bill does not interfere with the constitutional requirement that the Government be responsible to Dáil Éireann.  We all know that no Minister can possibly have in-depth knowledge of every detail of the day to day operations of his or her Department.  That fact has been brought to the attention of the House on more than one occasion.  This Bill reflects reality and deals with the relevant issues constructively.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us entered politics to be rubber stamps and none of us should or will be. Secretaries General are not and will not be autonomous under the provisions of this Bill.  They will be accountable to the Minister under section 6 which we may reach, but not if this progress continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I remain very worried about this section.  The main concern of the general public is that Ministers be able to run their respective Departments; effectively, they expect them to be the chief executive of their respective Departments.  I do not know any chief executive who must operate under the type of regulations about which the Minister of State speaks.  She should recognise that policy decisions by Ministers, in pure policy terms, are the exception rather than the rule, that the day to day operations <Col N="49" /> of a Department take an enormous amount of time.</P>
      <P>I will give a simple example in answer to which the Minister might explain the possible consequences. Suppose a Minister considers that some form or other within his or her Department is causing people considerable difficulties.  Will that Minister have to issue a formal, written instruction to the Secretary General to have it changed, or can he just issue an instruction?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 4, surely that is a matter for the Secretary General.  It makes section 4 very ambiguous and perhaps the Minister should consider clarifying its meaning.  This specific reference to policy appears to imply a difference between policy and other matters.  If not, why is policy specifically mentioned?</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about constitutionality. This Government certainly has established a record in the number of Bills already referred by the President to the Supreme Court, and I understand there is another today.  Assurances given in this House about the constitutionality of provisions rings rather hollow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>I am concerned to avoid creating too much rigidity and legality.  Flexible management, delegation of responsibilities and accountability are what we seek.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(j) ensuring that all civil servants or civilian employees of the Department of Defence will be provided with a right of appeal to the Minister with overall responsibility for that Department in respect of matters arising under paragraph (h) of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of an additional paragraph (j).  All staff up to and including assistant principal may be dismissed by the secretary general.  Previously the Government decided on dismissals.  There must be some appropriate appeals mechanism and I propose that the appeal of a decision by a secretary general for dismissal should be made to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This amendment provides that staff of the Department of Defence would have a right of appeal to the Minister for Defence in respect of the enabling powers given to secretaries general on matters affecting the appointment, performance, discipline or dismissal of staff.  As these powers will only be exercised following amendment to existing legislation in that area which will involve consultation with staff interests.  Questions such as right of appeal will be dealt with in that context.  I appreciate the Deputy's concerns but it would not be appropriate to provide for a formal right of appeal in the primary legislation; that is not the way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the amendment would limit any such right of appeal to staff of the Department of Defence, which would mean that Department would be treated differently.  For those <Col N="52" /> reasons I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  In response to Deputy Woods's point that there should be an appeals mechanism, I would prefer if the appeals mechanism involved an independent person rather than a politician. When legislation dealing with defence matters is being discussed and possibly amended I would prefer that the question of an appeals mechanism be included at that stage and that the appeal would be to an independent person rather than a politician.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about an independent appeals mechanism, but there must be some appeals mechanism.  The Government is excluded as an appeals body and now we are excluding the Minister.  Why is the Minister excluded?  The Minister represents the people.  If the Minister proposes that the appeal should be made to an independent person, that matter may be discussed subsequently, but I do not see the reason for excluding the Minister &mdash; in this case we are excluding the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to matters of strategy, and that is what Deputy Ó Cuív and I are concerned about.  We are talking about the normal operation of the Minister relating to matters of policy and strategy, not day to day involvement in the running of the Department on a good administrative basis.  Most of what we are talking about here was done in the Department of Social Welfare, and I do not disagree with that, but I see a problem with the exclusion of the Minister.  The Minister agrees there should be an appeals mechanism. I intended the amendment to apply to Departments generally &mdash; I made a mistake in including only the Department of Defence.  I spoke earlier about the various Departments and it was my intention to include all of them.  There must be an appeals system.  I do not wish to labour the point, but I do not see why the appeal should not be made to the Minister since the Minister is directly in control of the secretary general. On the other hand, if a satisfactory appeals system is provided for, I will accept that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the strategy statement of each Department of State and Scheduled Office shall contain details of how the Department of State or Scheduled Office concerned intends to ensure the effective delivery of its services through the medium of Irish to residents <Col N="53" /> of the Gaeltacht and to Irish speakers who live outside the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is self-explanatory and I hope the Minister accepts it.  There is a need for it because, despite the guidelines laid down by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Gaeltacht people find great difficulty in getting services through the medium of Irish.  Independent reports have been carried out by Bord na Gaeilge and so on, which show that the delivery of services in the Irish language, which is the first constitutional language, to those who require them is not provided by Government Departments. I ask the Minister to include this necessary subsection to protect the rights of the linguistic minority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy for the case made and do not disagree with the sentiments of the Deputies.  The amendment would oblige Departments to include in their strategy statements specific measures on the delivery of services through the medium of Irish to Irish speakers in and outside the Gaeltacht.  Strategy statements are intended to be the blueprints under which Departments will operate in the future.  It is implicit therefore that due regard will be paid to all obligations, whether arising from statute or from stated Government policies, over a wide range of matters when these statements are being drawn up.  These would include topics as diverse as environmental policy, fiscal policy, EU directives, discrimination against, for example, women, minorities and the travelling community, and a variety of other important issues including matters affecting people with disabilities, which will be the subject of the next amendment.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow I will announce an initiative under the strategic management initiative on the principles of quality customer service which will be directed towards the dealings of public and Civil Service with their customers and clients.  One of the elements of this relates to customer choice.  In the document &mdash; which will be launched tomorrow &mdash; customer choice in terms of customers of the civil and public service specifically includes a reference to those who wish to do business through the Irish language.  I will deal specifically with that tomorrow.  The document, which has been signed by all Civil Service offices and agencies of the State, states that in their dealings with the public, Civil Service Departments and offices will, under the heading Choice, provide choice where feasible in service delivery, including payment methods, location of contact points, opening hours and delivery times and provide services for those who wish to do business through Irish. I will be dealing with the point raised by the Deputy, with which I empathise, tomorrow rather than through this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is unsatisfactory and typical of the way the Irish language is treated.  We have plenty of goodwill but no legislative protection.  We have not relied on goodwill for protection of the rights of women, the environment and so on, on which there is a huge volume of primary legislation.  It is well recognised that goodwill alone does not ensure compliance.  Unfortunately, while the Constitution states the Irish language is one of the official languages, it is up to the State in either case to prescribe the use of either language. There is no language legislation.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, has singularly failed to provide any legislative protection for Irish speaking people, myself included.  Given the absence of alternative legislation to ensure these rights I simply ask the Minister to include a provision in this Bill which would at least ensure that Government Departments, when drawing up their strategy statements, would be legally obliged to address this issue.  They are already legally obliged to address issues concerning the environment, women's rights, travellers' rights and so on because there is other primary legislation.  I press the Minister strongly to recognise there is a huge deficiency. The Minister recognised in the Dáil recently that his voluntary guideline had failed to deliver the services required.  I ask the Minister to take this simple and minor amendment on board.  If what the Minister says is true it will not cause any problem because all Departments will include it in their statements.</P>

I will not be able, in an amendment to this legislation, to satisfy his quest for language legislation.  I am not in a position to accept this amendment for three reasons, not because I do not agree with much of what the Deputy has said. I am satisfied that implicit adherence to proper principles &mdash; which will be laid out tomorrow and published and signed up to by all Government Departments &mdash; is adequate and that there is, therefore, no need to provide specifically for the categories proposed by the Deputies as opposed to the other categories I mentioned.  In my substantive reply I listed many other categories and minorities, the disabled and others, all of whom are not covered by this legislation explicitly, but implicitly they are all covered.</P>

Section 4 (1) (e) provides specifically &ldquo;that appropriate arrangements are put into place that will facilitate an effective response&rdquo; to such cross-cutting matters.  Section 5 (1) (b) states that strategy statements must be prepared &ldquo;in a formal manner in accordance with any directions issued from time to time by the Government&rdquo;. It was intended, in drafting this subsection, that matters such as those raised by the Deputy will be comprehended by any directions or guidelines issued by the Government and complemented by the launch tomorrow of the quality customer service for customers and clients of the Civil Service, which will lay down that in their dealings with the public, Civil Service Departments and offices will provide services for those who wish to do their business through Irish.</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the strategy statement of each Department of State and Scheduled Office shall contain details of how the Department of State or Scheduled Office concerned intends to ensure the effective delivery of its services to people with disabilities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have in mind particularly those who are blind, deaf and with other disabilities.  I was involved in initiating work in relation to blind people which was much appreciated.  For those who are deaf the microcom teleprinter on the phone was sponsored by a number of Departments and semi-State bodies.  I think I know what was wrong with amendment No. 3.  There should have been a comma after the words &ldquo;all civil servants&rdquo;.  This amendment deals with a similar point but it is in relation to people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of this amendment is to oblige Departments to include specific measures in their strategy statements on the delivery of services to people with disabilities.  I fully agree with the case made by the Deputy.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities issued its report last week.  I welcome this report and I believe it provides a sound analysis of the key issues affecting people with disabilities.  Among the conclusions of that report were recommendations on the introduction of further legislation to promote equality for people with disabilities in relation to, <i>inter alia</i>, services provided by public bodies.  In tandem with the decision to publish the commission's report, the Government approved the establishment of an interdepartmental task force to draw up a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on the report.  This task force has been operating since January 1997 <Col N="56" /> and is due to complete the plan of action very shortly.  The Government has also authorised the establishment of a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the Commission's recommendations comprising former members of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, representatives of the social partners, a nominee from the National Rehabilitation Board, the South Eastern Health Board, the Disability Federation of Ireland, Government Departments and the newly established Irish Council of People with Disabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition to the £100,000 provided for in the 1997 Estimates, for the Irish Council of People with Disabilities, a further £200,000 was allocated in this year's budget. This will help to ensure that the council is set up on a proper professional basis which will help advance the interests of people with disabilities at all levels.  Moreover, when the equal status legislation comes into effect, for the first time in the history of the State there will be statutory protection against discrimination on grounds of disability.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate and share the Deputy's concerns, given the above initiatives I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to take this further step in this Bill.  My preference is to deal with the full institutional response to matters impinging on people with disabilities in a specific and detailed purpose-built statute rather than provide a token gesture in a Bill designed for specific purposes.  We have learned from past experience that the inclusion in legal instruments, including the Constitution, of essentially aspirational statements has facilitated the avoidance of hard decisions with practical effect.</P>
      <P>A key element of the principles of quality customer service which I mentioned earlier is access to services, that is, the importance of securing clean, accessible public offices which ensure privacy, comply with occupational safety standards and specifically facilitate access for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, the three reservations I expressed about the previous amendment apply in this case. It would be impractical and unwieldy to specifically provide for all matters, such as those relating to people with disabilities, in this item of primary legislation.  It would create an imbalance in the Bill if some but not others were included. Second, matters which cut across more than one Department or office are dealt with in section 4(1)(e) which provides that &ldquo;... appropriate arrangements are put into place that will facilitate an effective response ... &ldquo;to such cross cutting matters.  Third, section 5(1)(b) states that strategy statements must be prepared &ldquo; ... in a form and manner in accordance with any directions issued from time to time by the Government&rdquo;. Matters affecting people with disabilities as raised by the Deputy will be comprehended by any directions or guidelines issued by the Government.</P>

      <P>To a large extent this matter has already been discussed under section 4.  The intention of the amendment is to make it clear that the Minister is in overall and complete charge.  Section 6 states that, subject to section 12, which deals with cross departmental issues: &ldquo;... the Secretary General of a Department ... shall, in accordance with directions issued from time to time by the Government, be accountable to the Minister of the Government having charge of the Department or Scheduled Office in carrying out the duties or functions referred to in section 4&rdquo;.

This would include any function already performed by the Secretary General.

      <P>I am concerned about this change as the public interest element as represented by the Minister is being removed in the normal operation of the public service.  I am not referring to those currently on contract at assistant secretary level who are top class.  Notwithstanding this, in future a Secretary General or an assistant secretary might have his or her own agenda and there will be no checks and balances in the system. Amendment No. 7 seeks to delete the words &ldquo;other than section 4 (1) (h)&rdquo; from the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any case where a Minister has interfered.  I accept the Minister of State wants to ensure Secretaries General will have latitude but this is a fundamental change about which I am concerned.  Staff will work almost exclusively to the Secretary General in these matters. This means in effect that they will serve the Secretary General, not the Minister.  Civil servants have always seen themselves as serving the State and the Minister.  From their point of view, the Minister acted as a balance and they were assured that he or she would be on the same wavelength.  Ministers are being divested of this power.  Their position is, therefore, being weakened and undermined.</P>
      <P>I wish I had more time to deal with some of the more interesting and amusing amendments in my name.  They seek to make special provision in section 11 for the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; one could describe it as the Pat Rabbitte provision.  It is suggested that a Minister of State who regularly attends meetings of Government should have two special advisers. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, can have as many as he likes to enhance his status and position as leader of a political party.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure the prompt payment of amounts due to suppliers of goods and services by public sector purchasers and by contractors on public sector contracts.  The difficulties caused to suppliers by the late payment of business debts have been well documented.  An obvious problem relates to cash flow.  Late payment requires firms to extend overdraft facilities or to engage in additional borrowing.  This is particularly serious for small business where cash flow problems are one of the main causes of business failure.  In addition, monitoring and chasing late payments absorbs a substantial amount of scarce management time.  This is an unproductive use of resources which would be better spent in developing the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Task Force on Small Business, which reported in 1994, noted that getting paid on time was a never ending problem for small business and recommended that legislation should be introduced to ensure prompt payment by the <Col N="60" /> public sector.  The Government is fully committed to addressing this issue.  A commitment was given in the programme.  A Government of Renewal, to bring forward legislation in respect of the public sector.  The Bill now before the House fulfils that commitment and also fulfils a more recent commitment given in Partnership 2000 to introduce such legislation.  The Government has gone beyond these commitments by introducing legislation in respect of all businesses doing business with public bodies, not just small companies.</P>
    <P>There has been a number of surveys and estimates of the time taken to pay accounts in Ireland and in other European countries.  The task force estimated that payment periods in Ireland were 79 days on average, which was poorer than the European average.  A European business survey, published in May 1996 by Grant Thornton International Business Strategies Ltd, showed the average payment period in Ireland to be 59 days, which is two days less than the EU average of 61 days but nine days more than the UK average of 50 days.</P>
    <P>The surveys do not distinguish between public and private sector purchasers.  A survey which is often quoted in support of the contention that payment practices in the public sector are extremely poor is a survey of public sector fee performance undertaken in 1992 by the Society of Chartered Surveyors which indicates that the average payment period was 154 days.  However, as the survey was based on responses from only 11 companies, covering a total of 138 fee payments received, it could hardly be regarded as providing a comprehensive or representative view of the position in the public sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>In view of the absence of firm information on payment practices in the public sector, I decided to commission a survey on the issue.  The purpose of the survey is twofold: first, it is intended to provide reliable information on existing payment practices and, more important, second, it is intended to establish a benchmark for measuring progress in reducing payment periods and in assessing the effectiveness of this legislation in eliminating the problem of late payment in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The survey was based on a random sample of 75 public sector organisations, with a target sample of 100 invoices selected for examination in each organisation.  Consequently, the results of the survey are based on an analysis of over 7,000 payment records.  The key findings of the survey are as follows: the average payment period between the date of invoice and the date on which payment is made is 55 days; the average payment period for payments made after 45 days is 76 days; and approximately 57 per cent of payments are made later than 45 days.  The average payment period varied between different types of organisations.  For example, the average payment period for Government Departments was 50 days, which was the same as the average payment period for commercial semi-State bodies, while local authorities at 57 days and health boards and <Col N="61" /> hospitals at 58 days had relatively long average payment periods.  Average payment periods do not, of course, give a full picture of payment practices and a more useful indicator is probably the proportion of payments which are made late.  The survey gives information on the portion of total payments which were made in a range of payment periods.  This gives a clearer indication of the extent of the problem.  For example, it shows that approximately 57 per cent of payments are made after 45 days, 26 per cent are made after 60 days and 12 per cent are made later than 80 days.</P>
    <P>Other analyses of payment data have been undertaken in the survey, giving information on such areas as the proportion of late payments in the different categories of public bodies, payment performance by size of payment and payment period by type of goods purchased.  In addition, the survey deals with such issues as the reasons given by purchasers for making late payment.  I do not propose to give details of all the information resulting from the survey, but I will make the consultant's report available to the public as it contains many valuable insights into the problem of late payments.  The details I have given make it quite clear that there is significant scope for improvement in public sector payment practices and underpin the real need for the introduction of this Bill which will give the necessary legislative stimulus to the achievement of prompt payment practices in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill will require public bodies to pay amounts due to their suppliers on or before the date due under the terms of the contract, provided that the contract is in writing.  Where the payment date is not established by written contract, payment must be made within 45 days of receipt of an invoice or date of supply, whichever is the later.  The Bill also contains appropriate safeguards to deter public bodies from seeking unduly long credit periods in written contracts.  A key provision of the Bill is an automatic right to interest in respect of late payments.  There is no scope for having any interest due waived, which is a key factor in ensuring that public bodies will comply with the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill will apply primarily to purchasers in the public sector.  I am well aware, of course, that some private sector purchasers are not without fault in regard to their payment practices. However, I agree with the Task Force on Small Business that different approaches should be adopted, at least initially, to try to resolve any problems in this sector.  In the case of the public sector, I favour a legislative approach because that sector should have an exemplary record in paying its accounts on time.  Moreover, the public sector devotes substantial resources to the development of business and it simply does not make good economic sense to undermine and contradict such development policies by engaging in late payment practices which damage the cash flow, stability and survival propensity of firms.</P>
    <P>In the case of the private sector, legislation would not be the best approach, at least initially. <Col N="62" /> Taking into account that codes of practice on prompt payment have been adopted by employer organisations, it would be reasonable to allow some time to elapse to judge how effective these codes will prove to be.  It would also be prudent to allow some time to gain experience of the operation of the legislation in the public sector before making a decision on its extension to the private sector.  As an exception to that general principle, however, I have brought contractors on public sector contracts within the scope of the Bill.  If the main contractor gets new statutory rights and protection in relation to public sector purchasers then it seems only fair and reasonable that the legislation should ensure that the cash flow benefit is passed on, in particular, to small business suppliers.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be brought into operation on a date designated by order.  For reasons of transparency and clarity it is useful to mention, at this stage, that I intend to make an order which will bring the legislation into operation with effect from 1 January next year.  This implementation date will allow public bodies the necessary time to ensure that their systems are adequate to meet the new payment and reporting demands of the Bill.  I also want to make it clear that I am not closing the door on the concept of legislation for the private sector.  I am committed to a full review of the operation of the private sector codes of practice and this legislation three years after its implementation to determine the merits of extending it to the private sector.  There are significant economic benefits for business and for Ireland generally in the implementation of a comprehensive system of prompt payments.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the provisions of the Bill and elaborate on its main features.  Section 1 is an interpretation section, defining the terms used in the Bill.  Key terms defined are &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; and &ldquo;prescribed payment date&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; encompasses the persons and bodies who will be obliged to comply with the payment provisions of the Bill.  These include public bodies which are listed in the Schedule to the Bill, subsidiaries of those public bodies and contractors who supply, or contract with another person to supply, goods or services to the bodies listed in the Schedule or their subsidiaries.  The public bodies listed in the Schedule include all Government Departments, local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees and all State companies.  The purpose of listing the bodies covered is to try to make the scope of the Bill as transparent as possible for suppliers so that they will have no doubts as to which purchasers or prospective purchasers are encompassed by the provisions of the Bill.  This will ensure clarity and certainty, which is so often advocated by the business community.</P>
    <P>The Schedule is in two parts.  Part 1 lists all the public bodies or categories of public bodies who will be bound by the terms of the legislation from the date on which it comes in to operation.  Part 2 lists three bodies, Aer Lingus, Bus Éireann and <Col N="63" /> Bord Telecom Éireann.  The Bill proposes that the three bodies listed in Part 2 will not come within the scope of the legislation until one year after the implementation date.  However, I am delighted to inform the House that the Government has decided that all public sector bodies will have to comply with the legislation from the date of implementation.  I will, therefore, introduce an amendment at Committee Stage to rescind the provisions which allow a one year transition period for Aer Lingus, Bus Éireann and Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; extends beyond public sector bodies to include contractors on public sector contracts.  The intention is to ensure that the benefits flowing to main contractors from being paid on time by public sector bodies will be passed on, in turn, to their suppliers.  This provision will be of particular benefit to small business.</P>
    <P>The second key term defined in section 1 is &ldquo;prescribed payment date&rdquo;.  This is the date on which payment for the provision of goods and services will be due under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>In tandem with the publication of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, I obtained Government approval for the establishment of an interdepartmental task force to draw up a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report, and a monitoring committee comprising representatives of people with disabilities, their families and carers, service providers, the social partners and a number of Departments to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force commenced its work in January of this year.  It is chaired by my Department and is representative of all the major Departments which have responsibility for the wide range of policy issues on which the commission's report has an impact.  Material for inclusion in the plan of action is being prepared by each Department. The work of the task force is ongoing and it is expected to complete its report by mid-year.  It <Col N="64" /> will be then presented to Government for consideration.</P>
    <P>On 18 April I launched the monitoring committee. The terms of reference of the monitoring committee are to advise the interdepartmental task force on the prioritisation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities; to provide any assistance and support required by the task force to facilitate the preparation of the plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities; to advise my Department as required on the drawing up of a detailed implementation strategy arising from the commission's recommendations; to make proposals to my Department on mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the commission's recommendations; and to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which have been accepted by Government or by Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is one of the most significant documents concerning social issues, containing 402 recommendations.  We had a debate in the House last week on the report and I ask the Minister to give an assurance that time will be made available to continue that debate.  Will the Minister indicate also if the Ministers for Health, Education and Social Welfare will participate in any future debate as there is some overlapping in the report in regard to areas which come under their remit?  Will the Minister indicate if the task force he has set up is in a position to issue a timetable regarding the implementation of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDaid that the commission's report is one of the most significant documents on the rights of people with disabilities produced since the foundation of the State.  I regret I am not in a position to give a guarantee on the continuation of the debate, but the matter can be discussed by the Whips.  If it is possible to make time available to enable that debate be continued, I would be agreeable to that.  I will mention the matter to the Government Chief Whip.  In so far as overlapping in the report is concerned, the recommendations in the report clearly cover the briefs of many Ministers.  For that reason, the interdepartmental task force is representative, at a senior level, of the Departments required to have an input into the ongoing progression of the implementation of the report's recommendations.  That is the meeting point where the various Government interests will come together to set the prioritisation which obviously has to be made.  Deputy Keogh has tabled a question on the timetable and I will deal with that in more detail when we reach that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main recommendations in the report is that disability policy should be centred on one Department.  The Minister indicated on a previous occasion that that Department should be a section of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Has the task force contemplated the resourcing of such a Department within the Minister's own Department? Will the Minister indicate whether this area will be dealt with by an assistant secretary as opposed to a principal officer?  The Minister has agreed this is a significant report dealing with approximately 12 per cent of the population.  If the Minister agreed to have this area dealt with by an assistant secretary in his own Department, it would be welcomed by all the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>I can indicate the level of prioritisation that will be provided by the report of the task force when it becomes available.  We should have it before too long and I look forward with considerable interest to receiving it.  My Department is adequately resourced to do the job deputed to it.  It is no secret that I hold the view that, in accordance with one of the recommendations of the commission, the Department of Equality and Law Reform should have overall responsibility for this area.  That is the policy of the Labour Party and I am interested to hear the views of Members from other parties in that regard.  As to the level of staffing, be it principal officer or assistant secretary level, that matter would have to be examined in the light of decisions that would have to be made at the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As the report has been completed for more than a year, will the Minister indicate if any of its recommendations has been already dealt with?  A key issue in the report is the right of people with disabilities to income support.  I referred in my previous question to the Department of Social Welfare because people with disabilities have many more expenses and a lesser degree of earning power.  Approximately 80 per cent of people with disabilities are unemployed. The Minister said he was interested to hear the views of other parties on this area.  Fianna Fáil takes a serious view of it.  Islanders also have a degree of disability with regard to earnings.  I hoped, therefore, the Minister could tell the House whether any of the report has been recommended, whether he has been in touch with the Department of Social Welfare and whether that Department regards people with disabilities as requiring income support.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDaid asked whether any of the priority recommendations of the Commission's report have already been implemented.  One of the priority recommendations was that appropriate funding should be provided for the new Council for the Status of People with Disabilities.  That has been done, and I will refer to that in reply to a later question.  Likewise, one of the priority recommendations called on the Government to take appropriate action in the revision of the EU treaties so that provision in connection with disability would be made there.  That too is actively in train by the current Government.</P>

      <P>We are all guilty of some degree of inability to recognise people with disabilities who are faced with inaccessible services inflexible bureaucracy and, above all, general public ignorance which compounds their exclusion.  Is there any policy within the Department, and would the Minister agree that it would be a good idea to launch a campaign in the print media and in the visual media, to make the general public more aware of the problems faced on a daily basis by people with disabilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government and the previous Government have taken steps to put the issue of people with disabilities on the agenda in a manner that was never even tentatively approached before.  I refer to setting up the commission and the huge publicity that attached to that, to the listening exercise carried out, to setting up the Council for the Status of People with Disabilities, to the many public statements I and my colleagues have made in connection with it, and to the legislation, including the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill which the Government processed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  All these have put people with disabilities to the forefront of the agenda of priority issues as never before.  That process which was started by this Government and by the previous Government will be ongoing and will pick up speed as it goes, and it is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 32 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> Family mediation is currently available from two centres operated by the Family Mediation Service of my Department.  One is located at the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1, while the other is at Mill House, Limerick.</P>
    <P>It is my objective that where couples have decided to separate, as many of them as possible would avail of mediation to facilitate agreement on issues such as finance, property and child custody without having recourse to the adversarial courts system.  The use of litigation and adversarial procedures in family disputes can have very negative effects on the family and in particular on any children of the relationship.  The truth of this is well recognised and, in 1994, support for this view was available when, in the introduction to the Consultation Paper on Family Courts, the Law Reform Commission said:</P>
    <P>It needs to be recognised that judicial proceedings, even though conducted with informality, and sensitivity, are not therapeutic exercises and that it is not possible to exclude from them some element of confrontation.  This is one of the reasons why it is so important to avoid judicial proceedings where it is possible to do so without risk of injustice to the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Law Reform Commission in its 1996 report recommended a strong shift in emphasis away from the adversarial process and towards mediation &mdash; Recommendation No. 40. For this reason I hope an increasing number of separating couples will come to see mediation as the means of making arrangements best suited to their needs for their future as separated people, and for the needs of their families.</P>
    <P>It was with this in mind that I placed the family mediation service on a permanent footing and embarked on a development and expansion programme that is beginning now to bear fruit.  As part of a programme for the development and expansion of the family mediation service, two new posts of area mediation co-ordinator were filled recently following a competition held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission. One post was for the original centre at the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin; the other was for the new centre established at Mill House in Limerick.  These appointees are responsible for the delivery of a quality mediation service with the assistance of a team of mediators, each with his own geographical areas of responsibility. In addition, another competition was held recently to recruit a number of part-time mediators for the family mediation service.  I am hopeful appointments from this competition will be made very soon.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the area mediation co-ordinators will help to facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of mediators in private practice who have the necessary training and experience and otherwise meet the standards set by the family mediation service, to provide family <Col N="68" /> mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre or to relieve pressure on the centres at Dublin and Limerick.  The allocation of cases to private mediators would be done through the family mediation service.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to gauge what the demands for mediation will be over the next five years. Many of those couples, 3,250 approximately, who have availed of mediation since the family mediation service was first established in 1986, would now satisfy the criteria necessary for a divorce. Therefore, in addition to existing and new applications to the family mediation service for mediation, some couples who have already mediated agreements may return to review their agreement in the light of a divorce application. However, having regard to progress to date, I am satisfied the foundations are now laid for the development of a family mediation service that will be capable of responding in a structured way to whatever demands are placed on it in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all agree that mediation is the way forward, and statistics indicate that 55 per cent of people who go through mediation are satisfied with it and another 25 per cent come to some agreement.  Despite that, the Minister's Department allocated only £300,000 to the family mediation service last year.  I understand, the same is available this year.  I accept the Minister is doing his utmost for the service, but in the context of the £20 million it costs to go through the adversarial court system, surely more funding should be allocated to the area of mediation, given that most couples want to address their situation in this way because they get better counselling and advice in this way.  The Family Mediation Service is in the shadow of the courts.  It is the solicitors and barristers who are benefiting from the good objective the Minister has set out.  We all agree that mediation is available, but it will be only lip service if funding is not provided.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is too long.  The time allocated for dealing with the first three priority questions is almost exhausted and we have not yet reached No. 3.  We may not be able to deal with No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>When I took over responsibility for the Family Mediation Service in 1993 it consisted of just one centre in Dublin.  Since then resources have approximately doubled and we have opened a second centre in Limerick.  The way forward is to use either private mediators with the necessary expertise and qualifications or voluntary organisations under the auspices of the Family Mediation Service.  As I stated on previous occasions, we do not as yet have an adequate supply of trained professional mediators.  The number of people available to provide the service is relatively small, but the centres in Dublin and Limerick will facilitate the training of more <Col N="69" /> mediators.  As professional mediators come on stream, some means will have to be provided to avail of their necessary skills.  While I generally agree with Deputy McDaid's comments, I am sure he will agree that remarkable progress has been made since 1993.  The service was rather tenuous when I took it over since it was set up on a temporary basis.  I made it permanent, opened an additional centre and recruited staff.  More are to be recruited soon.  They will use private mediators and voluntary organisations under the umbrella of the Family Mediation Service.  We have established a solid base and I look forward to ongoing improvements as staff become available in future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister said, he did not indicate if additional funding will be provided for the service.  People are concerned about the privately regulated system of mediation the Minister has set up.  The majority of the funding is going into the legal rather than mediation aspect of the service.  The Family Mediation Service holds that funding unregulated private mediation is not the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding provided is for the Family Mediation Service which does not charge fees.  Many people avail of that worthwhile service. The future of family law rests more and more in the area of mediation.  I do not accept people are frightened of using the service.  If that is the case they are quickly put at ease.  Great care and time is allocated to individual cases.  The funding available in the Department this year is adequate, but it will have to be reviewed each year at budget time.</P>

      <P>Work in connection with services to people with disabilities is proceeding on an ongoing basis in various Departments.  Prioritisation of the report's recommendations is being specifically addressed by the interdepartmental task force which will draw up a prioritised list on particular items.  However, work in connection with people with disabilities has not come to a standstill in other Departments.  Extensive work is being carried out on an ongoing basis, particularly in the Departments of Health, Education and Enterprise and Employment.  The Government's decisions following the publication of the task force's report will place particular emphasis on specific recommendations in the commission's report.  I have also set up a monitoring committee on which there is a broad range of representation, including people with disabilities.  It will have an active, permanent and ongoing role in monitoring progress on the implementation of the report's recommendations.  The Council for the Status of People with Disabilities, which is up and running and properly funded, is an important additional factor in the equation.  It will also be a major voice in advocating the rights of people with disabilities. It will be the watchdog from outside and the monitoring committee will be the watchdog from inside.  Through those committees I have built a firm platform from which the rights of people with disabilities can be progressed in the future.</P>

      <P>As I stated in a reply to an earlier question from Deputy McDaid, the commission advocated that there should be one Department dealing with disabilities and it should be the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  I have outlined the Labour Party position in that regard and I am anxious to hear the views of the Progressive Democrats.  A disabilities Act is one of the recommendations of the commission's report.  I look forward to considering the task force's comments on it and the parameters I might suggest to it.  I am considering that question.  Until now we have been preoccupied in this area with important anti-discrimination Bills, the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill which are currently before the Supreme Court. <Col N="71" /> The need for a disabilities Act will have ongoing consideration.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if there are any policy implications for his Department, and his views thereon, in relation to the operation of arrangements to deal with international child abductions from the State.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the problem of the wrongful removal of children from the State by a parent or the improper retention of children abroad by a parent.</P>
      <P>The possibility of recovering a child in these cases has improved greatly in recent years.  The credit for this goes to the operation of two international conventions, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and a Council of Europe Convention on child custody which were given the force of law in the State by the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991.  Prior to that legislation there were no formal arrangements whereby rights of custody of parents in the State could be recognised or enforced in another state.</P>
      <P>The Hague Convention contains judicial and administrative measures to secure the return of a child on the basis that the custody of a child should be decided in the courts of the place where the child habitually resides.  The Luxembourg Convention contains measures designed to ensure that custody orders made by the courts in a contracting state are, subject to conditions, recognised and enforced in other contracting states.  Forty-four countries worldwide, including all our EU partners, the USA and Canada, are party to one or both of those conventions.</P>
      <P>The conventions provide for the establishment of a central authority in each contracting state to carry out functions which are specified in the conventions. All central authorities are obliged to initiate steps to trace a child, to seek the child's return or secure access to the child, to arrange, if necessary, for court proceedings to secure the return of, or access to, the child, to collate and send to other central authorities information about the child.</P>
      <P>The central authority which operates in my Department for the purposes of both conventions has received full co-operation from other central authorities in securing the return of children who have been removed from the State.  The Deputy will appreciate that I could not undertake, in reply to questions, to discuss the details of any particular cases.  I say that in the knowledge that from time to time some cases of child abduction get considerable publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of cases dealt with in 1996 by <Col N="72" /> our central authority was 114.  Of that figure 51 were abductions into the State and 63 were abductions from the State.  In 12 of those 51 cases of abductions into the State the court ordered the return of the children concerned; in eight cases the court refused to return the children; in nine cases the parties reached agreement; one case was for the recognition of a care order; one case was outside the scope of the convention concerned; 12 applications were withdrawn and 18 cases were awaiting resolution at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In 17 of the 63 cases of abductions from the State foreign courts ordered the return of the children; in five cases the foreign courts refused to return the children; in 15 cases the parties reached agreement; one case was outside the scope of the convention concerned; ten applications were withdrawn and 15 cases were awaiting resolution at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The operation of both conventions is the subject of regular review under the auspices of the relevant international organisations, namely the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the Council of Europe.  Both conventions provide specifically for those reviews and my Department has participated in them.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I recognise it is difficult to get a proper answer to a question on this area as frequently questions are transferred from one Department to another.  As a large number of emigrants have come to this country in the past few years, this problem will increase in future years.  I appreciate the Minister asking what I had in mind in tabling this question.</P>
      <P>Legislation on the Hague Convention was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Burke, some years ago.  The Minister informed us that 44 countries have signed up to that convention and obviously it is an important one.  In view of our place in the world and given that 44 countries constitute a relatively small number of countries, what efforts are being made to attract other countries to sign up to that convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Efforts to get other countries to sign up to that convention are matters for international organisations.  No doubt the appropriate communications are made by the Hague Conference and the Council of Europe.  It is not just a matter of signing up to the convention, certain procedures must be in place.  Legal systems must be in place to operate on an appropriate basis. Central authorities that meet certain qualifications must also be in place in the relevant countries. All the European Union member states have signed up to the convention and the range of countries that are parties to it are broad ranging.  I am sure work is ongoing on the international scene in that regard to improve matters further.</P>

      <P>I am sure many people will be surprised to hear that 114 cases were dealt with by our central authority.  Is the Minister aware of the <Col N="73" /> number of cases concerning children involving countries that have not signed up to the Hague Convention?  He said a number of cases were awaiting resolution.  Will he indicate how long it takes to resolve a case?  Is there an average time span or does it depend on the individual case involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the case involved. The facts of each case are different.  It depends on many factors, the information available to the court, if the central authority had obtained the necessary information required, the availability of court time and varying factors that may come into play.  I do not have information on the specific average length of time a case would take.  It varies from case to case.  I do not have information on cases involving countries other than those that are party to the two conventions concerned.  Proceedings under those conventions could not get under way if the appropriate country was not a party to the conventions.  Therefore, that kind of statistic would not be available because such an application would not have any legal base under those two conventions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We have become quite a cosmopolitan country, particularly in the past two to five years.  Quite a few people who are members of my profession and other professions have emigrated here from countries that have not signed up to the Hague Convention.  Many of those emigrants come from Muslim countries that have a different cultural outlook on the status of men and women.  I do not want to be racist or discriminatory, but as the numbers emigrating here increases the problem in this area will also increase.  When an Irish national marries a national of a country which does not abide by the Hague convention, does the Minister envisage he will have to take steps to require the foreign national to sign an agreement, before such a marriage, that disputes will be settled and any legal case heard in this jurisdiction?  This is all the more important given that the child from the marriage is Irish.  There will be problems when people from other countries, particularly Muslim countries, marry Irish people and these will increase in years to come.  Does the Minister think that, before a person from such a country marries an Irish national, he or she should have to sign a document stating that any case arising from the abduction of children will be heard in the Irish courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That question raises what could be quite a complex issue and it would depend on a number of surrounding circumstances.  I am not in a position to give a legal opinion on a hypothetical case of that nature.  This question concerns abduction of children either into or out of the State and, as I said in my initial reply, the facility for dealing with both types of case has much improved as a result of the 1991 Act and the ratification by many countries of the two conventions concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> I agree with Deputy McDaid that what he loosely described as the Muslim countries do not appear on the list of countries which have ratified the conventions &mdash; it appears the only such country to have ratified is Bosnia.  If a case arises where the availability of the convention procedure cannot be used because one of those countries has not subscribed to the convention, no formal arrangement exists.  Whether anything could be done &mdash; either within the Irish courts or the courts of the other country, Muslim or otherwise &mdash; would depend on the facts and on the legal system in that country, which could vary from case to case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  This country places a different emphasis on women and mothers than do those countries which have not signed the Hague convention.  If a child is abducted from Ireland to such a country with a different culture, what rights exist in Ireland to impose the legal right in the country of the father?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish courts would determine such an application in the light of our law.  A number of aspects of family law and international law would come into play and would be taken into account by the courts.  In a small number of cases, even in applications brought under the convention procedure, the courts refuse to return the children to the country of origin.  Consequently, a similar jurisdiction is vested in the courts in a case which would be outside the ambit of the conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that if a country has signed neither the Hague convention nor the Council of Europe convention, there is little or no redress for a parent seeking to have his or her child returned here?  In other words, it would be a difficult process and the parent would be unlikely to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean an abduction from Ireland to one of those countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on the circumstances of the case and the legal system in the country to which the child was taken.  The system might enable applications to be brought and court orders to be made there or it might not.  One might receive a sympathetic or unsympathetic response in such a country.  However, the tremendous facility of the convention procedure would not be available.  This procedure gives people from countries which subscribe to the convention a huge advantage because the system operates on a Government to Government basis, using the central authority in each country.  Procedures are in place for the supply of legal aid to people who would need to use the central authority convention procedures.  The convention is a huge boon to the parent of a child who has been abducted <Col N="75" /> either into or out of Ireland.  If one is not in a position to avail of the convention and the central authority procedure, it will be much more difficult. One will have to hire lawyers in that distant country, make inquiries and ascertain the legal position.  This could present great difficulties, which are precisely the ills which those conventions were designed to remedy and they have done so extremely well.</P>

      <P>I am proud that as Minister for Justice I introduced the legislation for the protection of children.  It concerns not only the rights of the parents but also the welfare and interests of the children.  I am glad the legislation is operating well but circumstances have evolved since it was introduced in 1991.  The Soviet bloc collapsed from 1989 onwards and we have a far more diverse population than we did then.  This diversity will increase, not only in Ireland but worldwide.</P>
      <P>In the dying days of this Administration, will the Minister ask the Irish delegation in the Council of Europe, which includes Members from all sides of this House, to try to ensure the range of countries is extended beyond the 44 countries which have already signed the council's convention? Will he also take an initiative to ensure those countries which have not signed the Hague convention do so?  Every country, regardless of tradition or religious background, is interested in its children.  There have been terrible abductions of children within one country's borders, in Belgium and elsewhere.  We must put in place greater protection for our children and I encourage the Minister to do everything he can to increase the number of signatory countries to the Hague and Council of Europe conventions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my reply to questions on several occasions I set out the context in which the present law on guardianship of, custody of and access to children operates.  I indicated that the court must, in proceedings under the Guardianship <Col N="76" /> of Infants Act, 1964, regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. That important criterion, which is common to many other jurisdictions, is a matter which the court must have regard to in all the circumstances of the case.  I indicated also that in areas of disputes relating to children, the best approach for all concerned, parents and children, may be for the parents to attempt to agree on the arrangements for their children without court intervention but that, in the absence of agreement, the court will inevitably have to make hard and difficult decisions which may include the granting of custody to one parent and access to the other.</P>
    <P>I mentioned I would review the law on guardianship in the context of preparation of the Children Bill in my Department.  That Bill is now before the House.  It provides for a new emphasis on counselling and mediation as alternatives to court proceedings concerning children.  It encourages couples who are in dispute to think in terms of agreeing such matters as custody of, and access to, children without the need for court intervention. It also clarifies the law in relation to joint custody and provides that, in appropriate cases, custody of a child may be granted by the court to a father and mother jointly.</P>
    <P>There is a range of other reforms in the Bill. Under the law as it stands, a father not married to the mother of his child cannot be the guardian of his child without a court order.  I have made provision in the Bill for such fathers to be appointed guardian of the child by agreement with the mother without the need to go to court as at present.  The Bill allows relatives, such as grandparents, to apply, subject to conditions, to the courts for access; it extends to the District Court power to order social reports in guardianship, custody and access proceedings generally; and it contains provisions relating to giving evidence by children in certain civil proceedings. The Bill also specifies a system of guardianship <i>ad litem</i> with legal representation, subject to certain strict conditions.</P>
    <P>I look forward to debate on the important social provisions in the Bill which address the sensitivity of the family law process.  They also address, as far as possible, the issue of gender balance, taking into account the need to have regard to the principle of the best interests of the children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that this very important issue is simmering and we will hear a great deal about it in future.  He has published the Children Bill, which I hope will be discussed here at some future stage.  However, will he agree that the courts and Judiciary, as currently constituted, are totally incapable of dealing with this problematic area?  Will he also agree that the whole area, which probably requires constitutional change, is based on a patriarchal view of society which held that the mother's place was in the home and that she automatically had to <Col N="77" /> take care of the children?  The roles of men and women have changed dramatically over time.</P>
      <P>There have been some horrifying cases in this area due to the inadequacy of the courts.  Some 95 per cent of custody cases are decided in favour of the mother.  For example, in the case of a man and woman with children who have been together for six years and where the man is the homemaker, if the mother went to England with another man she could return and get custody of the children in court, although the father had looked after them for four years.  There is something wrong in the whole area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be adequate for the time being.  Let us hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which must be dealt with. Does the Minister feel that his Bill deals adequately with this situation?  Will he agree there is a major constitutional problem at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy McDaid that, as he put it, the courts and Judiciary are totally incapable of dealing with these cases. I would like to think that the courts and Judiciary deal with these cases, by and large, in a careful, measured and sensitive manner.  Of course, judges may vary from time to time and cases are occasionally appealed.  One cannot speak about every case.  However, by and large, the Judiciary are extremely careful and cautious people who sympathetically apply the law.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, the law on the issue of custody of, and access to, children is very clear and is based on the basic, overriding principle that decisions on custody and access must be based on one primary consideration, which is the best interests of the child.  In some cases, that may involve giving custody to the mother, in some to the father and in others the optimal decision is joint custody.</P>
      <P>There have been some doubts on whether the option of joint custody has been available to the courts until now.  It is an important option which is why I have specifically provided jurisdiction in the Children Bill to enable the courts to grant joint custody in appropriate cases.  That is an important new indicator to the courts that joint custody, subject to whatever terms the court may consider apply to an individual case, should be awarded where appropriate.</P>
      <P>I do not know where Deputy McDaid got the statistic that in 95 per cent of cases custody is awarded to the mother.  I have no knowledge of such a statistic.  By and large, the courts deal with these cases carefully and always have the best interests of the child in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister.  I do not want to criticise the courts or the Judiciary because this is a new area but, particularly with the advent of divorce legislation, it will become an increasing problem.  Will the Minister agree <Col N="78" /> that, while one can become a failed husband, that does not necessarily mean one is a failed father? If the statistics which I have quoted are factual, it appears that the Judiciary is saying in its interpretation of the current legislation &mdash; which is the proper interpretation &mdash; that if one is a failed husband one is also, in effect, a failed father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a legal proposition that if one is a failed husband one is also a failed father. That is a different matter and I do not think the courts proceed, as far as custody of, and access to, children is concerned, on that basis.  My experience when I practised in the family law courts was that the judges approached each case with great sensitivity, sympathy, patience and understanding and always took the best interests of the child into account.  I am sure Deputy McDaid will agree that is the correct criterion on which the law should be based.  It is right and proper that the law has always been based on that criterion.</P>
      <P>The one shortcoming in this area was the absence of jurisdiction to give a clear signal to the court that it could award joint custody.  There has been a great deal of discussion on that issue.  Most of the organisations working in this area feel that option should exist and should be used on an increasing basis.  I agree with that suggestion and have included provision for specific jurisdiction in that regard in the Children Bill which I hope will be enacted as soon as possible.  I also hope it will be an additional useful facility to the courts where appropriate when dealing with these difficult and sensitive cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that Deputy McDaid has touched on an important point regarding the administration of justice by the courts in family law matters?  Does he also accept there might be a considerable improvement in the decisions handed down by courts were the judges to receive specific training in the context of courts dealing exclusively with these matters?</P>
      <P>There have been considerable changes to family law in recent years, for much of which the Minister has been responsible.  Decisions handed down by judges will, of necessity, become more frequent.  Such cases are, more often than not, very sensitive.  In view of this, is there not an argument for jurisprudence and the Judiciary to develop in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue that any training that could be provided in this specialised area for members of the Judiciary who practice in it could only be welcome.  The House has discussed this on occasion.  I will raise with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, the question of examining what means might be put in place or examined in consultation with the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  The arrangements must be made in agreement with the Judiciary, <Col N="79" /> whose members are independent officers under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister advise if the Judiciary has shown any willingness to embark on such training programmes?  Will he also agree that the family law courts are unsuitable to this process and this area needs to be reformed?  Does he consider that the Children Bill will have any effect in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information regarding the willingness or unwillingness of the Judiciary with regard to such approaches, but I will raise the matter with the Minister for Justice who has responsibility in this area.  I am not sure what Deputy Keogh means when she says the courts are unsuitable.  Does she mean the personnel or the premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

      <P>Both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree on either count, although that is not to say there is not always room for improvement on both counts.  These are primarily a matter for the Minister for Justice and I suggest Deputy Keogh raise the appropriate questions with her Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy O'Donoghue is relevant.  I do not understand why the Judiciary, especially in this area, cannot hold annual or biannual conferences to try and level matters because huge problems will arise.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that men and women should be given equal treatment as parents?  The glass ceiling effect in the employment area, where women progress to a certain level but go no further, applies to men in the case of parental equality, because women generally have guardianship rights and must look after children.  This would not happen if fathers had more balanced rights.  I do not want this to be seen as an attack on women.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill as drafted is probably contrary to Article 42 of the Constitution.  Article 42.1 states:</P>
      <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will consider this when reexamining the Bill.  Does he accept that men and women should be given equal treatment as parents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that Deputy McDaid has put the question in the right way.  In so far as children are concerned, we are all agreed that the criterion is and must be what is in the best interests of the child.  That will vary from <Col N="80" /> case to case and will depend on the specific circumstances in each family where the question of access or custody would come up for determination.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Children Bill, I took one anomaly out of the existing legal system, which is that where the desirable point is achieved in a specific case, where the mother and the father agree that a joint guardianship position is to apply, they may achieve that without going to court.  In the case of a mother and father who were unmarried until now, every case had to go to court, even in the case of agreement, and many hundreds of parents were put through that unnecessary difficulty.  I have provided that, where agreement is reached, they may make that arrangement by the procedures set down in the Bill without having to go to court.  It is a reasonable step.</P>
      <P>I am happy to discuss the Bill with Deputy McDaid and all Members of the House and I hope we will have an opportunity to do so.  I will keep an open mind on the question until the Bill is passed.  It can be considered further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister define what is meant by joint custody?  This is another area that is abused.  Joint custody should not mean that the father or mother get nine or ten hours custody of the child per week.  The meaning of joint custody should be defined.  I am aware of cases where one parent has nine hours access a week and the other parent has been advised to move to another part of the country or to the UK so that the other party is unable to avail of the joint custody.  What does the Minister mean by joint custody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Joint custody could not have been abused up to now because it has not been used to date.  There was no specific provision for it in law before I included it in the Children Bill, which was published recently.  How it will work is a matter for the courts to determine.  It will be open to the courts to apply particular conditions to its operation in individual cases.  The concept of joint custody is well developed in other countries and it has a useful role to play in our family law.  This is why I made provision for it.</P>
      <P>It will vary from case to case but, ideally, the parents will agree specific custody and access arrangements.  I agree it is difficult where parents fail to agree and it is left to a judge to determine the specific arrangements.  The court must always bear in mind the best interests of the child in devising how the custody and access arrangements will operate.  That will vary from case to case but, under a provision in the Children Bill, if it is enacted, the court could give overall nominal custody to both parents and then decide specifically how that would operate in practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Records of average waiting times for legal aid are not maintained as such.  Current maximum waiting times at each of the 30 full-time law centres on 31 March 1997 for persons seeking the services of the Legal Aid Board are set out in the first tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  In six centres the waiting time was one month or less.  In five centres the time was between one and two months.  In eight centres the time was between two and four months.  In five centres the time was between four and six months.  In four centres the time was between six and eight months and in the remaining two centres the time was greater than eight months.</P>
      <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and where, for whatever reason, they become excessive the position is examined by the board and appropriate remedial action is taken. There are a number of factors that should assist in improving waiting lists in the future.  The full impact of the two new law centres, which were opened earlier this year, as well as the two new law centres opened at the end of last year, has yet to be fully felt, particularly by adjacent law centres.  This is also true of the additional staff that have come on stream in accordance with the development plan for the service.  Meanwhile, the Legal Aid Board is actively engaged in negotiations, urgently seeking to extend the private practitioners scheme outside the Dublin area to which it is currently confined.  Extension of the scheme would have a significant impact on the waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information on waiting times at the board's law centres included in the tabular statement refers to the length of time the person who is the longest on each centre's waiting list has been waiting for an appointment with a solicitor at that centre.  It would not be possible without the allocation of a disproportionate amount of the board's resources to give an analysis of the progression of applications and cases through their various stages in the process.  Where it is <Col N="82" /> considered necessary, the board prioritises certain cases, some of which would fall into the family law category.  In addition, an emergency priority service, where applicants are not placed on a waiting list, is provided in certain child abduction cases, proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, and the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, and for the defence of child care proceedings under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>With the exception of divorce, the Legal Aid Board does not maintain its records in a manner that would make it possible without the allocation of a disproportionate amount of the board's administrative resources to provide a current breakdown of the waiting period for individual law centres in respect of the wide range of family law proceedings in relation to which services are available to eligible persons.  However, such information is extrapolated by the board from its records at the end of each year for inclusion in the statistical data contained in its annual report. Between 1989 and the end of 1996, a total of 5,410 legal aid certificates were issued in respect of judicial separation proceedings, of which 1,252 certificates were issued in 1996.  The board anticipates that some reduction in the number of persons applying for legal aid in respect of judicial separation will result from the introduction of divorce.</P>
    <P>Detail by law centre of the 1,175 persons who, on 31 March 1997, were seeking legal services from the Legal Aid Board in respect of divorce are set out in the second tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  This is the latest date for which such figures have been compiled.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Despite the fact that I have much sympathy with the subject of Question No. 5, it stretches the operation of the system when it takes so long to reach the next question.  It is most unfair.</P>
      <P>I have close contact with the legal aid centres in Cork city and I have referred many people to them.  I agree with the Minister that the centres are doing an excellent job and I recognise that the Minister has allocated more resources in the last three years than have ever been provided for the legal aid system.  However, there appears to be a log jam in the Cork North and South Mall centres in relation to people seeking legal assistance for family law matters.  The area involves huge urban sprawl but Cork city is such that people from different sides of the city are assigned to different centres to ensure that cases are not misrepresented.  There appears to be an inordinate delay in relation to family law cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At what speed is the Legal Aid Board pursuing <Col N="84" /> the negotiations with regard to the private practitioners scheme, a service which is only available in Dublin at present?  The log jam in Cork will be alleviated when the hump of the divorce legislation is overcome.  When will the negotiations be completed to ensure that the services of the private sector will be available in Cork city?</P>

      <P>I cannot say when the negotiations for the introduction of the private practitioners scheme outside Dublin will be completed. However, I am aware from the Legal Aid Board that it is pursuing those negotiations with vigour and making every effort to conclude them.  I agree with Deputy Lynch that the introduction of the private practitioners scheme would be of immense help to the service.  It has been of enormous help in Dublin.  It would be of great assistance if those negotiations were concluded.  In most law centres the waiting period is quite short. The Legal Aid Board has informed me it monitors this waiting period from time to time and, as necessary, transfers staff from one area to another.  The injection of State capital into this service has increased enormously since I assumed responsibility for it.  The number of new law centres has almost doubled, as has the number of people working within the service, including solicitors, support staff, clerks and articled clerks, now also recruited by that service.  It is a first class service, operating statutorily.  It has made huge advances, and is well placed to deal with divorce cases lining up for examination.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was adjourned I had been dealing with, in particular, section 1, the definitions section.  The second key term defined in that section is &ldquo;prescribed payment date&rdquo;, which is the date on which payment for the provision of goods and services will be due.  In the case of a written contract, the due date will be the date specified in the contract.  Where there is no written contract, or where the written contract does not provide for a date of payment, the payment date will be 45 days after receipt of the invoice or delivery of the goods, whichever is the later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also provision in section 1, in conjunction with section 10 (2), for the 45-day payment period to be reduced by order, at a future date, if <Col N="86" /> this should be considered desirable in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>Section 2 specifies that the Bill will apply only to goods and services supplied on or after the date on which its provisions come into operation. Section 3 allows the Minister, by order, to amend the Schedule which lists the bodies covered by the legislation.  This provision is necessary to allow the Act to be updated to include new public bodies which may be established in the future and to remove the names of those which cease to exist.  For reasons of transparency, the section also specifies that, if the Minister deletes a body from the Schedule, the reason for its deletion must be specified in the order.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the key provision ensuring the prompt payment of accounts and requires purchasers, whom I described earlier, to pay for the supply of goods and services by the prescribed payment date.  If payment is not made by the due date, the purchaser must pay an interest penalty on the amount outstanding.  The interest must be paid in respect of the period beginning on the day after the due date of payment and ending on the date on which payment is made.  Most importantly, the section specifically provides that the interest penalty cannot be waived by the supplier. Moreover, the interest penalty must be paid without any demand for its payment being made by the supplier.</P>
    <P>The automatic entitlement to interest in respect of late payments provided for in this section is a fundamental prerequisite to the effective operation of the legislation.  Very often suppliers regard themselves as being in a vulnerable position <i>vis-à-vis</i> purchasers.  It is more than likely they would be reluctant to submit demands for payment of interest for fear of jeopardising their chances of securing future contracts.  Section 4 is designed specifically to protect the supplier and ensure easy and automatic access for him or her to entitlements under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also stipulates when payment shall be taken to have been made by the purchaser.  This shall be when the supplier has received the appropriate amount of cash, when the appropriate amount is credited to the supplier's account or when the purchaser enables the supplier to credit his or her account with the appropriate amount, for example, by means of a cheque which is subsequently honoured.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is designed to address circumstances in which incorrect or inadequate invoices are furnished by suppliers.  It is not uncommon for lengthy delays to occur while problems relating to invoices are resolved between the purchaser and supplier.  Therefore, the objective of this section is to speed up this process or, at least, ensure that any undue delay on the part of the purchaser in querying an invoice will not result in the supplier having to wait indefinitely for payment.  This section is intended to encourage the purchaser to raise any queries concerning the invoice with the supplier within ten days of receipt of the invoice. It provides that, where a purchaser returns an <Col N="87" /> invoice to a supplier within ten days of receipt because of its inadequacy or inaccuracy and, at the same time, gives the supplier a written statement identifying the defects that prevent payment being made, the interest penalty shall not accrue until ten days after the purchaser receives a corrected invoice or until the due payment date, whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>If the purchaser is late in returning the invoice to the supplier, the period of grace allowed for payment after receipt of the corrected invoice will be reduced by a corresponding number of days.</P>
    <P>Section 6 specifies that, when any payment which includes an interest payment is made, it must be accompanied by a notice stating the amount of the interest penalty included, the rate by which and the period for which the interest penalty was computed.  There is also provision to allow the Minister to prescribe that additional information must be provided if, in the light of experience, it transpires that further information would be useful to suppliers.  The purpose of section 6 is to ensure clarity and transparency in relation to interest payments.  It will enable the supplier to know exactly how much interest he or she is being paid, the rate used and the period involved. In the absence of such provision, it would be difficult for the supplier to ascertain whether or not he or she was receiving the correct entitlement.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the payment of invoices in the event of dispute.  Suppliers often complain that it is common practice for purchasers to withhold payment of an entire invoice if any of the goods or services covered by the invoice are in dispute.  They also contend that some disputes can be spurious and used as a delaying factor to postpone the date of payment.  To rectify this problem in a fair manner I am providing for the partial payment of invoices in cases of dispute.  The purchaser will not have to pay interest on amounts outstanding in respect of goods or services in dispute provided, first, the parties agree that the goods or services are genuinely in dispute or a court or arbitrator so decides and, second, the purchaser pays for the goods, if any, agreed or determined not to be in dispute.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the resolution of disputes. It gives suppliers the option of submitting disputes relating to the payment of an interest penalty to arbitration.  Suppliers are sometimes reluctant to pursue cases in the civil courts for a variety of reasons, and I considered that some other form of resolution mechanism should be open to them under the Bill.  Given the subject matter of this Bill, access to arbitration is particularly suitable.  It is important to note, however, that the decision on whether to refer a dispute to arbitration rests with the supplier.  It is still open to the supplier to bring a case to the civil courts if he or she would prefer that course of action.</P>
    <P>The section also provides for the appointment of an arbitrator who may be chosen by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, <Col N="88" /> may be appointed by the President of the Law Society or by any other person prescribed by the Minister.  The provision of the Arbitration Acts will apply to arbitration under this Bill but, if necessary in the light of experience, the Minister may modify the provisions of those Acts for the purposes of arbitration on prompt payments or set additional conditions in relation to the arbitration.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is designed to ensure that main contractors on public sector contracts pass on the benefits of being paid promptly to their subcontractors. The section applies where there is a written contract between a public sector body and a main contractor and where the main contractor then contracts, in writing, with other suppliers for the acquisition or supply of goods or services to be provided under the first contract with the public body.  The main contractor must agree a payment period with his suppliers which is at least as short as the payment period he has secured from the public body.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of section 9, as published, with which, on closer examination, I am less than satisfied.  The clause to which I refer is the provision which would allow the main contractor and his supplier to agree, in writing, to a longer payment period than would otherwise be permitted under the section.  It appears this would have left a loophole and I have, therefore, decided to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to close this off.</P>
    <P>While section 9 refers only to circumstances relating to written contracts, suppliers to main contractors also have the protection of the legislation where there are no written contracts.  By virtue of the definitions of &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; and &ldquo;prescribed payment date&rdquo; in section 1, a main contractor would be obliged, under section 4, to pay his suppliers within 45 days in the absence of a written contract.  The amendment I propose to introduce on Committee Stage will make this position clearer.</P>
    <P>Section 10(1) requires the Minister, by order, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, to fix the rate of interest penalty which will apply to late payments.  It also allows the Minister to amend such an order.  This provision will allow for flexibility so that fluctuations in interest rates in the market can be taken into account, as necessary, in setting the rate of interest penalty on late payments.</P>
    <P>Section 10(2) allows the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, to shorten the 45 day payment period specified in the definition of &ldquo;prescribed payment date&rdquo;.  It is my intention to monitor the operation of this legislation on an ongoing basis and this section will give me the power, if it is deemed necessary or desirable in the light of experience, to reduce the 45 day payment period at any stage.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a major safeguard against public sector bodies seeking unreasonably long payment periods in written contracts.  It gives the Minister the power to police the payment <Col N="89" /> practices of public bodies.  Where the Minister considers any public body is availing itself of credit terms that are unreasonable in the circumstances, the public body can be compelled, by order, to pay for all or some of its goods and services within 45 days.  For reasons of natural justice, the Minister will have to advise the public body of the grounds for believing that the credit terms are unreasonable and afford them an opportunity to respond.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is intended to ensure transparency in regard to payment practices by public bodies. It will require all bodies listed in the Schedule to disclose details of their payment practices.  Where the body is required, by statute, to publish an annual report, the report must include details of the payment practices in the period covered by the report.  Where a public body is not required to publish an annual report, it will have to submit an annual review of its payment practices to the Minister and the review shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister also has the power to specify the type of details which should be included in the annual reports and reviews.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides a further mechanism for ensuring compliance with the legislation.  It specifies that every auditor auditing the affairs of a body listed in the Schedule must report on whether that body has complied with the provisions of the Act.  This is in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Small Business which suggested that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be given a function in monitoring the payment performance of public bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with tax clearance certificates and withholding tax.  It makes it clear that the Act does not require the payment of an amount due to a supplier who has failed to comply with a request to provide a tax clearance certificate and it extends the time limit for payment where there are delays in furnishing such certificates.  The section also makes it clear that the legislation will not affect the power to deduct withholding tax from any payment to a supplier.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is a standard section empowering the Minister to make necessary regulations under the Act.  It also deals with the laying of orders and regulations before the Oireachtas.  Section 16 is also a standard provision dealing with the short title and commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents further evidence of this Government's ongoing commitment to improve the operating environment for small business. The legislative requirement on public sector bodies to pay their suppliers promptly, with the automatic entitlement of suppliers to interest on outstanding payments, are positive steps to improving cash flow for small business and to freeing management time to concentrate on the essential elements of their business.  In conjunction with the wide range of other improvements introduced by the Government, this Bill will ensure that small businesses will have the environment they need to grow and develop and to <Col N="90" /> expand their very significant employment creation potential.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.  I welcome the support for the legislation, particularly from the Fianna Fáil benches. They were keen to see this Bill and I am glad we had the opportunity to introduce it in this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his scant understanding of what we put forward. Almost seven months ago I presented during Private Members' time the Prompt Payments Bill, which included everything that is in this legislation. Two hundred days later the Minister has presented a straightforward cog of that Bill. While imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the Minister's failure to take on board my Bill or immediately introduce alternative legislation has cost small businesses more than £10 million in credit costs since November.  I am indebted to the Minister for giving me that figure, which I had estimated based on surveys carried out by the SFA and ISME.  The document, Payment Practices in the Public Sector, by Goodbody Economic Consultants, issued today by the Minister, states that suppliers of goods and services will benefit from an improved cashflow.  It also states that the maximum total benefit is estimated at £19.7 million per year.</P>
      <P>I accept it takes time to prepare legislation, but the Minister could have accepted the Fianna Fáil Bill.  I said at the time I was prepared to take amendments on board.  In latter times the Government has taken on board Bills on justice and other matters and accepted them in a spirit of co-operation.  That could have been done with the Bill I introduced, but the Minister adopted a small-minded approach to a practical proposition offered in a spirit of co-operation and flatly turned it down on the basis that he would introduce a Bill shortly after Christmas.  He then said it would be introduced before Easter and now, in the dying days of this Government, it is introduced so that the Minister can say he fulfilled his promise.  That lack of generosity of spirit and inaction cost £10 million.</P>
      <P>Were I in the Minister's position and he in mine and he produced a prompt payments Bill which was acceptable, I would take it on board in a spirit of generosity.  We do not need expensive new surveys to tell us that getting paid by the State sector is a never ending problem for businesses. ISME and SFA have produced their own surveys.  I am amused it has taken an eminent firm to prepare the document, about which I will be asking the cost, and it has taken seven months to produce the Bill which will benefit suppliers by £20 million.  It is amazing except that this Government has a strong liking for surveys, expensive publications and photographs of itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Slow up of payments causes serious cashflow problems and requires firms to extend overdraft facilities or engage in additional borrowing, estimated at up to £20 million per year in credit costs for small businesses.  The final paragraph from <Col N="91" /> Goodbody Economic Consultants reinforces what I said seven months ago.  It is an amazing feat that it has taken that expensive survey to make that statement.  The seven months lost because of the Minister's small-mindedness about an Opposition Bill resulted in a further unnecessary cost of £10 million for businesses in the half year.</P>
    <P>It is apparent the reasons given by the Minister for rejecting the Fianna Fáil Prompt Payments Bill in November were spurious.  His decision to reject our Bill was petty politics and he displayed an ungenerous spirit just because we had produced it.  As an Opposition party we have limited resources but our Bill fulfilled all the Oireachtas criteria and met the standards laid down by the Dáil for Private Members' Bills, otherwise it could not have been produced.  I say this because the Minister rubbished the Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
    <P>We said if the Minister wished to table amendments we would look at them in a spirit of co-operation. Given the onset of an election, it is amazing what can be done.  Had I produced this Bill a month ago I can safely say it would have been accepted.  However, the Minister and the Government parties persist in taking their own route.  One can only conclude the short-sightedness resulted from the dilatory approach to the problem of late payments exposed by our Bill. There were endless promises to introduce a Bill and the never ending delay prompted us to produce it.</P>
    <P>Some days before our Bill was produced, the Minister took the unusual step of having a press conference to announce he would have proposals for a Bill.  I suspect it was an effort to pre-empt what we would do.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has produced the Bill, even if it is two and a half years after the rainbow Government's promise in its programme for government to introduce such a Bill.  In many State organisations and Government Departments there was acute resistance to the Bill.  The Bill will be introduced and, with co-operation, passed but the Minister will not be around to see its implementation.</P>
    <P>Last November when he rejected the Fianna Fáil Bill, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, said &ldquo;no time would be lost&rdquo; in bringing his Bill to the House.  He promised to have it in the New Year, later he promised he would have it before Easter but it is now May and we have the Bill.  May is a good month for elections.</P>
    <P>If the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage next week, Fianna Fáil will propose a number of amendments, the first of which will that Telecom Éireann, Bus Éireann and Aer Lingus come immediately within the ambit of the Bill.  I do not understand why they are being left out.  I am flabbergasted. Telecom, by its own admission and its financial reports, even though it faces difficult times ahead, has made profits and is well able to pay its bills on time.  Likewise Bus Éireann and Aer Lingus have published flourishing financial reports.  I do not understand the reason they are <Col N="92" /> to be treated differently.  The Minister has proposed they should not come within the scope of the Bill for one year after the coming into force of the legislation.</P>
    <P>This afternoon the Minister said the date of implementation of the legislation would be 1 January 1998.  It is worth noting Telecom Éireann, Bus Éireann and Aer Lingus will not come within the scope of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Bill until 1 January 1999.  That is extraordinary. Does the Minister mean one year after the coming into force of the legislation or one year after the passing of the Bill?  Perhaps we will get some guidance on that matter.  One way or the other those companies should not be treated differently from any other State or semi-State body which owes people money.  It makes no sense whatsoever and indicates the Minister is bowing to pressure. The same rule should apply to all State bodies and there should be no two tier system.  Aer Lingus and Telecom, both major businesses, are reported to be in strong financial circumstances. I will be proposing that amendment and giving due notice of it and I hope it will be accepted. If it is not accepted, and the Bill goes through unamended because of the weight of numbers, when in Government we will propose an amendment immediately.</P>
    <P>Another amendment we will propose next week is a special court system that would allow for quick inexpensive and effective legal remedies for non-payment of commercial debts.  A prompt and simple system, similar to the small claims type court, would serve a useful purpose in relation to registering judgments for commercial debts up to £5,000.  This would include a programme similar to the consumers small claims procedure which operated before the small claims courts were established.</P>
    <P>Under the procedure, if respondents did not dispute a claim of non-payment within 30 days of receipt of a notice from the District or Circuit Court registrars, they would be held to have admitted to it.  The claimant could then proceed to obtain a judgment against the respondent.</P>
    <P>We will also propose an amendment to designate small businesses as consumers.  This would bring small businesses within the remit of many ombudspeople and would give them new avenues to overcome difficulties.  The Fianna Fáil legislation required all Government Departments and State agencies, more than 200 in total, to pay their bills on time.  Our Bill took up directly the recommendations of the task force on small businesses and required all public sector bodies to settle their bills by the last business day of the month following on the date of invoice.  This gave an average credit period of 45 days to public sector bodies.</P>
    <P>Under the Fianna Fáil legislation if the State body was late in paying its bills it would have to pay an additional 1.25 per cent per month interest on the late payments business.  The interest rate was identical to the Revenue Commissioners' penalty for late payment of corporation tax.  All <Col N="93" /> these proposals are copied directly into the Minister's Bill.  However, one proposal the Minister has not taken up is our proposal to involve the Ombudsman.  We believe he or some other officer of such standing can add a moral weight and authority to the process and ensure State bodies do not try to abuse their position in relation to payments.</P>
    <P>We had proposed to give the Ombudsman powers to enforce prompt payments by State bodies.  He would also have the power to name State bodies in his annual report for non-compliance with the legislation.  We also required senior executives in each State body to certify compliance with the Bill in their annual report and accounts.  That will be necessary because executives and various other people will try to dodge this Bill and keep people waiting.  Often people who are awaiting payment fear they will be discriminated against for further contracts if they complain about late payments.  Legislation can mean well but those giving the contracts can make their displeasure plainly felt by not giving further contracts to small firms who are already disadvantaged because they are waiting for payments. There will be undertones of disapproval because they have been bold enough to pursue their rights under this legislation, and they may find that orders will go elsewhere.  This matter must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister rejected the idea of an annual report from the chief executive on an organisation's pace of payments.  If the Minister felt there was a problem with the Ombudsman he could have given the power to somebody else.  Fianna Fáil provided that its Private Members' Bill would come into effect on 1 July 1997 for every State body.  That date was based on the assumption that the Bill would not be passed for some time as it was a Private Member's Bill and we wished to be reasonable.  We did not want the Minister to reject it.  Whatever time gap there might have been between the passing of the Bill and that date could have been used by State bodies to prepare for its introduction.  Had the Minister wanted the provisions to come into effect sooner he could have proposed an amendment to our Bill which we would have accepted gladly. However, in effect he wants it to come into effect much later.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have worked with us immediately to tackle the late payments problem. Our Bill was prepared following consultation with the business community and our legal advisers.  I am interested to know why the Minister is to give a one year derogation to bodies such as Telecom Éireann.  I fail to understand the need for this.</P>
    <P>Late payment is a serious issue and should have been addressed long ago.  The small business task force noted that late payment causes serious cash flow problems and requires firms to extend overdraft facilities or to engage in additional borrowing. The problem consumes vast amounts of scarce management time in chasing payments. <Col N="94" /> The first task each day for many small firms is to list those whom they have to ring in attempting to extract payment and the firms tell me that in many cases it is like getting blood from a stone. When they could be seeking new business or dealing with research or personnel matters they must spend time seeking payment of bills.  When they ring up large firms they suffer the indignity of being shunted from one person to another or are told the cheque is in the post.</P>
    <P>Irish payment periods are among the worst in Europe and State bodies are among the worst offenders.  Departments, local authorities, vocational education committees and health sector bodies have poor payment performances.  The task force on small businesses came up with all the information which is in Goodbody survey. Fianna Fáil believes the public sector should have an exemplary record in paying its accounts on time.  The State's firms should lead by example and this would have a significant knock-on effect. At present the State takes many actions to support enterprise but it is contradictory for the State to assist small businesses through industrial policy interventions while the payment practices of State bodies smother the development of small businesses.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill followed a number of initiatives taken previously when Deputy Séamus Brennan chaired the task force on small businesses as Minister of State with responsibility for commerce and technology.  That task force made a number of significant recommendations, some of which have been implemented, although the pace of implementation is very slow.  The Private Members' Bill was not Fianna Fáil's first initiative in the area of prompt payments.  In 1994, the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who was then Minister for Finance, allocated £100 million to restructure the finances of the health sector bodies.  At that time they were among the worst offenders in withholding payments from suppliers, small businesses in particular.  Unfortunately, health bodies have slipped back into their bad ways in this regard.  The Fianna Fáil Bill made no exceptions for any State bodies.  It included every Department, health board, harbour authority, local authority, vocational education committee, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the ACC, BIM, Bord Gáis, Bord na Móna, CIE, ESB, RTÉ and the VHI.</P>
    <P>We undertook to continue to review this matter as it applies in the private sector and I note the Minister today echoed that commitment.  A code of practice was introduced, but I do not know how well that is operating and seven months after the Fianna Fáil Bill this Bill has been introduced.  Once this Bill has been in operation for some time we should examine the practices in the private sector.  I understand there are provisions in this regard in Germany for the private sector.</P>
    <P>We intend to propose amendments to provide for a special court system to allow for quick, inexpensive and effective legal remedies for non-payment <Col N="95" /> of commercial debts.  A prompt and simple system, similar to the Small Claims Court, would serve a useful purpose in registering judgments for commercial debts up to £5,000.  The Minister has proposed arbitration.  We also propose a procedure similar to the pilot consumer small claims procedure in operation before the Small Claims Court was established.  If respondents did not dispute a claim within 30 days they would be held to have admitted it.</P>
    <P>All Government contracts should contain a clause requiring main contractors to pay their subcontractors in accordance with the payment terms of the Bill.  Ireland's Presidency of the EU should have been used to have small businesses designated as consumers.  That did not happen and we will table amendments on that point.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has proposed many measures in this area.  In addition to the Private Members' Bill we have brought out a policy document on rewarding risk takers and we are planning radical reform of the agency structures which provide enterprise advice to small businesses.  I accept that Fianna Fáil was responsible for introducing the country enterprise boards as a response to the EU bottom up approach to making funds available. However, the system has gone too far.  For example, there are about 140 agencies to promote enterprise in Cork city and county alone.  It is like a jigsaw puzzle without a solution.  I am sure all the agencies do their best, but the consumers of their services must go to all the agencies for fear of missing out on funds or advice.</P>
    <P>The IDA, Forbairt, county enterprise boards, area partnerships, Leader groups, county councils' development groups, self-help groups, advice groups or innovation centres are all admirable but confusing.  The message I have received from around the country is that those planning a business or expanding their business must go to many agencies to establish the level of assistance available. Confusion is caused and time is wasted. Fianna Fáil proposes that in every county there should be one body for enterprise information. We also propose that there should be one body providing support to small businesses, rather than the current jigsaw of agencies.</P>
    <P>I will support this Bill, which is copied from the Bill I introduced to the House last November and which the Minister refused in a niggardly, small minded and ungenerous way, to accept costing small businesses £10 million in the intervening period.  That is not a wild summation on my part but is based on the figure given in the Goodbody survey commissioned by the Minister on payment practices in the public service &mdash; £19.7 million in a year and the intervening period is half of that which would have cost about £10 million.  That shows the mean spirit in which this was approached.  I know enough about the Minister's character to know that, either on his own initiative or on the advice of his Department, he will refuse to accept some of the important amendments I will table on Committee Stage in a cooperative <Col N="96" /> spirit.  I would be very surprised if he agrees to them, the most important of which will seek to ensure that large bodies such as Aer Rianta, Telecom Éireann and Bus Éireann will not be exempt when the Bill comes into force on 1 January next.  I will be proposing that they should come within its remit.  I am glad to support it in that spirit and look forward to the production and reception of the amendments to which I have referred next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the general principle of the Bill which is a welcome one, that is, that the State will pay interest where it or any of its affiliate bodies or bodies performing public functions or substantially reliant on public funding fail in their duty to pay for goods and services by the prescribed date.  There are, however, a number of features which could be improved.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy with the provisions of section 2. I fail to see why the Bill shall apply only to and in relation to goods and services supplied on or after the commencement of the Bill, in other words, outstanding bills will not be covered.  I fail to see why that should be so, especially since we have been given a timeframe for its introduction. It would be better to state that the Bill shall apply to and in relation to goods and services supplied on or after the passing of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that orders made under section 3 should be laid before the House and positively approved.  The Minister should not have the power to remove the name of a person or body from the Schedule, temporarily or permanently, by means of a statutory instrument.  It would be unfair on those who deal with public bodies, that by a stroke of the Minister's pen the bodies concerned can be exempted from the provisions of the Bill without any recourse.  If, for whatever reason, the public company to which I am supplying goods can persuade the Minister to exempt it by removing its name from the Schedule, I am entitled to be heard or, at the very least, the Minister should explain in the House why its name is being removed.  There should, therefore, be a positive mandate from the House for the inclusion or exclusion of bodies from the Schedule.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 4 which deal with the position of the Minister in determining the rate of interest payable where payment is not made by the prescribed date are unsatisfactory.  The rate of interest payable should be laid down in statute and it must, for commercial reasons, be capable of being revised from time to time.  Any revision should be subject to a positive mandate from this House, in other words, the House should be consulted where the Minister proposes to change the figure from 1.25 per cent per month to 0.75 per cent per month so that the implications are known.  It should not be done as a cost saving measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some misgivings about the provisions of section 5.  Will the exercise of the power of a purchaser to return an invoice for clarification be subject to the provisions of section 8 which deals with arbitration?  I would be worried if it is not. <Col N="97" /> It might become routine policy in certain Departments to fling back every invoice, with a standard nuisance &ldquo;get up your nose&rdquo; letter, in prevarication to the supplier.  Where it is later found that sufficient or adequate information was supplied to the purchaser, it would be better if it was deemed that the clock was running all the time.  I know the way Departments work and that the easiest thing for somebody who will be held accountable for the non-payment of an account to do is to send a Xerox letter stating the Minister or the secretary of the company cannot accept X, Y or Z and requires full details before payment can be made.  Where the provisions of section 5 are improperly or unnecessarily invoked, it should be deemed that the clock was running all the time.</P>
    <P>I accept that the necessary information should accompany payment.  The provisions of section 6 in this regard are reasonable.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, there is considerable doubt as to whether interest payable under the provisions of the Bill will be taxable in the hands of the recipient.  There is not much advantage in receiving interest payments if they are regarded as taxable income.  I know from professional experience in the courts that there is considerable doubt as to whether interest paid by the Revenue Commissioners on repayment of tax is subject to tax.  If it is, it clearly affects its value.  If I supply my services to the Director of Public Prosecutions and he delays in making payment &mdash; in fairness to the Director of Public Prosecutions, he is prompt in paying barristers &mdash; it would be unfair if the 3 per cent, 5 per cent or 10 per cent payable in interest was regarded as income, taxable at 48 per cent.  In effect, it amounts to compensation for a wrongful act on the part of the State.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification as to whether the arbitration procedure provided for in section 8 is contemplated as being one which will apply in determining whether the provisions of section 5 were properly invoked.  I agree fully with the provisions of section 9 which deal with the question of prompt payment to subcontractors.</P>
    <P>Section 10 states that the Minister shall fix the rate of interest penalty payable.  It should be borne in mind that it is a penalty.  I query, therefore, whether the State should claw back half of it in tax.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 the Minister and the Minister for Finance will play a supervisory role to prohibit or prevent a purchaser from setting out terms which, in the last analysis, are unfair or unreasonable.  I agree with Deputy O'Rourke that it would be better for a neutral person such as the Ombudsman or Director of Consumer Affairs who is conversant with commercial practice but who is not worried about the Exchequer implications to decide whether the terms offered by a purchaser are reasonable.  The Restrictive Practices Groceries Order which is still in operation requires payment in certain circumstances <Col N="98" /> by suppliers.  Non-payment in accordance with those terms can lead to court action and injunctions. It might be better if this issue was decided by a more objective body or person.</P>
    <P>I have no problems with sections 12 and 13. On section 14, I do not mind the tax clearance certificate system but it is important to make some points in regard to it.  It is a bit rich for this House to require a vast number of suppliers and companies to have tax clearance certificates but not to impose a tax clearance certification system on aspirant Members of the House.  We are great at giving it but not good at taking it.  We tell others they must comply with the tax law, that they cannot deal with certain companies and must be able to produce a tax clearance certificate, but none of us had to produce a tax clearance certificate before we entered Leinster House.  I wonder how fair that is.</P>
    <P>I hope this will not give rise to a situation where a letter asking for a tax clearance certificate is taken out of the bottom drawer by every semi-State and public body threatened with the interest penalty payment.  It is not good enough for companies to allow the matter to drag on for a while before sending a letter in red ink which asks, &ldquo;where is your tax clearance certificate, the clock is stopped&rdquo;.  Section 14(2) provides that if the certificate is not produced within seven days the clock will be stopped until it is produced.  The clock should not be stopped in respect of the period during which one fails to produce the certificate. If the supplier produces the certificate three weeks or one month later they should be entitled to their money.  The idea that the clock stops and cannot be retrospectively deemed to have started again seems unfair.</P>
    <P>A supplier of goods who finds it difficult to get a tax clearance certificate for whatever reason and convinces the inspector of taxes that everything is up to date should be entitled as of right to the money he would have been due if the request for the tax clearance certificate had not been furnished to him.  One cannot have it both ways.  A supplier who has dealt in good faith with a semi-State or public body who receives an annoying letter which says, &ldquo;produce a tax clearance certificate&rdquo; will have to ask his accountant to ring the Revenue Commissioners in, say, Limerick for the certificate.  If it takes a month for him to receive the certificate then he is entitled retrospectively to be regarded as somebody who is entitled to receive his money on time.</P>
    <P>We live in the real world and people must get on with their lives.  If, say, the Patents Office sends a supplier a letter which states, &ldquo;In regard to the envelopes you supplied to us last month and for which we have not paid you, will you provide a tax clearance certificate?&rdquo; this can be a serious imposition for a busy businessman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to outline my difficulty in obtaining details of waiting lists up to the end of March.  The inadequate replies to my parliamentary questions on this matter gave me no option but to raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Five weeks ago I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health in which I asked for the hospital waiting lists to the end of March. The Minister said that they would be circulated to me shortly.  When I did not receive the details by 20 April I tabled another parliamentary question in which I asked the Minister why the hospital waiting lists to the end of March were not available in view of the advances in technology. On 22 April the Minister replied to my question by giving endless excuses and effectively blaming the consultants for the delay.  He added that a significant proportion of the information on the waiting list figures was compiled and validated manually.  He again promised to provide the lists as soon as they became available.</P>
      <P>I have still not received the lists two weeks later.  I believe the lists are being withheld because the figures are bad.  When the figures are good the lists seem to be published much quicker. Hospital waiting lists are obviously out of control. In December 1994 when the rainbow coalition took office there were 23,700 people on the waiting lists.  This figure had been reduced from more than 40,000 through intensive action and an investment of £30 million by the previous Government.  This progress has not been maintained by the coalition Government.  Only £20 million has been spent in the past two years, and this has not even been sufficient to maintain the number on the waiting lists at 23,700.  At one stage the number had increased by almost one-third or 32 per cent to 31,519.  Even though the figure was reduced to 26,000 in December this was still an increase of 2,300 on the 1994 figure. The figures to the end of March are likely to have increased again due to the cancellation of procedures during the nurses' dispute and the ongoing chaos in hospitals.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to give an undertaking to publish the lists before the end of the weekend. Otherwise people will draw their own conclusions. If the Minister continues to refuse to publish the lists he will be yet another Minister to make a sham of the Government's claim to be open, transparent and accountable and will join the list from the Taoiseach down of Ministers who have been economical with the truth.  Until such time as I receive the lists I will continue to press the Minister to publish them.  I look forward to the Minister of State giving me the figures this evening.  If he does not I ask him to give an undertaking that they will be sent to me before the weekend is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Between the end of 1994 and the end of 1996 the Government provided £20 million for the reduction of waiting lists for hospital treatment. More than 38,000 people have benefited from this funding.</P>
      <P>When the waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993 there were 40,130 people on waiting lists for hospital treatment.  During the three year period to the end of June 1996 this figure was reduced by 9,683 or 24 per cent.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, provided additional funding in 1996 for this area to ensure that waiting lists did not continue to rise during the remainder of that year.</P>
      <P>The waiting list figures up to the end of March have recently become available but they require detailed validation and analysis, which is currently being carried out by the Department. When this analysis has been completed I will let the Deputy have the information, by specialty, within a week.</P>
      <P>The Minister has set aside a further £8 million in 1997 to continue the work of reducing waiting lists.  This funding will be targeted at areas where waiting times for surgery are excessively long. Special attention will again be paid to reducing the waiting times for cardiac surgery, including heart by-pass operations.  This represents significant progress in reducing the waiting lists and demonstrates the Government's concern that the necessary resources are provided to improve waiting times for treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise the position of the Bell Lines Freight Group creditors on the Adjournment, and I thank the Minister for attending to reply to a matter which is of considerable interest and importance in my constituency.  The Bell Lines Freight Group is currently under examinership and, while I realise the Minister is not answerable in this House for the examiner, I am extremely concerned about the position of small road hauliers who have worked exclusively for this company.  These hauliers are being offered settlement figures ranging from 25 per cent to 35 per cent, while larger creditors of the company, according to information supplied to me, are being offered settlements of 100 per cent.  That represents discrimination against the smaller creditors who are mainly small hauliers who live and work in my constituency of South Tipperary in the Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir areas.  They will face financial ruin unless something is done by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider amending the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 to cater for these people who have worked exclusively for this company.  These people worked solely for the company.  If this happened to other ordinary employees in the company, they would be immediately covered by <Col N="101" /> the 1984 Act which has been used previously in regard to the tanneries in Carrick-on-Suir and the Ballingarry Mines in Ballingarry and that area of Slieveardagh.  We have experience of the benefits of this Act which empowers the State to compensate employees for loss of earnings, loss of entitlements, holiday pay or whatever else might be due to them from an employer who becomes insolvent. I hope the Minister will examine this Act with a view to making it applicable to these small road hauliers who worked exclusively for Bell Lines up to the time it went into examinership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ferris for raising this issue.  I have every sympathy with the plight of the employees as described by the Deputy in his contribution.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 already goes beyond what we are required to do under the relevant EU directive, and provides for a wider category of wage related debts to be covered where the employer is insolvent.  I have already carefully examined whether this law needs to be amended to cover a wider number of circumstances where an employer has gone out of business, in the light of the concerns expressed by Deputy Ferris on behalf of workers caught by these situations. However, this examination to date suggests that such a widening might cause even greater problems than it would solve in that companies could be tempted to trade recklessly or to avoid paying their workers in the certainty that the Exchequer, through the Insolvency Fund, would pick up the tab.  I am carefully examining the possibility of strengthening the law on enforcement of the statutory orders made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, particularly in the so-called Phoenix syndrome, and I will be consulting with the social partners on the options open in this area.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 confers certain rights and protection to employees in situations where their employer becomes insolvent for the purpose of the Act.  These situations are defined in the Act and include liquidation, receivership, petitions to the High Court to wind up a company, resolutions made within company law procedures to wind up a company, bankruptcy, deceased employers being insolvent and the estate being administered within the terms of the Succession Act, 1965.  This company is not insolvent for the purpose of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of debts payable to employees whose contracts of employment are terminated in the circumstances outlined above include debts which are all pay related.  They include arrears of wages, sick pay and holiday pay outstanding at the time of insolvency, compensation which may be awarded in respect of minimum notice, awards or orders made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the courts in regard to unfair and/or wrongful dismissal, awards covering equal pay <Col N="102" /> matters and maternity or adoptive leave awards. The amounts payable are subject to statutory time provisions and other limits and are subject to an overall gross weekly amount of £300 where a weekly amount applies.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Act enacts the provisions of a 1980 EU Council directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  This directive promotes the social provisions advocated within the terms of Article 117 of the EC Treaty where member states agree on the need to promote improved working conditions for workers and to harmonise conditions where the improvement is being maintained.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Act and the insolvency payments scheme are the vehicles through which the provisions and specific objectives of the directive are administered in Irish law.  In fact, the scheme goes beyond the catalogue of debts to which the directive applies but maintains the criteria of covering outstanding pay related debts as intended.  It is financed from the Social Insurance Fund, again within the criteria of the directive and Article 117.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Act and the insolvency payments scheme act as a safety net for employees and allows them receive speedy payment in respect of their outstanding pay related debts; the other creditors are dealt with within the framework of company law legislation and in an examinership, within the terms of whatever proposals that may be agreed before the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment, and I thank the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for coming into the House to reply to the debate.  I want to ask the Minister the action, if any, he is taking to prevent the loss of 320 jobs at Asahi in Killala, County Mayo, one of the largest employers in the west, and if he will make a statement on the matter.  I share the sense of concern that exists throughout the west in regard to affairs at Asahi, about which we knew nothing until we read the dramatic account today in one of the daily newspapers.  I listened with interest to one of the SIPTU officials on radio at lunch time when he said that last February he and his colleagues, realising that there were difficulties and wishing to act in a spirit of co-operation, engaged in talks with management, but that they knew nothing of the current situation until they read about it in the papers this morning.  He said that they had a meeting arranged for 21 May. That date seems far away in the context of today's crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When did the Minister first become aware of the difficulties at the Asahi plant in Killala, County Mayo, and internationally?  Can he account for the actions taken since?  Does the <Col N="103" /> Minister intend to intervene directly by, for instance, going to Japan to meet senior management there?  Has the relevant section within the Department of Enterprise and Employment been monitoring the difficulties and what action has been taken?</P>
    <P>I know it was out of the hands of the Chair, but I would have preferred a Private Notice Question, which I had originally tabled, because of the chance it affords for debate and for questions and answers.  This is not possible here.  All I can do is pose the question and listen to the Minister read his script.  I want to know whether the early warning system came into play in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>Asahi has a fine record.  It has a long history in Mayo, locating there first in the 1970s and at one stage employing 750, now down to 320.  It has been the centrepiece for employment in Mayo and no effort must be spared in ensuring that employment continues, given the spin-off from it, the fine employment given in it and the commitment of the workers.  Today Mr. Noel Kilfeather, the SIPTU official, said quite clearly that they wanted to do what any other committed group of employees would wish to do in the circumstances and try to overcome the difficulties.  He was forthright in saying that they would do what was necessary.</P>
    <P>There are 3,000 people signing on the live register in Ballina each week while a 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory lies idle and the promise of APC for Castlebar and Protea Pine for Claremorris remain just a promise.  There is also worry over the Bellacorrig peat jobs.  When I was at a Claremorris Chamber of Commerce dinner as a guest speaker all those matters were put to me very forcefully.  Much attention has been paid to Knock Airport by the Minister for Tourism and Trade who is from that area.  I wonder now whether those frantic disclosures of his, which were nebulous and insubstantial, were made to minimise the news about Asahi.  The Minister expends frantic energy as he moves from town to town and from county to county, but not to Mayo, announcing new jobs, all of which are, in the main, pitched at eight, ten and 12 years hence. The reiteration of these announcements is aimed at overcoming the population.  In the most recent poll, jobs remain the huge preoccupation of people.  I am convinced that they do not believe the glitzy announcements and feel they are empty promises.  They are rainbow promises, and we know what happens on the other side of the rainbow, a false dawn which never emerges.</P>
    <P>To return to Asahi, I wish to be as helpful as I can in the circumstances.  It seems that at this time of trembling at the door of a general election the Government would seek to facilitate Asahi and save the jobs by reassuring the parent plant or by way of a management buyout.  I want to see this happen because Asahi was a proud beacon for employment in north Mayo for many years.  It would be sad if something happened to that plant, given that the workers are committed to saving <Col N="104" /> the 320 jobs there.  I want to see their commitment matched by ministerial commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I too share the concerns for the future of the Asahi plant in Killala and its 320-strong workforce. Those concerns are shared by many on this side of the House, including the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Deputy Kenny, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, Deputy Ring and Councillor Caffrey who represents the Ballina-Killala area.</P>
      <P>I confirm that discussions have been ongoing between Asahi and Forbairt and IDA Ireland for many months in an effort to safeguard the company's future in Ireland.  As Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I have taken a personal interest in this matter for a long period. Asahi has incurred significant losses over 20 years in Ireland due to difficult market conditions.  In this context the Asahi parent company in Japan is examining its world-wide operations.  Therefore, the future of the Killala plant has been the subject of close scrutiny.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every possible effort has been and will continue to be made by me and the development agencies with a view to ensuring that the Killala plant remains in operation. Because of my deep concern for the future of the Mayo plant, I sought a meeting with senior management from the Asahi Japanese parent company. I met a delegation from the company on Tuesday last and expressed the Government's concern in this regard.  Asahi has been a very good employer for the Ballina region for 20 years, and I want to ensure that every possible option is explored to allow this employment to continue.</P>
      <P>Arising from this meeting the agencies under my remit, Forbairt and IDA Ireland have been in further intensive, difficult and complex discussions with both local and parent company management.  These discussions have just concluded within the past few hours with a very positive outlook for the future.  In this context, I am pleased to report that the development agencies and Asahi are working together on proposals with a view to putting them to the respective boards in approximately one month's time.</P>
      <P>I am very encouraged by these significant developments for the future of the Killala plant. This is undoubtedly a very important plant, very strategic to the Ballina area.  I assure the Deputy that the agencies and I will leave no stone unturned in pursuing this matter vigorously.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I would like the Minister for Defence to clarify the subject matter of his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 7 on 29 April 1997 concerning recruitment to the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> My difficulty is not with the direct reply but with replies to a supplementary question I asked later.  On that occasion I stated:</P>
    <P>On 5 March 1996 the Government stated that the savings achieved through the reorganisation of the Defence Forces would be divided between the Department of Finance and the Department of Defence, on a basis to be agreed between the Ministers in those Departments. That decision was to be made within a month, but no decision has yet been made. That, more than anything else, shows the lack of commitment by the Government to reorganise the Defence Forces and is seen by most people in the Defence Forces as nothing but a cost cutting exercise.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Deputy is talking about savings but, as everybody in the Defence Forces is aware, they will not accrue for four years.  No commitment was given that the savings would be divided and a decision made after a month.</P>
    <P>A letter from the Government secretary, Frank Murray, in the Department of the Taoiseach dated 5 March 1996 states:</P>
    <P>I am to refer to the Memorandum, reference P364, dated 28 February 1996 submitted by the Minister for Defence concerning the implementation plan for phase one of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces and to inform you that at a meeting held today the Government (i) approved the draft implementation plan attached as Appendix A to the Memorandum to be effected over three years.</P>
    <P>The letter also outlines the terms of the voluntary early retirement scheme for members of the Defence Forces and goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed (a) that savings achieved through the reorganisation plan would be divided between the Exchequer and the Department of Defence on a basis to be agreed between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence and (b) that the Minister for Defence would report to the Government by <i>aide memoir</i> within one month on the outcome of his discussions in this regard with the Minister for Finance and that the Interdepartmental Committee on National Security would give further consideration to the position in relation to the Military Police Company at Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>I outlined the current position in the House last week, but the Minister disagreed with me.  I accept that even good plans must be changed occasionally, but the commitment given early in 1996 has been reneged on.  The large number of hearing claims being presented to the Minister for Defence will place great demands on the Exchequer.  Following the fresh look of the Department of Finance at its expenditure on Defence matters I am concerned the promises <Col N="106" /> made will not be adhered to.  This is unfortunate at a time when we are trying to reorganise the Defence Forces.  We have asked them to make sacrifices and put in place a voluntary early retirement scheme, but unless that is matched with expenditure on equipment and infrastructure the reorganisation will fall asunder.  I hope the Minister considers the matter with the seriousness it deserves.</P>

      <P>When I received notice of the Deputy's request to raise this matter on the Adjournment I was confused as to what he was referring.  I note from the blacks of yesterday's Order of Business that I was accused of misleading the Dáil.  I did not intend to do that.  I also have a copy of the Government decision to which the Deputy referred and there is no conflict in what I said and what is happening. The Government decision states that the savings achieved through the reorganisation plan will be divided between the Exchequer and the Department of Defence on a basis to be agreed between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence.  When I said in reply to a supplementary question from the Deputy that &ldquo;no commitment was given that the savings would be divided and a decision made after a month&rdquo;, I understood the Deputy thought the savings would be divided on a 50:50 basis.  That is not what the Government's decision states.  It states they will be divided on a basis to be agreed between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>No commitment was given that the savings would be divided.  The Deputy said a decision was to be made within a month, but in May 1997 a decision had not been made.  The Government decision requires me to enter negotiations with the Minister for Finance to find an equitable solution to the division of savings which will not accrue until 1999.  We will not know the exact split until nearer 1999.  I am negotiating the best deal possible for the Department of Defence for the period after 1999.  When the Deputy referred to a period of a month I understood him to believe a decision would be made within a month of the Government decision.  That is not the position.  When I have reached agreement with the Minister for Finance I am obliged to report back to Government within one month on that agreement so that the Government as a body can confirm the decision.  I understood from the Deputy's supplementary that he believed I was required to finalise a decision within a month of the Government decision being taken.</P>

      <P>There is a commitment.  Discussions are ongoing and the precise details are being worked out between the Departments of Defence and Finance.  I am obliged to report back to Government within one month of a final decision being taken so that the Government as a body can confirm that agreement.  There is no question of not following that commitment or of not conforming with the Government decision taken on 28 February 1996.  The misunderstanding may relate to the interpretation of the Government decision.  I am having ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance in an effort to achieve an equitable division of the savings that will accrue after 1999.</P>
      <P>In the meantime ongoing investment is taking place in the Defence Forces.  I can give the Deputy some facts and figures in that regard.  The Government's commitment to continue its programme of major investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces has been proven.  In the three years 1995-7 no less than £29 million was provided in infrastructural investment in military barracks generally.  A further indicator of the Government's commitment is that an additional £46 million has been provided in the two years 1996-7 to fund a voluntary early retirement scheme.  That is a clear indication the Government does not regard the implementation plan as a mere cost cutting exercise.  I am glad to have this opportunity to state there is ongoing investment in the Defence Forces.  A sum of £29 million has been spent in a short period and that will continue.</P>
      <P>On the savings that will accrue after 1999, I will conform with the decision taken by the Cabinet in February 1996 and will report back to it within one month of the final decision being taken by the Department of Finance and me.</P>

      <P>A final decision has not been taken because there is a question which must be decided.

It is a question of whether part of the savings should go towards the repayment of the £75 million for a stated period and after that I would like if the Defence Forces could look forward to getting 100 per cent of the savings.  That is the sort of discussion taking place and the line I would like the military authorities to pursue.  It is not a simple question of dividing the savings 50:50 or 60:40.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities deals extensively with the inequality experienced on a daily basis by people with disabilities and their families and carers.  It presents a picture of a society which excludes people with disabilities from almost every aspect of economic, social, political and cultural life.  The Commission made 402 recommendations, including addressing the need to improve services for people with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>I have established an interdepartmental task force to draw up a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report.  The task force is chaired by my Department and is scheduled to submit its plan of action to Government around mid-year.  On 18 April 1997, I formally established a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the Commissions's recommendations.  The monitoring committee is representative of people with disabilities, their families and carers and service providers, as well as the social partners and Government Departments. I eagerly await the results of their deliberations and in particular with regard to those people with disabilities who are considered to be particularly vulnerable.  In this regard, I refer the Deputy to Chapter 23 of the report.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations of the Commission was a proposal to establish a permanent council to represent people with disabilities.  On 11 March, the Interim Council, now known as the Irish Council of People with Disabilities, was launched, I was anxious that the council should be established on the firmest footing.  On this basis, in addition to the £100,000 provided for it in the Estimates for my Department for 1997, I was able to secure an additional £200,000 in this year's budget, giving the council a total allocation of £300,000 in respect of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another initiative I have taken which promotes equal opportunities for people with disabilities is the establishment of pilot community development projects.  In the course of the &ldquo;Listening Meetings&rdquo; held by the Commission, people expressed a great deal of frustration with the unavailability of information.  In the light of these difficulties, I have provided funding for setting up three pilot community development projects for people with disabilities in Cork, Clare and Tallaght-Clondalkin. <Col N="110" /> The main aims of these projects are to facilitate access at a local level by people with disabilities, including those living in residential settings, to all information, to include details of the range of services available, in appropriate formats, on the issues affecting their lives; and to facilitate participation by people with disabilities in local area partnerships or other community fora and thus empower them to influence the decision-making process and play an active part in the life of their community.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Bill, which I introduced and is currently before the Supreme Court, seeks to provide protection from discrimination in the workplace for a number of groups, including people with disabilities.  The Equal Status Bill, which I also introduced, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 29 April and has also been referred by the President to the Supreme Court for a decision as to whether it is repugnant to the Constitution. This draft legislation seeks to provide, for the first time, protection against discrimination outside the field of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the availability of child care is a major influence in enabling parents with family responsibilities participate in the workforce.  The type of child care arrangements <Col N="111" /> most appropriate to the different circumstances of children and families is, in the first instance, the responsibility of parents to decide.  However, the Government is committed to the stimulation and development of such facilities by employers, parents and community interests and would like to see increasing availability of child care facilities across the community, whether work-based or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The provision of child care facilities, as a means of ensuring equality of opportunity in the workplace, is a matter appropriate for attention in the context of collective bargaining.  Partnership 2000, the new national agreement between Government, the social partners and community interests, provides for the establishment of an expert working group, to be chaired by my Department, to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector.</P>
      <P>Women currently comprise over one third of the labour force.  This participation is increasing as many more women are remaining in the workforce after marriage, thereby causing a continuing increase in the demand for quality child care.  In many cases, the availability of child care is a crucial factor to their participation.  However, the necessary child care facilities are not yet sufficiently widely available and my Department will continue to promote the adoption of family friendly arrangements in the workplace, which have been shown to be beneficial both to businesses as well as employees.</P>
      <P>The success of the Pilot Childcare Initiative, as borne out in the report of the independent evaluator of the initiative, is an example of what can be achieved when provision is made to cater for the child care needs of a community.  My Department is responsible for funding the pilot Childcare Initiative, which commenced in 1994 and has continued in each subsequent year, including this year.  The scheme is intended to assist the initiation of projects for the establishment, on a pilot basis, of child care measures utilising the skills of trained local people, to enable local residents to undertake education, training, retraining and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to do, in the absence of a child care facility.  It is a condition of the scheme that grants are confined to groups in disadvantaged areas.  For this purpose, it has been agreed that these be defined as areas in which there are area based partnerships/local community groups currently in receipt of funds from the global grant for local development.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Manager (ADM Limited) which is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area partnership companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, 141 projects have been approved for funding in three tranches.  In the initial period <Col N="112" /> encompassing 1994 and 1995, a total of 73 projects were approved, a further 36 were approved in 1996 and 32 in 1997.  A total of £2,359,000 was made available to fund these projects.</P>
    <P>During the course of 1996, I arranged to have the initiative evaluated by an independent evaluator. The evaluation was in respect of the 73 projects in the initial tranche.  I will confine my comments on the report to a small number of the more significant conclusions contained therein.</P>
    <P>Projects aided under the initiative were able to generate, on average, an additional £1.33 from other sources, for each £1.00 allocated under the initiative.  The report estimates that the number of children being cared for by projects assisted under the initiative has more than doubled, from 1,679 before funding to 3,650 after funding, i.e, an increase of 1,971 children.  While more than half of the projects, 65 per cent cater for pre-school children only, the proportion of project making provision for school-going children has nearly doubled since the commencement of the initiative and now accounts for more than a third, 35 per cent of all projects.</P>
    <P>Staffing ratios in child care projects aided under the initiative, particularly in the case of children under one year, have improved considerably since funding from the initiative was made available.  The vast majority of projects now meet the Department of Health's recommended staffing ratios in each age category.  The employment potential of assisted child care projects was highlighted by the report.  It estimated that the total number of persons working in all 73 projects funded by the initiative increased by 90 per cent from 349 before funding to 663 after funding.  The average number of people working in each participating child care project increased from 4.7 to 9.0.</P>
    <P>Of particular significance is the finding that the majority, 66 per cent of mothers of children being cared for by projects funded by the initiative are involved, mainly on a part time basis, in some activity outside the home, notably paid employment, 22 per cent education and training courses, 24 per cent community employment, 16 per cent and other 4 per cent.  It is worth nothing that, in a minority of cases, as well as promoting labour market integration and the uptake of courses, the projects are supporting families under stress where the child is referred, and paid for, by the local health board.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these fundings that the initiative has been instrumental in bringing about a radical transformation in the child care projects which benefited from its funding and in the related communities.</P>
    <P>The evaluator's report, which was launched on 7 February 1997, is being studied in my Department. In due course I will determine the manner in which the Childcare Initiative can be best progressed, having regard to the material furnished in the report and the results of its consideration by my Department.</P>

In this context, I am, naturally, anxious to see better gender balance at senior levels in the Civil Service and every effort is and has been made to ensure that there are no barriers, hidden or otherwise, preventing women from progressing to the highest positions.  I believe that significant progress has been made in this direction.  A very welcome development has been the appointment in 1995 of the first woman secretary to a Department since 1959.  In addition, three women were appointed to assistant secretary level positions in 1995, two in 1996 and four in 1997 to date, bringing to 19 the number of women at and above assistant secretary level, compared with seven years ago.</P>

      <P>In general, <Col N="115" /> stamp duties are payable on documents such as deeds transferring property in order for the documents to have legal standing.  The yield to the Exchequer from stamp duty on property was over £190 million in 1996.  This revenue plays a very important role in shifting some of the burden of taxation from employment and it also makes a significant contribution towards the cost of implementing the Government's social and economic programme.</P>
      <P>The introduction of an exemption from stamp duty for property purchases by credit unions would reduce the yield from stamp duty and could be expected to lead to calls for similar exemption in respect of other organisations such as voluntary groups, sports clubs, trade unions, etc.  Accordingly, I do not favour granting such an exemption and I have no plans to exempt credit unions from paying stamp duty on property transfers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Following Government decisions of 20 February 1996 on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, the North-Eastern Health Board published <Col N="118" /> a detailed service plan in April 1996 aimed at combating the drug problem in the north-eastern area.  Included in this plan was the proposal for the establishment of rapid response teams.</P>
      <P>During 1996 my Department allocated £100,000 to the board to allow it to implement its service plan to address drug misuse.  This sum allowed for the establishment of a rapid response team and for the recruitment of five additional staff.  This team works mainly in the Drogheda-South Meath area.  The staff have been deployed to these areas because a significant drug misuse problem has been identified there.  The activities of the team are being monitored and evaluated by the health board before other teams are established.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, a further £60,000 has been allocated to the board in 1997 for continued expansion of its drugs services.  In addition to this, on foot of the First Ministerial Task Force Report on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs, an amount of £1 million is being made available to health boards outside Dublin for the further development of services.  Health boards will be notified shortly of their individual allocations from this.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the Ballinasloe area, County Galway, is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £12 million has been provided in 1997 for services to persons with a mental handicap; £2 million is being used to meet identified needs in existing services.  The remaining £10 million is being used to put in place new services, including additional residential, respite and day care places.</P>
      <P>Recently I approved an allocation of £850,000 to the Western Health Board for the provision of new residential, respite and day care places in 1997.  Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Western Health Board region have been agreed by the regional mental handicap coordinating committee in line with the priority needs which were identified for the region.  My Department is currently examining those proposals which I understand include provision for additional day and residential services in the Ballinasloe area.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities identified six areas requiring prompt attention with regard to implementing its recommendations.  These relate to the establishing of a special programme for the replacement of existing sub-standard facilities being used by people with disabilities; funding for the Irish Council of People with Disabilities; revision of the EU Treaties; the shortage of sheltered work-places; the retention and resources of the Department of Equality and Law Reform and the accessibility of all new and used rail and rolling stock and road vehicles ordered for public transport from 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>These recommendations are being considered by the interdepartmental task force as part of its overall consideration of the Commission's report and its preparation of the plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities.  However, there have been developments in relation to most of these issues already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Health, has been working with the health boards over a number of years to transfer persons with a mental handicap who are <Col N="121" /> currently inappropriately placed to more appropriate care settings.  St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, has the largest concentration of this group and has been specifically targeted by my colleague in this programme.</P>
    <P>My colleague has indicated that additional funding is being provided in 1997 to continue this programme.  In this regard, £625,000 revenue funding is being made available to the Eastern Health Board to facilitate the transfer of 50 persons with a mental handicap from St. Ita's, Portrane, to a number of new residential facilities on the north and south sides of Dublin.  Capital funding of £250,000 is also being available to furnish and equip the new facilities and revenue funding of £100,000 was also included in the board's 1997 allocation to assist in meeting with the changing needs of the clients in St. Ita's.  In respect of the recommendation on funding of the council, I have provided a total of £300,000 to fund the work of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities in 1997.</P>
    <P>In the discussions at the intergovernmental conference, Ireland has been a strong advocate of the creation of a competence on the part of the European Community to legislate against discrimination on the grounds of disability.  In fact, the White Paper on Foreign Policy referred to this very issue.  The outline for a revision of the Treaties, submitted by the Irish Presidency to the Dublin 11 European Council, contained a provision which would create the competence I have mentioned in relation to disability and other grounds.  There have been further exchanges in the course of the current Dutch Presidency and, again, the Irish Government has supported the reference to disability in the clause in question.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competiveness provides for targeting an additional 500 sheltered employment places over the period of the partnership.</P>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Transport Accessibility Committee, on which my Department is represented, is continuing to operate under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  I understand that Dublin Bus will be taking delivery of five large-capacity low-floor buses later this year and that the &ldquo;Omni-link&rdquo; service continues to operate in Dublin. Dublin Bus is, I am informed, going ahead with bus stop improvements to include Braille information. Bus Éireann has introduced a large-capacity low-floor bus in Cork, which has proved popular.  In relation to Iarnrod Éireann, I understand that the company is currently examining new railcars and that the new public announcement system in DART stations will include a real-time display of when the next train is due.  In addition, I am informed that access to DART stations is being continuously reviewed.</P>
    <P>I have also expressed my firm belief that there will be a continuing need for the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The Department should be retained into the future with a renewed and expanded brief to pursue equality for all, <Col N="122" /> including people with disabilities.  I would be interested to hear the views of other Members of the House on this issue, particularly from Members opposite as to their own parties' policies.</P>

      <Quest>when the working group on child care for working parents issued its recommendations; the progress, if any, there has been on each recommendation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12329/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Working Group on Child Care Facilities for Working Parents reported in February 1994 and made 16 recommendations covering a wide range of issues in the child care area.  A summary of the recommendation follows.  Progress continues to be made in responding to the recommendations of this report, which are targeted at a wide range of community, public service and private sector interests.</P>
      <P>My Department's plot initiative on child care projects is responding to recommendations 1, 4, 5 and 11.  Grant aid under this scheme, which is being administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management (ADM) Limited, is available in respect of start-up capital costs of pilot child care projects.  To date, a total of £2,359,000 has been approved for funding 141 projects.  In addition, the Employment Equality Agency, under the aegis of my Department, has contributed to encouraging initiatives by issuing its publication of best practice at national and international level in the area of family friendly initiatives in the workplace.</P>
      <P>With regard to recommendations 2, 6 and 7, the National Economic and Social Forum and subcommittee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> gave consideration to the job potential of child care services.  Under Partnership 2000, the expert working group, to be chaired by my Department, is to devise a national framework for the development of child care services and the conclusions of these studies on the job potential of the sector will be examined in that context.  The attention of the relevant planning authorities has been brought by the Department of the Environment to the inclusion of child care facilities in housing and shopping developments and disadvantaged lone parents at work are included in the category of parents for whom pre-school services and supports can be made available by health boards, under the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendation 3 provides that future collective agreements should look at child care provision beyond workplace nurseries.  While this is a matter primarily for the social partners, it is also a factor which continues to receive attention at national level in the new national agreement, <Col N="123" /> Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competition.</P>
    <P>On recommendations 8 and 9, the Minister for Health brought in regulations to give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, in December, 1996.  The provisions set out the various requirements to be complied with by persons carrying on pre-school services or, in certain circumstances, child minding services in the home.  The expert working group under Partnership 2000 will also consider implementation of these regulations.</P>
    <P>The expert working group is to devise a national framwork for the development of the child care sector.  The review of the pilot child care projects, which I recently published, as well as the effects of implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act by the Department of Health will inform the group's deliberations in furthering recommendations 10, 15 and 16.</P>
    <P>In response to recommendations 12, 13 and 14 dedicated funding from the Human Resources Programme is targeted at child care measures, especially as regards training child care workers, while FÁS, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, aims to increase the availability of child care services for its trainees through co-operation with my Department's pilot child care projects and in support of the efforts of County Enterprise Board-Area Board Partnerships. In addition, the Department of Education is devoting £900,000 per annum to support child care provisions for participants on the Vocational Opportunities Scheme and the Youthreach Programme.</P>
    <P>Through its involvement in the pilot projects and its promotion of child care issues, my Department continues to seek to influence an increased availability of child care facilities for working parents and for parents seeking employment or training opportunies.</P>
    <P>Recommendations of the Working Group</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Working Group, in abbreviated form, are:</P>
    <P>1.  Government to encourage initiatives of good practice by employers.</P>
    <P>2.  Government to encourage NESC, NESF etc, to recognise job potential of child care.</P>
    <P>3.  Future collective agreements to look at child care provision beyond workplace nurseries.</P>
    <P>4.  Government to provide a framework for support of local child care initiatives.</P>
    <P>5.  A Government proactive role to develop a prototype to increase child care places.</P>
    <P>6.  Housing and shopping development, planning approvals to include child care facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> 7.  Subsidisation of child care costs of lone parents.</P>
    <P>8.  Private child care providers (under a Government framework) to meet statutory standards.</P>
    <P>9.  Urgent implementation of Part VII Childcare Act, 1991 on regulation of pre-school services.</P>
    <P>10.  Setting up of a prototype service comprising a network of family day-carers.</P>
    <P>11.  County Enterprise Boards to grant aid child care start up costs.</P>
    <P>12.  Provision explicitly for child care under Structural Fund Human Resource Programmes.</P>
    <P>13.  Prioritisation of direct child care service rather than allowance in EU-funded schemes.</P>
    <P>14.  Education-training bodies to budget for child care provision for trainees etc.</P>
    <P>15.  Establishment of information and guidance service for employers and parents.</P>
    <P>16.  Establishment of a fixed-term agency to promote policy and practice for child care.</P>

      <P>Gender equality was one of the basic principles underpinning the report of the Sports Strategy Group Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland.  The recommendations of the report are now being implemented in my Department and the commitment <Col N="128" /> to gender equality is being given expression in the establishment of a special committee of the Irish Sports Council to examine the role of women in sport including participation, coaching, employment, sponsorship and the media.</P>
      <P>Annual funding is provided by my Department to national governing bodies of sport catering specifically for women's sport as well as to those governing bodies which provide for both women and men.  Funding is also allocated to sports projects initiated by the Irish Countrywomen's Association, while in 1996 a special grant of £100,000 was paid to Cumann Camógaíochta na nGael towards the provision of helmets.</P>

      <P>In my reply of 30 April 1997 I stated that certain of the information requested by the Deputy was not readily available and I set out the criteria for appointment as a permanent teacher of art.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, teachers are employed by the authorities of individual schools. While my Department maintains individual teacher records for purposes of recognition and salary, these records are not fully computerised and therefore aggregrate details are not readily available.</P>
      <P>I should say that maintenance of this information on a computerised basis is one of a range of enhancements being developed at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> The Deputy's question focused on the issue of full-time and part-time status of teachers of art. All teachers appointed to permanent posts must be fully qualified.  Appointees to eligible part-time and temporary posts must as a general rule be fully qualified.  However, in exceptional cases where it is not possible to obtain a fully qualified person an appointee may be sanctioned in an unqualified eligible part-time capacity for one school year and the managerial authority must re-advertise the post for the following school year.</P>
    <P>Neither the managerial authorities of second level schools nor the teacher unions have expressed concern to my Department regarding the qualifications of those involved in teaching art.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's question also dealt with the issue of incremental credit and qualification related bonuses.  Incremental credit is determined by an individual teacher's teaching and other eligible service.  Qualification related allowances are determined on an individual basis by reference to that individual teacher's qualifications.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy requires further details or clarification on any of these issues I will be happy to provide this.</P>

      <P>It is my intention that there should eventually be a psychological service available for all children in schools.  For this reason, there is a policy statement concerning the development of the schools psychological service in the Government White Paper on Education, which envisages the expansion of the psychological service on a phased basis.  The provision of the service is seen as a function of the new education boards.  Psychologists from my Department are assigned to serve all second-level schools in the country, including the counties in the north-east.  Parents may access this service through the second-level school attended by their child.  Psychologists from this Department serving second-level schools carry out assessments and casework as the resources of time and personnel allow.  Pupils and their families who require ongoing therapeutic work may be helped by services of the regional health board or by voluntary agencies funded by the board.</P>
      <P>In general, the responsibility for the psychological assessment of children in national schools, where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health boards through the appropriate director of community care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A schools psychological service at primary level is being introduced gradually by my Department as resources permit.  At present, this is provided for national schools which serve disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, in addition to the original pilot service in West Tallaght/Clondalkin and in South Tipperary. <Col N="131" /> Due to the need to limit public expenditure, it has not been possible to expand my Department's psychological service further in the recent past.  It will be some time before the Department of Education is in a position to take over responsibility for psychological assessments for educational purposes from the health authorities.</P>
    <P>As and when it becomes possible to extend the schools psychological service, the needs of children and of schools in various areas, including the north-east, will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 1996 was 498 pupils. This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and 16 assistant teachers for the 1997-98 school year.  Accordingly, the seventeenth assistant's post at the school will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.</P>
      <P>A maximum class size guideline of 29 applies in the case of classes in schools which are designated as disadvantaged.

Progress is being made in reducing the backlog and I will allow the project to proceed to tender as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution, judicial appointments are made by the President acting on the advice of the Government. The Judical Appointments Advisory Board was established under section 13 of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  Under section 16 of the Act, the board is required to submit to the Minister for Justice the name of each person who has informed it of his or her wish to be considered for appointment to a vacancy in a judicial office and to recommend to the Minister at least seven persons for appointment to that judicial office. The Act does not require any order of priority in relation to the recommendations nor does the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board give any particular priority in the list that they submit.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, the name of each judge appointed is listed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and indications must be given if he or she was recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.

For obvious reasons it is not possible to quantify the total volume of illegal drugs being brought into or consumed in Mountjoy Prison.  I can say, however, that the improved security and related measures which I have introduced over the last three years have been successful in significantly curbing the smuggling in and use of illegal substances within the prison.  This is reflected in the significant increase in the number of drug seizures made there.  The number of seizures in the main Mountjoy Prison involving illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia <Col N="137" /> which resulted in formal prison disciplinary proceedings against prisoners over the last three years which were as follows: 1924 &mdash; 172; 1995 &mdash; 392; 1996 &mdash; 423.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the report by the Ombudsman of the investigation of complaints regarding the payment of arrears of contributory pensions, which was published last week.</P>
      <P>This report concerns the investigation of three separate complaints which were made against the refusal by the Department to pay full arrears of pension to the complainants, who, for varying reasons, were late in making their claims.  The Department has accepted the Ombudsman's recommendations to pay arrears of pension in all three cases.</P>
      <P>In two of the cases, the persons concerned had failed to claim old age contributory pension in time, but were in receipt of other pensions from the Department.  Their other pension claims have now been treated as claims for old age contributory pension and arrears have been paid on that basis.</P>
      <P>The late claim in the third case was allegedly due to incorrect advice being given by the Department.  The Ombudsman, in his formal findings in this case, concluded that on the balance of probabilities the person in question did call to the Department on two separate occasions, as he contended, and that the officials he met failed to advise him adequately in relation to his pension entitlement.  The Ombudsman also found that the person concerned did himself, to some extent, contribute to this failure to get adequate advice and that his failure to claim a pension in time may be attributed both to his general lack of knowledge in relation to social insurance and to the failure of the Department adequately to advise him.  The Ombudsman concluded that the Department had discretion under existing arrangements to provide appropriate redress in his case.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Ombudsman's recommendation, the Department decided to pay pension arrears and compensation for the delay for the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from my Department's specific responses in these three cases, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this year's Social Welfare Act provided for more general improvements in this area, including: the maximum period for which arrears of old age contributory pension, retirement pension, contributory widow's and widower's pension and contributory orphan's allowance can be paid has been doubled from six months to 12 months.  This new provision applies to claims made on or after 1 January 1997; payment of arrears of up to six months are now being <Col N="140" /> provided for in the case of late claims for family income supplement (FIS).  Under the former arrangements, there was no provision for the payment of arrears of FIS; and further regulations for dealing with cases outside the statutory limits will be made later this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recommendations relating to the three specific cases, the Ombudsman made five general recommendations at paragraph 91 to which my Department is responding as follows: the information services will continue to be developed with a view to maximising the public's awareness of the scope and application of entitlements and, in particular, the requirement to make claims in time and the effects on entitlements of not so doing; it is intended that the circumstances in which arrears are currently paid on an extra-statutory basis will be incorporated in regulations to be made later this year under section 32 of the Social Welfare Act, 1997.  These regulations will be made public and arrangements will be made to have their provisions made known to applicants who are not entitled to full arrears. Arrangements have been in place for some time now requesting claimants who submit late claims to indicate the reason why the claims are late; the notification of potential contributory old age pensioners of a possible entitlement in advance of pension age has been identified as an important objective and is being pursued in the context of the redevelopment of the Department's pensions computer system; and the recommendations contained in paragraphs 91 (iv) and (v) of the Ombudsman's report will be taken into consideration in the formulation of the regulations to be made under section 32 of the Social Welfare Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>I believe that the revised provisions contained in this year's Social Welfare Act and in the associated regulations will prove to be sufficiently broad to provide the flexibility required to address the issues arising from the report of the Ombudsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the commitments, which involve additional expenditure, that I have made this year in relation to improving the social welfare services have been provided for in the budget.  I am satisfied that the allocation which has been provided for my Department in this year's revised estimates for public services is sufficient to meet these commitments.</P>
      <P>This year's budget package, which will cost £214.69 million in a full year, represents the biggest ever transfer of resources to social welfare recipients.  For example, all personal rates of payment are being increased by £3 a week, with a further £1.50 increase in all payments in respect of qualified adults.  This represents increases of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for all social welfare recipients.  When viewed against the backdrop of continuing low inflation, the significant extra assistance which has been provided represents very real gains for social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>During its period in office, the Government has ensured that the benefits of our economic growth and prosperity have been shared with all sections of our society, especially those in greatest need. This has been achieved through the injection of well over half a billion pounds, £588 million, in additional support for those who are dependent on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These very significant additional resources have enabled me to undertake a substantial programme of social welfare reform, which is <Col N="142" /> designed to improve the financial position of everyone in need, while at the same time providing real incentives for people to avail of employment opportunities.  These extra resources have also enabled me to tackle poverty and social exclusion, by channelling extra resources directly at those who are at greatest risk, such as larger families and families on low incomes, through substantial increases in child benefit, accompanied by real reform of the family income supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>The reforms which I have introduced in the social welfare system make it more work friendly, more family friendly, more caring for the sick and elderly and more focused on tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>

The savings amount to £13 million in total; £10 million from Subhead L1 &mdash; Market Intervention and £3 million from subhead L.3 &mdash; Forestry.
