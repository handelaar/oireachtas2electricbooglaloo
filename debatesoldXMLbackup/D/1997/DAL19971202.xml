      <Quest>the arrangements, if any, in place to ensure representation of the public interest at the Moriarty Tribunal of Inquiry; the body who will be responsible for instructing counsel for the public interest and for determining the form, content and extent of his or her instructions; whether these instructions will extend to representing the public interest in the submission of matters for the tribunal's consideration in relation to matters on which it is entitled to make recommendations; whether an arrangement is in place by which those responsible for representing the public interest might, in drawing up their brief, take into account matters raised by public representatives as being of specific importance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The protection of the public interest is a function exercised independently of the Government by the Attorney General.  I understand the question of appointment of counsel to represent the public interest at the Moriarty Tribunal is currently under consideration by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged if counsel for the public interest is to be appointed it will be the Office of the Attorney General which will instruct the counsel and determine the form, nature and extent of their instructions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I am sure he will accept it is a time honoured tradition in this House for the Taoiseach to answer on the Attorney General's behalf where appropriate.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Attorney General will accept representations from public representatives, particularly from Members of this House, as to how they think the public interest could best be represented by the person nominated by the Attorney General to so do at the Moriarty tribunal?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Issues which are put forward will be dealt with by counsel representing the Attorney General.  Because of some of the issues which arose in relation to previous tribunals it is not yet clear what kind of instructions the Attorney General will give to counsel.  I am sure that is what Deputy Quinn had in mind when he tabled the question.  I understand that whatever counsel is appointed will have the expertise and knowledge to deal with what they believe to be public interest issues during the course of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>This House would like to see counsel for the public interest raise issues about which people are curious.  However, in legal terms this issue is viewed in a slightly different light and there could be a slight misunderstanding of the role of counsel for the public interest.  I want to clarify this as I am conscious that two further tribunals are upcoming after Christmas and the issue will arise again at that stage.  The courts believe that the perception that counsel for the public interest should vigorously cross examine all witnesses before the tribunal is based on a misconception. The concept of the public interest is, from a legal viewpoint, separate and distinct from issues about which the public might be curious although it is difficult at times to see how they differ.</P>
      <P>If, through evidence given by witnesses before the tribunal, it is apparent that some public right has been interfered with, counsel for the public interest may then intervene if the matter has not been adequately covered by counsel for the inquiry.  My information is that the task of counsel for the public interest is to elicit answers to whatever questions they choose to put to witnesses who appear before the tribunal.  It is not the role of counsel for the public interest to cross-examine witnesses except where such testimony relates to a public interest issue and where the public interest team is in possession of factual information on which to base cross examination. It is also considered that the role of counsel for the public interest is not to substitute for parties who have been chosen to represent other groups before the tribunal.  I asked these questions when in Opposition and I would like to give the information back to the House now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his supplementary reply.  Does he agree the Attorney General has two distinct and separate roles in this instance?  His clear role, one I fully understand and do not wish to challenge, is as legal adviser to the Government.  However, in this particular context, the Attorney General also has a responsibility to represent the public interest and to appoint a suitably qualified person to legally represent that during the course of this tribunal. Does the Taoiseach agree that the public would have more than a curiosity interest in the management of the Ansbacher accounts?  Does he accept it would have a very real legal and political interest in this issue?  Evidence given to the previous tribunal revealed one beneficiary of <Col N="1239" /> these accounts, who will be the subject of one of the forthcoming tribunals.  It is clear there has been a breach of the law with regard to these accounts and a failure on the part of the Central Bank to properly monitor them.  The Taoiseach represents the Attorney General in this House. Will he accept the Attorney General should ensure that senior counsel representing the public interest at the tribunal will raise the question of the Ansbacher accounts in so far as they relate to the workings of that tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage counsel has not been appointed.  When public representatives raise issues in the House their concerns are on the Official Report which can be seen by the Attorney General.  I gave my earlier reply so Deputies could see how this matter is interpreted in the legal context.</P>
      <P>The Deputy wishes to know if counsel for the public interest will ensure that matters of public concern, particularly those expressed by public representatives, are taken into account by the tribunal. They should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it the Taoiseach agrees the management of the Ansbacher accounts, in the context of the remit of this tribunal, is a matter of legitimate public concern and not curiosity, and the Attorney General should instruct the counsel he appoints to ensure this matter will be properly raised within the brief of his or her representation of the public interest?  Will the Taoiseach formally communicate to the Attorney General what he appears to have said, that he agrees with me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of the tribunal have been agreed by resolution of the Dáil following extensive debate.  They reflect the concerns of the public as expressed by its elected representatives.  The issues raised by the Deputy are not included in the terms of reference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but they are related to them.  I am confident the tribunal will carry out its task in accordance with the terms of reference. I see no need for counsel for the public interest to bring these matters to the attention of the tribunal. However, particular note should be taken by counsel for the public interest of issues which have been raised by public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Deputy Quinn said matters raised by public representatives should be of specific importance.  Public representatives will not be represented at the tribunal.  To remove doubt about a number of issues of grave public concern, will the Taoiseach consider a short amendment to the terms of reference to provide that the Ansbacher accounts and the unadvertised sale of substantial State lands at Glending Wood, County Wicklow be included?  That would <Col N="1240" /> ensure these matters would be investigated rather than being left to chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make any such amendment.  However, I have every confidence that, as was the case in the last tribunal, relevant issues will be investigated.  While these issues are not included in the terms of reference, they are relevant to the moneys and the facts about which we have knowledge at present.  The tribunal and the teams represented at it will delve into these matters as they see fit.</P>

      <Qid>3</Qid>
      <asker>Mr. Sargent</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends to review the process in which advertisements for the purpose of Government information are compiled, in terms of their form and content, in view of continuing public criticism that these advertisements are neither readable nor user-friendly.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20242/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question appears to be prompted mainly by critical comments made about the advertisements regarding the recent referendum to amend the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The difficulties presented on that occasion for large sections of the public were undoubtedly related to the complex issues involved, which did not lend themselves to easy, simple explanation in the form of an advertisement.  Nevertheless, the lessons are being absorbed and I am determined there will not be a repeat of that experience in promoting debate on major public policy issues in future.</P>
      <P>I am confident the issues raised by the Deputy can be addressed in the new quality customer service initiative for the Civil Service.  As indicated in reply to questions on 18 November, I launched the customer service action plan for my Department on 12 November and the plans of the other participating Departments and offices will be published over the weeks up to the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I looked to the future when I tabled this question.  I had next year's Amsterdam Treaty in mind and how people might be informed and prepared for that referendum.  Will the European Commission be involved in funding it and will this have any impact on the presentation of information?</P>
      <P>Will someone be accountable for the readability of the information, as opposed to the content, given the importance of communicating as widely as possible the essence of the &ldquo;for&rdquo; and &ldquo;against&rdquo; positions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The customer service action plan will deal with the readability and presentation of information.  Last week I said there will be an examination of how the referendum on the <Col N="1241" /> Amsterdam summit will be presented to the public and whether it will be necessary to make legislative changes.  Since then I reconstituted the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and discussed this matter with the chairman and deputy chairman, who will look at this matter in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The matter is also being looked at in Government as this is an important referendum which is of great significance.  Everyone in this House wants it passed.  If Deputy Sargent is indicating he does not want it passed &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I will have to exclude him from that generalisation.  It is vital we have an opportunity to put the facts before the people so they can see the implications and ramifications of what is at issue.</P>
      <P>In so far as the direct involvement of the EU is concerned, it is always involved in information and research.  I do not know whether it has undertaken an initiative but the EU is actively involved in promoting the Amsterdam agreement on a European wide basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the restrictions on the dissemination of information on referenda as a result of the McKenna judgment are such that a new method will have to be found other than the newspaper advertisements which have been used so far?  Has he any ideas on how to put forward &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; arguments, if not through newspaper advertisements? It is clear one needs 20/20 vision to read those advertisements and people I spoke to about the last advertisement turned the page as quickly as they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  It is impossible to deal with intricate international, constitutional case work on the basis of a small <i>ad hoc</i> forum of two members of the Bar Council who, in a specified number of words, are allowed put the case for and against.  We did our best, but that is not much good in the case of referenda. We need an alternative.  It has been stated here on a number of occasions that the alternative will require legislation.  All of these matters have to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware the first response to the McKenna judgment was the publication of a booklet giving the case for and against, which was distributed to every household? That is a more user-friendly mechanism.  At the time, Fianna Fáil produced a legislative measure to put the procedure on a statutory basis.  Is it still the proposal of the Government to have a statutory mechanism for dealing with the dissemination of this type of information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what we are looking at in order to deal with this matter correctly and to deal with future referenda so that <Col N="1242" /> we can put the case clearly and comprehensively. Deputy Sargent said, with some merit, this case was not presented very clearly and we can learn lessons from that.  I have already stated that I accept that argument.  The matter has to be dealt with comprehensively.  It is not even satisfactory for those members of the legal profession who are asked to make the case.  They need to be able to put in a certain amount of data which is relevant to a case.  Members know the Amsterdam Treaty, in particular, is extremely complex.  The excellent Dorr report has been highly commended, not only here but elsewhere.  However, one cannot present that as one side of the case in a few pages or in a small report.  One must present it in a comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that a booklet is a better way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that but, as the Deputy knows, there is a limit to how a booklet can be presented under the rules of the <i>ad hoc</i> group.  We have to find another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is a need to address this matter other than through the Constitutional Review Committee?  I appreciate he said the committee intends to have it at the top of its list of issues, but it is a Constitutional Review Committee.  Assuming the Government is proceeding with a March date for the referendum, what we need is a mechanism for the proper implementation of the Supreme Court judgment on the McKenna issue.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider the proposal I made some weeks ago for an informal all-party committee to see if we can agree on how a fair presentation of the complex issues in the Amsterdam Treaty can be presented?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach sought advice on the application of the McKenna judgment?  Does it apply only to the period after this House agrees to a referendum, or is the Government precluded from providing information on the Amsterdam Treaty in advance &mdash; between now and the point at which this House will agree a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be cautious about the last point because it is not altogether clear. However, in the normal course it would apply during the process of a campaign.  The Government would be allowed to publish proposals, but that is only one aspect of it.  Trying to get those proposals passed is a separate aspect.</P>
      <P>The McKenna judgment was a constitutional case.  That is why I said it was a matter for the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  The other aspect I mentioned was that the Government is looking at this matter and if required to talk to party leaders after we come to some conclusions we will certainly do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the All-Party Committee on the Constitution would look at it but I am not too sure. As soon as the Government has finished its work <Col N="1243" /> we could have a small committee under the Whips, if necessary, or the spokespersons.  I do not have any great difficulty with that.  I would rather put something to that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, is it intended to proceed with a March date for the Amsterdam referendum, as indicated in the House some weeks ago?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter which Government is in power there is a difficulty with this matter. Will the Taoiseach agree the expense of hiring a barrister for and against, and advertising in newspapers, is a waste of money because nobody reads the advertisements?  We are all trying to find ways to deal with the problem.  Will the Taoiseach consider hiring journalists to write newspaper articles for and against referendum proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>They did that already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Those articles could be described as advertising.  They would be much more likely to be read those than full page arguments which Governments insert.  Such articles for and against proposals could be carried as advertisements, separate from the normal news stories.  It would probably not cost as much either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>More interesting proposals.  I would not say advertisements are not well read. We are lucky that people read them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some advertisements last year were misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers of people who campaigned, as well as those who wrote about the advertisements not being comprehensive, suggest that a fair number of people read them.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt it is useful to air issues concerning a referendum in a newspaper.  However, the Deputy will be aware it can be hard to get the different sides of opinion going.  The newspapers do their part, but it depends on the interest in that referendum.  While some Members were excited about Cabinet confidentiality, public interest in it was almost zero.  Even though all 166 Deputies tried to inject some heat into the debate, we failed.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Because of implications for the economy and this country's possible involvement in military alliances, as well as the seriousness of this matter, does the Taoiseach agree the wrong gloss has been put on the McKenna judgment?  It does not bar the Government from using public funds to look for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, but it requires that fair representation is given to both sides of the argument.  Given that the March date is quite close, will the Taoiseach report to the House on how public funding for fair representation of both sides of the argument can be secured?</P>

Will he set a target, for the benefit of everybody, the Government included, for the referendum, that they may work towards it even though he cannot say for definite when it might be?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I indicated last July that I would regularly consult all shades of Northern political opinion to consolidate democratic consensus around a peaceful way forward, and that I would meet those Northern parties wishing to participate to regularly review means of achieving progress.</P>
      <P>I met on Friday last with the SDLP, the Alliance Party, Sinn Féin, the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition and the Northern Ireland Labour Party.  The meeting took place over lunch and was open to all the parties participating in the talks.</P>
      <P>We had a very good meeting.  We reviewed progress to date and availed of the opportunity to exchange at first hand our various views and ideas on where we should now be going to ensure that the talks are successful.  The meeting was geared towards generating momentum in the talks, which continues to be the primary arena and focus.</P>
      <P>In the context of an overall settlement the Government will put forward and support proposals for balanced constitutional change.  Any changes proposed will be put to the people North and South.  When the time comes for such constitutional change it will need to be fully considered and widely discussed.  Given the issues involved, there can be no doubt that there will be a full and frank debate both inside and outside of this House prior to and during the referendum campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Prime Minister Blair did recently, and as I indicated in my remarks following my meeting with Northern parties at Government Buildings <Col N="1246" /> on Friday last, I propose to visit the talks in Castle Buildings next week.</P>
    <P>The role of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is a matter for the Forum itself and for the parties participating in it.</P>
    <P>I will circulate a copy of my speech to the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland in which I ranged over developments relating to the Irish economy, Economic and Monetary Union and Northern Ireland to the Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a time honoured tradition here that all parties in this House assist in whatever way they can in the resolution of the problems in Northern Ireland.  Is the Taoiseach deeply concerned about, and what are the implications for his attendance at the talks next week, the damaging impact of the comments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, in recent days?  Is he aware that as late as lunch time today, the Unionist leader, Mr. David Trimble, said the Government has got itself into a hole and he may find it very difficult to continue to deal with the Irish Government?  In view of the Taoiseach's successful meeting with Mr. David Trimble last week, will he say what action he has taken to deal with the comments of the Minister, Deputy Andrews, and what action he intends to take to ensure the full team of Ministers involved in the Northern Ireland talks prepare themselves for all statements and interviews?  What action does the Taoiseach propose to take to ensure adequate and clear communication with the Unionist party at the talks next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been at the talks all day and has been dealing with the Unionists.  I am aware that the remarks made by the Minister especially one particular line, created difficulties over the weekend. The Deputy will also be aware of the Minister's reply yesterday.  I do not want to get into a blow by blow account of each issue and controversy that occurs in Northern Ireland, even when some are more serious than others.  The fundamental outcome which the Irish Government wants from the talks is stable agreements.  As I said to Mr. Trimble two weeks ago, we are not interested in conquests, we want something that is lasting and which all sides can live with and, therefore, can be sustained.  This can only come about by agreement and consent.  This remains central to our approach to the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail on the Government's negotiating position as the talks are ongoing but in regard to Strand II the North-South body at the centre of the current hiatus would be critical to any agreement to which Nationalists could give their allegiance.  For such an agreement to be reached there would have to be Unionist agreement to the body's functions. That is self-evident.  It is not perceived by us as a vehicle for taking over the government of Northern Ireland against the wishes of a majority &mdash; the interpretation put by some on the Minister's <Col N="1247" /> comments &mdash; rather it would provide a focus for practical action at island level, for which there is ample scope, as well as the necessary institutional expression of the identity of Northern Nationalists.</P>
    <P>The agreement will have to be based on the three strand process.  There was a useful meeting on that this morning.  There will be difficult issues for us to face in the negotiations as we move forward. We will have to react and try to reach acceptable compromises.</P>
    <P>The Government is focused on the practicalities involved in North-South co-operation.  These will largely shape the functions to be exercised by a North-South body, the various functional agencies that would report to it and the ways in which they would operate.  I discussed this matter at some length with Mr. Trimble ten days ago.  Such co-operation makes sense in many areas.  Practical arrangements can be made to the advantage of all the people on the island in securing the acceptance of Nationalists of the agreement which would ensure stability.  The issues and arrangements will be considered fully in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said yesterday.  As everybody knows, in the Northern talks words are extremely important.  Hardly a week goes by without some issue blowing up into a controversy. While I accept people have a right to react strongly to comments made outside, the Minister has adequately cleared up the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his lengthy reply.  I take it he is disowning the remarks made by the Minister for which the Minister did not apologise yesterday.  In view of the positive meeting the Taoiseach had last week with Mr. Trimble and the courageous comments made by Mr. Trimble that he thought the meeting went very well, is the Taoiseach taking action to ensure the Minister is aware of the sensitivities involved and is well prepared before he gives interviews? What did the Taoiseach say to the Minister about his comments and will he apologise to ensure he can be effective at the talks next week given that Mr. Trimble has said he will find it difficult to continue what had started off as good dialogue with the Taoiseach?  This has been put in jeopardy because of the Minister's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clarified these matters which were dealt with yesterday in the North.  It is back to business today.  I thank everybody involved in the serious business that was completed this morning in spite of the difficulties encountered yesterday.  I was talking to the Minister last evening when we reflected on the day's events, as we do daily, in the case of the Northern talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should inform the House that today's plenary session has been completed, everybody having been in attendance.  The Plenary Review Group has decided to establish a small working group <Col N="1248" /> to prepare a statement on an agreed format for resolution of the key issues, which was as much as I had thought could be achieved.  A sub group has now been established with two people representing every delegation.  It will draw up a list of the key issues to be resolved along with the appropriate format for their resolution.  Hopefully that will be achieved by the week beginning 15 December.</P>
    <P>In terms of the heat generated yesterday, I have clarified that issue.  It is not the first nor I predict will it be the last time that temperatures will be raised at these talks.  Over the past 24 hours or so I have spoken to a number of people in the North, which is no different from the daily practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that over the past 15 years my party has played a very constructive role in endeavouring to bring the extremities of the divided communities in Northern Ireland closer; that my former party Leader, Deputy Dick Spring, had a seminal influence and was present on many of the key occasions, along with representatives of other parties in this House?  Does he agree that the success of those talks is dependent on a shared, multi-party approach in the South along with a common position on key sensitive issues?  If he does accept that, would he not also agree in a more fulsome manner than he displayed in replying to Deputy Owen that the remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, on Friday last were unfortunate, very unhelpful and could have been avoided had the Minister adhered to his script?</P>
      <P>Because of the sensitive nature of what is involved, the history of the Sunningdale Agreement, in particular the Council of Ireland, will the Taoiseach take all necessary steps to ensure that we do not stray from the script in these areas?</P>
      <P>Will he also indicate whether, since Friday last, he contacted the Leader of the Official Unionist Party, Mr. David Trimble, directly to reassure him of the formal position of the Irish Government, as it would appear he did so clearly and successfully in the course of his earlier bilateral meeting with him?  Can he assure the House that the undoubted damage done has been repaired by him by way of direct intervention with Mr. David Trimble and, if not, will he consider doing so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Owen that Mr. Trimble's concern was well addressed both yesterday and this morning.  I want to thank Mr. Trimble and all others involved on their constructive role today in having completed the plenary session, which had nothing whatsoever to do with the remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs which were perceived as being a difficult obstacle. There has been an extremely successful outcome to today's plenary session.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Quinn's questions, at all times I anticipate and thank the House for its bipartisanship on the North.  As Deputy Quinn will recall, on at least four or five occasions that I can remember, in various former capacities I went to the assistance of the former leader of his party when his resignation was called for.  Therefore, as far as calling for the resignation of people representing this House and Government in the North is concerned, that is probably one of the most over-played cards in the game.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs went somewhat further than what is the position, which he has clarified.  What I said earlier is the position.  I am very conscious that every word uttered in the Northern talks is important.  I might also add that I daily decline the opportunity or temptation of jumping on a remark made by somebody in the North.  I should remind all my Unionist colleagues of that fact, bearing in mind that all kinds of remarks are made on different occasions, at different meetings and ceremonies when Members of the House could become very irritated but do not.</P>
      <P>I am interested in building co-operation, not creating difficulties.  I am interested in finding resolutions, not holes in various matters.  I am interested in meaningful dialogue and moving matters forward and I am glad the parties to the talks acknowledged that today.  They all went in, following yesterday's petition and Minister Andrews's statement explaining his position, but we must move on from that.  I can understand people in Opposition wanting to remind the world that Minister Andrews went over what is our own line in an interview, one of about 22 he gave last week, but he has now corrected that position.  I am sure it will not be the first or the last time he will have to do that.  I am glad people have accepted that position and there was no mention of it in the talks this morning.  People went about their business and reached a successful end to the plenary session.</P>

      <P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach's extensive reply to my question that over the course of the last 48 hours he has had direct contact with David Trimble and has taken whatever steps he considers were necessary in the context of the points made by various spokespersons for the Unionist parties over the weekend, and the point of retraction and clarification the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, issued yesterday?</P>

      <P>This is my first supplementary on these questions.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that he should insist that this is the last time such a mistake will be made?  Does he agree that this is the third occasion on which serious problems have been created for the negotiations, and that further such errors of judgment will only weaken the Irish Government's negotiating stance in these talks?  Will he agree it is important efforts are made to ensure this is the last time? No one is expecting perfection and no one can guarantee this will never happen but we should send out the message from here that it will be the last time such mistakes are made.  Commenting on Articles 2 and 3, the North-South bodies and his attempt to interfere in the judicial process between Germany and Britain in relation to extradition two weeks ago is something a Minister for Foreign Affairs should not be doing.</P>

Will the Taoiseach agree it is time for Sinn Féin and the SDLP to join the forum in Northern Ireland to which they were elected particularly as we are encouraging all the parties involved in the negotiations in Northern Ireland to participate in the forum in the Republic?  It would be a gesture of confidence building and goodwill if they were to take their seats in that forum.  Also, will the Taoiseach agree that the changes announced by Minister Mo Mowlam yesterday in relation to the RUC are to be welcomed, namely, the change in the oath RUC members currently take and that the subtitle of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is to be changed to the Northern Ireland Police Service?</P>

More importantly, following his meeting on 28 November with the Northern parties &mdash; I regret all Northern parties were not invited &mdash; may I ask the Taoiseach if the idea of a second or Upper House for a Northern assembly to represent community groups as proposed by the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition was discussed?  Will the Taoiseach comment on whether the forum might be an appropriate way to proceed in Dublin Castle?  Community groups wishing to help with the peace process might find more of an opportunity to involve themselves through that?</P>

      <P>On the occasion of the issue concerning Articles 2 and 3, people put forward an interpretation of what the Minister, Deputy Andrews, said in a written speech and then walked out.  They walked in a few minutes later after he had clarified the position.  The talks in the North cannot be compared to the talks we would have in a committee.  More tension surrounds them and for that reason we all must be more careful, but I would not like to see a situation where every time I met someone from the <Col N="1252" /> North I would have to have a carefully prepared script.  That is not how we should spend our time and we will not get anywhere by doing that.  We are not and will not try to create difficulties.</P>
      <P>The point has been well made on this issue, that there has been an argument since 1920 that the issue of a third Government would arise.  That is why people may be over sensitive.  People will recall from history many arguments about this in the 1925 agreement.  People in the Unionist community are very sensitive about the third Government approach and that is why they reacted yesterday. They are concerned there might be something on our agenda that would move matters on to what was the old position of 1925, but that is not what we are at.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sargent said that all parties from the North were not asked to that meeting.  If he means they were not invited by way of an invitation card, nobody was asked in that manner.

      <P>The court poor box system has been in place for many years and predates the foundation of the State.  It is not a practice specifically regulated in legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the decision of a court in any case is a matter for the presiding judge who makes his or her decision having heard all the evidence in the case.  The Deputy will also appreciate that, in accordance with our Constitution, the Judiciary is independent in the exercise of its judicial functions, subject only to the provisions of the Constitution and the law.</P>
      <P>The recent apparent growth in the use of the court poor box system is a matter of concern to me and is one I raised with my predecessor when in Opposition as spokesman on justice issues.  I asked the Attorney General for his opinion on the matter and when that is received, I will give further consideration to the matter.</P>

      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>): I thank the Minister for his reply.  I put it to him this is a distortion of the principle of justice being applied equally.  Does he accept that if a person can afford a contribution to a judge's pet charity, he walks free without a conviction, endorsement, suspension or criminal record?  Is the Minister aware that at Kilcock District Court recently 33 motorists escaped conviction because they were prepared to pay up to £20,000 to the District Justice's pet charity.  In one case, a person drove at a speed of 120 miles per hour on the M4, one of the most dangerous stretches of road, and yet that person was in a position to make a substantial payment to the judge's pet charity and walked out without a record.  If one cannot pay, one faces the full rigour of the law, including a conviction, an endorsement, a possible suspension, a fine and jail if one <Col N="1254" /> cannot pay the fine.  Does the Minister accept that is wrong?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate it is not for me to comment on decisions made by the courts which, under the Constitution, are independent of the Executive.  I agree it is a matter of concern and I have sought a full report from the Attorney General.  When his opinion is to hand, I will decide what steps are appropriate in the context of that opinion.  Meanwhile, I am sure Deputy Higgins will appreciate it is not open to me to criticise or be seen to interfere in any way with decisions of the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>): Does the Minister accept there is a volume of evidence which suggests the system is being abused?  From the point of view of the implementation of the Road Traffic Acts, operation lifesaver is in operation in the area where this judge administers his own distorted sense of duty and fair play.  This is making a mockery of operation lifesaver in light of the unprecedented carnage on our roads.  Given that the President of the District Court liaises with judges of that court, does the Minister consider it more worthwhile appraising the President, Mr. Smithwick, of his anxieties in the matter, rather than resorting to the conduit of the Attorney General?</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a reply to a written question I tabled recently.  It shows how the amounts have escalated.  For example, in 1993, the figure was £139,750.  In 1996, that had jumped to £305,481.  I sought details from the Minister relating to the charities which benefited.  The Minister replied that money paid into the poor box is recorded separately in the District Court offices in the general cash account, moneys are paid out on foot of a direction from a District Court Judge and in the main are paid out to local charities and that it would not be possible, without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time, to compile a list of the names of the charities which benefited in this regard or on the amounts paid to each charity.</P>
      <P>This is public money paid to a public court poor box and the amounts stated in the reply to my question comprise individual contributions.  If these have been paid to give the cumulative amounts in the reply, it should be possible to establish the charities benefiting and which have benefited.  Is the Minister prepared to find out which charities benefited and make the information available to me as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins is aware, the moneys concerned are paid out to a wide variety of charities and that is done, as far as I am aware, on foot of a direction made by a District Court judge.  As the Deputy pointed out, these payments are made in the main to local charities. The court poor box system is used to some degree by most District Court justices.  I understand the <Col N="1255" /> vast majority of judges who use this system do so only in a number of cases.</P>
      <P>Prior to Deputy Higgins tabling this question, I referred the matter to the Attorney General on 15 October 1997 and I await his advice on it.  I am not prepared to engage in criticism of the courts, the manner in which they make decisions or the decisions.  I intend to take on board the advice of the Attorney General on the matter and, having considered his opinion, to decide the best course of action.</P>
      <P>I am afraid it is not open to me to elaborate any further on the matter.  There is a strong argument that there is a statutory basis for the system under the Probation of Offenders Act.  No doubt, some people will make a contrary argument, but, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I believe the most prudent thing to do is to await the advice of the Attorney General on the matter and address the situation from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On my appointment as Minister I commenced a review of arrangements for processing applications for refugee status.</P>
      <P>Within a few weeks I was satisfied that resources in terms of staff numbers and basic facilities were inadequate to deal with the number of applications being lodged.  I therefore sought and obtained Government approval for additional staff to be appointed to my Department and for new premises to be obtained.</P>
      <P>In addition, a dispute about payment of legal fees which had prevented appeals against refusal of refugee status from being dealt with for nearly three years was resolved in June.  I arranged for appeal hearings to recommence on 12 August. Resolution of this dispute means that it is now possible to bring to finality the processing of appeals against a finding that an individual has no entitlement to refugee status.</P>
      <P>Recruitment of the additional staff is in hands. In this regard, various staff unions have expressed concerns relating to the proposed recruitment of the additional staff.  Discussions in this regard have been taking place between the Department of Finance and the staff side &mdash; the last meeting was held on Wednesday 26 November &mdash; and I am hopeful that the matter will be resolved shortly.  It is my intention to commence appointing the new staff as soon as possible after this matter has been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 22 members of staff dedicated to dealing with asylum claimants in my Department.  This includes a small number of the above mentioned additional staff.  When all the additional staff are appointed there will be almost <Col N="1256" /> 90 persons dealing with asylum claims.  It is expected that the additional staffing resource will have two effects.  First, it will enable the very significant backlog to be tackled.  Second, it will ensure that cases are dealt with in a more timely fashion and that the current processing time of approximately two years per case will be significantly reduced.  I would expect that applications lodged in the New Year will be processed to finality in a period of about six months.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has completed legal formalities for the acquisition of new accommodation. Work on fitting out of the new accommodation, estimated to cost £2.5 million, has started and the accommodation should be ready for use in the early part of 1998.  Until then the work of processing applications will continue in temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>In so far as the implementation of the Refugee Act, 1996 is concerned, I have already made an Order commencing sections 1, 2, 5, 22 and 25 of the Act with effect from 29 August last.</P>
    <P>There is at present a High Court injunction preventing the appointment of a Refugee Applications Commissioner under the Act.  Because of this litigation I am not in a position to appoint a Refugee Applications Commissioner, an appointment central to the introduction of the remaining sections of the Act.</P>
    <P>In light of the impasse over the appointment of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, my desire to deal with all applications for refugee status fairly, efficiently and in a timely manner, and the need to put in place an interim arrangement to deal with the current large caseload, I have met the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Discussions between the representative and my officials are continuing with a view to establishing a procedure to deal with the backlog of cases which has built up over the past two years or so and currently stands at about 4,000.</P>
    <P>Both the UNHCR and I are satisfied that the arrangement made in 1985, involving formal consultation with the UNHCR in each individual case, is no longer workable due to the huge increase in numbers applying, and that a new approach is necessary.  I hope that new procedures will be put in place very shortly.  The procedures which are under discussion follow, in as far as practicable, the philosophy set out in the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>I again want to place on the record my appreciation of the advice and assistance being given by the UNHCR in this matter and, especially, as part of that assistance, the acceptance by the UNHCR of my offer of funding for the placement by the UNHCR of one of its staff in Dublin for the next 12 months or so to assist my Department in dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures, taken together, will bring about an improvement in the position &mdash; not just in fairness to those who have applied for refugee status who are entitled to a speedy decision but also to the taxpayer who <Col N="1257" /> must support applicants and their families while a decision is pending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the present delay in processing these applications is very undesirable and is giving rise to tension which ultimately results in a very unhealthy type of politics?  When does he expect the backlog to be cleared?  What waiting period would he consider acceptable in processing these applications? Does he consider six months an acceptable period for applicants to wait for a decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the Deputy's point that it is undesirable applicants should have to wait so long for a decision and that is why I made valiant efforts to put in place the arrangements I already outlined.  Following the provision of the necessary staff and accommodation it will take approximately six months to deal with an application.  Given the logistics, this is a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered there has been a very large increase in the number of applications in recent years.  This has caused a problem for the Department and has required the recruitment of 72 additional staff.  I hope the staff and accommodation will be ready early in the new year.  This will be of great relief to people who genuinely wish to seek asylum here.  In general terms, the matter should work out well.  I am mindful and appreciative of the crucially important role played by the UNHCR.  It has fulfilled this role for a considerable period.  The new arrangements will work satisfactorily and will be to the benefit of all concerned.</P>

      <P>What action does the Minister propose to take as a result of the decision handed down by the courts today?  What extra safeguards does he propose to introduce to allay the concern that some asylum seekers may be deported to countries where they will be persecuted?  What is the status of the case regarding the appointment of the refugee commissioner which is before the courts and will the Government seek an early hearing of this case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On the recent Supreme Court decision, it is a generally recognised international principle that people seeking asylum should do so at the first available opportunity. This principle has been applied by successive Ministers, irrespective of the Government in office.  It was given effect by the Dublin Convention which guarantees asylum seekers who arrive in the territory or at the borders of a member state of the EU that their applications will be examined fully by one country in accordance with its asylum determination process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision concluded that the Minister &ldquo;carried out a proper inquiry as to whether the United Kingdom was the first safe country for the purpose of a substantive inquiry into the applicant's claim for refugee status and <Col N="1258" /> that such inquiry was held in accordance with the provisions of the Von-Arnim Letter in so far as they are material to such an inquiry and the requirements for natural and constitutional justice&rdquo;. The Von-Arnim Letter referred to is the 1985 arrangement with the UNHCR under which applications for refugee status are currently examined by the State.</P>
    <P>A number of cases &mdash; five in the courts and 23 administratively &mdash; have been on hold pending the outcome of this case.  It is intended to instruct the 23 to leave shortly.  Other cases may come to light during the investigation of claims and they will also be affected by the judgment.  In so far as the Supreme Court judgment has application to individual cases then naturally it is the function of the Government and the authorities to apply the decision to those cases, and obviously that will be the position.</P>

      <P>I assume Deputy Higgins has in mind an official inquiry into those aspects of the Garda handling of the matter which were the subject of criticisms, expressed or implied, in the judgment to which he referred.  Before I deal with those criticisms it is only right to draw attention to the positive aspects of the judgment from a law enforcement point of view, in particular, the vindication of the Garda Síochána in its decision to seek essential evidential material in this case and then to proceed by way of section 64 rather than section 63 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. This retains the advantages to be gained from section 64 in the pursuit of the ill-gotten gains of modern day ruthless criminals, especially those involved in the sale and supply of drugs.</P>
      <P>During the recent debate on my Department's Supplementary Estimate I indicated to the Deputy my concern about aspects of the court's judgment and my intention to seek a full report from the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that it is his strict policy to preserve the privacy of individuals.  He has informed me that practically every day of the year the gardaí behave, and Garda Press Office personnel respond, in a way which ensures this policy is adhered to.  Nevertheless, the court found, as a matter of probability, that the leak of information regarding the proposed search of the premises emanated from a Garda source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has advised me that informal inquiries were conducted by the Garda authorities to establish the source of the leak, an approach which, according to the advice I have <Col N="1259" /> received, can be more successful on occasion than the more formal inquiry.  Because of the finding of the court and because of the commissioner's overall concern about this judgment, he has appointed a senior officer to investigate the matter thoroughly.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Will the Minister accept, as the judge said, there is probably a criminal matter at stake here?  Will he accept this is not the first time an incident such as this occurred? For example, is he aware a similar incident occurred when an adviser to a former Minister was arrested days before the presidential election and obviously the media was tipped off?  Is an investigation ongoing in that regard?  I approve of the powers given to the Criminal Assets Bureau. Under operation pineapple the Garda sought files relating to the property transactions of John and Geraldine Gilligan.  Are negotiations taking place between the Criminal Assets Bureau and the legal representatives of John and Geraldine Gilligan on a possible settlement for unlawful seizure of their property?</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to, nor can I, discuss operational matters in so far as they relate to the Garda authorities or the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The Garda Commissioner has advised me that informal inquiries were conducted to establish the source of the leak in this matter. Very often such approaches yield best results.</P>
      <P>Because of the finding of the court and because of the Garda Commissioner's serious concern about the judgment of the court, he appointed a senior officer to investigate the matter.  When that investigation is to hand the matter will be considered further.  The question of whether a criminal offence took place in this case would then arise.  The prosecution of an offence would be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I sincerely hope the source of the leak is identified because it is entirely unacceptable.  I cannot progress the matter further in the absence of information, but when such information comes to hand appropriate action will be taken.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to consider any suggestions which might enhance the operation of our criminal justice system.  I am not clear precisely what type of commission Deputy Flanagan has in mind.  In particular, the question of advice and assistance on the reform of criminal law referred to in the Deputy's question is in many ways a separate matter from the task &mdash; also mentioned in the question &mdash; of ensuring that all appropriate agencies are equipped to act in a more cohesive manner.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware the advice of the Law Reform Commission is available on reform of the criminal law.  The question of the establishment of a separate commission to deal exclusively with the criminal law has been raised from time to time over the years, but successive Governments have not been convinced of its advantages. I pay tribute to the work of the commission in the area of criminal law and work has borne fruit in recent years in measures dealing with such areas as the confiscation of the proceeds of crime, nonfatal offences against the person and bail.  I have a number of pieces of criminal legislation under preparation which will reflect work carried out by the commission in the criminal area, for example, fraud and the indexation of fines.</P>
      <P>In regard to ensuring that all appropriate agencies in the criminal justice system are equipped to act in a more cohesive manner, the major programme of organisational reform which I have under way at present is a vital ingredient.  As the House will be aware, this is a time of unprecedented reform in the operation of our criminal justice system and the changes taking place under the umbrella of the Strategic Management Initiative are worthy of mention in that regard.  A Bill setting up an independent courts service has been published, legislation is being prepared to establish a prison authority and the House will be aware of developments last week regarding the Garda SMI.  Obviously, a key objective of all changes in these areas will be to attain the greatest possible level of cohesiveness among all the agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not have a closed mind on the type of issues raised in the Deputy's question.  I propose to publish a White Paper on crime in which these issues can be further addressed and I would obviously welcome Members' views on them.</P>

However, in the past three years we have had a raft of legislation in the criminal justice area, most of which is working well.  Does the Minister agree that such a commission could carry out a thorough appraisal of legislation to determine if we have a legislative overload?  I am speaking in particular in the context of what happened two weeks' ago and the matter which unravelled today in the High Court.  I welcome the McGuinness judgment, but because of the confusion five people are still at large and two appear to have absconded.</P>

      <P>We debated in great detail last week and the week before, the events surrounding the release of five persons who had been detained under the Drug Trafficking Act.  I indicated to the House then that it was not a function of a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, irrespective of his or her political persuasion, to interfere with or criticise Judicial judgments as it would be in breach of the separation of powers.  I do not intend to go over that ground again.  I am sure there is agreement that a very complex set of circumstances arose.  The High Court has made its judgment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question raises two distinct issues.  First, advice in relation to criminal law and, second, the issue of ensuring that agencies in the criminal justice system are equipped to deal with crime in a more cohesive manner. Proposals for reform of the criminal law would have to take into account the role of the respective agencies involved but it would be beyond the remit of an advisory body on reform of criminal law to be also charged with ensuring operational effectiveness and cohesiveness. However, in the context of the White Paper on crime I will look favourably on any realistic proposals made in either of these areas.  It is important to realise there is a major structural change under way in the justice system.  In a few years the criminal justice system will be unrecognisable. There will be a new courts service board and a new prisons authority.  I am also reviewing the probation service to try to improve its effectiveness in modern day society.</P>
      <P>In addition there is the question of the strategic management initiative report and all the changes it proposes which are under consideration today.  There is a major reform of criminal law and its structures and when all of these reforms are implemented we will have a more effective, streamlined and efficient criminal justice system. Meanwhile, I have repeatedly refused to interfere with or criticise judicial decisions despite the harshest criticism and questioning by Deputies.  It is very important for any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to recognise and acknowledge the separation of powers as stated in the Constitution.  I do not mean to labour this point but it appears to me there were some people who did not understand or refused to understand that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for more reform.  The Minister spoke of the separation of powers.  In a constitutional democracy, does he agree that it is important to have checks and balances? Thirty seven pieces of criminal law have been introduced in the last six years, including various referenda.  Does the Minister agree that this is a substantial amount of law?  Much of it was needed to tackle the sophistication of international criminals.  However, there must be order as well as law.  We are getting to a stage where there is a lot of law and very little order &mdash; all picture and no sound.  It is time to look at the effectiveness and efficiency of the various wings of Government, including the Garda and the courts.  Does the Minister agree that this House is right to be concerned that there is no debate on the increase of the Secret Service Vote from £250,000 to £750,000 in one year and the introduction of super grass witnesses?  Does he also agree it is important that the House is assured that future criminal justice provisions are needed and that they should be accompanied by certification to that effect?  Some criminal legislation, such as the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, is being used for purposes for which it was never intended.  If we keep introducing these laws they will be used against citizens who are not criminals as well as those who are criminals.  Let us be hard on crime and criminals.</P>

      <P>We welcome the Minister's reforming zeal in establishing a review group on the probation services.  Could he explain his extraordinary decision to exclude union representation for probation officers on that review group?  Is he not concerned by the reports in today's newspapers that probation officers are balloting on whether to take industrial action as a result of his extraordinary omission and exclusion?  Does the Minister agree that probation <Col N="1263" /> officers have been the most innovative and committed members of the Probation Services? Their exclusion is a grave omission and a serious mistake which is solely the Minister's responsibility. Will he address this problem and ensure that they have proper representation on what is, I presume, a key review group, since the Minister has included it as part of his reforms?</P>

      <P>It is hoped that the White Paper will be published in 1998.  In the first instance, it is my intention to establish a crime forum.  I envisage this will sit for five to eight weeks.  It will take on board the views of all those with an interest in the criminal justice system, criminal law and its effects on society.  I hope this will be followed by a national crime council and that everything will be included in a White Paper on crime.</P>
      <P>White Papers have been published over the years on various matters affecting people's lives. It is incongruous that we have not had a White Paper on crime and its effect on people and their property.  We need to address the causes of crime and how they can be minimised as well as the need for sanctions and for greater resources to be ploughed into the fight against crime.  A White Paper will not resolve all the difficulties and problems associated with crime but it is time, as we approach a new millennium, for a new and fresh approach to its causes and effects.  I am confident a White Paper will be published in 1998.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gay Mitchell's comments about the amount of legislation passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas in recent years and the need for checks and balances.  He mentioned the secret service Vote and the increased powers which have been given to the authorities.  He may agree that crime has become more sinister and organised in recent years and that it often involves the illegal supply of drugs.  As a society and Government, we must respond to this threat in the most appropriate manner possible and that often involves giving greater powers to the Garda.  For example, the Bill I introduced in the House last year when in Opposition, which allows for the freezing of assets, gives the Garda extensive powers which might not have been acceptable in society ten or 15 years ago but which people now recognise as being necessary.  It is important, as Deputy Gay Mitchell points out, to ensure there are balances to protect innocent citizens. These checks and balances are in place and the legislation passed in recent years is operating effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus mentioned the probation and welfare service.  I am aware of IMPACT's concern that it is not involved or represented on the new group which is reviewing the probation and welfare service.  However, IMPACT is not the only trade union representing the staff of the service.  I am satisfied that staff interests are fully represented on the group by a senior official from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It will be <Col N="1264" /> open to IMPACT to make a submission to the group if it so wishes.  It is my wish that it will cooperate with the group in its extremely important work.  I would be the first to acknowledge the tremendous work done by the probation and welfare service.  This review is taking place in appreciation and recognition of the work they have done and to see if their role can be expanded to reach further into society where problems exist so that they can be even more helpful than they have been in the past in the resolution of those problems.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel resources is a matter for the commissioner.  Present arrangements are that the Garda divisional officer-district officer takes direct responsibility for searches-investigations of persons who are reported missing.  Special investigation teams are appointed as necessary.  For the purpose of follow-up, missing persons are deemed to warrant attention by the Garda Síochána if they are under 18 years of age or elderly, or physically or mentally handicapped, or are missing in circumstances which give rise to fears for their safety.</P>
      <P>The question of the value of a centralised Garda national missing persons unit is kept under continuous review.  There are arguments for and against such a proposal.  I understand that the Garda Commissioner considers that investigations of missing persons are more effective when they have the kind of local focus which is achieved under present arrangements.  Local officers have available to them, as required, the services of all the specialist units and manpower which are part of the overall Garda organisation structure.</P>
      <P>The matter is one which merits being kept under review.  In this regard, officials of my Department, together with members of the Garda Síochána, will be travelling to the UK in the new year to assess the potential value of a new investigation initiative there, involving analysis of data using sophisticated computer software as an aid to investigations.  If the initiative shows sufficient promise I will consider its adoption in this country.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Does the Minister not recall that when he was in Opposition he gave a clear and categorical assurance that, in Government, he would establish a specialist missing persons unit within the Garda Síochána?  Does he not recall that that statement was made in the wake of the tragic and heartbreaking disappearance of Ms Jo Jo Dollard?  Does he not recall that <Col N="1265" /> he spelt out the merits of a highly specialist unit dedicated specifically to deal with this issue? Does he not recall that he said it was a matter which had to be taken very seriously in the light of the number of people, particularly women, who disappear or go missing from time to time?</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Higgins's powers of retention have not diminished with the passing months.  Of course I recall it.  That is why I made clear in my reply that officials of the Department, together with members of the Garda Síochána, will be travelling to the UK in the new year to assess the potential value of a new investigative initiative there which will involve the kind of analysis which I outlined to the House.</P>
      <P>It is something which I favoured in Opposition, as Deputy Higgins stated, and which I am reviewing in Government.  As the Deputy will be aware, the decision on establishment is one which would have to be taken by the Garda Commissioner because it is an operational matter.  My predecessor, Deputy Owen, indicated to me on a number of occasions in this House that she agreed it was a matter which should be taken seriously and considered, and it is being taken seriously and considered.</P>

      <P>I have spoken to the families of the missing women and I know the Minister appreciates the terrible trauma involved.  It is important that we learn the lessons of countries such as Belgium, where missing persons cases were not tackled quickly and carefully enough, and systems were not put in place to ensure that every necessary action was taken.  The Minister should treat this as an urgent matter and should ensure we have in place the systems to provide the necessary co-ordination of information.  He mentioned new computer software; what is the timescale for introducing the new systems?</P>

      <P>What determines whether a person is missing?  Is the Minister aware that in my constituency a man was dead in his bed for a number of years, was neither collecting his social welfare pension nor paying local authority rent but the fact that he was missing or out of circulation was never reported to the authorities?  Will the Minister inform the House whether there is co-ordination between local authorities, health boards, the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs and the Garda to report the fact that persons have suddenly ceased either to pay their rent or collect their pensions?  Does that trigger a missing persons investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Garda Síochána is concerned, missing persons are deemed to warrant its attention if they are under the age of 18, elderly, physically or mentally handicapped or have gone missing in suspicious circumstances, <Col N="1266" /> that is, circumstances which would give rise to fears for their safety.  I trust that answer's Deputy Mitchell's question.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Fitzgerald, that is a matter of grave concern.  I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner, with whom I have had a number of discussions on this matter, that he has had, and would have, no hesitation deploying whatever resources are necessary to trace missing persons.</P>
      <P>There is certainly a missing persons problem. Men account for approximately 70 per cent of all persons missing since 1990 and there does not appear to be an undue representation of young women in the figures.  At least 22 persons went missing near the coast, at dangerous locations such as cliffs, etc., or were last seen on boats and trawlers.  Some were also last seen at ferry ports, which might be taken to suggest they went missing of their own volition.  We must face the tragic reality that foul play may have been a factor in some cases.</P>
      <P>The figures conform to some extent to the broad picture emerging from research into suicide. For example, instances of males going missing and male suicide cluster in the early twenties and early forties age groups.  For the period 1990 to 1996, inclusive, 10,614 persons were reported missing to the Garda Síochána and of this figure, 75 people are still missing.  That is a cause of considerable concern and approaching Christmas one must be conscious that this is a difficult time for the relatives of those who are missing.</P>
      <P>I can only reiterate that the authorities will be assessing the position in the UK to see whether that initiative should be adopted here.  In the meantime, the commissioner will deploy whatever manpower and resources are necessary to find missing persons.  I hope this indicates to the House the degree of concern with which this is being treated and that it will be of some comfort to those who must go through the distress and trauma of not knowing where there loved ones are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify developments in relation to the recent action of Welsh farmers against imports of beef from this country. The background to the matter is that a group or groups of Welsh farmers have, over the past two days, chosen to express their dissatisfaction with the policies of the United Kingdom Government by blockading Irish beef arriving by ferry from Ireland and destroying one consignment.  Their dissatisfaction relates, I understand, to the level of prices being paid to Welsh producers and to the UK handling of the effects of revaluation on prices.</P>
      <P>The action is not only illegal but totally unacceptable.  Free trade in agricultural products is a central plank of the Common Agricultural Policy and the EU single market.  No amount of dissatisfaction on the part of any group with the policies of a particular administration can justify impeding free trade.  In any case, I cannot see how such action is in any way helpful to the case being made by UK beef producers and the UK beef industry generally.</P>
      <P>Immediately following the first incident at Holyhead on Sunday night and Monday morning contact was made with the UK authorities through our Embassy in London and through the UK Embassy here.  My concerns about the action taken were made very clear to the UK agriculture ministry, the Welsh Office and the police authorities responsible for the port area.  I also spoke this morning to the Secretary of State for Wales, Mr. Ron Davies, and made it clear that the UK was an extremely important market for us and that everything possible should be done to allow our product be exported and traded there without restriction or impediment.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to unrestricted access for our product which complies with the various regulatory requirements and standards.  The UK authorities have fully accepted the validity of our complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free movement of goods to a member state of the EU is the responsibility of the authorities <Col N="1268" /> in that state.  I have made very clear to the UK authorities my concern that this principle be upheld by the appropriate authorities and by whatever action is required at local level in the current circumstances, notwithstanding the views of the local producers.  I welcome the statements made by the UK authorities, the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Jack Cunningham, and the Secretary of State for Wales, Mr. Ron Davies, condemning the action of the Welsh farmers.  The UK farmers' union has also condemned this action.</P>
    <P>I will continue to follow up this matter carefully to ensure the sentiments expressed are translated into direct action on the ground to allow Irish consignments enter UK ports and continue on their journey.  Compensation for loss is primarily a matter to be taken up directly with the UK authorities by the companies involved.  I am due to meet Mr. Jack Cunningham, my counterpart in the UK.  I will also speak to him later this afternoon. I hope the various representations made to the UK authorities will succeed in resolving this matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>The House is pleased to hear the Minister has met the Secretary of State for Wales and made representations to the UK Minister for Agriculture, Jack Cunningham.  Does he agree the most serious view must be taken of what was an outrageous and unjustified attack on our produce?  To be too conciliatory at this stage may be the wrong approach.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister take further measures to ensure our producers are adequately compensated for this outrage?  Has he asked the UK Secretary of State for Wales and the Minister for Agriculture to ensure there will be no recurrence?</P>
      <P>Given their close collaboration on European issues, have the farming organisations made representations to their counterparts in the UK? Does the Minister have information on the implications for jobs in Ireland following this awful behaviour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the strongest possible representations to the authorities in the UK. There was no question of any conciliatory references by me.  I condemned the matter outright.  It is illegal.  As a member state of the EU we are entitled to free trade in goods and services to the UK, which is a traditional and important market.</P>
      <P>There is no question of dumping any product, nor of price undercutting.  I received assurances from the UK authorities that it was a matter for the police authorities, with whom our Embassy is in contact, and that every step is being taken to ensure that we are allowed free and unimpeded access to the markets in the UK.</P>

      <P>I am not sure.  That is a matter for the UK authorities.  I am assured the UK Government <Col N="1269" /> will take resolute action against illegal activity by protesters.  That was made clear by the Secretary of State for Wales, who was interviewed on &ldquo;The News at One&rdquo; today.</P>
      <P>Farming organisations have contacted me and my office.  They are making appropriate representations on the matter.  Everything that can be done is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister raise with the Secretary of State for Wales the security arrangements and how they were breached to allow this action be taken at the ports in Wales?  Did the Secretary of State advise him on the practical measures he intends to take to ensure these ports are kept open for the future and that there is not a recurrence of these incidents?  Is he concerned about the increasing use of the tactic of blockading and disrupting ports during disputes, not only in France but also in the UK?  Has he any plans with his Government colleagues to raise this issue at EU level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary of State for Wales assured me he made direct contact with the police authorities responsible for the ports in the area and was pursuing the matter of the illegality of the first protest.  I understand that the protest last night was peaceful in that the ferries were disrupted and made turn around.  There was no illegal activity, whereas on the previous night the consignment was destroyed.  This afternoon the Secretary of State is meeting the police authorities responsible for the ports and the Welsh farmers' union in order to put a stop to such action and ensure normality is restored.  The Secretary of State reminded the farmers' union that it was one of the first bodies to protest when similar events recently occurred in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Holyhead is a private port and not public property.  In this context, how was a cavalcade of 400 cars given access to the port to act in an outrageously illegal manner?  Why did the UK police, who were presumably outnumbered, not know in advance about what was going to happen?  Four hundred car loads of farmers from various parts of Wales drove into a private port, drove out our imports and dumped goods to the value of £100,000 into the sea.</P>
      <P>What happened on Sunday night was worse than what happened last night, but last night's events, hovering between legal and illegal action, included strong intimidatory actions which caused our drivers to come back with their supplies.  Such intimidatory action, either physical or psychological, does not constitute a peaceful protest and must be illegal if it prevents our products entering the UK.  Just because they did not throw the goods into the sea on Monday night does not mean the action was less intimidatory.</P>
      <P>I note the point the Minister made about compensation, but it is important that those seeking compensation have his active support.  Is he prepared to give that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Tesco was the destination of the £100,000 shipment which raises a very important issue for Irish suppliers, namely, that of a major multinational purchaser of Irish food products losing confidence in its source of supply as a result of such activities.  I ask the Minister to consider what steps he should take to give confidence to Tesco. I understand the consignment was replaced and brought in through another port.  I would like confirmation of this.  It is important for Irish suppliers that major international purchasers such as Tesco can be sure of the supplies they purchase in Ireland reaching them on time.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on doing his best, but as the action was repeated on Monday night despite his very strong protest on Monday, and that one Welsh farmer stated that those involved were only warming up, what further action does the Minister propose to take?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's maritime experience is evident when he speaks about Holyhead.  I understand the protesters were a maverick group of Welsh farmers that did not have the authority of the Welsh farmers' union which condemned the action.  The farmers gained access to Holyhead port in a dawn raid.  The police were unable to prevent what happened.  I have the strongest possible assurances from the authorities, including the Secretary of State's Office, that this will not happen again.  Our Embassy in London is in hourly contact with the police authorities responsible for the ports.</P>
      <P>I will actively support the companies involved who have made a claim for compensation.  Tesco and the other stores in the UK form a very important market for Ireland.  We export up to 100,000 tonnes or £200 million worth of produce to them per annum.  At this time of year, in the run up to Christmas, that market is extremely valuable.  We will do whatever we can to reassure stores in Britain of the continuity of supply.  My information is that replacement goods have been supplied, through a different port, to the supermarkets concerned.</P>
      <P>As soon as I leave the Chamber I will be contacting Jack Cunningham, my counterpart in the UK, to ensure this action stops.  This is a traditional market and we are not dumping or underselling products.  We have a legitimate trade with the UK and we can point to the fact that we are major importers of food, spending some several hundred million pounds per annum in this area under EU regulations.  We want to continue to do that.</P>

      <P>I will ensure this matter is raised at EU level.  The Council of Agriculture Ministers is due to meet in the near future and I understand this issue was raised at the most recent meeting of the Council of Trade Ministers.  From time to time, due to frustrations of one kind or another, producers take this kind of action.  I recall some time ago Irish farmers dumped potatoes into the sea at Dundalk, although it was an isolated incident. That kind of action is not a proper way to express frustration; it is illegal, out of order and contrary to EU rules.  I will raise the matter at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.</P>

Irish factories have today reduced the price of beef by 2p per pound and cattle prices have decreased by between £5 and £10 at Irish marts.  Given that set of circumstances, will the Minister do everything in his power to ensure this does not continue?  If this action continues for another few days we will find ourselves in a very serious position.  Will the Minister go to the Competitions Commissioner in Brussels if the British Government are unable to deal with this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge Deputy Connaughton's comments about the effect the blockade has had on cattle prices in the marts and on the ground.  At the end of the day, it is the responsibility of every State to ensure the law is upheld and it is the responsibility of the UK authorities to ensure the police allow free access of Irish goods to the UK market.  I have made every effort possible, on an hourly basis, to ensure this matter is resolved as quickly as possible and that the condemnation of this disruption by UK Ministers is translated into action on the ground.  I want them to direct the police authorities to ensure the safe passage of goods from Ireland to their UK destinations.</P>

Many Tesco, Sainsburys and other stores which Irish producers supply are located throughout the UK and our hauliers cannot make loops around the coast to get access to the UK or any other corridor. I have made that clear and I hope my representations will be effective and lead to an early resolution of this matter.</P>

Two members from each party will form a sub-group which will identify the key issues from all the work they have done since 24 September. They will also address how they will deal with the format and arrangements for dealing with each of those issues.  I know the members <Col N="1276" /> would like to conclude that by the week beginning 15 December, but it would be unfair to put a deadline on it.  That is their plan.  It would mean that by the Christmas period we would have, hopefully, the list of items which require attention and the means by which they would hope to move each of those issues forward in the session after Christmas.</P>

The research by Trinity College on those travelling to England was initiated by the previous Government.  This information would be useful and should be in the public arena.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,659,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment in the year ending 31 December 1997 for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach, and for the payment of grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises from a variety of factors.  A number of new public services commenced operations under the aegis of my Department in 1997.  These are the National Partnership Centre, the Information Society Commission and Territorial Employment Pacts.  Services in respect of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act have been reactivated.  It is appropriate that the costs arising on some special services such as the Moriarty Tribunal of Inquiry, the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality and the all-party committee on the strategic management initiative should be borne by my Department.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to make substantial organisational arrangements in my Department since July 1997 to take account of these new services, to adjust for a number of services which were transferred to other Departments and to provide for the administrative arrangements directly related to a change of Government.  These factors gave rise to increased financial demands above the level estimated for the general administration of the Department, including salaries, travel and official entertainment and a wide range of utilities costs.  The final costs of the EU Presidency were also discharged in 1997 above the estimated level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's services in the area of partnership are critically important.  Ireland's economic performance in recent times has been impressive.  Every imaginable superlative has been used to describe our success.  The statistics speak for themselves: 5.5 per cent average growth per annum during the past ten years compared to 1.8 per cent during the previous decade; the lowest inflation rate in the EU; buoyant Exchequer returns which indicate that the general government balance, the measure used for Maastricht Treaty purposes, should record a surplus for the year; and record creation of new jobs &mdash; 41,000 <Col N="1281" /> more people at work in April this year than at the same time last year giving a total increase of 186,000 during the four year period since 1993. Forecasts for 1998 predict a further increase of over 50,000 people at work.</P>
    <P>The positive effects of these performance indicators on the economic well-being of our people are evident throughout the country.  Many reasons have been advanced to explain Ireland's exceptional performance.  The truth is that, as with all growing economies, success is rooted in a multitude of factors and policies working in an appropriate balance with one another.  What is unique in the Irish context is the mechanism which enables that balance to be struck.  It boils down to one word &mdash; partnership.</P>
    <P>The national partnership agreements since 1987 have been the bedrock of Ireland's achievements during the past decade.  They have provided a framework for stability that had been markedly absent in previous years.  That is clear from any number of perspectives &mdash; growth rates, industrial relations, inflation figures, Exchequer returns, emigration statistics, numbers of people at work and so on.</P>
    <P>At national level, the four social partnership pillars &mdash; employers and business, the trade unions, farmers and the voluntary sector &mdash; work together with Government to advance the agreed set of commitments outlined in Partnership 2000. Although each pillar and constituent organisation has its own special interests and concerns, they work in a spirit of co-operation towards fulfilment of the partnership agreement.  The Government does likewise but, additionally, it is obliged to act as co-ordinator and facilitator, frequently spanning a vast range of sectoral interests and concerns.  That unique and crucial role often falls to my Department.  Considerable resources are required to fulfil that role effectively.  Having regard to the scale of national benefits the administrative costs are modest.</P>
    <P>Under Partnership 2000 a range of mechanisms is in place to ensure expeditious implementation of the agreement.  These include a secretariat which services the quarterly plenary meetings in all respects, from logistical arrangements to the production of progress reports.  In addition, officials from my Department chair, or are otherwise represented on, a significant number of groups operating under the auspices of the partnership. These groups deal with a wide range of economic, fiscal and social issues of particular concern to some, or all, of the social partner organisations.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead, the years to the new millennium and beyond offer particular opportunities and present unique challenges for Ireland, especially in the context of our entry into economic and monetary union.  We must continue to achieve sustainable, competitive advantage, particularly in an enlarged and more integrated European Union.  Central to that aim is the implementation of Partnership 2000 in order to best position the country to meet the challenges <Col N="1282" /> and avail of the opportunities which will inevitably ensue.</P>
    <P>Equally important, we must continue our earnest efforts toward bringing about a more equitable distribution of the nation's increasing wealth. The Government's agreement with the social partners provides an imaginative and effective framework to progress that agenda and is complemented by the Government's own Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>In short, we must learn from the mistakes of the past and, perhaps more importantly, the successes. We should continue to remind ourselves of what is being done correctly and what could be done better.  The partnership process provides the framework to do just that.  In particular, it focuses the efforts of Government and the social partners on realising our shared vision of a better future for all our people.  It is in such a context that adequate resources are essential.  In part that represents the reason for my moving this Supplementary Estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>Another key part of the Government's strategy for promoting partnership in the years and decades ahead is the National Partnership Centre. Arising from the commitment in Partnership 2000, a National Centre for Partnership was established in May last under the aegis of my Department.  Its key task is to promote and facilitate a new, more co-operative relationship between unions, employers and employees at workplace level in the private and public sectors. The centre has two full-time executives and other administrative appointments will be made in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate provides £193,000 for the cost of salaries, office equipment, travel and subsistence, training and promotion, design and printing, research and office maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate covers costs in relation to progressing the important work of the Information Society Commission.  The commission, established in May last, is playing a vital role in overseeing the implementation of the strategic framework for the development of the information society in Ireland.  It is currently preparing an interim report which will identify areas for action to position Ireland to maximise the benefits of technology in the years ahead and will also include its work programme for the coming year. In this Supplementary Estimate, the 1997 allocation of £249,000 for the commission relates to six months of operations this year and includes set-up costs.</P>
    <P>Territorial employment pacts &mdash; TEPs &mdash; are an exciting new pan-European Union initiative, established by the European Commission, to encourage regional and local partnership in tackling long-term unemployment and disadvantage in a cohesive, co-ordinated and integrated manner. There were 88 TEPs selected throughout the European Union, four of which are in Ireland. The Commission's proposal of the pacts is a recognition of the importance of broadening the <Col N="1283" /> partnership principle and of intersectoral co-operation at local level to tackle unemployment. Therefore, the Irish pacts will build on the experience of the area-based partnerships already in place under the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development.  Our local development approach has been recognised internationally as a useful model for tackling disadvantage, acknowledged as such by the European Commission in its endorsement of the pacts.  It is important that we continue to be at the leading edge in implementing the pacts in Ireland and I am confident we shall be successful in doing so.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate provides £60,000 Irish co-financing for the pacts which are 75 per cent grant-aided by the European Union.  The territorial employment pacts have the full support of the social partners at national level, receiving endorsement under Partnership 2000.  Their success calls for the participation and support of employers, workers, State agencies and indeed all who can bring worthwhile ideas for action to the table.</P>
    <P>As Members will be aware, from February 1996 meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation were deferred until a basis had been restored on which, consistent with its terms of reference and the basis on which it was established, it could agree to meet in a fully inclusive format. Following the restoration of the IRA ceasefire on 20 July last, this became possible.  It has been decided to hold occasional meetings of the forum commencing with one on Friday next, 5 December, 1997.</P>
    <P>A total of £40,000 is being provided this year for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  This is to cover costs associated with the forum, including that of the meeting this week, the cost of the printing of proceedings of that meeting and of some outstanding proceedings.</P>
    <P>A total of £50,000 is being provided to fund projects this year under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust.  This is to cover an amount, which had been envisaged by the former Taoiseach and with which I agreed, for the Institute of Irish Studies in the University of Liverpool.  This amount is part of a total figure of £180,000 which will provide sponsorship of the lectureship in modern Irish language and literature in the institute over a five year period.  The institute received funding from the trust in previous years to establish the lectureship.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware I recently announced a further allocation of £150,000 from the trust towards the cost of a First World War memorial in Messines in Belgium for all the Irishmen who died in the conflict.  The total provision is, therefore, £200,000 for the current year.</P>
    <P>These allocations have been made from moneys which will accrue to the Irish Government in connection with the winding up of the Irish Soldiers and Sailors Land Trust, on foot of an agreement on division of the proceeds, made with the British Government some years ago.  The <Col N="1284" /> trust was set up in 1922 to provide houses for Irish ex-servicemen who fought with the British Armed Forces in the First World War.  It is currently in the process of being wound up and when all the necessary procedures for winding up the trust have been completed, the money will become available.  The Irish Government's share will be somewhat more than a million pounds.  I will shortly seek Dáil approval of a motion to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>A provision of £300,000 is proposed for the tribunal in the current year for all legal and administrative costs.  Work on the preliminary investigations specified in the terms of reference has commenced, and Mr. Justice Moriarty has indicated that he hopes to complete his task and finish his report by mid-1998.  The administrative staff which served the McCracken tribunal have remained in place to serve the new tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate includes a provision to meet the expenses of the <i>ad hoc</i> Commission on Referendum Information.  The commission was established by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to encourage informed debate on the positive and negative implications of the proposed constitutional amendment on Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> commission consisted of the Ombudsman, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.  It supervised the production of an information advertisement, within parameters it could lay down, containing statements of the case for and against the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>To ensure the statements were prepared in a fair and impartial manner, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government invited the President of the Bar Council to nominate two senior counsel, one to draw up a statement for the case and the other a statement against, having regard to arguments advanced publicly on either side and to submissions made to them.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the proposed <i>ad hoc</i> commission is £400,000.  In line with precedent the cost is to be borne by the Vote of my Department which sponsored the referendum.</P>
    <P>In response to views expressed by Members I propose that an Oireachtas Committee on the strategic management initiative be established, the details of which will be announced shortly.  A token provision of £5,000 is being provided to meet possible expenses of the committee during the remainder of this year.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House earlier, substantial organisational arrangements were required in my Department in the course of the year.  Accordingly, expenditure in my Department's administrative budget will exceed the amounts estimated. To a large extent this arises because of the change of Government in the course of the year. Additional costs inevitably occur in these circumstances, in particular as a result of severance payments due to staff of the outgoing administration. There are also extra administrative costs associated with this change and with the transfer of staff and functions to other Government Departments. <Col N="1285" /> Payments relating to the EU Presidency were discharged in 1997 and were higher than the amounts previously estimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the Estimate he introduced and the outline he gave to the House.  I put down a marker in regard to a matter I am concerned about and which I wish to draw to the attention of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>In the past five or six years, 37 criminal law Bills were laid before this House.  Some of them contained draconian powers and almost all were passed into law.  The Taoiseach, with the assistance of the Attorney General, needs to take a role in monitoring the situation which is developing; we are approaching a law and order problem with much law and little order.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy who has stood for law and order for many years, I make no apology for my approach.  If we do not have law and order the most feeble will suffer.  Law and order is a human rights and a social justice issue but it must be enforced in a way which does not bypass the constitutional requirements for checks and balances in our democracy, provides for accountability from those given strong powers and only provides such powers where they are clearly necessary. Law and order requires prison reform, efficient as well as effective policing, statistical analysis which allows for measurement of success and-or failure and a courts system which, though independent, must modernise where it is wise to do so.</P>
      <P>In addition to passing laws, we have started to modernise the administration of the courts ten years after I first introduced the Courts (Administration Reform) Bill, 1986, but we have done precious little about prison reform.  Many of the laws passed were necessary because of the sophisticated capability of organised criminals. However, there comes a time when we must ask if we need ever mounting new criminal laws giving more and more powers to the Garda.  Before enacting any more criminal law provisions of that kind, the Taoiseach should consider appointing a wise person, such as the former Ombudsman, the former Comptroller and Auditor General, the soon to retire President of the High Court or, perhaps, a former President to examine independently the current state of criminal law and identify if any gaps remain.  Only after that type of process should we consider conferring more powers.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Public Order Act, 1993, was meant to tackle problems of loitering.  I objected to a section in that Bill.  Using that section to which I objected, the first prosecution under that Act was taken against the distribution of a leaflet by a group, but that was not the intention of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The use of the Offences Against the State Act has been common, even for non-subversives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a new development in the use of supergrass witnesses which was not discussed in this House.  News reports blast out all day long that a defendant before a court is believed by the Garda to be the murderer of a journalist, even though he has not been charged.  Gardaí search and arrest people in circumstances where the media are forewarned, thereby attaching guilt and blame where none may lie.  One could be forgiven for wondering if we have a propaganda department or a public relations department in the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>The Garda are not only a police force but the guardian of the peace.  There is a need for greater accountability from the management of the force.  Furthermore, elected representatives must be free to make constructive criticism without being the subject of abuse in a Garda magazine or a leaked innuendo by Garda sources.  Let us have law and order, but that order must include checks and balances if the cure is not to be as bad as the disease.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is at the coalface but the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach must take a detached view of overall needs and involve the Attorney General, who has a constitutional duty to ensure the system works, as it is required to do, fairly for each citizen and as any one section of the community might want it to.  That is a responsibility held by the Attorney General and, traditionally, the Taoiseach has answered for the Attorney General on policy issues of that kind in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supergrass evidence has now been introduced and, if it is to be used in the future, there should be regulations governing its use.  There is a proposed increase in the secret service Vote from £250,000 to £750,000, presumably for use in <Col N="1287" /> rewarding informants.  All those powers if used against criminals can be effective, but it is for the Executive, the Oireachtas and the courts to ensure a separation of powers and checks and balances to defend the innocent.  I put down a marker that we should reflect on how to deal effectively with crime and its causes within a democratic framework and I hope the Taoiseach will reflect on those words.  I am not opposed to any of the harsh measures taken to improve criminal law, but there comes a time when it must be accompanied by order and there must be checks and balances.</P>
    <P>Regarding Partnership 2000, the Taoiseach referred to the advances made.  I recommend that during the quietness of the Christmas period he should examine how beneficial the Programme for National Recovery, PESP 1 and 2, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and Partnership 2000 have been in closing the gap in society to give those who are deprived a better chance to participate.  If we want to give people equality of opportunity we should tackle the housing conditions in which they live.  Some conditions particularly those in inner city flat complexes, are unacceptable.  We should also provide access to third level education, which is not on the agenda for large sections of the community, particularly for those who live in inner city areas, including Dublin.</P>
    <P>On the question of tolerance, the House should put forward proposals on racial tolerance before this issue, which is clearly of concern to the community, is dealt with improperly and the House should deal with it in a sensitive and balanced way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the territorial employment pacts.  As a former Minister with responsibility for local development at the Department of the Taoiseach, I was pleased to hear this, particularly as it relates to local development.  I would like make a suggestion to the Taoiseach which may have already been made.  It was my ambition to try to make Ireland a centre of excellence for local development, although I did not get the opportunity to bring it to fruition.  No country in Europe has the experience of participative democracy we have.  Our system is not perfect and is being refined as we go along.  For example, there is a need to tie in representative democracy and participative democracy so that elected representatives, whether councillors or TDs, are not by-passed because it is the public purse, European or Irish, which funds local development.</P>
    <P>Our thinking on local development fits nicely into the territorial pacts proposal made by President Santer and which the Taoiseach mentioned. Indeed, we had a major input into that proposal and all European Council conclusions since and including the Essen Declaration where local development initiatives have been mentioned. There is a need for the European Union and the 11 applicant states to tackle disadvantage.  Local <Col N="1288" /> development, as we know it through the partnership process, is a vehicle for doing that in the five fingers in a glove integrated approach which it takes.  I acknowledge the need for refinement of the local development process but we cannot always ensure the horse goes before the cart. While there is a need for refinement, the idea is good.</P>
    <P>We should ask the European Union, not only in the context of the existing Fifteen but in that of a union of 26 or more member states, to see if we can make a fairer society and tackle the sources and causes of disadvantage.  Let us see how local development, as we have developed it and as was studied by the OECD which gave an impartial and fair view of how it operates here, can influence and lead Europe.  Let us seek to have the European centre of excellence for this participative democracy and local development partnership approach here.  We could lead Europe and the world and give a great service to Europe if that came about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is substantial in real terms given the overall size of the Taoiseach's budget.  Much of it is inevitable and unavoidable and it is not being opposed by my party.  I would like to ask a couple of questions to which the Taoiseach may be in a position to reply.  If he cannot respond, he may avail of an opportunity to communicate with me later.</P>
      <P>The first question relates to the national partnership centre, which I strongly support.  The sum of money made available for what is a body with only two paid executives is fairly substantial.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will take the opportunity to outline when the programme of work will be made available to a wider public than that participating in it and say if the question of its housing and accommodation has been resolved.  It is not desirable that it should be physically housed in the Department of the Taoiseach.  Temporarily, it had to be given a home but if it is to be given the manifest autonomy it requires, it should be taken out of the Government Buildings complex.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will be in a position to respond.</P>
      <P>I welcome the additional £30,000 for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  Obviously, the money required is not only being used for the one day event later this week but for some backup and good report work which should be properly documented and made available to the public. They are essential documents in the building of confidence, North and South.  I welcome the fact that an opportunity has been taken to get extra money to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who is a former Minister for Finance, is probably in breach of every known sound accountancy rule in raiding the Sailors' and Soldiers' Trust and using it as a bounty fund to disperse money in a different and specific way. However, he is following the practice and precedent of his predecessor, so I cannot criticise him on that basis.  It is wrong in principle that <Col N="1289" /> money accruing to the Exchequer as a result of the winding up of a particular trust, irrespective of its origin, is retained like an escrow account for disbursement by a Government Department &mdash; in this case, the Department of the Taoiseach. Having regard to the nature in which the trust was established and its purpose, it might be more appropriate if the proceeds were used to contribute to the cost of the Army deafness compensation fund.  It is bad accountancy practice and that it has been established should not go unnoticed on this side of the House.  It should not be encouraged.  I assure the Taoiseach that this precedent will be cited in future on the grounds that two Taoisigh utilised this money, albeit for undoubtedly good purposes.  I do not doubt the bona fides and appropriateness of the centre for Irish studies in the University of Liverpool or the proposed memorial in Belgium.</P>
    <P>As regards the referendum, would the Taoiseach outline why this money is dealt with in his Vote and not the Department of the Environment and Local Government?  I am open to correction but I recall that the Department of Finance had to bear the cost of an explanatory memorandum relating to the divorce referendum, because there was no provision for it in the then Department of Equality and Law Reform.  This may be an accountancy device to place it in the Vote of one Department rather than another.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that, having successfully transferred responsibility for the area based partnerships and local development from the Department of the Taoiseach &mdash; where I believed it should never have been in the first place &mdash; the Taoiseach has not followed through the logic of that correct decision and has notionally and nominally retained responsibility for the territorial employment pacts within his Department.  It may simply be an accountancy device because the operational programme for local urban and rural development is associated with his Department.  I believe the operation of the area based partnerships was not enhanced by its location in the Department of the Taoiseach.  While it is a horizontal, multi-disciplinary activity which crosses over the remit of a number of Departments and it made some sense for the Department of the Taoiseach to have responsibility for it, that Department should not get directly involved in operational activities.  I believe that was the sense of the Taoiseach's decision to transfer the responsibility to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation &mdash; if I am correct in assuming that is the Department in which it is now located.  The Taoiseach might be able to explain why this was done with this relatively small sum of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty with the way the Taoiseach has allocated responsibilities since he took office.  I refer specifically to the recommendation of the National Economic and Social Council that pilot studies be conducted on rural renewal.  The Taoiseach laid much emphasis on <Col N="1290" /> partnership.  I am unsure whether he is aware that there has been no informed debate in this House on rural development.  There has been a withdrawal of public services in rural areas which has led to mass emigration, particularly from the West.  When I was Minister of State, seven or eight pilot studies were undertaken on the recommendation of NESC which is led by the Department of the Taoiseach.  These pilot studies were done in the context of Agenda 2000 and the territorial employment pacts.  To my horror, responsibility for rural renewal has now been transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;rural&rdquo; implies an agricultural content, but the idea of renewal means, for example, putting a one stop shop in a place like Feakle, for which funding was provided by the former Minister for Finance.  Now there is no provision for these people who have a three year programme.</P>
      <P>Rural renewal has been successful.  It is community driven, and no politics are involved.  I invite the Taoiseach to communicate with the officials in his Department who have been working on rural renewal and who have drawn up an interim report.  Rural renewal has involved a conversion of people, particularly trade union people, who work for public services, who have made themselves available to people in country areas to provide a service where post office, health and bus services etc.  had been withdrawn. In Feakle, to give that example alone, there are services available from all the public services at least once a month.  The lack of transport facilities has been a challenge all over the West and in every rural area, but the other day, owing to an agreement between Bus Éireann and the school bus authorities, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Davern, was able to launch a new bus service for old folk at a reasonable cost.</P>
      <P>All the benefits of the pilot studies will be lost if the Taoiseach passes the responsibility to the Department of Agriculture and Food which has other problems and does not want the headache of trying to renew a post office in Ballydehob or a health clinic in Castletownbere.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to review this issue of renewal.  There is a clear distinction between development and renewal.  Development involves services, public and private.  Cranny, County Clare, where the post office was closed has taken up one of the pilot schemes and it has led to a renewal of the parish, uniting the community and providing services over a ten mile radius &mdash; people are coming to Cranny who had not been there for years, to avail of the banking services there now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to work out what funds will be necessary in the future when the interim and final reports are made because I am quite certain there will be a necessity to continue building on the existing schemes.  I am not saying they will all be successful.  There was a study done in Letterfrack with the use of EU funds and particular problems were identified, but no solutions were provided. The rural renewal schemes initiated during the lifetime of the last Government are providing solutions, <Col N="1291" /> and showing ways of proceeding.  The department of rural development in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, which is supervised by Michael Kenny, is very soundly based.  Every time I tabled a question on rural renewal to the Taoiseach it was transferred to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Officials of the House persuaded me my questions were spurious and should not be tabled to the Taoiseach.  I could have said the Taoiseach knew nothing about rural areas but I have not adopted this approach.  I merely want him to look at what is going on.</P>
    <P>We see much of the human side of the Taoiseach every day in photographs published in the newspapers and his Department must adopt a hands-on approach to social issues.  When the Taoiseach was on this side of the House he championed issues such as the development of partnerships and the renewal of areas of his city.  The pilot schemes introduced by the previous Government were tremendous and I am disappointed the officials in the Taoiseach's Department did not fight harder to keep them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring the points made by Deputy Mitchell to the attention of the Attorney General.  I agree with the overall thrust of Deputy Quinn's points.  On the points made by Deputy Carey, if all these sections were in the Taoiseach's Department he would not have to deal with other Departments.  It was intended that all these aspects should be dealt with by the line Departments. There are often arguments about which is the correct line Department.  However, this is not a reason for including all these aspects in the Taoiseach's Department.  The Taoiseach must ensure he is familiar with what is going on in the line Departments and if there are turf wars between two or three of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he must talk to them and co-ordinate the activities.  I discuss the various issues every day so that I have an overall view.</P>
      <P>It is not the fault of the officials who work hard on these issues but if these matters are split between many Departments it makes it very difficult to deal with them.  This is what happened in a number of areas over many years.  Successive Taoisigh endeavoured to correct the issue and all of them were successful in their own way.  When Deputy Quinn and I were in Government some years ago we dealt with arts, culture and the Gaeltacht issues.  If I remember correctly, we found that seven Departments were responsible for different aspects of these issues.  I have not heard anyone argue that the present position is not better.  It is not always possible to bring all these matters together but it is better to have libraries, museums and other services in this area under one Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the subject matter of a parliamentary question is not my responsibility then I do not answer <Col N="1292" /> it.  However, this does not mean I have no interest in the matter.  I will raise with the appropriate people Deputy Carey's point on the differences between rural development and rural renewal.</P>
    <P>On the National Partnership Centre, I take Deputy Quinn's point that the £197,000 was basically paid to two individuals.  Much of this money was spent on setting up the centre.  The executives have also commissioned much research.  They have some clerical assistants but do not have any senior staff.  I will meet those involved shortly.  In their short-term work programme they are considering best practices and looking at genuine partnerships that have worked, mainly in the private sector where people have followed through with participative and work councils. Some semi-State companies have a long track record in that regard and they hope to learn from experience in that area.  They are also anxious to organise training programmes which will lead to partnerships and that would be useful.</P>
    <P>From our respective careers in the Departments of Finance and Labour, Deputy Quinn and I are aware that many industries and companies would be glad to form partnerships, but there is a fear of doing so because of a lack of information on the issue.  The National Partnership Centre &mdash; Deputy Quinn made available money for its establishment &mdash; should provide information on the benefits of partnerships.  If information was readily available rather than only when there is a crisis, such as in the face of closure, and people were trained in the workplace, which the centre hopes to do, that would build up trust and confidence.</P>

      <P>For convenience purposes they are accommodated in the offices of the Department of the Taoiseach.  I will raise that matter with the officials when I meet them.  The Information Society is accommodated in Dublin Castle, and I am sure it would be possible for the centre to use that venue, which is associated with meetings on Partnership 2000 and, therefore, may be more appropriate.</P>
      <P>On the issue of soldiers and sailors, I agree with Deputy Quinn that trust funds should not be raided.  The former Deputy, Paddy Harte was involved in this matter for a considerable time when he was a Member of the House and he identified this fund.  I do not want a position where a sum of £2 million is sought but only £1 million is available.  Under the Freedom of Information Act, which will come into effect in April, criteria will be set for the selection of projects and they will be published.  Applications will be sought by way of advertisement and a process set up to deal with the matter.</P>

On territorial employment pacts, I am advised that because they are linked to the social exclusion aspects of the Partnership 2000 programme, those involved with Partnership 2000, which comes under the aegis of my Department, wish to retain that aspect.  I will, however, consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order, 1997</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 26 November 1997.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to explain to the House my reasons for postponing elections of members to the regional fisheries boards for one year.  These elections were due to take place on 16 December next.  Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, elections to the management committees of the trout and coarse fisheries development societies take place at the same time as the elections to the regional boards. As a consequence of this Order, these elections will also be postponed for one year.  My reason for this decision is to allow me to complete a comprehensive review of the structures, services and organisation of the inland fisheries sector.  I will elaborate on my thinking in this regard later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seven regional fisheries boards have statutory responsibilities under the Fisheries Act, 1980 on the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of the fisheries within their regions and offshore to the 12 mile limit for the protection of salmon.  The boards also enforce various legislative provisions on water pollution as it affects fish stocks and have an input, at planning stage, in proposed developments which could impact on fish stocks or habitats.  They promote and develop game, coarse fish and sea angling.  Each board has between 20 and 23 members, seven of whom are appointed by the Minister.  The remaining members are elected from panels representing the main fishery <Col N="1294" /> interests, including fishery owners, commercial fishermen and salmon, trout, coarse and sea anglers. The seven regional boards have a total of 265 permanent staff.</P>
    <P>The regional fisheries boards are funded largely by the Exchequer and the European Union from the Department's Vote administered through the Central Fisheries Board.  In addition, the regional boards generate their own resources, notably through fisheries rates, licence duties, fines and forfeitures.  Expenditure in 1997 by the central and regional fisheries boards will be of the order of £14 million.  The estimate for 1998 is £14.9 million.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board is made up of the chairpersons of the seven regional boards and six ministerial appointees.  There are no elections to the central board.  The trout and coarse fisheries development societies, which were set up in 1991 under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991 participate in the development of trout and coarse fisheries by raising funds through the issue of share certificates and making grants or payments available for appropriate development works. Each society has a management committee comprising seven members, five elected by the members and two nominated by the Minister. The balance of angling interests, whether trout or coarse, on each society is determined by the extent of the particular angling interest in a region.</P>
    <P>Elections to the regional fisheries boards were last held in December 1992.  Members elected and nominated at that time, with subsequent nominees arising from vacancies in the interim, serve under the Act until the declaration of the next election results.  In accordance with regulations made under the Fisheries Act, 1980, elections to the regional fisheries boards would fall due to be held this year on the third Tuesday in December, 16 December.  Section 15 of the 1980 Act enables me to postpone by Order for a specified period of time the elections to the boards.  Before making such an Order a resolution approving of the draft must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is on this statutory basis that I approach the House today.</P>
    <P>Inland fisheries is one of our greatest self-sustaining natural resources.  Angling opportunities in Ireland compare very favourably with the best in the world and this is reflected in the growing demand for the product.  The quality of our Atlantic salmon and wild trout fisheries is unsurpassed. We have extensive and excellent coarse fisheries with a wide range of species.  The rich fishing grounds off our coasts provide high quality and varied opportunities for the sea angler.</P>
    <P>The central and regional fisheries boards have done exceptional work since their inception in 1980 in managing and developing this valuable resource.  I pay tribute to all the board members, both past and present, as well as management and staff for their committed contribution over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> I believe that we have collectively reached a point after almost 20 years where it is timely and appropriate to review and reflect on the future needs of and direction for the boards.  My primary objective in this regard is to support and facilitate the boards in delivery on their mandate as efficiently and effectively as possible and to plan the way forward for the boards into the new century.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I recently announced my intention to review comprehensively the structures, services and organisation of the inland fisheries sector with a view to implementing the necessary degree of change, both legislative and organisational, to deliver on the Government's strategic objectives for the inland fisheries resource.  The primary objective is to ensure effective and efficient delivery of service and best deployment of human and financial resources, combined with a catchment management approach for the conservation, management and development of the fisheries at regional and local level.</P>
    <P>Greater clarity in the respective roles of the Department, the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards is a key consideration.  I believe it would be sensible and prudent to postpone elections to the regional boards for one year to allow for full consideration of all the issues involved in delivering the necessary degree of strategic change and, most importantly, to provide continuity during this process.</P>
    <P>Immediately on coming into office I asked the Central Fisheries Board as a matter of priority to draw up a strategic plan which would take a critical look forward at management, development and conservation objectives of our inland fisheries resources over a five-year period.  I am pleased to announce that the board has responded with admirable speed and presented me yesterday with its development plan for 1998-2002 entitled &ldquo;Achieving Sustainable Growth.&rdquo; I have arranged for copies of this report to be left with the spokespersons of each party.  I presume all Members received them yesterday.  Has Deputy Stagg a copy of the report?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the central and regional fisheries boards, their staff and all involved in the formulation of the plan.  Deputies will agree that this is a good report with a clear outline of future plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plan represents a welcome consensus among the boards and fisheries interests on the way forward for developing inland fisheries.  It underlines the importance and benefits of consultation and participation by all stakeholders in the process.  It sets an ambitious agenda for the <Col N="1296" /> boards in terms of conservation and development objectives for the resource; more effective delivery of services; and the need to address the management and organisational challenges inherent in delivering on those strategic objectives.</P>
    <P>In particular, I welcome the plan's recognition of, and commitment to, improved deployment of the considerable human and financial resources devoted to inland fisheries.  The board's plan is also timely and appropriate for a number of reasons.  It reflects and commits the board to the principles governing the ongoing process of strategic change in the public service.  The Government is committed to delivering fundamental reform in the management and delivery of services by Departments and, by extension, associated agencies.  This is a process to which the previous Government was also committed.  The plan puts a welcome focus on service delivery, resource deployment and management systems. It sets important organisational goals for customer service, financial management systems and human resource strategies across the inland fisheries service.  Key principles of value for money, efficiency and effectiveness and customer service are well reflected in the objectives set by the board.  I welcome and endorse that strategic approach.</P>
    <P>In addition to the organisational challenges, the plan sets out a number of key objectives for the development, conservation and protection of our fisheries.  I particularly welcome the emphasis given to maximising jobs and economic activity through further targeted development of game, coarse and sea angling.  In this regard, the plan reflects the targets already set in relation to the tourism angling measure for growing the tourism angling product and to increasing angler numbers and revenues through focused investment and sustained overseas marketing.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that, as a priority, we intend to tackle the overseas marketing issue.  It has been decided to transfer £300,000 from the tourism angling measure to a tourism marketing fund to promote angling market research and promotion overseas.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the central and regional fisheries boards and all relevant agencies to ensure the success of this important initiative.</P>
    <P>The board's plan also sets a number of key objectives in relation to environmental and water quality issues as they impact on the fisheries resource.  I welcome the board's commitment to deliver on the water quality action plan which I announced last August.  In the face of the many serious threats to fish stocks and habitats, it is essential that we deliver the necessary co-ordinated national effort to prevent water pollution; tackle the causes of pollution; and move swiftly when pollution incidents occur.</P>
    <P>The continued sustainable development of our inland fisheries resource critically depends on maintaining and securing the highest standards of water quality in fishery catchments.  I have <Col N="1297" /> already announced my intention to implement a national catchment management strategy and I have tasked the boards with the development of six pilot projects as part of that process.  I welcome the plan's commitment to deliver on this objective.  The catchment management approach will ensure better ownership of development and conservation strategies among our people at regional and local community level.  It will involve and empower anglers and all the players in maximising the potential of the local fisheries resource.  I look forward to working with the boards in delivering this initiative.</P>
    <P>Decisions on future strategic directions for inland fisheries will be fully informed by the board's plan.  My thinking will also be informed by the recent helpful report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the management of inland fisheries, the salmon management task force's report and successive consultancy reports into the organisation and management of the inland fisheries sector.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, elections to the fisheries development societies will be postponed and I outlined the importance of the fisheries development societies.</P>
    <P>We all share a common objective to manage, conserve and develop the uniquely valuable inland fisheries resource to best effect.  The Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards are pivotal in the delivery of that objective and have set out a clear strategic view of future priorities and directions in their new five year plan.  My intention in carrying out this review is to strongly position the boards, both organisationally and statutorily, to deliver on that challenging agenda for change beyond 2000.  A catchment based approach to conservation and development combined with best management practice, service delivery and resource deployment is the key to delivering on that agenda.  I look forward to working with the boards and with all the interested parties to deliver the necessary strategic change.  Postponement of the election will provide a prudent degree of continuity for 12 months as we undertake this process.</P>
    <P>I will bring my proposals to Government as early as possible in the new year.  I am confident these will deliver the necessary framework for the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards to deliver on the challenges ahead.  In these circumstances, I ask the House to pass this resolution approving the terms of the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this resolution.  Last August I received a letter from a member of a regional fisheries board which stated that the Central Fisheries Board had the worst record of any organisation when it came to answering mail. He said he could not recall receiving an acknowledgement of a letter let alone an answer, although information was sought on many occasions.  Although the Central Fisheries Board is capable of producing a glossy tome such as the <Col N="1298" /> one I received, it must change its structures and procedures.</P>
      <P>I agree with the decision of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to defer the appointment of members of the regional fisheries boards for another year.  It is a correct decision taken in the context of a comprehensive review of the central fisheries services.  It is time the operation of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards was reviewed and changes made.</P>
      <P>A consultant's report commissioned in 1994 cost almost £65,000.  Although many recommendations were made, no change took place.  This report was not accepted by the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards disassociated themselves from it.  A further consultant's report by Price Waterhouse in 1996 reviewed the organisation and management structure of the fisheries services and of the inland fisheries area and further recommendations were made.  It is now time to implement the recommendations of both reports in order to realign the roles of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board consists of 13 members, seven of whom are chairpersons of the regional fisheries boards; the other six members are appointed by the Minister.  The regional fisheries boards have between 20 and 23 members, seven of whom are appointed by the Minister. There is a necessity for the redefinition of the roles of both the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards.  When one considers the chairpersons of the regional boards are members of the Central Fisheries Board and they are in the majority, surely this raises important questions as to whether decisions, which should be taken in the national interest, can be blurred if regional and local interests prevail.</P>
      <P>There is also a strong criticism of the composition of the regional fisheries boards and there is a necessity to have bodies, such as those related to tourism, and local authorities involved and to look at whether the current composition is representative of all the fishing interests who use this natural resource.  As a member of a local authority, I am aware that most local authorities spend a great deal of money on enforcement to combat pollution.  All the reports state that there is an overlap in the duties of local authorities and the regional fisheries boards.  That area needs to be looked at and it is very important that local authorities are represented on such boards.</P>
      <P>It is also obvious that the Central Fisheries Board needs to change in order to have a sharper focus and have representative knowledgeable personnel from the inland fisheries areas.  I am sure the Minister would agree that the Central Fisheries Board does not necessarily act in the interests of inland fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board is a statutory body established under the Fisheries Act, 1980.  It is a harsh criticism of the board that although there is a legal obligation on it to produce a five-year <Col N="1299" /> development plan, it has never produced a plan of this nature.  Now, 17 years later, at long last it has done so.  The Minister stated that this five-year plan was produced with admirable speed and I must compliment him on that, but we waited nearly 17 years for something concrete like this to develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that, as a result of this plan, they will now reappraise the operation of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards to improve their clarity, the definition of roles and the overall performance.  Much work has gone into the report of the Central Fisheries Board but I am sure the Minister will agree that it will not succeed unless many fundamental changes take place.</P>
      <P>It is in the role of marketing angling overseas that there is a necessity for great change.  As there is a recognition that there is a great weakness in this area, Bord Fáilte no longer has a lead role in it.  The recent decision to transfer £300,000 from the tourism angling measure to a tourism marketing fund to promote angling market research and promotion overseas must be welcomed.  There is an urgent necessity to provide the necessary resources for this important area.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note when the Central Fisheries Board established a special unit to manage the tourism angling measures, and committees were established to appraise and approve the various projects, that there were no private sector or business interests on these committees.  I do not agree with that because the people who are at the coalface deserve to be members of such committees.</P>
      <P>Over 152,000 overseas anglers came to Ireland in 1995 and generated revenue of £52 million. There are 190,000 domestic anglers who spent an estimated £27 million in 1996.  Undoubtedly, the potential in this area could be enhanced considerably by an improved marketing strategy.</P>
      <P>The salmon management task force, which reported during the period of office of my colleague, the previous Minister, Deputy Barrett, recommended many initiatives as there was great concern about the depletion of wild salmon stocks.  There is an urgent need to be able to fully assess and quantify salmon and sea stocks.  I therefore welcome the current operation of ten fish counters in Irish waters and also welcome the Minister's decision to install at least another 14 counters in the next two years.  Fish counters are an important management tool in quantifying and monitoring salmon and sea trout stocks and spawning targets, which can assist in conservation and development strategies.  I trust that further fish counters beyond these 24 will be installed so that all our key catchment systems are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another key recommendation in the salmon management task force report was the establishment of catchment area committees.  The intention <Col N="1300" /> was that local fisheries and angling, tourism, industry and farming interests would plan a comprehensive strategy for the catchment areas, to include fishing activities, pollution prevention, water quality, the protection of fishing life, etc. That is a positive step and was one of the key recommendations of the salmon management task force.  I trust the composition of those committees will reflect the interested parties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's recent decision to start with six pilot fisheries catchment projects across the country, one of which will be on the Mulcaire river in Limerick.  I trust this will proceed promptly and that the results will be evaluated and the scheme extended as appropriate. The Minister recognises the necessity to revamp all inland fisheries activity.  I acknowledge the dedicated approach of the staff who often operate in difficult circumstances, particularly those working for regional fisheries boards.  It is also a matter of urgency to improve and redefine the inland fisheries area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Price Waterhouse consultants' reports on inland fisheries and the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money report, published recently.  These reports identified the need which the board accepts for changes in structures, clear policy positions and direction, legislation to give legal forces to those positions and structures, a one stop shop for water quality, a localised catchment management strategy to fit into the overall policy, and a new, effective marketing strategy.  I congratulate the Minister on taking the initiative to delay the appointment of new boards to give a breathing space for the required consultation.</P>
      <P>I record my appreciation for the record of achievement of the existing boards.  Despite not having a plan such as was outlined yesterday by the Central Fisheries Board, the work of the regional fisheries boards, particularly those with which I am most familiar in the west and northwest, has been substantial.  The north-western board has developed not only traditional game fishing but coarse fishing also.  It is widely recognised that this is a time for change and it is timely that the Minister is acting at this stage because of the reports and plan which have come to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the high value placed on free fisheries in most lakes and rivers.  This is particularly true of trout and coarse fisheries but also of long stretches of salmon rivers where the State, through the fisheries boards or the Land Commission, hold the riparian rights.  He is also aware of the lengths to which anglers and boatmen are prepared to go to secure these free fishing <Col N="1301" /> rights.  He will be mindful of the rod licence dispute which halted angling and angling tourism for over two years in the last decade.  I am sure he knows that those involved in the angling industry were prepared to suffer huge financial loss in defence of their free fishing at that time.  Boatmen, bed and breakfast operators, hotels and fishery owners suffered during that period, as did tourism in general.  The Minister will also know that free fisheries are a major marketing tool in attracting valuable Irish and overseas angling tourists.</P>
    <P>The resolve shown during the rod angling dispute has not gone away.  If anything, it is strengthened by the defeat of the rod licence regime.  In recent weeks, somebody in the Minister's Department or the Central Fisheries Board, or both, decided to restart the rod licence war.  This time they decided to go much further than the rod licence proposal. They have now selected the first batch of free fisheries, the thin end of the wedge, which they have offered for sale to the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>The successful bidder, native or from overseas &mdash; all EU citizens are entitled to bid &mdash; will then charge a rod licence to all and sundry who wish to fish there, whether they are local youngsters or German visitors.  The higher the bid, the more likely the bidder is to succeed and the higher the resultant licence fee will be.  Will locals be priced out of the market, not only for the fishing titles but for the right to fish in their local rivers?  Who are the likely new landlords of our now free fisheries? Will they be German industrialists or French and Dutch entrepreneurs, or will the English gentry have an opportunity to make a comeback and recover the fisheries if their cheque books are large enough?  EU law, as the Minister is aware, requires that the highest bidder be allowed buy State assets which are for sale.</P>
    <P>This is madness.  It will be strongly resisted and will not work.  I am telling the Minister today, which is the first time this has been discussed, that he will not be able to say he was not warned about it.  I will give him the example of the small River Robe in Mayo.</P>
    <P>I was first taught to fish for trout on the River Robe by my late grandfather, John Vahey.  I am sure he never thought he would be mentioned in a House of Parliament.  He had worked as a gamekeeper on that river when the local landlord owned the waters and lands.  He was extremely happy that the landlord was no more &mdash; he used say &ldquo;good riddance to bad rubbish&rdquo;&mdash; that the jackdaws had taken over the ruins of the &ldquo;Big House&rdquo; and that the land had been allocated to locals.  He was particularly happy that he and his grandson could fish the river unrestricted, not as poachers but as Irishmen with the right to so do. I have regularly fished on the River Robe since then, except during the rod licence dispute, and I intend to continue this happy practice.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister thinks I am inventing this proposal I have a copy of the tender document to sell the fishing rights on a list of rivers.  The proposal <Col N="1302" /> to sell the fishing rights on the River Robe would mean that I would require 12 separate licences from the new landlords to fish there.  It is not one of the great rivers; it runs from Claremorris to Lough Mask, which is about 15 miles.  I would need a licence for almost every mile and a half of the river.</P>
    <P>If the River Robe is to be butchered and sold piecemeal, what will happen when they sell the big rivers and the great midland and western lakes?  I have no doubt, having discussed this matter with officials in the Department and the Central Fisheries Board, that is their intention.  The Minister, as the political head of the Department, will have to carry the can for those actions.  If this proposal goes through, anglers will need special bags, not to carry the fish but to carry the special licences they will require.</P>
    <P>This proposal is 12 times worse than the rod licence proposal as far as the River Robe in concerned. It will hugely inhibit local anglers and will undoubtedly give rise to poaching.  It will open the way to foreign ownership and will discourage overseas anglers.  It will be counterproductive and give rise to a dispute that will put the rod licence dispute in the halfpenny place.</P>
    <P>Anglers contribute to the quality and maintenance of the fisheries voluntarily and in large measure.  Overseas anglers contribute through their spend in the general economy, directly benefiting State coffers.  They are valuable, but this proposal could drive them away.  Previous speakers have given figures indicating the amounts involved.  They are worth £80 million per annum and there is a target in the new plan to bring them up to £150 million per annum.  Employment numbers currently amount to 3,700, while there is a target in the new plan for this to increase to 7,000.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister order a halt to this crazy and ill-conceived project?  As a political colleague I suggest that he should not walk into a minefield with his eyes open.  Today we received the strategic development plan for inland fisheries from the Central Fisheries Board.  It could not be more up to date.  It makes vague references to a commercial focus and a commercial use of sale of consultancy services, such as tidal research, fisheries development and training.  There is no mention of selling the hard won fishery rights &mdash; the free fisheries.  This is a backdoor sale without consultation or agreement.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address this matter in his reply?  If I am not satisfied with it my party will not support this motion as a signal that we are not satisfied with this proposal regarding the tendering and sale of free rivers in Ireland.  If the sale of fishing rights proceeds, I will join with others in resisting it until it is reversed.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply.  I hope he will indicate that this madness is halted and that a plan presented to him yesterday indicates that the fisheries boards are jumping the gun by selling fisheries at a point where major replanning and restructuring of the inland fisheries industry is about to take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in office at a critical time in the development of the marine and fisheries, which has arisen because of increased leisure time, the strength of the economy and the expansion in building.  Traditionally isolated areas and facilities are now being used.  Because of my experience in the then Department of Tourism and Trade I know the Minister is presiding over an area of enormous economic potential.</P>
      <P>I was present when the House debated the rod licence issue during Private Members' Business. It led to one of the most spurious campaigns, with many sides making bad-minded contributions.  If the Minister intends to abolish or radically restructure the Central Fisheries Board he should respect Deputy Stagg's advice, as a practising angler on the river Robe, that 12 licences should not be required by anglers to fish the section in question.</P>
      <P>In answer to a question on 18 November, the Minister said that arrangements would be made for locals to fish, irrespective of the tender system. However, that does not answer the question at issue here.  When the surface is scratched all the traits of old Ireland can be found.  I would therefore advise the Minister to proceed with great caution.  He is trying to reintroduce something that generations of people fought long and hard to remove.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the members of the various boards who are genuinely interested in the development of a resource which has enormous potential.  When Minister for Tourism and Trade we worked diligently in marketing angling tourism abroad.  Many people do not appreciate the extent of the resource we have in Ireland.  I had the opportunity of opening the world fly fishing championships in Galway some years ago, the highlight of which concerned an Italian angler who was able to fill his kettle in the middle of Lough Mask from his boat, boil it on one of the islands and have his lunch.  In many continental countries which do not have the huge potential and facility we have, anglers have to fish in polluted canals, unused quarries and over-crowded and polluted lakes.  The Minister is presiding over the future development of an immense resource and I am sure that, as a doctor of science, he understands this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher spend angling interest, particularly in the United States and in the context of salmon fishing, warrants closer inspection in relation to tourism.  There are many high spenders on the east coast of the United States who have an immense interest in angling and who go fishing in salmon rivers in Canada, Argentina and South America.  In latter years they have gone to Russia. However, all these areas are isolated and far away and if the fishing is not as good as it should be or the anglers get fed up with the location or the isolation, they want the option of doing something else.  Ireland, with its salmon waters and rivers, is an ideal location for marketing to that upper end of the salmon fishing market.  The £300,000 additional funding for marketing should <Col N="1304" /> be focused on this area and I am sure Bord Fáilte personnel in North America, including Joe Byrne, would be more than willing to give their experience and advice.  It has potential to bring in extra money to areas that badly need it.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade I worked with the North-Western Fisheries Board and the Western Fisheries Board in developing angling resources.  The North-Western Fisheries Board was the first to develop its plan in 1992 and has been working on it since 1994.  I do not understand why the decision of the previous Government regarding the devolution of power to the regional boards was not carried through in the case of the Moy Fisheries.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with this issue in his reply.  It is ludicrous that a section of water which flows past the headquarters of the regional fisheries board in Ardnaree House is controlled by the Central Fisheries Board.  It is not good enough.  This is the best salmon fishery in Europe and tremendous work has been carried out over the past number of years in developing it.  I ask the Minister to be decisive and firm and to address this matter once and for all.  He will be thanked for doing so and will get credit for it.  The local economy of an area which has been disadvantaged and deprived for too long will reap the benefit.</P>
    <P>The Western Fisheries Board includes Loughs Mask, Corrib and Carra &mdash; the great fishing lakes of the west and the finest in the world, three of the 13 wild brown trout fisheries remaining in Europe.  I do not know who owns the waters of these lakes.  I understand they were bequeathed during the time of Queen Victoria to the Irish people.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, under the powers and functions legislation introduced in the past fortnight, is entitled to take over these waters for the purpose of developing various businesses in which the Office of Public Works might be involved.  I would like the Minister to clarify the co-operation that exists between him and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to actions taken under those powers.</P>
    <P>Lough Corrib, Lough Mask and Lough Conn are also subject to by-laws which prevent jet skis, sailing, speed and power boats, windsurfers and so on utilising these waters.  Such activities are acceptable in the proper locations if carried out to a controlled standard but we cannot allow a situation to develop where the great reservoirs of the west, which currently supply water to hundreds of thousands of people, are overrun.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise the importance of the resource he manages as that is critical to its future development.  I support the concept of restructuring the fisheries boards and the Minister is correct to allow himself the breathing space to do that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, would address the issue of the non-appointment of staff to regional boards.  In his speech he referred to the boards' mandate to manage, conserve, protect, develop and improve fisheries within their <Col N="1305" /> regions up to a 12 mile limit.  It is physically impossible for the north-western and western boards to do this as they do not have the necessary resources.  There has been a vacancy for an assistant inspector in the Bangor area for a number of years.  Will the Minister explain why that vacancy has not been filled?  The vast and rugged coastline from Sligo Bay to Leenane is impossible to cover.  Inshore fishermen's and half-deckers' nets are being cut by Irish and Spanish trawlers but there is no ability to control this.  The Minister could examine the possibility of providing additional resources for the people who try to do their job within the 12 mile limit along the inner sections of the coastline.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the prevention of water pollution, the necessity to tackle its causes and the importance of moving swiftly when pollution incidents occur.  That is critical.  The recent Teagasc report indicated that the same return could be elicited from farming activities through the use of far less phosphate fertiliser.  The Minister will find that farmers, like anglers, are custodians of the environment and are only too willing to play their part in its development and conservation.</P>
    <P>During Fine Gael's term in Government, funding was allocated for tertiary treatment works in Castlebar.  These clean the Castlebar river which flows into Lough Cullen which subsequently acts as a filter for Lough Conn and the Moy fisheries basin.  These are measures which the Minister should investigate as the prevention of water pollution is a critical issue.  Local authorities, sewerage schemes and so on contribute to the development or destruction of an enormous resource.</P>
    <P>One of the problems, which may be addressed in part tomorrow, pertains to the seaside resorts scheme.  When we introduced the scheme in various areas we intended to include the Shannon corridor and basin.  However, many of our smaller towns and villages do not have the necessary infrastructure in place in terms of sewage treatment plants and so on.  If there is to be an explosion of investment and consequential economic development, it is necessary to provide parallel facilities to cater for that.  That will prevent pollution and avoid a situation where, on the one hand, there is economic expansion but on the other, the resource one is trying to protect is destroyed.</P>
    <P>This is a timely intervention and one which I support.  The Minister is correct to allow himself the time to restructure and reorganise as this is an enormous international resource, not just a minor facility.  As someone who had the opportunity and privilege of dealing in a tourism and trading sense with foreign groups, I realise that Ireland's fishery potential has enormous significance internationally. It is a wonderful pastime and a marvellous resource which we must protect for our children's children.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether the Minister intends to reorganise, restructure or abolish the Central Fisheries Board, I urge him to avoid a course of <Col N="1306" /> action that will renew the rod licence war in the west.  During that dispute we witnessed a great deal of unseemly behaviour by all sides which continued for a long period of time and I do not wish to see that happen again.  An angler should not have to have 12 licences to fish sections of a river which he fished as a child and which his father and grandfather fished before him.  I urge the Minister not to take that course.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to restructure he must forget about licences.  If he wants to examine the management of a waterway, he must talk to local people and the regional fisheries boards.  There is a method of realising the development potential of this industry without advertising internationally for tenders for sections of a waterway. I wish the Minister well in his efforts to develop an enormous national resource with great potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not usually like the idea of postponing elections.  However, in this case there are good grounds for such a decision on the basis of the need to reform the structures in inland fisheries and, hopefully, to establish a new legislative basis for the industry.  Postponing elections for a year might enable that to happen.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, however, that the commitment given by the Minister in this regard is described as a review.  The Minister committed himself to bringing proposals to Government early in the new year but he did not offer a commitment to legislate, which would appear to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the proposals will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that clarification.  It is implicit in the postponement of elections that when elections are held they will be held to different or at least reformed bodies.</P>
      <P>The inland fisheries resource is hugely underappreciated in some sectors of society and greatly appreciated in others.  Large numbers of people participate in inland fisheries either as anglers or as tourism promoters who provide accommodation and other supports for visiting anglers.  I welcome the publication yesterday of the Central Fisheries Board's five year plan for the development of inland fisheries.  I have not yet been supplied with a copy of the plan but I read a summary of it in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New legislation is required to underpin the development of inland fisheries.  The Central Fisheries Board, the regional fisheries boards, the Salmon Research Agency, the Marine Institute and the Department have teams of people, both board members and staff, who are committed to the development of inland fisheries and to working on that development.  However, the structures which exist at present were put in place in 1980 to replace what can only be called the inheritance of the 19th century, when the approach to inland fisheries was different from what is necessary today.  That approach was based on the assumption that the landlord class owned the fisheries <Col N="1307" /> and, as the peasantry was inclined to poach the fish, there was a need to put in place a regime which protected the interests of the owning class. While there may be remnants of that inheritance, the requirements regarding the development of inland fisheries today are quite different.  The structures required and the way in which they go about their business need to reflect that reality.</P>
    <P>For that reason I welcome the Minister's commitment to the concept of catchment management. It is important that control of our fisheries is essentially based at local level.  If we are to get away from the old 19th century idea of the poacher and fishery owner structure which we have inherited, it is important there is community involvement at local level and that structures are put in place.  The best way to deal with the problems of poaching, pollution and other pressures on the inland fishery resources is to involve those at local level such as anglers, clubs, those who have an interest in the fishery, environmentalists, etc.  This will also protect and develop our fisheries. Those at local level know and understand their own local fishery and are in the best position to manage and be involved in it.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister only made a passing reference to the report of the salmon management task force.  Clearly, the implementation of the second phase of the report of the task force requires legislation.  If it is to be implemented in time for the 1998 season, it must be introduced early in the new year at the latest, in order to provide for the quota and tagging system which goes with it.  This is important, because for the first time in a long time, the different interests in the salmon fishery are signed up in agreement with the recommendations contained in the task force report.  It would be a pity if that opportunity was lost.  I am concerned this will happen if the second phase is not proceeded with and if there is not an early commitment to proceed with the necessary legislation to give it effect.  The Minister may find himself under pressure coming up to 15 May 1998 and the end of July 1998 to allow the season to open later.  I urge him to give an early commitment to proceed with the second phase of that report and the introduction of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Stagg that the question of ownership will be a critical issue in this process. As the economic importance and value of inland fisheries is realised, the question of the ownership of our fisheries will come more sharply into focus. I would be appalled at any question of selling off the people's right to our fisheries.  Deputy Kenny mentioned, for example, the huge sums of money that can be made from a week's fishing.  It is said that American and Japanese business people will happily pay $6,000 or $7,000 for a week's salmon fishing in northern Russia.  The implied suggestion is that we ought to follow that kind of model but we should be clear in rejecting it.  We do not want to see a situation where the right to fish in our rivers and lakes is priced beyond the reach <Col N="1308" /> of the ordinary angler.  I would caution strongly against any question of selling off fishing rights or introducing any kind of regime involving the payment of huge sums of money.  By implication, that would mean only the very wealthy would be able to fish in our rivers and lakes.  The first signs of any such system should be rejected.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny about the river Moy.  I do not understand why the transfer of the management of the Moy to the North Western Fisheries Board has not yet been completed.  I hope the Minister will confirm in his reply that the process is being completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that a final review of fisheries will be made and that the Minister proposes to have a catchment management plan.  In my experience of fisheries, it seems there has been a lack of definition within the law.  One does not know exactly where the dividing line is between where anglers or net fishermen may operate or the definitions concerning snap, drift or draught nets.  In my previous capacity as a Minister of State I visited many coastal areas where I found a great appreciation of the good work done by Deputy Gilmore in his period as a Minister of State.  Many people who were fish farming along the coast appreciated the great efforts he made to untangle many of the problems that existed in those areas.</P>
      <P>As regards the regional fishery boards, the former Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, tried to implement a catchment management plan on the advice of officials.  I know he travelled around the country and that he received plenty of advice. However, 14 licensees for drift or draughtnet fishing in the little village where I live believe they were not consulted about this matter.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is to have another review his officials should devise a system whereby each licence holder would be made aware that such a review is taking place.  That will at least require a letter to be sent to each licence holder, whether they are anglers or net fishermen.  It is essential to achieve a consensus.  The catchment management plan was implemented in the south-east and was making progress.  I also understand, however, that it was not finalised and that agreement was not reached.  I am quite certain it will be the same with the other major rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire the tenacity of the Minister if he can deliver a final plan on this matter because it has eluded many other Ministers.  A detailed review is necessary.  As Deputy Gilmore pointed out, wild salmon, as a resource, is gradually being eroded. Maybe it will require draconian measures.  If so, violence is likely to erupt because of the history of this issue.  That is why I want to see wide consultation and local meetings.  I know regional meetings are convenient for the fisheries boards and their officials, Department officials and the Minister, but individual fishermen have long family traditions in their families.  People along the perimeter of the river may hold licences.  It may be difficult to get them together, but if there is an <Col N="1309" /> opportunity for them to be consulted it should be taken, even if it means sending a registered letter.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the new boards will be elected or what format they will take, but the previous system did not work.  This was mainly because of the wide geographical diversity within each region.  Most fishing in the Clare area is done on the Shannon, but it is regulated by someone in the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board in Drumkeeran in north Leitrim.  I appreciate that those furthest from the centre need to be represented, but many decisions on the distribution of licences are made on a political basis.  That may not yield the best results, and hereditary licences can be lost.  In my constituency there are problems if such licences do not pass on to the next of kin when a licenceholder dies.  I urge the Minister to be cautious and to plan for communication.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are anxious for conservation measures.  Anglers in Ennis put young salmon into rivers for many years, but they have been stopped recently because a particular spawn from the river Fergus had to be used, and the anglers were using spawn from the Shannon.  The supply of salmon stopped as a result, and I understand the supply of trout has also stopped.  Has the Minister reviewed this matter?  If healthy fish can be purchased from the ESB or another reputable supplier, why not let angling clubs who want to improve the quality of fish in the river buy these fish?  What are the difficulties?  I have heard a disease mentioned, but the matter has never been fully explained.  The Minister should refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister recently if he was going to stop drift net fishing on rivers and if he was going to confine tidal water fishing to anglers. He said he was not, and I want him to confirm that position.  Drift net fishing is a misnomer.  Such nets, when used at sea, can be six miles long and of a substantial, and occasionally illegal, depth.  Users of these nets are being compared with fishermen who use nets 300 yards long in estuaries.  These fishermen are aggrieved.  They have a long family tradition, perhaps 200 years, of fishing the estuary.  In the estuary abounding the Shannon there has been little or no landlord influence.  Licences have been processed by the regional fisheries board and its predecessors and families have had a substantial income in the peak salmon season.  The previous Minister made a sterling effort to conserve the breeding stock by reducing the fishing season for spring salmon, almost eliminating it.  I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Woods, intends to do likewise.  If agreement is to be reached it is crucial that the Minister states his intentions with regard to spring salmon, the restructuring of the board and whether he intends to consult widely.  Perhaps he will outline some of his ideas on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision to postpone the elections to the regional fisheries boards but the Minister will also have to postpone the proposals <Col N="1310" /> from the regional fisheries board in relation to the river Robe.  This local amenity which has 12 sections has been put out to tender. We have fought the landlords for many years and we do not wish a situation to develop where Lord Ballinrobe or Lord Westport would own the river Robe.  If this happened the local people would not be able to fish the river and would have to go, cap in hand, seeking permission to use it.  This is a bad decision and one about which the anglers in the area are outraged.  They are becoming organised, will fight it whatever way they can and will have my support.  Deputy Stagg enjoys fishing and I met him during the summer when we viewed some of these beautiful rivers.</P>
      <P>In reply to a recent parliamentary question the Minister said anglers had not invested in the industry.  That is not correct, they have worked very hard over the years to maintain, restore and promote angling by means of fishing festivals and so on.  The Minister's decision is a backward step. By putting it to tender the Germans, the English and the lords will once again own the land, the rights of way, the fishery rights and a serious situation will arise.  I thought that in 1997 we had gone past that and would have taken a different road, that as a nation we were more mature and would not revert to the old way.</P>
      <P>I recall an incident in the Foxford area where non-nationals owned the fishing rights.  Those who had adjoining lands ended up in the High Court.  The case cost them over £100,000 which they had to raise.  They won the case in the Circuit Court but lost it in the High Court.  Will the Minister ask the regional fisheries board to postpone the notifications immediately and have discussions with the anglers in relation to the river Robe?</P>
      <P>There is an ongoing problem in relation to the river Moy about which there are some legal difficulties. I ask the Minister to try to resolve the matter as quickly as possible, given that it is a major tourist attraction.  It would be preferable if it could be resolved locally.  I recognise the Government is committed to it but there are some legal problems which I hope can be resolved.</P>
      <P>In relation to Ballinrobe I urge the Minister not to allow the tenders to go forward.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this local amenity is not divided into 12 different sections.  People with money are always looking for an opportunity to invest. I have no problem with other nationals buying property but they do not want anyone to the side, front or rear of them.  If the river Robe falls into the wrong hands local people will be unable to fish the river and those who offer bed and breakfast accommodation in the area will lose business. I do not want to see local people being forced to bid against each other for ownership rights to various sections of the river.  It is wrong that tenders are being sought by the regional fisheries board.  Deputy Stagg, the people of Ballinrobe and Mayo, those who love the sport of angling and I are opposed to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> Last year restrictions were imposed whereby the number of days on which draft fishermen on the north Mayo coast could fish was reduced. This is wrong as they only make use of their licences for a few months of the year.  While I appreciate that the regional fisheries boards have to take measures to conserve stocks, which have been low in recent years, Spanish boats which are as big as submarines take whatever is available leaving nothing for the locals.  This matter will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>At a recent council meeting unofficial bed and breakfast establishments were the subject of many complaints.  I made the point that the people concerned who operate for ten to 12 weeks of the year use the money to send their children to third level educational institutions.  I also made the point that Bord Fáilte provides a bad service for the fee charged.  Many operators cannot depend on it to provide business, they have no option but to market their own product. The world championships organised by the angling clubs in Ballinrobe attracted thousands of visitors to the area.  We do not want to return to the days of the landlord when people will have to beg for permission to use our rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>I have always found the Minister to be a reasonable man.  He must stop the regional fisheries boards from engaging in the tendering process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The postponement of the elections gives the Minister an opportunity to conduct an indepth review of the role played by the regional fisheries boards.  It is right to pay tribute to them for the work they have done in recent years in promoting and conserving fish stocks in our rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh &mdash; the lake district of Ireland &mdash; offer some of the finest fishing and boating waters in the world. Has contact been made with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland?  The time is opportune to develop links with our neighbours across the Border who have a role to play in the preservation of our waters and the prevention of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of the development of our inland waterways and the enormous interest taken in them, perhaps occasioned by the present affluence which is good to see, the problem has arisen of people boating and fishing on the same lake which is simply not practicable.  I suggest that certain lakes be designated solely for fishing purposes and others solely for boating purposes.  I am not talking about casual boating activities but rather speedboats and jet skis which have become commonplace.  Many people interested in fishing have told me that they are a nuisance, an annoyance and a danger.  They say that while they have no objection to people enjoying a sporting activity, people in speedboats and on jet skis cannot be allowed on lakes while others endeavour to fly fish or cast bait for coarse fish from the <Col N="1312" /> banks of lakes or from rowing boats.  It is dangerous and may well lead to an accident, apart altogether from driving away those entitled to fish in lakes.</P>
    <P>While these are fast-growing new sports and those interested are entitled to engage in them and have their fun, they should take place within designated areas only.  Since my county can boast of having a lake for almost every day of the year, it would be very easy to designate a number specifically for boating purposes, probably those with easier access rather than those more remote where there is better fishing.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to observe the enormous progress made on the matter of measures to control farmyard pollution and the co-operation now obtaining between farmers, fishermen and fisheries boards.  While I do not want to appear to be always defending farmers, coming, as I do, from a farming background I do not like generalised labels or a totally misplaced attitude being taken to them.  The majority of farmers are honest, decent people but, as in all other walks of life, there are some cowboys.</P>
    <P>Throughout the l960s, when farming was developing here and silage-making was new to us, farmers put down two slabs of concrete, one for silage and another for feeding their cattle, grantaided by the Department.  They were small developments at the beginning of a new cycle in farming. Within those plans, there would have been provision for drainage running from the slab of concrete into an outlet leading eventually into a small stream or river.  That was the thinking in the Department at the time.  The concrete slabs were put in place and worked.  I remind the House that farmers were not the instigators of that idea, rather it was the Department that grant-aided it.  It is easy, with the benefit of hindsight, to blame Departmental officials for being short-sighted but in the course of any review of measures to be taken against pollution we must carefully examine proposals to ensure that we do not do harm down the road.</P>
    <P>Once the problems arising from these outlets came to the fore and were realised, the fisheries boards took action and unfortunate farmers were prosecuted and berated, even to the extent of hitting the headlines in local papers, highly embarrassing to any decent farmer and his family. While not wishing to point the finger at various fisheries boards, they could have adopted a somewhat different attitude at the time.  There is no doubt but that the message was got across and farmers knew they had to change that practice, which they did at enormous cost, providing tanks for holding effluent and so on.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem arises from the overuse of phosphates.  The Department and Teagasc convened meetings of farmers in local schools and parish halls to advise them on the use of fertilisers and the need to apply potash or phosphate in certain proportions or the nitrogen in the soil would not be activated.  Farmers duly followed those instructions.  Now they are told <Col N="1313" /> they were simply putting their money down the drain and they are being blamed for causing no end of problems.  Again, that is a warning.  If this review is to be undertaken, it is vital that good advice is obtained.  When looking for good advice, it is hard to beat going out into the country and talking to a man of the soil because he knows what he is talking about.  I am not against people in officialdom or those who give advice in certain areas, but difficulties can arise when people do not understand nature so it is important that we get this right.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight the great achievement brought about through co-operation with the fishery boards, namely, the restoration of one of the finest lakes in the country, Lough Sheelin, which Deputy Stagg knows well.  Ten years ago the lake was stagnant with no fish life.  It has now been fully restored, notwithstanding the fact that some of the largest pig producers in this country, and one of the largest in Europe, operates on the banks of Lough Sheelin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar with the lake also.  I am sure he has enjoyed many an afternoon on it.  He is always welcome to come back again, as long as he is not looking for votes.  The point I am making is that a large piggery can operate successfully near one of our finest lakes.  That is possible where there is co-operation and goodwill.</P>
      <P>We should not overlook the role of farmers, landowners who are not farmers, the fishery boards and others who are interested in the promotion of tourism.  There is great potential in this area and if we make the effort to market tourist areas properly and attract people into them, they will provide alternative enterprises for those currently experiencing difficulty in earning an income for their families.  They can develop the tourism market knowing that tourists will come to these areas to fish which will benefit farmers, the fishery boards and others who enjoy the streams and the lakes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their wide-ranging, relevant and helpful comments.  Everybody accepts what I am trying to do.  We have had various reports and we want to move forward on the basis of a catchment area approach.  That approach is intended to involve more people locally along the lines suggested here.  Following that, I hope to go to Government with proposals in that regard and then come back to the House. I want to have the widest possible consultation. This is an ongoing process.  Much of the basic work has been done by my predecessors, going back to the time when I was previously Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the issues raised, one of which concerns the river Robe and the issue of <Col N="1314" /> the tender documents.  This is not a sale but a lease to which the conditions of a lease apply. These are Land Commission fisheries and I will look into those immediately.  That is all I can say to the Deputy for the present.  I would be very concerned if it were anything of the kind mentioned by a number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>The decision in relation to the river Moy has been taken in principle, which some Deputies recognise, but two issues remain to be resolved; one relates to the title and the other is an industrial relations matter.  I hope these can be resolved in the near future.  In any event, in line with the catchment area approach, we want to have it transferred locally under the catchment area plan.  There is no difference between Deputies and myself on this matter other than the question of ensuring that it can be brought about in practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised questions about the second phase of the salmon management task force.  A marine institute assessment was carried out on this and that institute is preparing its recommendations.  I expect they will be available before Christmas or in the early new year at the latest at which time I will make them public to enable those concerned to consider them.  The Deputies who contributed to this debate have read and know the details of all the reports and they used them in regard to the progress of policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Questions about cross-Border inland fisheries were raised.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would know this is an important point.  A good deal of work is under way in this area.  The INTERREG and the peace and reconciliation programmes are providing considerable funding for joint projects in that area, including the Erne salmon project which involves a sum of more than £1 million.  I accept the points made by Deputy Boylan and we will consider this matter further because it is relevant and timely.</P>
    <P>The river Robe was raised by many speakers and we will pursue that point as a matter of urgency.  In regard to water pollution, I discussed the question of phosphates with Teagasc.  I met representatives of the IFA and they both began work immediately on programmes and took the matter very seriously.  I accept Deputy Boylan's point that farm organisations were quick to become involved in this important issue.</P>
    <P>What we are doing is well understood and we are not trying to hide anything.  We plan to deal with this matter in an open way with broad consultation. As most speakers said, it is timely to address this issue.  It is for that reason we planned to postpone the elections for a year.  That will provide an opportunity to deal with this matter, to adopt a catchment area approach and to hold elections following that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, pursuant to Article 29.5.2 of Bunreacht na hÉireann, approves the terms of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 17th day of November, 1997.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to move this motion.  The conclusion of the convention banning the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines has been the result of the determination of a number of countries, including Ireland, to by-pass the deadlock in more traditional diplomatic negotiations in favour of a fast track multilateral negotiation. Those countries committed themselves in the so called &ldquo;Ottawa Process&rdquo; to the conclusion of a comprehensive and global ban on anti-personnel mines in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>We were not prepared to proceed at the pace of those Governments which continue to use diplomatic negotiations for the purpose of maintaining their prerogatives to use these inhumane mines for the foreseeable future while countless thousands of innocent victims were being killed and maimed monthly.</P>
      <P>On taking office, the Government set the conclusion of a global ban on landmines as the immediate priority of Irish disarmament policy. The determined and purposeful pursuit by like-minded Governments of this singular goal led, in the short duration from its launch in Ottawa in October of last year to its culmination at a diplomatic conference in Oslo in September of this year, to the conclusion of a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel mines for all time and the elimination of existing mines within a set time frame.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with a core group of nations, including Canada, Austria, Mexico and South Africa, played a key role at the Oslo Conference in bringing about the conclusion of this convention. Under the convention, anti-personnel mines will be banned without reservations and exceptions and for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To summarise its main provisions, the convention prohibits the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines; requires the destruction of all stocks of anti-personnel mines with the exception of a small number of devices required for mine detection, clearance and destruction techniques; provides for the clearance of all anti-personnel mines in mined areas under national jurisdiction and control in accordance with a specified time-table; promotes international co-operation and assistance by states in a position to do so to help mine affected countries clear mines and to support the victims of landmines; contains transparency and compliance provisions, including the requirement to make declarations and provide other information on compliance and implementation as well as procedures for clarification and <Col N="1316" /> fact-finding missions and entrusts the Secretary-General of the United Nations, as depositary, with the servicing of meetings of state parties and the implementation of the convention's reporting and clarification mechanisms.</P>
    <P>When this convention was concluded at Oslo, it enjoyed the support of more than 100 participating delegations, including in particular the mine affected countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.  While the United States participated in Oslo, its delegation declared that it was not in a position to forego the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines for the foreseeable future.  The majority of participating states in Oslo, including Ireland, would not agree to an exception which would have compromised the fundamental global approach we were pursuing and would have defeated the goal of a total ban which we set out to achieve.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed that the United States will not be in a position to join us in signing the convention this week.  The United States was the moving force behind the 1996 UNGA resolution calling for the total abolition of these weapons, and we still hope that by signing this convention in the near future, it will give concrete expression to its commitment to bring about an end to these hideous devices.</P>
    <P>A number of other significant states, including Russia, China, India and Pakistan and two of our partners in European Union, Greece and Finland, did not, despite our best efforts, participate in the conference.  Since Oslo there have, however, been a number of positive developments in this regard.  Greece announced that it will sign the convention in Ottawa.  Japan and Russia have stated that they will sign in due course, and other countries that traditionally have been negative towards the Ottawa process will now also sign at Ottawa.</P>
    <P>At the signing of the convention in Ottawa tomorrow, the Irish delegation will be led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and with the adoption of this motion today it will also be possible for Ireland to be among the first countries to ratify the convention tomorrow.  The ratification of the convention, following the adoption of this motion will be possible because existing legislation, including the Explosives (Land Mines) Order, 1996, provides the appropriate legal and administrative instruments, including penal sanctions, to prevent and suppress any activity prohibited to a state party under this convention undertaken by persons or on territory under its jurisdiction or control.  This order bans the manufacture, keeping, importation, conveyance or sale of landmines.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is the Government's policy that the Defence Forces shall not use anti-personnel mines in any future Defence Force military operation. Ireland is therefore already in a position to ratify this convention without any further implementing legislation.  In being the first to ratify it, it is the Government's intention to signal the importance it attaches to the entry into force <Col N="1317" /> of the convention, which requires 40 ratifications to bring it into force.  It is especially important that it should enter rapidly into force and become a norm of international law because all along, there have been countries which have attempted to belittle the effort we have made to reach a global ban by means other than the traditional diplomatic route.</P>
    <P>It was argued that the convention agreed between those countries eager to halt the scourge of anti-personnel mines working together with mine affected countries would be no more than an instrument of so-called declaratory diplomacy. Instead we have managed to conclude a convention negotiated by more than 100 states, which is a comprehensive treaty providing all the requisites of a verifiable disarmament agreement and one which needs no further or subsidiary agreements to bring about the total elimination of these barbaric devices.  It will be up to Ireland and other like-minded countries to work towards universal adherence to this convention so that any use of anti-personnel mines will quickly be deemed unacceptable anywhere and by anyone. We believe there are sufficient like-minded countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe determined to see that this treaty enters into force with the shortest possible delay.  Our ratification of the convention on the first day it is open for ratification will be a statement of our determination to contribute to bringing this about.  While in Ottawa the Minister will be examining with other states' signatories and especially with our fellow core group countries the significant ways in which we can promote the universalisation of this convention.</P>
    <P>We have been doing our part to assist mine affected countries to clear their lands of these inhumane weapons and to help the victims of landmines to recover from their injuries and reintegrate into their communities.  This year alone we allocated over £1 million to support projects in countries such as Angola, Mozambique, Cambodia and Bosnia which are suffering the consequences of the indiscriminate use of landmines. Long after a conflict is over innocent people continue to suffer and are prevented from resuming normal social and economic activities. The Government is committed to continuing to support demining projects, community mine awareness programmes and victim rehabilitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have lost limbs to anti-personnel mines, and hundreds of thousands more have lost their lives following mine explosions because of the lack of transport and medical care.  The international committee of the Red Cross compiled data in 1995 which showed that approximately 26,000 people per year are killed or maimed by landmines.  Some 19.8 per cent of these were children under the age of 15, 7.3 per cent were women and 4.2 per cent were men over 50 years old.  The remaining 68.7 per cent of victims were &ldquo;potential combatants&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> However, this statistic is open to interpretation and should be read in conjunction with a 1993 study carried out in Peshawar with refugees from Afghanistan, which revealed that only 17 per cent had been engaged in some form of military activity at the time of their maiming or killing.  As NGOs have consistently pointed out, landmines are not very good at killing and injuring soldiers but they all too easily kill and maim civilians and contaminate their land.</P>
    <P>Over the past 25 years, the use of landmines has destroyed not only people and their families but also the productive potential of entire regions and even countries.  In Afghanistan and Cambodia, for example, up to 35 per cent more land could be made available for farming if it were not for the threat of land mines.  The area is equivalent to more than twice Britain's cereal producing area.  The consequences are easy to see.  These countries at one time were self-sufficient in food and now partly depend on international aid.</P>
    <P>This is not exceptional.  The people and economies of about 35 countries are severely affected by land mines.  Some additional 30 countries have varying degrees of difficulty with this threat.  This amounts in all to about one-third of the world.</P>
    <P>This is the backdrop to the world-wide civic campaign involving hundreds of NGOs and millions of citizens to inform, educate and campaign against the effects of land mines and to demand a comprehensive, purposeful and lasting solution to this problem.  These organisations, supported by public opinion, have demanded a complete ban on the production, stockpiling, sale, transfer, export and use of anti-personnel mines.  They also seek increased resources for mine clearance and victim assistance.</P>
    <P>Anti-personnel land mines do not differentiate between an old woman collecting firewood, a UN peace-keeper and a fully armed hard-bitten enemy soldier.  This is why the campaigners have sought a review of the laws of war governing the use of land mines.</P>
    <P>Previous attempts to review the UN convention which was signed in 1980 and came into effect 14 years ago today, that is, 2 December 1983, have not been successful.  It is frightening to note that since the early 1980s more land mines have been made than during any period in history with, perhaps, the exception of the period of the Second World War.  In previous discussions to review the inhumane weapons convention, the order of the day was for certain member states to seek &ldquo;get-out&rdquo; clauses so as to suit their own military, commercial or political purposes.  The definition of anti-personnel mines was amended to exclude mines that are classified &mdash; that is classified by the manufacturers, exporters and user states &mdash; as having different primary design. For example, anti-airfield mines or anti-airfield clearance mines that have distinct and substantial anti-personnel effects could have been left outside the scope of previous treaties because they could be classified differently, with the primary design purpose of, in this instance, runway denial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> A review of the treaty process was eventually agreed in May 1996 and the amended protocol to land mines and the UN Inhumane Weapons Convention came into force but still did not live up to the expectations of the international campaigning groups or public opinion.  The amended treaty had no teeth.  There were virtually no verification and sanction mechanisms, for example, but Canada declared at the end of the conference that it would host a meeting of like-minded countries in the autumn of 1996 to progress the matter further.  How many times do we hear NATO member states described as war lords?  Canada has shown the way and has shown that the will of one state can change the view of many others.  It is true that Ireland was one of a small group of countries which participated with Canada, but it is time that Ireland regained its confidence in taking initiatives of this kind on the world stage.  The Canadian move in relation to land mines is not unlike the nuclear non-proliferation treaty moves instigated by Ireland over 30 years ago.  It is time we renewed that pioneering spirit.  One state can make the difference.  Thanks to Canada, there is now a programme on the table which is workable and can be effective in dealing with the land mines issue.  Canada ended its conference by challenging all states to return in December 1997 to sign a treaty banning anti-personnel mines, and Canada has since instituted a vigorous programme of diplomatic meetings, demarches and pressure to try to bring about a ban on anti-personnel mines within one year.</P>
    <P>This will not solve the problem for those who have already suffered.  There remains the potential for suffering for those who still live in areas which are mined, but it should ensure that future conflicts do not leave behind the deadly legacy that has scarred the world over the past quarter of a century.  According to the Bureau of Political and Military Affairs, US Department of State publication &ldquo;Hidden Killers: The Global Problem With Uncleared Landmines, l993&rdquo; landmines are &ldquo;the most toxic and widespread pollution facing mankind&rdquo;.  At last a serious dent can be made in clearing this pollution facing mankind.  I am sorry that the United States, which carried out that research, will not be one of the first 40 states to sign the treaty.</P>
    <P>Jim Carstairs in &ldquo;Diplomacy, International Law and The Civic Campaign Against Landmines&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>Canada has chosen its allies well; the massive weight of public opinion and the international N.G.O. campaign, and peer group pressure from supportive countries.  It has set a date for a ban in such a way that it would be politically impossible for many states to disagree publicly and will isolate all those states which do not fall into line, and it has done away with the principle of consensus.  The rubric has been: &ldquo;if you don't like it, don't turn up&rdquo; and &ldquo;if you do turn up, you have to agree to a strong position first&rdquo;.  Some governments did not appear to <Col N="1320" /> have understood this message when 89 participants and 36 observing states met in Oslo from 1st to 17th September l997 for the conclusion of formal negotiations on a landmine ban.  It swiftly became clear that many country delegations were uncomfortable with the real dynamics of what has been called the &ldquo;Ottawa Process&rdquo;.  The hangover from cold-war and disarmament policy took its toll as delegates struggled to consolidate the political statements of their respective governments in favour of a total ban on anti-personnel mines with their own ingrained training in resistance to change. Many of the delegates had come from the more traditional consensus-based Conference on Disarmament and found it hard to accept that it was public opinion that was driving the process forward, at times it appeared in spite of the diplomats themselves.</P>
    <P>The ban treaty which has resulted, though not perfect, represents a real step forward both in terms of addressing the urgent humanitarian crisis caused by landmines and in terms of laying the foundations for a new post Cold War diplomacy. It may be premature to estimate the number of countries that will sign the treaty this month.  I hope the number will be 100 and, if not, that it will at least be the 40 required to enable the treaty to come into effect.</P>
    <P>The important features of the treaty are a complete ban on anti-personnel landmines covering production, use, stockpiling, transfer and development; destruction of stockpiles within four years from ratification; clearance of mine fields within ten years; provisions on assistance for victims assistance, demining and stockpile destruction; comprehensive transparency requirements and review and follow-up mechanisms.</P>
    <P>I pay particular tribute to all the Irish and international NGOs.  I mention in particular Pax Christi, the international Catholic peace movement, which has worked so hard to bring about the convention on the prohibition on the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines and on their destruction.  I have some concerns about Article 5.3 which allows certain state parties which believe they are unable to destroy or ensure the destruction of all antipersonnel mines within the time period to request a review conference for an extension of the deadline. However, it is clear that the treaty is a major achievement.  The previous Government worked hard to bring it about and the present Government has completed the work.  It is a commendable day's work and shows what democratic governments acting together, in this case led by Canada, can achieve.  It also shows the important role of NGOs and how much can be done in response to public opinion where there is a will.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for concluding with the words of Canada's Foreign Minister, Mr. Axworthy, at the Ottawa conference:</P>
    <P>Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a straightforward choice.  We can remove one hundred <Col N="1321" /> million mines, an arm and a leg at a time.  Or we can act.  There is momentum, there is political commitment and, most importantly, the peoples of the world support what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>In being one of the first countries to ratify this convention, Ireland is recognising the will of those people.  I hope the minimum number of states will ratify the convention to bring it into effect immediately.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo agus muid ag caint faoin Chonradh tábhachtach seo a shíniú agus a chur i bhfoirm ghnímh sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the opportunity to support this motion approving the terms of the convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction, to be signed by Ireland on 3 December 1997.  It is appropriate that all sides of the House pay tribute to the achievements of those who have brought about the convention, particularly the role played by the Canadian Government.</P>
      <P>There has been huge public support for banning landmines.  The real issue affecting us as politicians is how to bring about the destruction, decommissioning and prohibition of the production of landmines.  It is incumbent on us to speak clearly about the nature of the problem. One of the horrific facts of our time &mdash; I was spokesperson on Foreign Affairs for about 11 years, up to about five years ago &mdash; is that those who make and sell armaments, of which landmines are a part, regard the production of such weapons and means of destruction as an ordinary commodity production.  There is an appalling contradiction in international treaties in that countries which, on the one hand, sign up in terms of international jurisprudence with a great flourish of rhetoric for the most admirable and idealistic forms of human co-operation, even using the word &ldquo;peace&rdquo;, are at the same time the most obdurate objectors against any restriction or restraint on the production or sale of armaments, which is one of the great obscenities at the end of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>I asked the then Taoiseach, on his way to discussions on the Amsterdam Treaty, to see if it was possible, in the context of the treaty, to place some restraint on the volume and production of armaments.  That theme was discussed, but it must be stated regularly and plainly that perhaps the children, if not the adults, of the planet will cry out in horror at one of the most appalling combinations of facts, which is a defilement on the planet, that not only is there no serious restraint on the production and sale of armaments and the placing of landmines but that they are sold to the most vulnerable, starved and malnourished people in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If total resources on the technology and science of landmine production was deflected for five years and devoted to solving the water resources <Col N="1322" /> problem of the world, we would begin to envisage the transformation of whole countries on the African, Asian and Latin American continents. Yet neither the research, the application of technology nor the scientific delivery into the social systems of these countries is possible.  Very often the least democratic countries are the biggest purchasers at international armament fairs.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in 1995 the figure of expenditure for military purposes was $744 billion and the developing countries' share of that money was $114 billion on allegedly defence-related material.  The poorest one-fifth of the world bought one-fifth of the total production of the richest one-fifth of the world, devoted entirely to destruction in a military sense.  There is no point imagining that politics or diplomacy has succeeded when these facts are repeated decade after decade.  The significance of the convention, the seeds of which we are discussing this evening, is that it is at least a small step in the direction of knocking the old con game that something cannot be agreed until everything is agreed, the old strategy of throwing the landmines question in with the question of denuclearisation in the knowledge that we have fobbed it off for a number of years. It was the moral will of the people against such a diplomatic blind that brought us to this point.</P>
    <P>Unlike many Members, I have had the experience of travelling in a North African desert through approximately 7 kilometres of a mined area and watched people point to the hidden jelly fish in the ground like the ones that had amputated the arms and legs of members of families I had met.  There is another appalling side to this. The international legal regime lists this as a heinous act in all the international conventions against cruelty and for the protection of civilians because the target is indiscriminate, frequently the civilian population.  It is used to strike mortal terror in non-compliant populations or as an antiterrorism device.  It is also frequently used to move people from areas they have farmed to areas already under pressure, thereby creating an environmental effect.</P>
    <P>Millions of landmines remain in the ground. The agenda of action for the international community is to put an end to the production, sale, distribution and placement of landmines.  It takes 200 times more effort to remove a mine than to place one.  Funding must be allocated for the technology to comb out mines.  Resources must also be provided for artificial limbs and rehabilitation programmes.</P>
    <P>It is a significant scar on all humanity that we have devoted so much intelligence and resources to producing such indiscriminate weapons of destruction.  The number of people killed by landmines is far greater than the conservative estimate of 25,000 per year.  That figure is taken from the known 110 million landmines in Angola, Eritrea, Mozambique, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Cambodia, South Korea, Iraq and Bosnia.  Some of the countries with whom we share international treaties are cynical about this matter.  The European <Col N="1323" /> Union is being besmirched by its attitude to the armaments trade.  Some people followed the Iran-Iraq war as if they were looking at video games and others took obscene pleasure from deploying weapons to the war.  Landmines were sold by western countries to a regional conflict which later erupted into a much more serious one.</P>
    <P>I am sure young people will have more regard for politics when they note all Members of the House are in agreement on this issue.  One cannot talk about landmines and imagine it does not have implications for our economic and international relations in the other realms of politics in the European Union.  We must integrate what we are doing here with what we are doing elsewhere if we are to take the next necessary steps.</P>

      <P>I support this measure which, when implemented, should lead to a large number of people being saved from the horror of these dreadful devices.  The removal of anti-personnel mines throughout the world cannot happen soon enough.  Before commenting on the specific nature of these appalling instruments of war and terror, I will reflect on a worrying tendency in modern life, the ever increasing use of violence.  It is both sad and extremely strange that at a time when the world has never been more advanced in terms of the sophistication of solutions available to a wide range of problems, people in such numbers seem to find the need to turn to violence.  It affects mankind at international, national, local and domestic levels. Unless some significant progress is made as a matter of urgency in tackling the situation, the future for mankind is very worrying.</P>
      <P>While it has recently been very heartening to see a person of the calibre of our former President assuming a key United Nations role in the campaign for human rights throughout the world, it is very sobering to recall the limited success of the international community in tackling a variety of violent crises around the globe.  For example, it is only a few years since the appalling events in Bosnia.  This was rapidly followed by genocide on a huge scale in both Rwanda and Burundi.  The agony of these countries continues to some degree or another.  Despite the scale of these human and man-made disasters, very little has been achieved to date in terms of convicting and punishing the main culprits in these countries.</P>
      <P>Whatever we may say about the effectiveness of the United Nations in areas of conflict such as those I have outlined, there can be no doubt either about the organisation's general good intentions or its unique position in offering possible solutions to war.  In this regard, the measure before us will undoubtedly strengthen the hand of the UN as it attempts to successfully tackle a range of ongoing conflicts across the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All instruments of war are obscene whether guns, tanks, knives or mines.  In each instance the <Col N="1324" /> clear intention is the same &mdash; to inflict death or the maximum possible level of injury on another human being.  Consequently, the use of such weapons is a crime against humanity.  In an ideal world, there would be no such thing as a legitimate target.  However, the reality of life means that there is a tendency in a war to divide the population into those involved in the armed forces and all other citizens.  In an attempt to place some boundary on the horrors of war, there have been a number of international efforts and conferences aimed at protecting non-involved citizens during the course of war.</P>
    <P>The development and use of the anti-personnel mine was a deliberate and cruel step taken to make a mockery of such measures.  These weapons are totally indiscriminate and take a particular toll on non-military personnel.  They are laid in their hundreds of thousands and many remain as death traps long after the conclusion of hostilities in the relevant conflict.  I sincerely hope the prohibition of these terrible devices will be implemented rapidly.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly return to the overall issue of violence in our society.  As I have already stated, violence is not restricted to interstate conflicts. Instead, it seems to crop up on a regular basis in modern life.  For example, in recent years we have seen a very disturbing increase in the level of extreme violence against women.  On many occasions this has lead to either death or severe injuries.  Similarly, children and older people no longer seem to be safe from the ravages of violence.  It is particularly devastating and worrying to see the level of domestic violence being recorded throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are regular new additions to the litany of violent crimes.  For example, the practice of random drive by killings has become increasingly common in cities throughout the United States.  Similarly, the concept of road rage has become an increasing feature of life in the United Kingdom, and thankfully to a much lesser degree here.  The epidemic of drug abuse which has struck western societies over the last 20 years or so has further added to both the obscenity and frequency of violence.  The desperate drug abuser will often carry out the most horrific attacks simply to obtain resources to support his or her compulsive habit.  Drug suppliers and dealers use violence as a mark of their vile trade in human misery.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as we approach the new Millennium and aspire to newer and greater heights for humanity in a variety of activities, it is vitally important to take stock of who we are in terms of the fundamental values adopted throughout our society.  While a range of issues remain to be effectively tackled at international and national levels, there are few of greater importance than the need to address the obscenity of violence in all its horrible manifestations.</P>
    <P>In many ways, the modern emphasis on the individual has contributed to an increase in the level of tension in society.  For example, the need <Col N="1325" /> to be assertive is stressed more and more in commercial life and personal development.  While the biblical advice of turning the other cheek was widely promoted a few years ago, we are now more likely to hear people being encouraged to get their retaliation in first.  Unfortunately, this is increasingly the case in the competitive world of sport.  The vital need to win at all costs is stressed, despite the fact that sport should primarily be about enjoyment and recreation.</P>
    <P>The sum of my comments is that violence is an evil and a crime against mankind and that it must be tackled at a number of levels.  Otherwise, the very basis of civilised and humane living will be eroded beyond repair.  While I do not wish to indulge in any attack on the media, it is worrying to see the central role of violence in so many television series and films.  It even penetrates various cartoons screened, supposedly, for the entertainment of children.  What possible message can children get from watching such material, day in day out?  With its simplistic division of everyone into good and evil, it cannot help the developing child to adopt a balanced view of life.  The effect on children's views is clearly reflected in the nature of toys which are the most popular, especially at Christmas.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the adoption of anti-personnel mine measures at international level.  Hopefully, the resulting benefits will become apparent at the earliest possible time.  However, the issue forcefully brings to mind the cancer of violence and the worrying failure of the most affluent societies to deal effectively with it.  I have no doubt it is a problem which will require a wide coalition of efforts, especially education, before the scourge of violence or the daily threat of violence, totally disappears.  Since the target of violent behaviour is often the most defenceless members of the community, we must keep their interests and concerns in mind at all times.</P>

      <P>The ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction marks a small contribution on the part of this country to a safer and more civilised world.  However, the ratification of this convention by all countries, especially the main producers of these lethal weapons, would be a major contribution to a safer and more civilised world.  If one wished to find an example of man's inhumanity to man and the unscrupulousness of the world's armaments industry, one need look no further than landmines. These weapons are hidden, they do not differentiate between the pressure of a barefoot child and that of a military vehicle, they are cheap to manufacture and install but expensive to remove and remain lethal long after a military conflict has ended.  Landmines continue to render significant areas of productive land unusable and this land is often in areas where the need for food is greatest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Landmines are often made of plastic and no bigger than a child's hand.  The legacy of the landmine is truly awful.  An estimated 26,000 people, mainly civilians, are killed each year.  Compared to the 3,000 people killed during 25 years of appalling atrocities in Northern Ireland one gets an indication of the appalling waste of life.  An estimated 110 million landmines still pose a threat in 70 countries, particularly in the Third World. We are told that the world's major powers plant two million to five million landmines every year. The United Nations estimates that at present rate of clearance it will take 1,100 years to rid the world of landmines at a cost of $33 billion.  That means it will be the third millennium by the time they are cleared or, looking backwards, we should have started to clear them the year the Normans landed in Ireland.  It costs only a few pounds to produce and lay a mine but it can cost almost £1,000 to remove it.  The more sophisticated mine detectors now cost approximately £6,000 each. One person involved in clearance is killed for every 5,000 mines removed.</P>
    <P>While we have never produced or used landmines, our Defence Forces serving abroad with the United Nations have not been immune from their threat.  Much of the work of the Irish troops serving in Lebanon with UNIFIL involves the detection and clearance of mines.  Earlier this summer six Irish soldiers involved in clearing an Israeli minefield were injured when one of the devices detonated.  One of those involved, Private Gary Maloney, lost his leg in that explosion.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it is shameful that it has taken so long for serious efforts to tackle the problem and for this convention to emerge. There is no doubt that if there had been more casualties in what we like to call the developed world and if the problem had not been largely confined to the Third World, action would have been taken earlier.</P>
    <P>Our welcome for the convention must also be tempered by the knowledge that many key players did not participate in the Oslo conference at which it was agreed and that some have made it clear they will not ratify it.  While Ireland is entitled to credit for the key role it played in securing agreement at Oslo, it was particularly disappointing that two of our European Union partners, Greece and Finland, did not participate. Major producers of mines, including Russia, China, India and Pakistan, did not participate either.  I understand, however, that Greece has announced it will sign the convention and there are signs that Japan and Russia will sign at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the United States which participated in the Oslo conference but whose delegation said it was not in a position to forego the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of anti-personnel mines for the foreseeable future is most disappointing.  Many people find it incomprehensible that a country which claims to offer moral leadership in world affairs continues to assert a right to use such weapons.  It is even more <Col N="1327" /> extraordinary in the context of statements issued by the US Government at the end of October when it launched new initiatives to remove existing landmines.  Yet it continues to maintain the right to manufacture, stockpile and use landmines as and when it sees fit.</P>
    <P>President Clinton has been quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;as Commander in Chief, I will not send our soldiers to defend the freedom of our people and the freedom of others without doing everything we can to make them as secure as possible&rdquo;.  The contribution landmines make to the security of the US forces is totally disproportionate to the death and destruction their continued use will bring to tens of thousands of innocent civilians of whom few, if any, will be American.</P>
    <P>Many people in the United States do not share the enthusiasm of the US armed forces for these dreadful weapons.  The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October, is headed by an American woman, Ms Jody Williams.  It will continue to exert pressure on its Government to change its position and I hope our Government will use the close relationship that exists to exert all possible pressure on Washington and on the other countries which have opted out of this convention to follow the example of virtually every other country in the world by ratifying it.</P>
    <P>Apart from the dreadful death and injury caused by these weapons, the landmine problem is adding greatly to the difficulties of many developing countries in feeding their people. Whole areas of potentially productive agricultural land are off limits because they are infested with landmines.  We must look for an accelerated clearance programme to stop the death and destruction and to free up additional areas for food production, and the primary responsibility for financing this campaign must rest with the countries which have profited from the production of these landmines.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the eve of Ireland's signing this convention in Ottawa.  Tomorrow is European Disability Day and, while the disabilities caused by landmines are outside the Europe Union, we should be mindful of the disabilities caused by landmines for many years.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this House agrees this is an optimistic moment in international relations but, as Deputy Higgins pointed out, one must reflect on how international relations have got to the point which has allowed so many landmines to be put in place.  It is a gross failure of the world order which has allowed this horrific situation and the statistics on landmines are very depressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I watched a video produced by the Irish <Col N="1328" /> Red Cross.  The effects of landmines all over the world, the number of landmines, the length of time it will take to clear them and the cost to public health systems, life and the environment, are depressing.  Landmines affect every one of those areas on a daily basis.  The scale of the problem is enormous and, while this is an optimistic moment at which so many countries will sign this convention, it is very clear that the convention has been brought about primarily by the work of non-governmental organisations and by the sort of focus which individual personalities, such as the late Diana, Princess of Wales, have brought to bear on this issue.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there have been those in the international political community who have worked to make sure this convention is successful but landmines are an indictment of the political world order because the scale of the damage is so intense.  It is very worrying that the US and China will not sign tomorrow, and that it is questionable whether Russia will sign, although there seems to be an indication that these countries are moving in a more proactive way in relation to tackling this issue.</P>
    <P>The scale of the problem has primarily been pointed out by the International Red Cross, whose members were working with people who had suffered the effects of landmines exploding. In 1995 the International Red Cross launched a worldwide campaign advocating a ban on the weapons and it has done a tremendous amount of work since then.  Since 1979 the International Committee of the Red Cross Rehabilitation Programmes alone have made over 100,000 artificial limbs for 70,000 amputees in 22 countries.  Some 140,000 pairs of crutches and 7,000 wheelchairs have also been produced.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that most victims of landmines are civilians who step on a landmine after a war has ended.  In some countries 30 per cent of victims are women and children.  The basic facts are that every 20 minutes landmines claim one victim.  Every hour three people are killed or maimed by these weapons and in any one day 70 people will become victims of landmines.  It is estimated that every month 2,000 people are killed or maimed by landmines.  In other words, in a year landmines kill or injure 24,000 people.</P>
    <P>Landmines kill or maim more people every year than the population of the suburbs of Crumlin and Inchicore combined and it would take less than five months for landmines to kill a population equivalent to that of Terenure.  As other speakers said, the scourge is very far removed from Ireland.</P>
    <P>In some ways it is easy for us to sign this convention. We are not involved in this deadly trade. However, at a moral level it is important that we have taken a lead in it and that we are up front. We should continue to use our influence internationally to make sure that other countries which will not sign the convention do so in the future.  As well as direct victims of landmines there are many indirect victims.  Communities <Col N="1329" /> have been terrorised and many countries have been devastated through landmine infestation.  A great deal of land cannot be used as a result of landmines, which hugely affects the economies of the countries concerned.  Access to fresh water may be denied &mdash; most people injured or killed by landmines were collecting water.</P>
    <P>This treaty is only a first step in the huge job of de-mining.  It costs between $3 and $10 to produce a landmine and between $300 and $1,000 to remove it.  This treaty to stop landmine production is important but huge costs will have to be borne to clear landmines.  One estimate is that it will cost £300 billion over a period of 1,100 years, which is an horrific thought.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position to support a worthy workshop run by the Irish Red Cross, providing supports to people injured by landmines in Kenya.  The organisation launched a Christmas appeal to raise £135,000 and asked the Government to back the campaign with an equal amount.  Given that tomorrow is not only budget day and European day for disability but also the date for signing the convention, it is appropriate the Government should support the work of the Red Cross.  The aids which landmine victims need are cheap by western European standards but are expensive in countries where landmines abound, so the victims cannot afford them.  Anything we can do to give aid should be done.  Landmines also affect those we send abroad to offer humanitarian assistance and to keep the peace.  A number of them have been killed by landmines also. This has direct relevance for the many Irish people giving aid.</P>
    <P>It is important that the treaty is signed tomorrow but it is horrific that matters have reached their current state, in which landmines are so pervasive. It will take a huge international commitment to get rid of the existing mines, even if no more are produced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing her time.  I praise the Government for participating in this positive initiative.  We can be justifiably proud of our role.  We also must praise the previous Government, which initiated a joint action of the EU Council of Ministers in October 1996, during the Irish Presidency, which established a moratorium on mine exports with the stated goal of total global elimination of land mines.  This embargo was legally binding and seems to have been adhered to.  Deputy Higgins' party colleague, the former Minister of State, Ms Joan Burton, played a positive role in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the statistics, which are frightening: for every mine cleared, 20 new ones are planted; in Bosnia alone, 4 million to 6 million mines were planted; it will cost a staggering £33 billion to clear mines and it will take 11 centuries to do so, as Deputy De Rossa said.  I hope this treaty will give added impetus to this work and speed up the process significantly.  The cost of laying a mine is $3 but to remove it costs <Col N="1330" /> $1,000, which gives an idea of why the costs are so huge.</P>
    <P>Many people say that political or NGO activity is a waste of time but politics has played a useful role here &mdash; the NGOs, specifically Pax Christi, have been mentioned.  In September 1995 there was a review of the UN Convention on Inhumane Weapons, which controls the use of anti-personnel mines.  That meeting broke up in disarray when they could not agree on even the basic rules.  Ironically, in spring 1996 the Gulf War commander General Schwarzkopf joined 14 other US generals calling on President Clinton to back a global ban.  I join the criticism of the US for not coming on board on this.  As a world leader, it needs to take a lead on this matter rather than leaving it to smaller countries such as Ireland to become part of the Ottawa process.</P>
    <P>Pax Christi is pressing the UN to proclaim 2000 as the international year of the eradication of land mines.  The Minister should emphasis the importance of this to his colleagues.</P>
    <P>I wish to single out for praise the European Union, which has played a very positive role in making available about £11 million for the clearance of mines.  However, we must ensure the mines are cleared.  We cannot have what is known as &ldquo;double dipping&rdquo; where the companies which produced the mines, such as Meckam in South Africa and Daimler-Benz, are seeking the contracts to remove them, which is quite a lucrative business.  Ireland should seek to have the EU declared a mine free zone.  There are mine fields in Greece and Finland, although the Finns dispute that.  As the EU broadens it may include the Czech Republic and former Yugoslavia which also have mines.  The Organisation for African Unity and CARICOM have said they wish to have mine free zones in their areas.</P>
    <P>It is very important that, in talking about the elimination of land mines, we are aware Ireland is part of that military process and the export of weapons.  The Afri report last year highlighted the fact that Ireland is involved in the arms race. In 1996 the Department of Foreign Affairs approved 35 export licences for specifically military goods, those which do not have a dual purpose. These included airforce equipment, such as runway arresters which are a type of net to catch planes landing on aircraft carriers, and electronic devices for aiming gun turrets.  These goods are exported to countries to which Deputy Higgins referred, such as Argentina, Brazil, Malaysia and Singapore, which do not have very good human rights records.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Government to take action on this matter.  The Afri Report stated:</P>
    <P>Clearly, the Department of Foreign Affairs is operating a twin track foreign policy: the public one, as outlined in the White Paper, proclaiming our principled stand on the arms trade and human rights; and the hidden agenda that promotes the sale of weapons parts and military goods to dubious destinations all over the <Col N="1331" /> world in contravention of agreed EU guidelines.</P>

Tá sé riachtanach go dtiocfaidh an lá sin.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate and who expressed not only their support for the ratification of this convention but their abhorrence of the unbelievable toll landmines have inflicted and are likely to continue to inflict on various communities throughout the world. The growing awareness in this country of this matter has been expressed by the Government. In 1994 the amount allocated to support the UN and the NGOs, such as Concern, amounted to approximately £450,000.  This has now been increased to approximately £1 million.  The commitment to supporting such efforts will continue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell raised the question of the definition of anti-personnel mines.  While not ideal, the definition in this convention is considerably wider than any previous convention of its kind.  Anti-personnel mines are defined as &ldquo;mines designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.&rdquo; Deputy Gay Mitchell also raised the provision in Article 5.3 that allows state parties that believe they are unable to destroy or ensure the destruction of all anti-personnel landmines, referred to in the first paragraph, within the prescribed time period to submit a request to have the time period extended.  While I understand his concerns, this provision is specifically designed to help developing countries that might not be in a position to clear mines with their own resources.  They should be able to present a case for funding from the donor community countries.  This is expressly provided for under Article 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the support given by Canada.  However, we should not forget the role played by other countries.  Austria prepared the first draft of the convention and organised an expert meeting last February to discuss the text. Belgium hosted the meeting in June that convened the diplomatic conference that took place in September in Oslo, which was co-chaired by Norway and South Africa.  Ireland played a key role in Oslo.  Germany also hosted an expert meeting earlier this year that concentrated on the verification mechanisms of the convention.  To keep the momentum moving forward, Ireland will be offering in Ottawa to host the expert meeting next year to assess the current state of the anti-personnel <Col N="1332" /> mine problem as well as progress in mine action.</P>
    <P>Deputies De Rossa, Fitzgerald, Gormley and Michael Higgins referred to the fact that, so far, America has not seen fit to ratify this convention. This is disappointing.  However, this and other issues will be discussed in Ottawa this week.  It is extremely important that the American Government be persuaded to change its mind.  We must avail ourselves of whatever persuasive influence we have, together with other EU and non EU countries, to ensure that this happens without delay.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for the undoubted support given to the convention.  We look forward to continuing to make our best efforts to ensure that the ratification of the convention will have the desired effect of removing and banning the production of anti-personnel landmines and remove this enormous blot in international history, especially in Third World countries.  I will not repeat the statistics which are so horrific as to compel every conscientious person with any influence to work towards an agreement which can be implemented throughout the world.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the House for affording me the opportunity of raising this issue which is of prime international importance.  As everybody is aware, over the past five or six years an unusual political situation has existed in Algeria with the result that a state of emergency exists resulting in the erosion of civil and, in particular, human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> A question has arisen regarding who is responsible for what atrocity.  This has been well documented by Amnesty International in the hope that EU Governments will take up the issue at EU level or the UN with a view to the establishment of a commission with powers and authority to identify the causes of and remedies for the atrocities in Algeria.  I do not wish to enumerate the various atrocities, but on the Government side there are retaliations for peculiar happenings on the opposite side.  Islamic groups seem to have set themselves up as an alternative Government.</P>
    <P>Thousands of men, women and children have been murdered in the most grotesque circumstances over the past five or six years.  Everybody in the outside world is conscious of what is happening but the outside world has so far been unable to assist because the Government does not want external interference.  However, the problem has gone on for far too long.  The world is becoming a much smaller place with modern telecommunications, and people throughout Europe and the world are aware of what is happening.  In view of this and the fact that we have always prided ourselves on our pursuance of human rights issues with a view to highlighting problems and resolving them, something needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister on behalf of the Government, should take initiatives to highlight the situation and encourage the setting up of a UN inspired and backed commission which would have some powers of investigation.  Such a commission would at least be able to go into Algeria and give its opinions to the rest of the world as to how best to protect the lives of the innocent human beings currently being sacrificed on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>I will take this item in the absence of my Government colleagues who are on official business.</P>
      <P>This is a very timely debate, one which I welcome. The situation in Algeria, as revealed in numerous media reports for several months, has filled all of us with a deep sense of horror.  The massacre of innocent civilians, particularly of women and children, has evoked a strong sense of outrage among the Irish people.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department have received a very large number of expressions of concern from the public and the Government fully shares this sense of outrage.</P>
      <P>The current horrific situation in Algeria has its genesis in the cancellation by the then president of the second round of the general election in January 1992 when it seemed that Islamic fundamentalists were set to win.  Since then a vicious conflict has been fought, resulting in an estimated 80,000 deaths.</P>

    <P>This appalling situation has attracted world-wide concern.  With our partners in the European Union we have been monitoring it very closely. Following the Council of Ministers' meeting on 12 September, the Presidency of the Union issued a statement on Algeria expressing the deep shock <Col N="1334" /> of the EU at the wave of killings and other atrocities which have plunged Algeria into bloodshed and reaffirmed its outright condemnation of all acts of terrorism and indiscriminate violence.  It reiterated its encouragement for the political and economic reform process in Algeria.  It was agreed at the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Mondorf in late October that the Presidency should meet the Algerian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ataf, and this meeting took place last week in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>At that meeting the Presidency conveyed, on behalf of the EU, our profound concern at reports on Algeria, our solidarity with the people of Algeria and our condemnation of terror and extreme violence.  We will continue to encourage a process of national reconciliation with democratic parties who renounce violence and confirm the European Union's intention to continue to support the process of reform, notably through the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.  The Presidency also stressed the vital importance of fundamental freedoms and human rights and indicated the EU's readiness to facilitate a political solution.</P>
    <P>The Government's position was set out in the reply given by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to a parliamentary question in the Dáil on 4 November.  In this he indicated that he was deeply shocked at the reports of massacres, that he could not accept the Algerian assertion that what was happening was an internal affair and that, together with his EU colleagues, he was at the disposal of the protagonists should the EU be requested to help facilitate a political solution.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with the Minister of State at the Department, met the Algerian Ambassador to Ireland to discuss recent events in Algeria.  My colleagues outlined the profound repulsion felt at the largescale killings of so many innocent Algerians, including women and children.  My colleagues made it clear that our interest in Algeria and our desire to assist should not be seen as interference. They explained the importance we attach to an approach made in a spirit of co-operation, by holding out the hand of friendship to an emerging democracy which has difficulties in dealing with killings on this scale and in coping with a very serious security problem within their territory. However, my colleagues indicated that, as a country with a strong track record in seeking to protect human rights, Ireland would be understanding but firm in handling these issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear he was keen to explore ways in which Ireland, either bilaterally or through the EU, could help relieve the problem in Algeria.  He also asked the Ambassador to convey to the Algerian Foreign Minister his interest in meeting him in Algeria in the not too distant future, explaining that our foreign policy was deeply posited on the need to address human rights issues.</P>
    <P>Nobody should be under any illusion that the situation in Algeria is susceptible to a quick fix. <Col N="1335" /> It is a complex and highly dangerous amalgam of tensions and strife, based not only on an ideological struggle but fed also by economic and social alienation.  This has resulted in a catastrophic cycle of violence, repression and destruction. Outside involvement, if wisely handled, can help bring this cycle to an end, but it can also, if mishandled, prove counterproductive and risk leading to increased isolation and further suffering by the Algerian people.  Our efforts must, therefore, be directed to ensuring that the outcome is one which meets the objectives of respect for human rights and support for democracy which I have outlined.  The Government is committed to continuing its efforts in that regard and to this end my colleague, Deputy Andrews, is hoping to see the situation at first hand in Algeria in the near future.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hospital Waiting Lists.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The waiting list for cardiac surgery for children in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin is approximately 160 and rising, compared to 120 at this time last year.  Operations are regularly cancelled due to the lack of a surgeon or an intensive care bed or a qualified intensive care nurse.</P>
      <P>There are two cardiac surgeons available to the hospital and they give one day per week for surgery. As a result, children who are due to have operations have their operations cancelled to allow urgent surgery to be carried out on newborn babies.  There are also two cardiac consultants attached to the hospital and the number of patients they must attend to each week is, to put it mildly, staggering.  The waiting list for a public out-patient is approximately 12 months.  The Minister will agree this is unacceptable, particularly for a child with a heart condition.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline what it means to have a child with a heart problem.  I recently received a letter from a constituent which set out her deep concerns about her five year old son who has a heart condition.  She told me her child's skin colour is quite blue, while his mouth and tongue are almost black.  He cannot climb the stairs in his home and gets breathless walking from room to room.  All outdoor journeys are conducted in a child's buggy.  This year he started school and he must be carried to his classroom.  It is not difficult to imagine how this child's quality of life would improve if the necessary surgery was available to him.  That surgery should be carried out without further delay.  However, this child is 106th on the waiting list.  It must be heartbreaking for the parents to have a child in that condition and to know he is only 106th on the list.  Indeed, it is heartbreaking for the parents of children who are behind and in front of him on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the public regularly complain that they cannot understand how this situation is allowed to continue.  I have raised the issue of cardiac surgery for children but a recent Sunday <Col N="1336" /> newspaper carried a major article on the problem of waiting lists for cardiac surgery for adults, where there is also a huge problem.  At a time when Ireland has a booming economy, it is difficult for parents, spouses and other relatives of ill people awaiting cardiac surgery to understand the situation.  I hope that in his reply the Minister of State can give me some assurances.  In particular, I ask him to arrange without further delay for another cardiac surgeon to be allocated to the Children's Hospital, Crumlin, and to have at least another cardiac consultant as well as providing more intensive care beds and ICU trained nurses. The theatres in Our Lady's Hospital are like something from the 1950s.  The Minister of State should give some hope to people who have to face this dreadful situation every day.  We would all like to see immediate attention being paid to this serious problem.  I trust the Minister of State can give us some hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for raising this issue.  I am grateful to him for giving me an opportunity to clarify the situation regarding paediatric cardiac services at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.</P>
      <P>This hospital serves as the national referral centre for paediatric heart disease and has recently experienced an increase in the number of children awaiting cardio-thoracic surgery.  This additional demand has resulted in extra pressure on the service and an increased waiting time for some patients.  My Department has had discussions with the hospital and is fully aware of the need to address this situation.  The reasons for the additional pressure have been identified as a lack of theatre space and ICU beds, a shortage of ICU trained nurses and advances in surgical and interventional techniques which have resulted in increased demand.</P>
      <P>In April 1997 my Department invited proposals from the hospital for the spending of £500,000 to be made available from the 1997 waiting list initiative to alleviate the pressures on this specialty.  Proposals submitted by the hospital were accepted by my Department and the funding was immediately provided to support them. In a recent progress report on the initiative the hospital stated that:</P>
      <P>Since the appointment of a locum consultant paediatrician the hospital has achieved an increase in its cardiology out-patient department's activity and in the number of echo-cardiograms performed.  The combination of both these factors will result in an additional 545 procedures being carried out in 1997.  Building works on four additional ICU beds were recently completed.  An additional training programme for ICU nurses commenced in September and six candidates have been selected for participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a project team, which consists of officials from my Department and hospital representatives, <Col N="1337" /> is currently working on a development plan for the provision of additional theatres at the hospital.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has asked that this work be concluded as a matter of urgency so that the hospital can proceed to the next stage of this important development which has his and my support.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently met the chairman and representatives of Our Lady's Hospital and confirmed that the project would be included as a priority in the Department's capital programme. A budget cost cannot be set for the development until the project team has completed its brief.</P>
    <P>The measures outlined above will combine to address the problems which have been identified at the Crumlin hospital.  The Deputy will also be aware that proposals are currently being developed for a wider range of measures in relation to cardiac care services, both adult and paediatric.  I am confident that these initiatives will have a positive impact on the service levels available for this specialty in the near future.</P>
    <P>In fact, I have been in contact with Dr. Des Duff in Crumlin hospital.  He advised me also, as the Deputy said, that there is a problem with the cardiac services there.  As I outlined, the Minister for Health and Children has taken steps to alleviate the difficulties, and within a short time we hope to have made an impact on that problem.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces is one of the few State institutions which has never been called into disrepute.  It is often the subject of much praise for its role at home in internal security operations and for peacekeeping duties overseas.  This has changed recently, however, with statements and accusations being made which have not helped the country's image.  Responsible and constructive contributions can be made by less destructive means.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the Gleeson commission, pay and conditions have improved greatly in the Defence Forces.  I had the honour of serving in the Army for almost 20 years.  At all times I found the commitment and sense of duty to be of the highest order.  Many personnel worked at unpleasant tasks in poor conditions, by and large accepting this as their lot.  I saw members of the Defence Forces risk their lives, and some lose theirs, for the greater good.  They never expected or sought to make a claim.</P>
      <P>Hearing loss in the Defence Forces is an issue that has gathered momentum in recent years.  In 1992 49 claims were received.  This has increased to the present number of 100 claims per week.  It is irrelevant to examine how the claims propagated, as those claims are now before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> The high level of compensation awarded by courts for certain hearing loss patterns is also irrelevant.  In other jurisdictions those would be regarded as being in the normal range and would attract little or no comment.</P>
    <P>Exposure to gunfire can cause hearing loss. Present judicial attitudes hold that if hearing has been damaged in any way, the plaintiff must be compensated.  Soldiers claim their hearing was damaged on firing ranges where they were not given adequate ear protection as required by regulations.  In many cases a considerable degree of hearing loss has been sustained, while in others minimum hearing loss has occurred.  Certain questions must be asked, assuming that prior to 1987 the level of protection afforded to personnel was inadequate by modern standards.  Did the State take practical measures at the time?  Earplugs were issued in the mid 1970s.  On what recommendation were these purchased and were they assumed to be satisfactory at the time?  Did the State provide an acceptable duty of care based on the information it had then?  From the late 1970s I was acutely aware that hearing could be damaged if ear protection was not worn during range practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently hinted at setting up a tribunal.  It is still too early to take this approach, and the Minister should not put administrative convenience before the public interest. He should ensure his legal team pay great attention to the unit commander's certificate, which details information on the claimant, and particularly the other information column, which details previous employment and other activities. In many cases where such information may have had a significant bearing it has not been used.</P>
    <P>The cortical electrical response test, an objective hearing test, should be carried out on all claimants.  Army deafness may open the floodgates of litigation.  Where does the duty of care stop?  Present health and safety guidelines tell us those who sit in front of a computer screen should have an adjustable seat.  Will people who did not have this facility in the past make claims in the future?</P>
    <P>Can we legislate to prohibit the &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; policy?  If so, will the cost of litigation be outside the reach of the common man?  Has the judicial system, which should be the servant of the people, now become the master?  Should we consider legislation which would establish particular rates of compensation for specified levels of injury?  The Minister has a difficult task ahead, but it must be addressed with the utmost urgency.</P>

      <P>The role of the FCA in this matter is inclined to be forgotten.  From the point of view of the training of young men and women, I welcome the fact that a study group has been set up. However, I am concerned they are not issued with personal ear defenders.  As a consequence ear defenders have to be shared at ranges.  I urge the Minister to rectify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1339" />
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue.  The interests of taxpayers and genuine claimants must be protected by the Minister for Defence in the State's handling of court actions by members of the Defence Forces over hearing damage.  Fine Gael supports genuine claimants who have suffered significant hearing disability as a consequence of their work on our behalf in the Defence Forces.  It is important that members of the Defence Forces should have the same recourse to justice as every other citizen.</P>
      <P>It is clear that strict parameters for hearing damage measurement and legal fees must be set down before a new wave of claims comes through the courts system in the new year.  As a first step I ask the Minister to commence an urgent review of the 1,000 cases already dealt with through the courts, to examine the patterns of settlement and the implications for the State's approach to liability. Such a review should take full cognisance of the cost breakdown in cases being heard, which are as follows: £5,500 per case for solicitors, £2,500 for barristers, £2,000 for witnesses and a departmental cost of £6,000 per individual case, a total cost of £16,000 before a penny is awarded to any claimant.</P>
      <P>The review should also take into account that 20 civil servants have been allocated to work on this issue in the Department, 20 extra solicitors are now involved in the Chief State Solicitor's Office and a number of Army officers are working full time on this issue.  The Minister will agree that the potential scale of liability to the State has far-reaching implications, if the system in use remains unaltered and loosely managed.  I ask the Minister to get an urgent report before Christmas from the expert group which he has established to set out an internationally verifiable test to assess hearing damage and permanent disability.  The remaining number of days of the court term should be used by the Minister to hurry negotiations with the legal profession to examine how best to reduce costs in these cases.  Will the Minister meet as soon as possible with the Incorporated Law Society who states in today's media reports that there is a better way of managing the claims and who criticises the State's approach as one that is guaranteed to maximise rather than minimise costs.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the public is concerned about a compensation culture out of control, not because of successful litigation but because of the huge legal costs associated with such actions.  It is clear, given the magnitude of what is going on, that before we can move to any other system, such as an awards tribunal or a panel, agreement must be reached by all concerned on the valid criteria to be used in assessing hearing handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister examine whether an approach could be taken via the social welfare system?  Would this be the most effective way of providing support for those genuine claimants suffering verified long-term disability from hearing damage?  I sound a note of caution that the <Col N="1340" /> potential knock-on effect of these claims from members of the Defence Forces, who suffered occupational damage to their hearing, needs to be carefully handled if we are not to have an avalanche of litigation from workers in other State sectors where high levels of noise had been part of their work environment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to imply that individuals do not have a right to seek recourse to justice through the courts, they certainly do but the Minister's objective must be to minimise the legal fees, introduce an internationally validated hearing damage measurement and look after genuine claimants with speed and fairness.  This may ultimately entail an administrative based award system rather than the former slow and costly courts procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies for providing me with the opportunity of dealing with this issue.  Army hearing loss litigation is a matter of grave concern to me and the Government.  A huge amount of taxpayers' money is at stake.  We must ensure every effort is made to contain this expenditure while having regard to the legitimate claims of serving and former members of the Defence Forces who may have been genuinely injured.</P>
      <P>With over 10,200 claims made against the Department and claims continuing to arrive at a rate of 100 per week, it is evident this is an enormous problem.  In recent days there has been tremendous media and public interest in the subject. This is something I welcome.  In view of the huge potential cost it is important that public opinion be well informed as to the extent of the problem and the issues involved.  There has been criticism of the validity of many of the existing claims.  I hope we can maintain a balance in debating the issue.  There are genuine claims and I am anxious all claimants are treated fairly.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that unprotected exposure to noise such as gunfire may cause high tone hearing loss.  Of itself, this does not induce a significant handicap.  Normally the ability of an individual affected by high tone hearing loss to hear everyday conversation remains largely unaffected.  In such circumstances he or she has not incurred a significant handicap and a large compensation award should not be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not simply the view of the Department of Defence.  There are internationally accepted hearing handicap assessment systems.  There are systems in America, Britain and other countries which reflect this consensus.  To date, such systems have not found favour in our courts. Because of this the Department of Health and Children is preparing as a matter of urgency a hearing handicap assessment system.  A group of specialist hearing consultants have been convened to examine the matter.  I hope their report will be available early in the new year.  When completed the hearing handicap assessment system will be adduced in evidence in court.  I am advised that, if it is accepted by the courts, it may <Col N="1341" /> have a marked effect on the level of damages payable.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to address relates to the costs incurred by the current strategy of defending rather than settling cases.  There are two difficulties.  The lack of an agreed hearing handicap assessment system is a major impediment in negotiating settlements.  The State cannot settle cases <i>en masse</i> at the current level of quantum because this is too high.  A rapid settlement policy, whether by a tribunal or some other scheme, would require a blanket admission of liability.  This could have the effect of inducing many more claims.  Such an approach would require us to ignore advice from eminent medical experts to the effect that the majority of claimants do not have a serious hearing handicap.</P>
    <P>The current strategy of running selected cases is producing results.  A number of cases have been dismissed by the courts and, more importantly, the overall level of quantum has been reducing, particularly in the current legal term.  Pending the production of a hearing handicap assessment system by the Department of Health and Children the current strategy should be continued at least in the short-term for as long as it yields such positive results.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legal costs involved the director general of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland has suggested that he meet with my Department and the Chief State Solicitor with a view to discussing how the cases could be processed in a more cost effective manner.  I am happy to co-operate with this approach and a meeting has been set up for next week.  At this meeting my officials will propose to the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland that, in view of the large volume of hearing cases being handled by some solicitors, a discount should be given in relation to the size of the fee.  There is a remarkable similarity in all the statements of claim coming into the Department dealing with the issue of hearing loss.  With the advent of the word processor there is a major reduction in the amount of <Col N="1342" /> work involved in the preparation of these similar cases by solicitors.  This suggests there may be scope for a reduction in the level of fees charged. While fully aware of the taxing system available in the courts, it behoves the profession, in view of the public interest, to show its goodwill by cooperating with the State in effecting a reduction in these fees.</P>
    <P>The Government is prepared to compensate those who have suffered a genuine injury and are suffering a significant handicap.  What we are not prepared to do is waste taxpayers' money on compensating individuals whose hearing is normal for their age or whose handicap is so small that they did not notice it until they spotted an advertisement in the newspaper inducing them to make a claim.  The money that has been spent and may be spent on this issue could be put to far better use in projects dealing with health, education, social welfare and infrastructure generally.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Frances Fitzgerald and Timmins for their very constructive approach to this matter this evening and look forward to a continuance of that consensus.  It is a nightmare scenario I have inherited.  I want to find practical solutions and am open to considering suggestions from all sides of the House which would take account of what Deputy Timmins said &mdash; that we have the greatest pride in the work and achievements of our Defence Forces.  As Minister for Defence I would be the last person to diminish that pride and honour in the slightest degree.</P>
    <P>What I am endeavouring to do, with the support of the House, will do more to enhance that pride and honour in the longer term rather than standing idly by and watching the litany of claims being submitted without paying due attention to the kinds of processes which can and must be put in place.</P>
    <P>I can assure both Deputies I will bear their suggestions in mind.</P>

    <P>The grounds on which a person may be refused entry to the State are set out in Article 5 (2) of the Aliens Order 1946 as inserted by Article 3 of the Aliens (Amendment) Order 1975, S.I. No. 128 of 1975.  The principal grounds are as follows: (1) the person is not in a position to support her/himself and any accompanying dependants; (2) although wishing to take up employment in the State, the person is not in possession of a valid work permit issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; (3) the person is suffering from a specified disease or disability; (4) the person has been convicted, whether in the State or otherwise, of an offence punishable under the law of the place of conviction by imprisonment for a maximum period of at least one year; (5) the person being a national of a state subject to visa controls is not the holder <Col N="1345" /> of a valid Irish visa; (6) the person is the subject of a deportation order; (7) the person has been prohibited from landing by order of the Minister under the Aliens Act; (8) the person is not in possession of a valid passport or other document which (a) establishes their nationality and identity to the immigration officer's satisfaction; (b) was issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government; and (c) does not purport to have been renewed otherwise than by or on behalf of such an authority.  There is no basis for refusing a person entry to the State on grounds of colour or ethnic origin.</P>
    <P>These controls are necessary because of the evidence of an abuse of the common travel area by people with no right to enter Ireland.  Almost 1,000 people have been detected trying to enter the State illegally since the new measures took effect.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities, who have responsibility for immigration controls at points of entry to the State, have been asked to ensure that immigration officers exercising their powers do so in a discreet and courteous way, and to ensure that those who are questioned and are entitled to enter the country are thanked for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>Immigration officers have a difficult task to perform, particularly at a time when the State is experiencing illegal immigration at a level unheard of previously.  I would, of course, be concerned to ensure that there should be no occasion where the controls would be exercised without an acceptable level of courtesy.  I would hope that the general public would understand the difficult and sensitive tasks which fall to be performed by our immigration officers and would co-operate with them in the exercise of their duties.</P>
    <P>I dealt earlier with the Refugee Act.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> In accordance with the provisions of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 1990, the powers to grant a firearm certificate to a person resident in the State is vested in the local superintendent of the Garda district where the person resides.  Firearm certificates to non-residents are granted by me.</P>
    <P>Strict conditions for the granting of these certificates are provided for in the Acts.  In addition, a firearm certificate may be revoked in circumstances provided for in the Acts.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the restrictions imposed in the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1990 are adequate to control the use and issue of firearms.  Accordingly, I have no plans to amend these Acts in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the existing level of prison accommodation is grossly inadequate to meet current demands and that this has been the case for some years now.  Furthermore, it is clear to this Government, considering the established trends in the numbers of committals to prison, on conviction and on remand, that the prison capacity increase that was being provided for by the previous Government was inadequate to fully cater for future demands.</P>
      <P>Considering the gross overcrowding of prison accommodation, the totally unacceptable high levels of temporary releases existing and the infamous &ldquo;revolving door syndrome&rdquo; which seems to have become an accepted part of the operation of our prisons over recent years, it is self-evident that urgent drastic action is called for to prevent the total breakdown of the prison system.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind, on top of that, the ever increasing numbers of custodial sentences being imposed for serious crimes and the likely impact on the remand prisoner population arising from amendment of the bail laws, this Government had no hesitation in placing its commitment to provide 2,000 additional prison places, including 1,000 places and a new remand prison within the first two years, among its key priorities in the programme for fighting crime.  I am pleased to confirm that my Department's prison building programme is on target to deliver in excess of the 1,000 additional places promised by mid-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding research in the area, my Department monitors relevant research and related developments in the penological area.  Trends in the rates of imprisonment both here and in other <Col N="1348" /> jurisdictions are studied.  I can inform the Deputy that the recent experience, in this jurisdiction, of increases in the numbers of both males and females being committed to custody reflects similar trends in the UK and elsewhere throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that the planned increase in prison accommodation is fully justified and, indeed, essential for the orderly and safe operation of the prison system, as we enter the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I am equally convinced of the need to maximise the use of custody alternatives and have signalled my views, more than once, on the case for a balanced justice system.  This does not, however, dispose of the basic reality that, for the reasons I have mentioned, we now need a significant increase in prison capacity.  The need has been apparent for years and now it is being tackled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> The Government is equally committed to keeping legislation covering offences against the State under constant review and to amending it in the light of changing circumstances as necessary.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the Provisional IRA ceasefire of August 1994 in July this year, the continuing cessations by loyalist groups which were previously part of the Combined Loyalist Military Command, and developments more generally in the current peace process, create an opportunity to review the provisions of certain legislation in this jurisdiction.  Accordingly, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government shortly with a view to initiating a wide-ranging review of legislation in the area of offences against the State, including, in particular, the issue of internment.</P>

    <P>The cost of placing an individual on a community service order, which is a direct alternative to imprisonment, is £37 per week or £1,927 per annum.  In the case of probation type orders, which includes probation orders and supervision during deferment of sentence, it is much more difficult to estimate a cost per case as the period of supervision varies.  In addition, probation-type orders are more labour intensive than community service orders and involve the provision of pre-sentence reports and ongoing supervision.  The probation and welfare service deals with the number of cases referred to above within a total annual budget of approximately £12.5 million. This figure includes funding for staff salaries, incidental costs, assistance to voluntary organisations and the costs of running the communty service order scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 43, 80, 91, 95, 112 and 402 together.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make statements to the House about the progress of individual Garda investigations except in instances where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>All I propose to say in this case is that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a person has been charged, on the directions of the DPP, with the murder of one of the two persons referred to by the Deputies.  Arising from information which arose in another context, the Garda Commissioner has appointed a senior officer to review all the circumstances of the case.  This review is ongoing.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, he will give to allow the Law Reform Commission to draft legislation capable of being submitted to Dáil Éireann thus short circuiting the otherwise lengthy legislative process that often seems to accompany proposals emanating from the commission.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the functions of the Law Reform Commission are as contained in the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.  Those functions are to keep the law under review and to formulate proposals for reform.</P>
      <P>The proposals must, under the Act, be submitted to the Taoiseach or to the Attorney General in cases where the Attorney has requested the commission to examine and research a particular area.  The Act does not provide a system under which the commission is required or allowed to produce legislation for direct submission to the Dáil.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Constitution entrusts to this House and the Seanad the power and duty of considering and passing Bills and that every Bill that comes before the House must be initiated in the way that is provided under Standing Orders.  Obviously changes in such arrangements would not be a matter for me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>If the suggestion were to be made that a Minister would sponsor legislation directly produced by the Law Reform Commission then it is difficult to see how in reality this would lead to any savings in time.  When the Law Reform Commission produce proposals for legislative reform these have to be examined in detail by the relevant Minister from the point of view of policy and a Minister will have to consult the Attorney General, his colleagues in Government and often outside interests before finalising proposals.  The key point to note in this regard is that the function of the Law Reform Commission is to advise on proposals for law reform: it is the function of this House to legislate, most commonly on the basis of proposals put before it by the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>There is inevitably a lapse of time between the production of a Law Reform Commission report and the Government being in a position to bring forward legislative proposals.  Aside from the process of examination and consultation which I have already mentioned, the reality is that the Government has to prioritise its legislative proposals and in those circumstances it is not always possible to begin work on Law Reform Commission reports immediately on their publication.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances I am not convinced that changes from the present practice along the lines that would seem to be suggested in the question are feasible or would prove beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken this question in the context of being the Minister who has responsibility for dealing with many of the reports submitted by the commission.  However, the Law Reform Commission operates under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. <Col N="1353" /></P>

      <P>I am not aware of any unusual circumstances as indicated by the Deputy and my Department has not introduced any new measures in relation to EU/EEA nationals resident in the State.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in the course of their duties in connection with applications for residence permits by EU/EEA nationals, it is often necessary to confirm certain routine facts to enable a permit to issue.  Such routine inquiries have been made for many years and, having regard to their purpose, I do not think they could be regarded as intrusive.</P>

      <P>I have examined the report prepared by the National Women's Council of Ireland, entitled &ldquo;Who Makes the Decisions in 1997?&rdquo; which was recently launched by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>My Department monitors the position of women on State boards on an ongoing basis.  At end September 1997, according to the analysis done in my Department, women constituted almost 28 per cent of total membership of State boards and 35 per cent on ministerial/ governmental nominees.  Women comprised 18.2 per cent of chairs of such boards.  These figures are very similar to the findings of the National Women's Council of Ireland's report, which covers the situation at June to September, 1997.</P>
      <P>I intend to continue the policy objective of gender balance of State boards, with a minimum target of 40 per cent of women and men in direct appointments.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to inform the House that the person in question was re-arrested by the Garda Síochána and charged before the Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 28 October 1997. On that date he was remanded in custody to 18 November 1997 when he was further remanded to 2 December 1997.  The person in question applied to the High Court for bail and was granted bail by that court on 24 November 1997. He was released on bail on 25 November.</P>
      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that the person concerned appeared before the District Court today and was remanded on continuing bail until 27 January 1998.</P>
      <P>I have previously informed the House that the circumstances which led to the person's original release on bail were investigated by the President of the District Court who satisfied himself that the issue of an incorrect warrant arose because of a clerical error in the District Court.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Dáil questions on this matter on 21 October 1997 I also informed the House that the President of the District Court, in conjunction with the Chief Clerk of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, had made changes in the arrangements regarding the issuing of warrants.  In recent discussions which I have had with the President of the District Court he indicated that he is satisfied with these arrangements.</P>

      <P>I would refer Deputies to my reply to Question No. 23 today.  In addition to the material contained in that reply, I would add that it is not possible for me to put a cost on the provision of services to asylum seekers.  In addition to adminstration costs borne by my Department, costs for services provided to asylum seekers and refugees would be borne by a number of Departments &mdash; Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Health and Children, and Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The abridged Book of Estimates contains a figure of £625,000 as being the revised figure for the administration of the asylum process in my Department for 1997.  Included in the Estimates for my Department for 1998 is a sum of £4.168 million for the administration of the asylum process.</P>

      <P>In general under our legal system, the law provides for maximum penalties for criminal offences, leaving it to the discretion of the judge to decide on the appropriate penalty in the light of the evidence presented in a particular case. Mandatory penalties are an exception to this. There are mandatory sentences in the case of murder and treason and the Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice Bill which was recently published proposes minimum mandatory sentences in the case of serious drug trafficking offences.</P>
      <P>As an aid to consistency in sentencing the Criminal Justice Act, 1993 gives power to the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against what appears to the Director to be unduly lenient sentences.</P>
      <P>There is statutory provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of their jurisdiction and while there is no similar provision in the case of judges of the other courts it is understood that they hold similar meetings.  I might also mention in this context the establishment by the Chief Justice last year of the Judicial Studies Institute which is funded by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I might add that last year the Law Reform Commission produced a report on sentencing. This is being considered in my Department and any proposals which may emerge from this examination will be announced in the usual way. <Col N="1359" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the traditional approach of the Oireachtas in relation to sentencing matters has been to establish maximum penalties which apply to particular offences leaving it for a court to decide in the light of all the circumstances of a particular case to impose the penalty which it believes appropriate, subject to the maximum penalty set down in legislation.</P>
      <P>There are, however, exceptions to this.  Legislation currently lays down mandatory custodial sentences in respect of the crimes of murder and treason where there is a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment.  In the case of treason and murders that previously would have been capital murders, section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990 obliges a court in passing sentence to specify imprisonment for a period of 40 years as the minimum period to be served.  A minimum of 20 years is set down for attempted murders to which that section applies.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I have made it known that I favour the introduction of a mandatory minimum sentence in particular drugs cases.  I believe that the unique circumstances surrounding the drugs menace warrant this approach.  In this regard, the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, which I published recently, proposes that minimum ten year sentences will apply in the case of serious drug trafficking offences.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce mandatory sentences for other crimes.</P>

      <P>I am committed to ensuring that the Garda Síochána has the necessary personnel and resources to enable it to meet the demands placed on it.  In particular I believe that we should increase the size of the force and to this end the Programme for Government includes a commitment to increase Garda numbers to bring the total strength of the force to 12,000.  Gardaí cannot be recruited and trained overnight but I expect to achieve this goal <Col N="1360" /> within the lifetime of the present Government.  A competition was launched in June this year to provide for the recruitment of trainee gardaí and the intake from this competition will be accelerated to enable the implementation of the current Government's policy.</P>
      <P>The actual allocation of personnel and resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I am guided by his operational knowledge and expertise in such matters.  The Garda authorities have informed me that the current overall strength of the Garda Síochána as on 31 October 1997 was 10,840 with a rank breakdown as follows:</P>

    <P>With regard to Garda vehicles, the Garda authorities inform me that there are 1,760 vehicles in the operational fleet and these include cars, mini buses, 4×4 vehicles, recovery vehicles and lorries, small and large vans and motorcycles.  In 1990 there were less than 1,300 vehicles in the Garda fleet.  Not only has the fleet expanded in size but it now also includes a greater range of specialised vehicles.  The gardaí in recent times identified a requirement for specialised high powered vehicles, jeeps, to provide them with a rapid response facility in their anti-crime operations and in high visibility management and enforcement. Thirty extra four wheel drive vehicles will have been acquired by the end of the year.  The Garda fleet was augmented during 1997 with the purchase of two aircraft, one fixed-wing aircraft and one helicopter, which became operational on 9 September 1997.</P>
    <P>Requests for further vehicles, both on the ground and in the air, are considered in the light of present and changing trends in the Garda response to both crime detection and crime prevention and of course in the light of budget constraints.</P>
    <P>I have to ensure that not only are the necessary resources available but that also the mechanisms are in place to ensure that they are used in the most efficient and cost effective manner.  Implementation of the recommendations, recently approved by Government, of the SMI steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána should facilitate this.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána has adequate resources at the moment to meet the varied responses required of them by the various groups mentioned by the Deputy.  I am confident that Garda management will continuously monitor the deployment of personnel and resources to ensure that their effectiveness is optimised. <Col N="1361" /></P>

The names of the persons to be appointed to the steering group will be announced shortly.</P>
      <P>One of the tasks of the steering group will be to oversee the &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; review of the force.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 105, 404, 406 and 412 together.  My predecessor sought a report from the gardaí on the operation of the relevant sections of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act in the context of renewing those provisions under section 11 of the Act.  No report was sought from the courts on the matter but I understand that it would be unusual to have sought the comments of the Judiciary on the operation of legislation in such a context.</P>
      <P>The report received from the Garda authorities was confined to setting out statistics in relation to the operation of the relevant sections and indicating that the legislation had proved beneficial to the Garda Síochána in the investigation of drug trafficking offences.  A report based on this was laid before the Dáil and Seanad by my predecessor on 25 June 1997.  On 7 July I laid before both Houses a second report which was based on the report laid by my predecessor with updated statistics in relation to the operation of the relevant sections &mdash; the updating was necessary because of the time-limits contained in section 11 in relation to the period to be covered by the report.</P>
      <P>Subsequently my Department notified the Garda authorities by letter of the passing of the resolutions by both Houses continuing in force the sections in question.  The question of seeking further observations from the gardaí at that stage obviously would not arise in the circumstances which I have outlined.</P>
      <P>I met yesterday with the President of the District Court and the Garda Commissioner to discuss matters arising in connection with the nomination of judges under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two forms of therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the prison system at present. Both are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measures of control over their offending behaviour.  The first is individual counselling from my Department's clinical psychology service and from the probation and welfare service.  This form of therapeutic intervention is available in all prisons, with the exception of the Curragh where it will be available shortly.  The second is an intensive offence focused group work programme which is available only in Arbour Hill Prison at the moment.</P>
      <P>The dedicated treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to eleven months to complete. The emphasis is on accepting personal responsibility for the offence and developing effective relapse prevention strategies for each offender.  All convicted sex offenders who are in custody are invited to apply to participate in the programme.  Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are deemed suitable. Where more than ten offenders who have applied are deemed suitable, the places on the programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence.  The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme.  It is important to note that both forms of treatment are voluntary, offenders are encouraged to avail of these services but they are neither compelled to attend, nor do they receive any extra concessions for attending.</P>
      <P>I am keen to expand treatment programmes for sex offenders and my Department is actively examining the possibility of increasing the number of group treatment places available by locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh.  However, in view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme, it will take some time to put a new programme in place.</P>
      <P>A new therapeutic programme for offenders will be introduced in Cork Prison as well as in Arbour Hill early in 1998.  The thinking skills training programme for offenders is designed to target a range of offenders.  Sex offenders will be invited to participate.  The programme will be run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers.  Such structured interpersonal work with offenders represents a significant development of the role of the prison officer and a new and challenging development within the Irish prison service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 389 together.</P>
      <P>My Department communicates with the Garda authorities on the enactment of relevant legislation in the area for which I have responsibility. Such communications would generally follow consultation with the Garda on the preparation of the legislation in question and its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In relation to changes in the manner of notifying reforms of the criminal law to bodies who operate under the legislation, I refer to the statement which I made in the House on 25 November. In that statement I acknowledged that there was substance to the point that the level of criminal law reform has been such that it is difficult for people who have to operate it to keep fully abreast of all developments.</P>
      <P>Once legislation is enacted it is a matter for the courts to interpret it and for that reason there has been a reluctance on the part of my Department to take any action in relation to explaining the effects of that legislation.  There is undoubtedly a difficulty in that regard.  If an attempt were made by my Department, or indeed any other Department, to interpret the law for the Judiciary, it would rightly be condemned, but I have instructed my Department to examine what usefully might be done in this regard.  That examination is now under way and will involve consultation with the Judiciary, branches of the legal profession and the Garda Commissioner.</P>

I should emphasise that applications for permission to reside or to remain in the State are considered on an individual basis, unrelated to the nationality of the individual, having regard to the reasons advanced for seeking such permission. Where it has been decided to refuse permission to remain, a person is notified in writing of that decision.  That person is given the opportunity to leave the State voluntarily or to make submissions as to why he or she should not be required to leave the State.</P>
      <P>Any submission received is considered and the question of deportation only arises if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, deems it conducive to the public good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The joint report by British-Irish Rights Watch and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties requests the Government to establish a <Col N="1370" /> judicial inquiry to investigate alleged ill-treatment of persons who were arrested in connection with Garda inquiries into the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe in Limerick on 7 June, 1996.</P>
      <P>I would not be prepared to tolerate, under any circumstances, any abuse of persons in custody, nor would I be prepared to stand over any breaches of the relevant regulations in this area, which were put in place to protect such persons.</P>
      <P>Having considered this matter very carefully, I have concluded that it would not be appropriate for me to take any action on the allegations of ill-treatment in the report until such stage as the courts have fully disposed of cases whcih are before them arising out of the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  These include criminal charges brought against persons who allege they were ill-treated while in Garda custody.  It may be expected that in cases of this nature the issue of the voluntariness and legality of statements made by accused persons will arise for judicial decision during the course of their trials.</P>
      <P>However, I reject totally the suggestions in the report that the Government of the day was implicated in some way in the alleged ill-treatment of the persons involved, and the assertions in the report that the Garda Complaints Board is unsuitable to deal with complaints from them.</P>
      <P>I shall be replying in these terms shortly to the two organisations in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Garda has the necessary resources to mount a successful campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that drink-driving and speeding are two of the key offences targeted by &ldquo;Operation Lifesaver&rdquo; which was brought into operation in the Louth-Meath division last July and subsequently extended to all Garda divisions. I am informed that &ldquo;Operation Lifesaver&rdquo; will place greater emphasis on drink-driving and speeding detections during the Christmas period. In addition, the annual Christmas drink-driving campaign which was launched by the National Safety Council on 21 November, 1997 has the full backing of the Garda authorities.  All of these measures will ensure that approximately 40,000 checkpoints will be mounted countrywide over the Christmas period.  In addition to the traffic corps, which operates throughout the country, <Col N="1371" /> members in uniform will also be involved in increased enforcement during the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have a range of the most up to date equipment for the detection of speeding offences and traffic control generally.  This includes GATSO, a sophisticated mobile radar, video, computer system capable of multiple detections, tripod mounted lasers, laser guns, in car videos and other specialist vehicles.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the recently appointed deputy state pathologist will be based in Dublin.  This is a condition of the appointment as advertised.</P>
      <P>I understand that this decision was made in view of the fact that in excess of 50 per cent of suspicious deaths occur in the eastern part of the country and therefore, the basing of the state pathologist or the deputy elsewhere could not be justified.  There was also the consideration that there are pathologists available locally in other areas of the country in the event of the state pathologists not being available.</P>
      <P>In addition, expensive laboratory facilities are being provided in Beaumont Hospital for the state pathology service.  The duplication of such facilities outside Dublin would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person concerned was released from prison in the UK in January 1996 and that he returned to Ireland in April of that year.  Following consultations by the Garda authorities with the State's legal advisers as to the person's legal status on release from prison in the <Col N="1372" /> UK, the Garda was advised that the warrant of the Special Criminal Court imposing a sentence of penal servitude for life on him in June 1974, should be executed.  The person concerned was duly arrested by gardaí in March 1997 and subsequently lodged in Portlaoise Prison from where he had escaped with others in August 1974.</P>
      <P>The average length of sentence served by offenders serving life sentences in recent years is approximately 12 years.

      <Quest>if he will restore pension parity to certain retired members of An Garda Síochána whose pensions calculation omits certain allowances which are taken into account in calculating the pensions of gardaí who currently retire in view of his reaffirmation of parity between public service pensions and current rates of public service pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19645/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recently decided that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP) and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> (PCW) should benefit from these pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum of 3 per cent in their pension, or 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who had already received an advance payment of 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the case of the garda sergeant and inspector ranks in the Garda Síochána, an agreement was reached in March 1994 under the restructuring clause of the PESP which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for the garda, sergeant and inspector ranks and for an increase in the designated post allowance. The agreement did not provide for the benefit of the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances or of the increase in the designated post allowance being extended to Garda pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>Because of these provisions of the agreement, which did not provide for a special pay increase, pensioners who retired prior to 1 January, 1993 are not entitled in the normal way to any increase on a purely parity basis.  Their pensions are therefore subject to the minimum adjustment of 3 per cent which is calculated as if the pay scales in question had attracted a special pay increase of 3 per cent with effect from 1 September 1995.  The implementation of these increases for Garda pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993 is currently in train.</P>
      <P>In relation to superintendents and chief superintendents, restructuring deals under the PCW are being finalised at present.  Pensioners from those ranks who retired before the commencement dates of the deals will also benefit on a parity basis subject to a minimum increase in their pensions of 3 per cent or 2 per cent as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Government decision in relation to parity arising out of the restructuring deals under the PESP and PCW pay agreements does not have any bearing on the pensionability of certain Garda allowances in 1982 which arose out of a finding by the arbitrator that a number of Garda allowances, which had previously been non pensionable, should become reckonable for pension purposes with effect from 1 October, 1982.  This recommendation was accepted by the Minister for the Public Service and by the Minister for Justice. Garda pensioners who retired before that date did not benefit from the changes recommended by the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the Garda pension scheme generally, the Deputy may be aware that in February 1996 a commission on public service pensions was <Col N="1374" /> established to examine and report on the pension terms of public servants, including members of the Garda Síochána.  The commission issued its interim report earlier this year and will issue its final report to Government in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 393 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach met a delegation from Disability Federation of Ireland (DFI) on 15 October.  DFI is the national umbrella body for a number of organisations which provide a comprehensive range of services to people with disabilities. The Taoiseach was accompanied by Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at my Department, with special responsibility for equality and disabilities.</P>
      <P>A wide-ranging discussion took place on matters of concern to DFI and on issues affecting people with disabilities in general.  The Government's commitment to people with disabilities and the initiatives taken by the Government since taking office were outlined by Minister of State Wallace.  I note from the DFI statement in its November newsletter that it has been encouraged by its meeting with the Taoiseach and with other Ministers.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental task force, established to draft a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on the commission's report, is continuing with its work and it is my intention to submit an interim plan to Government as soon as possible.  Tenders were sought from a number of economic consultants to cost the commission's recommendations so that a comprehensive, cohesive and cost-effective plan can be drawn up.  Tenders have now been received and are being examined in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The monitoring committee, established to oversee implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, had its first meeting on 25 July this year and it has held four meetings to date.  A sub-group has been set up to consider devising appropriate mechanisms to monitor implementation of the commission's report.  A second sub-group has been established to advise on topics for inclusion in the proposed disability awareness campaign which will take place from 8 to 12 December, <Col N="1375" /> 1997.  A series of regional events will be held during the week aimed at raising public awareness of disability and a video on awareness will also be produced.</P>
    <P>On 18 November, 1997, the Government's decision to establish a national disability authority was announced.  An establishment group, chaired by an Assistant Secretary from my Department, is being set up tasked with the preparation, <i>inter alia</i>, of detailed proposals for the establishment of the national disability authority for submission to Government within six months.</P>
    <P>The establishment group will also examine the question of a disability support service and the transfer of certain responsibilities in relation to the training and employment of people with disabilities from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The establishment group will be comprised of representatives of the Department of Health and Children; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance and will include two members nominated by me.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the first meeting of the establishment group will be convened prior to Christmas.</P>
    <P>I am currently in the process of establishing a disability equality unit within my Department. The commission's report called for the establishment of such a unit to provide a focal point for disability equality policy and legislative development; to operate an interdepartmental co-ordinating mechanism; to monitor the implementation of Government decisions in relation to disability policy and to monitor the achievement of the quota for the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector.  I believe that a dedicated disability equality unit is essential to promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Further funding from my Department of £100,000 in 1997 has been announced for the Irish Council of People with Disabilities, for use, <i>inter alia</i> in securing new accommodation suitable to its needs.  The Government is fully committed to the work of the council which had already been allocated £300,000 by my Department in 1997.  Its allocation for 1998, announced in my Department's Estimates, is £700,000, more than double the original 1997 allocation to the council.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, the Government has been seeking to develop cross-departmental working mechanisms to facilitate the effective delivery of services, to minimise bureaucracy and to promote equality for people with disabilities.  As a result of this commitment to cross-departmental working, it has been possible to deliver the package of measures aimed at people with disabilities which was announced recently by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in conjunction with my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> A package of funding of £4,325,000 was announced which is expected to directly benefit eleven thousand people with disabilities, and voluntary agencies.  This funding will enhance the opportunities for people with disabilities to achieve independent living and community integration.</P>
    <P>A sum of £50,000 from this allocation was given to the Irish Council for People with Disabilities for computer equipment for their 30 county networks. The equipment will substantially improve communications between the national office and the local networks.</P>
    <P>On 1 October 1997, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government introduced new regulations which make it an offence for a vehicle to be parked in a parking bay for a person with a disability on a public road or in a public car park, unless a parking permit for a person with a disability is displayed in the vehicle.  Henceforth, abuse of these parking spaces will constitute a parking offence punishable by an on-the-spot fine.</P>
    <P>On 5 November, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, announced Government approval for up to £5 million in grant assistance towards the cost of a bid to host the Special Olympic summer games in Ireland in 2003.  Hosting the Special Olympics would provide an exceptional opportunity to promote awareness of disability. The outcome of the bid is expected to be announced next summer.</P>
    <P>A number of pilot community services projects aimed at people with disabilities have been established by my Department.  Projects are being undertaken in Ennis, Cork City, Tallaght-Clondalkin and Cahirciveen and my Department has made funding available for the recruitment of project workers and to meet associated costs. These projects will ensure access at local level by people with disabilities to all information in appropriate formats on issues affecting their lives and will facilitate the involvement of people with disabilities in area partnerships and other community fora.</P>
    <P>Project workers have already been appointed in Cork and in Tallaght-Clondalkin.  The project worker post in respect of the pilot project in Cahirciveen has been advertised and it is anticipated that it will be filled shortly.  The project in Clare received funding of £25,000 last month.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the Government remains firmly committed to ensuring that the needs of people with disabilities, their parents and carers are comprehensively addressed and that I, and Minister of State Wallace, are determined to continue to progress this issue vigorously.</P>

      <P>The criteria used to assess an entry visa would depend on the purpose for which the visa is sought.  A work permit is required where a person who is not a national of a European economic area state, or a dependant of such a national, seeks to come to the State to engage in employment.  The issue of a work permit is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who would be in a position to determine the skills requirement in the catering trade.  Clearly, possession of a work permit has an important bearing on the outcome of a visa application, although possession of a work permit in itself does not guarantee the issue of a visa.  The religion of an applicant has no direct bearing on the issue of a visa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 98, 383 and 388 together.</P>
      <P>The lasting effects of any Government's crime policies on the level of criminal activity within society has to be assessed over the long term rather than the short term.  In the short term, the signs are promising, as evidenced by the continued overall drop in the number of reported offences, which are down by some 10 per cent since January last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> The thrust of the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime has three components.  Firstly, a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime.  Secondly, a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime.  Thirdly, a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>There have been comments which have tended to take from the real meaning of zero tolerance. It has been suggested for example that it might mean sanction of imprisonment for minor offences taking no account of the seriousness or degree of culpability involved in the offence. There have also been suggestions that it would involve the Garda receiving some sort of direction from the Government on how to enforce the law.  Needless to say, these comments are misleading and there is no question of this Government interfering with the fundamental process of law.</P>
    <P>As regards the targeting of those engaged in criminal activity, I have already announced a series of measures involving practical initiatives and legislative changes.  The practical measures include increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000 and resourcing of crime-fighting initiatives in the Garda Síochána, as well as the provision of additional prison spaces.  I have already introduced the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997 and further legislation will follow if required.  I am satisfied that this major criminal law reform measure to clear practical evidence of the Government's policy of zero tolerance towards crime &mdash; particularly, but not exclusively, drug trafficking.  The Bill contains a series of very strong measures which are, regrettably, all too necessary as a response to those who inflict such harm on our community.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures taken together will be successful in dealing with all types of criminal activity.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware of experience in other countries with different approaches to zero tolerance, and lessons will be drawn from these experiences taking due account of differences in legal systems, policing ethos and cultural values.</P>
    <P>In relation to current crime levels, in general, statistics for 1997 have not yet been published but provisional figures, for the first ten months of 1997, indicate that there has been a significant decrease in crime when compared to the corresponding period last year.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on violence against women has only recently been assigned to my Department.  Work has commenced on putting the necessary structures in place.  A national steering committee is currently being established and will comprise representatives from the relevant Departments &mdash; Education and Science, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; and also representatives from the relevant State agencies and non-governmental organisations working in this area.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware each aspect of the justice system operates within a statutory framework which outlines the key functions and responsibilities of the relevant agencies and, where appropriate, individuals. Apart from piecemeal legislative development, this framework has survived relatively unchanged since the foundation of the State.  In the context of implementing the strategic management initiative my Department is currently undergoing a major programme of organisational change.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of this change programme is to bring about a modern integrated system with each key agency in the justice system clear about its own role and its relationship and linkage with other agencies in the system.  This involves reform of the institutional framework of the entire justice system, including the core Department's role, structure and management systems.</P>
      <P>Key aspects of the change programme involve the establishment of independent agencies to manage the day to day operations of the courts and prisons.  Both projects are now well advanced.  The first stage of a fundamental review of the Garda Síochána was published on 26 November. As I announced on that occasion, the Government is fully committed to implementation of the Garda SMI review and I will shortly announce the detailed arrangements to underpin the implementation programme.  The role of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will change as it devolves its line functions.  Its future role will be more strongly policy oriented, with greater emphasis in areas such as policy research and evaluation of performance by each agency in the justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key objective of this organisation change programme is to clarify authority, responsibility and accountability in relation to each aspect of the justice system.  In the cases of the courts service and prisons authority, the respective statutes will outline the accountability structure.  The position <Col N="1382" /> in regard to Garda legislation will be reviewed in the light of accountability changes which emerge in the implementation phase of the SMI review.  In all cases, a key principle will be the devolution of authority, responsibility and accountability to the lowest appropriate level possible.  Accountability to the Oireachtas for the performance of the various agencies will continue to be through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Within the context of this unprecedented organisational change a number of concrete developments have already taken place: in the case of the courts, the Courts Service Bill has been published and will be debated in Seanad Éireann in the next few weeks.  I anticipate that this historic legislation will be enacted early in the new year, opening the way to the establishment of the new courts service.  In the case of the prisons, acting on the report of the expert group published earlier in the year, I have recently obtained the approval of the Government to proceed with the appointment of an interim board to drive forward the intensive preparations required to effect an early transition to the prisons authority, once the necessary legislation has been enacted.  I expect to bring proposals for legislation to establish the prisons authority to Government in January/February, 1998.  In the case of the probation and welfare service I have recently announced the commencement of a major review of the service by an expert group, as to its future role, needs and appropriate management structure. The report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána was published last week.  A major investment programme in computerised management systems in the Garda, prisons, courts, probation and welfare service and other agencies is now under way.</P>
    <P>Given the scale and depth of the organisation change programme outlined above, it will clearly take a number of years to see it through to conclusion. I am satisfied that change of this order is necessary and I am absolutely committed to bringing the process forward as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>Figures issued by the CSO in September of this year indicate that the pay differential between the earnings of male and female industrial workers in the manufacturing sector in this country is decreasing.  In 1971 women's hourly pay was 56 per cent that of men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> By 1996 it was 74 per cent that of men.  This rate of progress highlights a still unacceptable differential between the earnings of men and women in manufacturing.  It should be borne in mind, however, that focusing on the manufacturing sector fails to illustrate the broader labour market experience particularly in the services sector where most women workers are employed and where there is evidence that the situation with regard to the male/female pay differential is markedly better.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the ESRI published a report which was commissioned by the former Department of Equality and Law Reform and the Employment Equality Agency, on the question of the male/female wage differential.  That study showed a 20 per cent differential between the earnings of men and women.  The study concluded that approximately half of this differential could be related to the shorter length of experience of women in employment.</P>
    <P>Under the Partnership 2000 Agreement, my Department has agreed to commission an updated study of pay differentials.  It is intended to consult with ICTU, IBEC and the relevant Government Departments to agree appropriate terms of reference for the new study.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Bill, 1997 which was published yesterday, provides for equal pay for work of equal value as between men and women in employment and represents an advance on existing legislation.  Under section 19 of the Bill, a person may use as a comparator another person who is employed by the employer, or by an associated employer, at any time within three years preceding or following the alleged discrimination. In addition, indirect pay discrimination has been codified and the requirement that the pay comparator should be employed in the same place as the person alleging discrimination has been removed.  These advances contribute in some measure to the further narrowing of the pay differential between men and women.</P>

      <P>I have not received any proposals to close Garda stations in the Dublin area at night and I have no such plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the life of the previous Government an Inter-Departmental Group on Garda deployment <Col N="1384" /> was established involving the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.  That inter-departmental group addressed a number of issues including the question of rationalisation of station opening hours. However the work of that group was in effect overtaken by the SMI process.</P>
    <P>The report of the SMI steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána published last week recommends, <i>inter alia</i>, a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo;review of the force to determine the optimum resources required for effective and efficient policing of the State.  The report envisages the operational element of this review focusing on the achievement of an optimum match between the availability of gardaí and the demand for policing services and on structures which achieve this objective efficiently and effectively. It recommends that this &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; review should develop detailed proposals in relation to particular issues with resource implications, including the demand for policing services throughout the country and the opening hours of stations.  The steering group further stated that the recommendations of the inter-departmental group on Garda deployment, whose work it subsumed into its own, in relation to stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Area should be used to arrive at early conclusions, <i>inter alia</i>, on the optimum number of stations required for 24-hour service and the appropriate opening hours of remaining stations.</P>
    <P>In line with its recommendations concerning control and accountability, the respective responsibilities of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and the future preparation of long-term strategic and annual policing plans, the steering group was clearly of the view that any proposals concerning alteration of the opening hours of Garda stations should be included in the Commissioner's annual policing plan submitted to the Minister.</P>

Similar precautions are taken when refurbishment and upgrading works are undertaken in the existing prisons.  I might add that the new remand prison will have a significant number of cells designed for multiple occupancy.  It is generally accepted that such occupancy helps prevent prisoners committing suicide or otherwise harming <Col N="1386" /> themselves at the early stage of their incarceration.</P>
    <P>A number of prisoners who have died in our prisons over the years were being held on remand.  Every death in custody &mdash; be it of a remand or sentenced person &mdash; is a tragedy.  An elaborate strategy is in place for the prevention of suicides in prisons but unless there is to be a total denial of all personal privacy to all prisoners at all times the possibility of suicides in custody cannot be precluded no more than it can be precluded in the wider community.</P>
    <P>Fifty-two of the 57 suicide prevention recommendations contained in the report of the advisory group on prison deaths (published in August 1991) have been implemented or are in the course of implementation.</P>
    <P>A national steering committee on suicide awareness was also set up last year.  This committee has met on a number of occasions to date and is reviewing the ongoing relevance of the 1991 recommendations.  I will be only too happy to consider any proposals for improvement recommended by the steering committee.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union provides appropriate structures for member states to inform and consult one another, within the Council, in areas regarded as matters of common interest, such as immigration policy and policy regarding nationals of third countries. Such exchanges take place on a regular basis and it is not proposed to raise any specific issues in this area at the forthcoming European Council. In addition, agreements between the European Community and the applicant countries provide for free trade primarily, but also include economic and technical co-operation, financial assistance and a political dialogue which allows for exchanges with regard to such matters as illegal immigration and asylum.</P>

      <P>The national centre for partnership was established this year, in accordance with Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the centre is to foster, directly and indirectly, partnership arrangements, between employers, employees and unions in the workplace with a view to securing the competitiveness, <Col N="1388" /> viability and prosperity of enterprises and the modernisation of public services.</P>
    <P>The centre is managed by a board and has two full-time executives, Mr. John O'Dowd, former General Secretary, CPSU and Mr. Gerry Grogan, former President, IBEC.  The work programme for the centre is based on the following priority issues: promotion of involvement and partnership; monitoring developments; technical assistance and support to organisations involved in developing involvement and partnership arrangements; dissemination of best practices; and training for management, union, employer and workplace representatives.</P>
    <P>Work to date has focused mainly on ascertaining the existing level of partnership in the workplace through countrywide meetings with employers, employees and unions.</P>
    <P>In addition to the board, a liaison group, chaired by my Department, has been established with representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Irish Productivity Centre, the Labour Relations Commission, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance. The role of the liaison group will be to act as a communications forum and as a resource for the acquisition and dissemination of information and expertise on partnership and on training to support partnership.</P>
    <P>The work of the centre is formally linked to the wider monitoring mechanism on Parnership 2000 by way of an annual presentation by IBEC and ICTU to the quarterly plenary meetings.  The first such presentation is scheduled for the next quarterly meeting which takes place on 28 January.</P>

      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 was made under the Restrictive Practices Acts to regulate competition in the groceries sector.  The order bans the selling, or advertising for sale, of grocery goods below cost with the exception of certain specified goods such as perishable foodstuffs.  It also prohibits such practices as &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, boycotting and sets out provisions for controls on terms and conditions of supply.  The order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs. The Groceries Order was last reviewed in February 1995, after which the then Minister announced his intention to retain the order for a further two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> The order is, among other matters, currently being reviewed by the competition and mergers review group established in September 1996.</P>

      <P>Report No. 6 of the FÁS-ESRI manpower forecasting studies deals with occupational manpower forecasts to the year 2003.  This is the third such report which presents forecasts of employment for broadly defined occupational groups.</P>
      <P>The FÁS/ESRI report does not address the supply side of the labour market, nor does it attempt to examine the demand-supply gap or skill shortages.</P>
      <P>The principal objective of the occupational manpower forecasting project is to develop a system which can be used to provide information on the changing patterns of occupation and to identify possible variations in skill requirements across broad occupational areas of the economy. This information is of value in determining medium-term manpower and education strategies as well as in planning training provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenge for the Government and the social partners is to ensure that over the next few years the Irish labour force gains the maximum possible benefit from the expansion of employment predicted in this report.  On the basis of the expected pattern of change, the very large increases anticipated for the professions, especially in the technical area, and other categories would point to the need for adaptations and adjustments to education and training provision in this sphere.  In this regard, the Government recently announced the creation of a £250 million education technology investment fund, with an initial £100 million to be invested in 1998. One of the key aims of this initiative is to develop new areas of activities in our institutions, especially where emerging skills needs have <Col N="1390" /> already been identified.  This underlines the Government's recognition of the key role of high quality graduates and technicians for economic development.</P>
    <P>Coinciding with that announcement I also announced the establishment of a new business, education and training partnership to develop national strategies at the highest level to tackle the issue of skills needs, manpower forecasting and education for industry and business.</P>
    <P>In relation to other areas where expansion is forecast, I wish to point out that the Government, in its Action Programme for the New Millennium, is committed to supporting industry in order (1) to create more jobs and (2) to protect existing jobs through training and improved company competitiveness.  The programme recognises the important link between training and competitiveness. The proposals in the White Paper on human resources development complement these objectives and create an agenda which will substantially contribute towards meeting ongoing skills needs.  I am considering at present how best to implement the main proposals of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures recently agreed by the Government, together with the ongoing programmes being undertaken by FÁS and the Department of Education, will ensure that skills shortages are minimised and that the Irish labour force will obtain the full benefit of the employment expansion anticipated in recent employment forecasts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 126 and 127 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of all petrol retail outlets is covered by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations, 1979 (S.  I. 311 of 1979) as amended by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) <Col N="1391" /> (Amendment) Regulations, 1988 (S.  I. No. 303 of 1988).</P>
    <P>The 1979 regulations laid down national licensing requirements for retail and private petroleum stores.  These regulations were developed to address the dangers which exist in relation to the operation of such stores.  The sole purpose of the regulations was, and is, the effective control of the licensing of retail petroleum stores in order to prevent the risk of injury to persons or property, in storage, conveying, loading, unloading and dispensing operations carried on in connection with such stores.</P>
    <P>Due to the fact that a considerable number of petrol retailing stations did not meet the necessary safety standards in respect of space, storage of petroleum and access for vehicles, the 1988 regulations provided an exemption until 31 December 1999, from a number of the 1979 regulations. The position regarding the implementation of the regulations is under review at present.</P>
    <P>In practice it is, in the first instance, the relevant local authority or harbour authority to which an application for a licence is made and it is the relevant local authority or harbour authority which decides on the granting of certain exemptions from the requirements of the above mentioned 1979 regulations.  In this regard I am not therefore in a position to comment on the specific situation in Irishtown, County Mayo as referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>My Department does not operate any grant or subsidy scheme in respect of the adaptation or relocation of premises in order to comply with the regulations.</P>

      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not generally afford any preferential treatment to families or individuals because they hold a medical card.  The sole exception to this is that persons who hold medical cards are exempt from the Employment and Training Levy, payable at 1 per cent of reckonable income in excess of £197 per week and collected through the PRSI system.</P>
      <P>The Department does not have responsibility for any scheme of secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for a medical card is determined on the basis of means and other circumstances by the relevant health board.  People solely dependent on unemployment payments are usually eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> In turn, people who are dependent on unemployment payments for specified amounts of time are eligible for training courses and employment schemes run under the aegis of the Department. While so participating they retain entitlement to a medical card.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 12 animals under the 1994 suckler cow premium scheme and on the same animals under the 1994 cattle headage scheme.  At an inspection on 22 December 1994, ten of the cows applied on were absent and replaced with nine other cows and one in-calf heifer, as allowed under both schemes. The person named was requested to forward sales dockets for the original cows and purchase dockets for replacement animals.  Final documentation was not received by my Department until 5 November 1996.  However, adequate documentation on the sale of two animals applied on under the <Col N="1400" /> 1994 suckler cow scheme was not received and the matter continues to be investigated.</P>
      <P>With regard to the 1994 cattle headage scheme application by the person named, one of the animals applied on as a cow was discovered from the sales docket supplied to be a heifer.  In accordance with condition 19(b) of the terms and conditions of the scheme, the applicant was ruled out of the scheme for 1994 and 1995.  The person named did not apply under the 1996 cattle headage or suckler cow premium schemes or the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme.  He will be paid his entitlement under the 1997 cattle headage scheme within the next week.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on ten beef cows under the 1996 cattle headage scheme and was paid £779.45 on 27 September 1996 which was based on 8.698 hectares of forage area.  Subsequently, the area aid details of the person named were updated, recording 6.69 hectares. This area entitled the person named to £599.55 under the 1996 cattle headage scheme.  Consequently, there was an overpayment of £179.90 which my Department recovered by deducting £109.90 from the 1996 extensification amount and by deducting £70 from the agrimonetary compensation scheme payment on suckler cows due to the person named.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the most recent information available, the person named is recorded as having 8.44 hectares, entitling him to £756.39 under the 1996 cattle headage scheme which would give a true overpayment of £23.06. The person named is now due a refund of £156.84 which will be paid to him within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>Water pollution can arise from many sources, domestic, industrial and agricultural and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has overall responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>Regarding the agricultural aspects, the rural environment protection scheme (REPS) is the main instrument in promoting better nutrient management by farmers which should result in considerable improvements in water quality.  One of its more important measures is the requirement to prepare a waste management, liming and fertilisation plan for the farm.  This measure is designed to protect and improve the quality of our water resources by minimising nutrient losses from agriculture.  Over 30,000 farmers are now participating in the scheme of whom 2,041 are in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A code of good practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates was published jointly in July 1996 by my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  This code prescribes methods to prevent or minimise the pollution of waters from nitrates by adopting certain farm waste and nutrient management techniques in the storage of organic wastes, silage, dungstead and farmyard manure and soiled <Col N="1408" /> water.  Such management has the double benefit of avoiding pollution and maximising the nutrient value of farm waste.</P>
    <P>The national sustainable development strategy published by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government earlier this year sets down a target for a sizeable reduction in phosphate levels over the next five years.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996, provides that local authorities may require landownersfarmers to provide a nutrient management plan setting nurient application rates to prevent water pollution.</P>
    <P>The Government has introduced improved capital allowances for investment in pollution control facilities.</P>
    <P>There is a strong emphasis in REPS on the training and education of participants and it is recommended that all participants attend training courses to help them meet the REPS requirements.</P>
    <P>In general training and advice for farmers is provided by Teagasc.</P>

      <P>The following are the dates and nature of the changes in the operation of REPS since 1 July this year:</P>
      <P>July 1997 &mdash; Revision of REPS plans</P>
      <P>An improved system for checking revisions of REPS plans was introduced which involved the provision of a detailed report from the planner in each case as to why the revision was necessary. September 1997 &mdash; Additional Lands in REPS As a result of an amendment to the detailed rules, new procedures were introduced which enabled farmers to receive payment on additional lands included in REPS subsequent to joining the scheme.</P>
      <P>November 1997</P>
      <P>The issue of commonage land has recently been reviewed.  Applications containing commonage land must have ten acres of privately owned or leased land to qualify the commonage land for payment.</P>
      <P>These changes have the aim of refining and improving the scheme while at the same time responding to audit and control demands.</P>

      <P>The townland of Kilnarovanagh, in the district electoral division of Macloneigh, County Cork, was considered by the disadvantaged areas appeals panel in conjunction with other townlands in the area for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  However, based on the information supplied by those farmers in the area who were surveyed, the stocking density of the townland exceeded the limit of 0.99 livestock units per forage hectare.</P>
      <P>The appeals panel attempted to aggregate the results of Kilnarovanagh with those of other townlands in the DED to see if a group of townlands could be identified which would, together, satisfy the criteria.  However, since all but one of the other townlands also exceeded the stocking density limit, this was not possible, and the panel had no option but to confine its recommendation for this area to the one townland, Tooms East, which satisfied all the criteria.</P>
      <P>Following publication in May 1996 of the new areas designated as disadvantaged, it was announced that any individual or group who wished to get details of the reasons for the non-inclusion of their area should contact my Department, either by telephone or in writing.  The landowners in Kilnarovanagh are welcome to avail of this facility. The contact telephone number is (01) 6072940.</P>

      <P>In the period since 1 January 1997 close to £700 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU livestock and arable aid schemes <Col N="1422" /> of which over £444 million relates to payments made under the 1997 schemes.  To date this year some 1.32 million payments have been made of which 798,037 relate to payments under 1997 schemes and the timing of these payments compares favourably with the position in 1996.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1997 disadvantaged areas headage schemes commenced on 28 September 1997 and to date over £90 million has been paid. Some 79 per cent of cattle headage-beef cow applicants and 83 per cent of sheep headage applicants have now been paid.  Payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October (the earliest possible commencement date under EU regulations) and some £85 million was paid to 94 per cent of applicants within one week of commencement of payments.  The current position is that over £89.5 has been paid to 99 per cent of applicants.  Payments under the 1997 special beef premium and suckler cow premium commenced on 1 November and 3 November respectively.  The EU regulations provide that payment cannot commence until 1 November and that only 60 per cent of entitlement can be paid.  To date over £11.6 million has been paid under these schemes.  Some 83 per cent of special beef premium applicants and 78 per cent of suckler cow applicants have now been paid.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that this year priority was accorded to making payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme in view of the very severe harvest conditions which affected some parts of the country.  It should also be noted that almost 6 per cent of 1997 cattle headage-beef cow and suckler cow cannot be processed for payment at local office level because the applications in question are under query with the farmers concerned.</P>
      <P>Payments are continuing to issue to farmers under all premium and headage schemes.</P>
      <P>While the requirements of the land parcel identification system which is fully operational in 1997 under EU rules have been a complicating factor in processing the various premium and headage applications this year, it is expected that most remaining eligible applicants will be paid in the very near future.</P>

      <Quest>if he will extend section 26 of the Finance Act, 1997 to provide that areas adjacent to marinas such as the Kilrush Creek Marina, County Clare will qualify for tax relief for enterprise areas as in the case of airports and as set out in section 35 of the Finance Act, 1995; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1997, includes a provision for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports as enterprise areas.  The tax reliefs for the enterprise areas are those set out in section 35 of the Finance Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the announcement of these provisions in the Finance Act, the EU Commission raised queries about the State aid aspects of these enterprise areas and I subsequently issued a press release on 23 July 1997 stating that the Commission was raising such queries.  There was a meeting in July in Brussels between officials from my Department and officials from the EU Commission to discuss this matter.  The Commission subsequently sent a representative here on a fact-finding mission which included a visit to a number of proposed enterprise areas and an existing one. Since then, we have supplied the Commission with any supplementary information which it requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing can proceed on the enterprise area front until the EU Commission has reached a decision on the matter.  While I am very hopeful that this matter will be satisfactorily resolved in the very near future, the question of designating any new areas as enterprise areas cannot be considered at present.  I should also point out that the designation of enterprise areas is generally carried out in the context of urban renewal relief and as such is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the first instance. <Col N="1424" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft EU employment guidelines, as proposed by the Commission, have been considered by the ECOFIN and Social Affairs Councils and most recently by the Extraordinary European Council of Heads of State and Government which was held exclusively on the subject of employment in Luxembourg on 20 and 21 November.</P>
      <P>On foot of the Conclusions of the Extraordinary Council, the Commission will now finalise its proposal for the guidelines for formal approval by Council shortly.</P>
      <P>The position, therefore, is that the guidelines have not yet been adopted.  However, it is evident that the content of the guidelines, when adopted, will require member states to prepare national action plans for how they intend to implement the guidelines.  The Irish national plan will be drawn up by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in consultation with other Departments as appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the national action plans of the member states will become available early next year, and that the first review of the plans will take place at the Cardiff European Council in June 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> The Maastricht criteria have provided a model for the employment guidelines, but the Maastricht criteria themselves will not be affected by the employment guidelines.  The relationship is that the employment guidelines must be complementary to the Maastricht criteria, i.e. not be in conflict with the Maastricht criteria, by, for example, imposing undue additional public expenditure obligations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, quite rightly, refers to the unemployment crisis in the EU.  While our national unemployment rate of about 10 per cent is now below the EU average of some 11 per cent, there is absolutely no cause for complacency, as 10 per cent is still an unacceptably high level.  The initiative of introducing employment guidelines will increase the focus of the EU and the member states on the unemployment problem.  The guidelines should lead to improved policies that over time will achieve the objective of reducing the level of unemployment in the Union.</P>
    <P>The Government very much supports this initiative on guidelines and will be pressing forward actively with preparation of the national action plan and implementation of the guidelines.</P>

      <P>The Department of Finance has not carried out any study of the implications of the BSE crisis on the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>In producing forecasts for the economy, the Department of Finance takes account of all developments in agriculture.  Output in agriculture accounts for just over 7 per cent of gross domestic product in Ireland, and the proportion is falling.  Changes in agricultural output therefore have a relatively small impact on overall GDP growth.  GDP grew by 7.8 per cent in 1996 and is estimated to have grown by about 8.75 per cent in 1997.  From these figures it would appear that the negative impact of the BSE crisis on GDP growth in 1996 and 1997 has been relatively small.</P>
      <P>In terms of employment, it is again apparent that the impact of the BSE crisis has had little effect on overall employment levels, which rose by 41,000 in the 12 months to April 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the current progress in relation to drug abuse.  All health boards are working to implement the recommendations of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs and have been provided with funding for this purpose.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board, where the drugs problem is most acute, six addiction centres and 15 satellite clinics provide prevention, counselling and treatment services to drug misusers.  In addition, around 70 general practitioners and 55 pharmacies are involved in the provision of treatment to drug misusers in their own local area.  At present there are 2,660 people on the central methadone treatment list, with over 900 new people having come into treatment since the beginning of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> However, estimates of the number of drug misusers would indicate that a substantial further expansion of drug treatment services is required in order that treatment can be provided to anyone who needs it.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board's progress report of 13 November 1997 it outlined developments to date, but it also pinpointed the locations where further drug treatment facilities were required, namely, in the south inner city, north-west inner city, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Finglas with smaller scale satellite clinics being set up in up to 20 other locations throughout the greater Dublin area.  The health board is consulting local communities in every case, but progress on many developments is slow due to local opposition towards the establishment of drug treatment facilities.  I would appeal to all Deputies to support the health board in its efforts to provide the appropriate services in areas where the need for such services has been identified.  The Eastern Health Board, for its part, is setting up treatment facilities within a strict code of practice.  In the past, where the health board has worked in conjunction with local communities, the Garda and voluntary agencies in the setting up of such clinics, they have been found to work effectively, with minimal disruption to local communities.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the scourge of drug abuse at local community level.  This can only be done by providing the appropriate treatment and care to those who need it at an early stage, so that these people can be prevented from moving further into a life of crime and anti-social behaviour to feed their drug habit.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, with the proper support, the Eastern Health Board will establish a network of services which can adequately respond to the drugs problem from the health perspective.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260, 263, 264, 265, 266 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>The majority of persons with autism avail of the generic mental handicap services, including assessment and diagnostic services, day, residential, respite and home support services, which have been substantially enhanced in recent years. Specific programmes exist within the mental handicap services to address the special needs of persons with autism.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities, including the enhancement of diagnostic services as outlined in my Department's policy document on services for persons with autism, which was published in 1994, is being included by the health boards, including the Western Health Board, in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.  Additional funding amounting to £502,000 has been made available to the Western Health Board region since 1995 for the development of specific services for persons with autism.  This is in addition to the additional funding of £1,779,000 allocated to the region in the same period for the development of generic services for persons with a mental handicap, from which persons with autism also benefited.</P>
      <P>The OYAS programme, referred to by the Deputy, is one of many different programmes used in the care and development of services for children and adults with autism.  Service providers in Ireland are well aware of these programmes and incorporate elements of some of these approaches in the programmes which they provide and which are designed to meet the needs of individual children and adults.</P>
      <P>Since 1995 the board has also allocated £12,000 annually to provide training specifically for staff working with persons with autism, as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) introduction to using TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children) methods;</P>
      <P>(b) intensive training in TEACCH;</P>
      <P>(c) working positively with autism and challenging behaviour;</P>
      <P>(d) understanding and working with people with autism; and</P>
      <P>(e) assessment and diagnosis of autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This training programme was planned on the basis of a survey of staff training needs undertaken by the board's Regional Autism Training Group in 1995-96.  In addition to the training conducted at regional level, individual agencies have <Col N="1431" /> also conducted training at local level and aim to enhance the expertise within their own locations.</P>
    <P>The Irish Society for Autism, at the request of my Department, recently organised a number of training and information workshops for clinicians working in the area of diagnosis and ongoing care programmes and will be following these with similar training for staff working with persons with autism in each of the health board regions.</P>
    <P>The multidisciplinary teams which work with children with autism in the Mayo region include speech and language therapists, psychologists, in-home teachers, social workers and support workers.  There is also a child psychiatrist in the Mayo region who provides services for children with autism.  Paediatricians, child psychologists and the child psychiatrist are all involved in the early detection and diagnosis of childhood autism.  Although these teams offer a wide range of services to children with a mental handicap they have also received specific training in autism and its treatment.  In relation to other supports available to parents of children with autism the domiciliary care allowance is available to all parents and carers of children who require a level of care considerably in excess of a child of similar age who does not have a disability.  All pre-school children with autism receive approximately one hour per week of in-home teaching and a similar period of speech therapy.  In addition children-families have the assistance of a support worker for varying periods each week.  The support worker works both within the home and in pre-schools at which the children attend.  A residential respite service is also available for children of schoolgoing age.</P>
    <P>The provision of educational services to children and adults with a mental handicap, including autism, is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, that children with autism have access to a range of educational and support services. The precise nature of the support provided depends on the severity of the condition in each individual case.  In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in mainstream schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools, including schools dedicated to children with a mental handicap and schools for children with emotional or behavioural disorders.  The following special educational supports are provided at present in County Mayo:</P>
    <P>(1) two special schools cater for children with a mild mental handicap;</P>
    <P>(2) two special schools cater for children with a moderate mental handicap;</P>
    <P>(3) three special classes for children with a mild mental handicap in mainstream national schools;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> (4) 33 remedial teachers, who provide a service to 112 national schools;</P>
    <P>(5) three resource teachers, who provide a service to 14 national schools.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the Minister for Education and Science that a review of the operation of a pilot programme of special education services for children with autism in Dublin and Limerick which was first introduced for the 1995-96 school year is now commencing.  The Department will be consulting with the Irish Society for Autism as part of this process.  The review, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year, will provide the basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>
    <P>As regards the incidence of autism, research so far has not confirmed an especially high incidence in Ireland.  Difficulties regarding classification make interpretation in this area difficult.  The Irish Society for Autism will, later this week, be launching an extensive research study which it undertook in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board in the board's area.  The report examines the number of children and adults with autism, the ratio of male to female cases, services available, the levels of understanding and the consequences of diagnosis.  My Department has also made funding available to the Irish Society for Autism for research into the mortality rate and causes of mortality in persons with autism.</P>
    <P>With regard to the services which may be available to the individual mentioned by the Deputy, I have asked the Western Health Board to contact her directly to discuss her needs.</P>

      <P>A total of £500,000 was spent on upgrading facilities in St. Ita's Hospital in 1994 and 1995.  In 1996 my Department provided a further £250,000, while the Eastern Health Board provided £60,000 from its own resources which enabled further substantial upgrading to be carried out in all patient care areas throughout the hospital.</P>
      <P>The board's current development plan in relation to the St. Ita's Hospital campus provides for the closure of old wards in the main hospital block in line with a reduction in patient numbers in the psychiatric service and mental handicap service of St. Ita's.  The development plan envisages the main hospital closing as a residential facility.  This will be facilitated by the provision of purpose-built residential facilities in the community and on the hospital campus for residents with a mental handicap, and the transfer of long-term older psychiatric patients from the main hospital block to more modern accommodation on the hospital campus as vacancies arise.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the board adopted a development plan &mdash; St. Ita's Mental Handicap Service Development Programme 1997/1998 &mdash; which provides for the replacement of the older facilities in the hospital by the commissioning of four community residences and two village complexes providing a total of 85 places in the community. Implementation of the plan is under way with capital funding of £650,000 and revenue funding of £625,000 being made available this year by my Department.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the board are fully committed to the implementation of the overall development programme which will continue in 1998.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy in the first instance to the statement issued by the chairman of the board of management of Hume Street Hospital at the annual general meeting of the hospital on 20 November 1997.  Hume Street hospital has recently completed a strategic review of its services having regard to the development needs of dermatology services in Ireland.  I understand that the hospital board of management is now developing that strategy and will be actively considering a number of options over the coming months on how to deliver services in the short and medium term to its patients.  This includes the possibility that it could ultimately relocate its dermatology services to a general hospital site.</P>
      <P>Hume Street Hospital is not a modern building and consequently requires ongoing maintenance work.  The board of management has identified a priority maintenance programme for the basement area of the hospital and has sought funding for this project.  The Department has allocated capital funding of £20,000 in 1997 on an interim basis to carry out essential works in the area of the hospital.  An additional sum of £10,000 was also allocated to the hospital in 1997 for general health and safety improvements.</P>

      <Col N="1435" /> However, it is a matter of concern to me that not all the available training places on this year's psychiatric nursing and mental handicap nursing registration-diploma programmes were filled.

My Department is currently involved in consultations with the relevant interest groups with the specific objective of developing an appropriate recruitment drive to coincide with next year's competition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future,</i> which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of the services.  As recommended in this report, co-ordinating committees are being put in place in the health boards.  One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees will be to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.  The question of <Col N="1438" /> allocating additional funds for the provision of aids and applicances to people with disabilities will be considered as part of this process.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government, with the agreement of my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, decided to devote £4.325 million savings on his Department's Vote to voluntary agencies working with people with disabilities for the purchase of aids, applicances and equipment, including wheelchairs.  Each of the agencies which have received a grant under this scheme are co-ordinating the provision of aids, applicances etc. with their regional branches and the local health boards.  A sum of £266,000 was paid directly to agencies in the Southern Health Board area. Other grants were paid to the national headquarters of agencies and are intended to cover the whole country.  It is not possible to identify what portion will go to County Kerry.  The provision of this funding will have an impact on health board waiting lists for aids and applicances.</P>
    <P>An announcement will be made in the context of the budget on the level of funding to be allocated to these services in 1998.</P>

The reasons for this increased pressure were identified as the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and the advances in surgical and interventional techniques which have resulted in increased demand.</P>
      <P>In April 1997 my Department invited proposals from the hospital for the spending of £500,000 to be made available from the 1997 waiting list initiative to alleviate the pressures on this specialty.  Proposals submitted by the hospital were accepted by my Department and funding was provided to support them.  The hospital recently forwarded a progress report on the initiative which stated that: since the appointment of a locum consultant paediatrician the hospital has experienced an increase in its cardiology out patient department's activity and in the number of echocardiograms performed the combination of both these factors will result in an additional 545 procedures being carried out in 1997; building works on four additional ICU beds commenced in July and it is expected that these works will be completed shortly, and an additional training programme for ICU nurses commenced in September and six candidates have been selected for participation.</P>
      <P>A project team consisting of officials from my Department and hospital representatives is currenly working on a development plan for the provision of additional theatres at the hospital.  I have asked that this work be concluded as a matter of urgency so that the hospital can proceed to the next stage of this very important development.</P>
      <P>The question of additional consultant manpower is being considered in the context of the current review of the further development of cardiac services generally.  I am confident that all of these initiatives will have a positive impact on the service levels of this speciality in the near future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the case raised by the Deputy, I understand from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin that the person in question is on the waiting list for cardiac surgery.  The hospital is not in a position at present to give a date of admission and the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority. The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals formulated by the hospital for the appropriate spending of the additional funds allocated under the Waiting List Initiative, <Col N="1442" /> referred to above, include the possible transfer of some children to the UK for surgery with a view to allieviating the waiting list pressures on paediatric cardiology-cardiac surgery service.  The hospital has confirmed that no child will be referred for treatment abroad without the consent of the parents.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board, by agreement with the Dublin local authorities and on their behalf, operates an accommodation referral service and provides emergency accommodation for homeless people including asylum seekers. The board's expenditure in this regard is fully funded by the Dublin local authorities.  Under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, the Department recoups 90 per cent of the local authorities' expenditure on the provision of accommodation for homeless people including emergency accommodation for asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>The Department's expenditure on recoupment claims to date in 1997 is £3.609 million.  A significant element of the recoupment is accounted for by asylum seekers in Dublin and elsewhere.  A detailed breakdown of the extent to which the recoupments relates to expenditure on asylum seekers accommodated in the Dublin area will not be available until early 1998 when the annual figures from the EHB become available.  Outside the Dublin area, local authorities do not distinguish between homeless people and asylum seekers in their recoupment claims.</P>

      <P>Kildare County Council applied to my Department in 1996 for special funding of £500,000 for the reconstruction of this bridge.  The council was informed that additional funds were not then available from which a special grant could be allocated.</P>
      <P>More recently, Kildare County Council submitted four applications for funding under the EU co-financed scheme of non-national road grants in 1998.  These amounted to £2.45 million in total and included an application for funding of £250,000 for Bond Bridge.  As the overall funding requested by the council considerably exceeded the council's expenditure guideline for this scheme of grants, their proposals were returned for revision and resubmission at an appropriate level of expenditure.  The council's revised applications were received today and they do not include an application for Bond Bridge.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the selection of projects under the EU co-financed scheme depend on their compliance with EU eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme in any particular year.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department has received a letter from the Secretary of the Cork Council of Trade Unions regarding community employment scheme workers who are allowed to select either Class J or Class A contributions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter referred to by the Deputy is one of a number of representations I received regarding the entitlements of former community employment workers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the introduction of class A PRSI for community employment workers commencing such employment on or after 6 April 1996, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.  Provision was also made for existing community employment workers, i.e. those who had commenced their scheme prior to 6 April 1996 to be given the option of paying class A PRSI, if they wished, or of continuing with their existing class J PRSI.</P>
      <P>As a result of the introduction of this measure, community employment workers who revert to the live register may qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit as a result of having paid at least 13 classs A PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>In such cases, the earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The social welfare secondary benefits, including the Christmas bonus, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  Unemployment benefit claimants do not therefore have an entitlement to these benefits.  While I recognise the difficulties faced by community employment workers who re-qualify for unemployment benefit when their period of community employment finishes, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit was disallowed in this case by a deciding officer following an examination by a medical assessor who considered that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>In the context of her appeal against this decision the person concerned was examined by another medical assessor who was also of the opinion that she was capable of work.  Following an oral hearing of her appeal on 2 September 1996, and taking account of all the evidence available in the case, an appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office decided that she was not incapable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts and disallowed her appeal.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the appeals officer's decision, the person concerned furnished a report from a hospital registrar.  This report was considered by the Department's chief medical adviser who concluded that she could not be regarded as incapacitated on the basis of the medical condition described therein.  The appeals officer reviewed the case in the light of the additional evidence and concluded that a revision of his decision was not warranted.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive in the absence of new evidence or new facts or any change of circumstances since the decision was given.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of their contracts, branch managers are required to engage the necessary clerical assistance to enable them to deal efficiently with the work of the office and the levels of remuneration to branch managers are adequate to enable this to be done.

      <P>The future role of the branch office service in the light of the changing nature of the service being provided at local level by my Department is under discussion with the Branch Managers' Association.  The terms of branch manager contracts, including the appropriate staffing levels in branch offices in the future, will be among the matters to be considered in the context of these discussions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333, 334, 335, 336 and 337 together.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives in my Department's statement of strategy is to ensure that cultural tourism is promoted in a manner consistent with the primary function of conservation.  The development of interpretative centres must therefore be considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> While my Department has not undertaken any formal studies on the tourist value of interpretative centres, the importance of the rich heritage on this island in relation to tourism is well established. Improved access to and presentation of, and, where appropriate, interpretation of the cultural heritage under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 both facilitates and promotes heritage tourism.</P>
    <P>The provision of interpretative centres as part of overall heritage management strategy is primarily influenced by the specific requirements of each site.  While there is no international prototype of an interpretative centre which is used for the development of interpretative centres, my Department has regard to European and other international experience in developing access to and presentation of the national heritage.</P>
    <P>Expenditure of Structural Funds on developing and improving access to the cultural heritage and its presentation is continuing as part of my Department's programme of expenditure from Structural Funds under the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-99.  I will seek further EU funding for the national heritage, including funding relating to developing access to and presentation of the heritage, for the post 1999 period.</P>
    <P>On the possibility of funding privately-owned interpretative centres, there are no discretionary funds at my disposal for this purpose.  However, the Heritage Council, which is an independent, statutory body under the Heritage Act, 1995, has powers under that Act to provide advice and assistance including financial assistance to persons and bodies in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage.</P>

      <P>Compensation arrangements for landowners affected by proposed SAC designations were agreed following extensive consultations between my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food, and the farming organisations.  The details are as follows:</P>
      <P>Option 1</P>
      <P>Landowners may join the rural environment protection scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, under which those with land in SACs will be eligible for top-ups on existing payment rates in return for complying with SAC conservation conditions.  This will involve amendments to the existing REPS scheme and is subject to approval from the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Option 2</P>
      <P>Landowners may quantify any financial losses that will result from complying with the SAC conservation conditions laid down by my Department and claim from my Department for such losses.  Where agreement is not reached on the amount payable, independent arbitration will be available.</P>
      <P>An information note regarding compensation, which was sent by my Department to all those thought to own or use land in proposed SACs, is available from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and I am forwarding a copy to the Deputy for his information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  340, 341, 342, 343, 344 agus Uimh. 346 le chéile.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 20 and 22 of 27 November 1997.</P>
      <P>Under the Whale Fisheries Act, 1937, I, as Minister, have power to control whaling operations in Irish exclusive fishery limits or by Irish ships elsewhere, but there is no demand to carry on whaling in Irish waters.  There are no specific facilities to monitor this Act but I am satisfied that any breaches would be brought to attention by fisheries patrols.  The sanctuary declaration is also a symbol to the rest of the world that Ireland does not take whales or dolphins and promotes the protection of these animals.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in my response to previous questions, the moratorium on commercial whaling is not fully effective as Japan and Norway are taking an increasing number of whales legally under the Convention.  Japan and every other member state in the International Whaling</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> Commission are legally entitled to take as many whales as they themselves decide for scientific research purposes.  Norway and the Russian Federation have lodged legal objections to the moratorium and, therefore, are entitled to take whales for commercial purposes in waters other than recognised sanctuaries.  The Russian Federation has chosen not to exercise its rights under this objection. Norway takes whales under objection and Ireland has on numerous occasions asked it to desist without success.</P>
    <P>The Irish proposals will, if accepted, limit the possible extent of commercial whaling to coastal waters and will greatly reduce the extent of scientific research whaling.  These proposals were produced as a result of informal discussions with representatives of other Governments and non-government organisations, generally at IWC meetings.  Ireland's Commissioner has given a number of media interviews on the subject.  He has also met with the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group and is available for discussion with any other interested group.  A formal briefing session on the proposals was given by the Commissioner to representatives of more than 100 non-government organisations attending the IWC meeting in Monaco.  I understand the organisations were most appreciative of the open and transparent manner in which the proposals were put forward and were grateful for the opportunity to comment on them directly.  I would remind the Deputy also that the proposals put to the IWC at the recent meeting in Monaco were actually an invitation to start a discussion, rather than a set of fixed texts which could be voted on.  I am still open to suggestions for amendments to these proposals and I will support any proposals which achieve the objectives of controlling and limiting whaling.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the suggestion that Ireland has not &ldquo;called for&rdquo; the implementation for the moratorium. The comprehensive assessment of whale species being carried out by the Scientific Committee of the IWC is likely to show that commercial whaling at sustainable levels will be possible on a number of whale populations.  This is one of the reasons why Ireland has brought forward proposals now to limit and control whaling.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the details of assessments of the effects of pollution on endangered whale species but I can confirm that the Scientific Committee of IWC has been asked to ensure that such effects are taken into account in calculating quotas under the revised management scheme. The IWC does not have a function in relation to marine pollution.</P>
    <P>Ireland has proposed that the revised management scheme should contain the following provisions in relation to the monitoring of whaling operations including trade:</P>
    <P>&mdash; international observers on all whaling vessels;</P>
    <P>&mdash; satellite tracking of whaling vessels;</P>
    <P>&mdash; DNA samples to be taken from all whales;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" />&mdash; DNA testing of whalemeat in the market; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; standards for carrying out surveys.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that hunting on State-owned foreshore, State-owned lakes, rivers and other accretions belonging to the State is regulated under section 30 of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  While the legal title to these areas may be disputed in some cases, responsibility for the conservation of wildlife on such lakes and rivers rests with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department.  However, other Government Departments, local authorities and State bodies have various responsibilities for diverse matters relating to such lakes and rivers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that a very considerable amount of work would be required to research the specific matters raised by him &mdash; for example, some 38 lakes are regarded as State-owned &mdash; and I am reluctant to commit the resources that would be required without having a clearer understanding of the benefits that would accrue from the process.  If, however, the Deputy requires information in relation to particular lakes or rivers, I will be glad to have the matter investigated further.</P>

      <P>I am aware of two instances where gardaí who were convicted of common assault were allowed to continue to serve in the force.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in one of these cases the breach of discipline was processed in accordance with Regulation 13 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989.  This regulation prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Garda authorities where certain breaches of discipline are admitted and the holding of an inquiry is, therefore, unnecessary. The penalty imposed in this case was a temporary reduction in pay.</P>
      <P>In the second case the complaint was processed under the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.  The Garda Complaints Board referred the matter to a tribunal hearing which found the garda in breach of discipline and imposed a fine equivalent to four weeks pay.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that guidelines are in place for members of the Garda who encounter drug addicts, prisoners and other individuals who may be in possession of syringes or needles.  Other measures for the welfare of gardaí include the assignment of welfare officers to provide a confidential counselling service to members and a network of welfare committees &mdash; at national and divisonal level &mdash; to discuss matters pertaining to members' welfare.  Gardaí can also avail of services of trained &ldquo;Peer Supporters&rdquo; whose role is to respond whenever a member is the victim of a traumatic incident. Finally, a working committee has recently been set up by the Commissioner to examine the necessity of having body armour available for use by gardaí in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>Section 49 (1) (a) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 (as substituted by section 10 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994) provides that &ldquo;a person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while he is under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle&rdquo;.  Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, as amended provides that an &ldquo;intoxicant&rdquo; includes &ldquo;alcohol and drugs, and any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol.&rdquo; There have been successful prosecutions under section 49 (1) (a) of the Road Traffic Act, 1996 (as amended) for driving under the influence of an intoxicant.  However, statistics are not compiled in such a way as to distinguish between cases of driving under the influence of intoxicants other than alcohol, and alcohol.  This information could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that in the ongoing campaigns carried out by the gardaí in enforcing the Road Traffic Acts, the gardaí give high priority to the offence of driving under the influence of intoxicants, including drugs, as part of their road safety strategy to dissuade drivers from engaging in this anti-social activity. <Col N="1473" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 373 and 376 together.</P>

I think that it would be wrong to prejudge the outcome of that examination now.</P>
      <P>As regards the use of electronic equipment designed to monitor fax and mobile telephone communications, the Deputy will be aware that interception of telecommunications is regulated by the Postal and Telecommunications (Regulation) Act, 1993 which provides that, I, as Minister with responsibility under the Act, may authorise warrants permitting lawful interception on foot of applications by the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces.  It is already an offence under the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, to intercept telecommunications messages without lawful authority.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to carry out a review of management of the Garda Síochána in view of the fact that the Garda Síochána's overtime bill has trebled in three years and will cost the taxpayer £43 million in 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most marked increase in overtime expenditure occurred in the period 1995-96 when expenditure went from less than £17 million in 1995 to £37.5 million in 1996.  Overtime expenditure in 1997 is likely to reach £43 million which again represents an increase over the previous year although the rate of increase has slowed down somewhat.</P>
      <P>There has been a substantial increase in the demand on Garda operational resources over the past few years and in the short-term this demand can only be met by the use of overtime.  Overtime expenditure has increased due to demands associated with serious crime investigations, such as the investigation into the murder of journalist Veronica Guerin, together with the on-going BSE operations, measures to combat the entry of illegal aliens, and special operations such as Lifesaver and Dóchas.</P>
      <P>The current level of overtime is very high but many of the operations funded by this expenditure have been particularly effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is to ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money and I intend to see a more focused approach to overtime expenditure.  I already went into some detail on this point during the recent debate on the 1997 Supplementary <Col N="1475" /> Estimate for the Garda Vote.  The management procedures for overtime expenditure are being reviewed to see if improvements can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that in addition the general management of resources, including overtime expenditure, is being addressed in the framework of the strategic management initiative.  The Government approved the publication last week of the SMI Report of the Steering Group on Efficiency and Effectiveness of An Garda Síochána.</P>

The national service is co-ordinated from Garda DMA Headquarters in offices provided by the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Garda authorities have ensured also that there are long-standing instructions to all members which provide, where a non-national may be charged with an offence, that every facility is to be afforded to enable contact to be made with the relevant consular officials of the country of origin.</P>

However, it is a most important part of the determination process that the situation in the countries of origin of asylum seekers is researched and taken into account.

      <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to increase Garda numbers to bring the strength of the Force to 12,000.  This will require the recruitment of an estimated 2,200 gardaí.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda management will continue to monitor the deployment of personnel with a view to ensuring that policing requirements are adequately met.  Furthermore, the report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána published last week recommends a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; review of the Force to determine the optimum resources required by <Col N="1478" /> the Garda for effective and efficient policing of the State.  This recommendation has been approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>A recruitment campaign is currently under way for the Prison Service.  Already, since the beginning of October, 52 prison officers have been recruited.  Between now and the end of 1998 it is proposed to recruit in the region of another 330 prison officers to meet the staffing needs arising from the opening of a new prison at Castlerea, a new female prison at Mountjoy and a new remand prison at Cloverhill.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that additional prison officers will also be recruited during 1999 and the year 2000 to staff the additional prison spaces which the Government intends to provide during that period.</P>

      <P>I have already addressed the Deputy's questions in my reply to him of 18 November 1997. As regards the terms of reference of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet, they are as follows:</P>
      <P>To identify the nature and extent of the issues surrounding the illegal and harmful use of the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> To prioritise such issues with particular reference to the need to address the issue of child pornography in the short-term. To examine and assess the current approaches both domestically and internationally to addressing the problem of the illegal and harmful use of the Internet.</P>
    <P>In relation to those issues which can be domestically addressed, to identify the legal, technical and structural problems which arise and to make specific recommendations for their resolution in the short, medium and long-term as appropriate.</P>
    <P>In relation to those issues which require resolution in an international context, to make recommendations which will inform policy in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda operate under legislation enacted by the Oireachtas which falls to be interpreted by the courts.  Obviously in reality it is not possible for the Oireachtas &mdash; or indeed any other body &mdash; to foresee every circumstance which might arise and it is inevitable that all legislation in the criminal justice area will be rigorously tested in the courts.  In these circumstances there is no process whereby legislation can be completely proofed against having consequences which cannot be foreseen or interpretations put upon it which were not obvious at the time of its enactment. While I appreciate that the term &ldquo;technicalities&rdquo; is used as a form of shorthand it has no precise meaning in the context of the examination of particular legislative provisions.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I do, of course, accept that whatever measures are possible should be taken to attempt to ensure that weaknesses or potential weaknesses in legislation which come to light are remedied as soon as possible.  In this context I have been considering proposals which would allow for a regular forum to take place of people involved in the preparation and operation of the criminal law whereby weaknesses or potential weaknesses can be identified and remedial action taken.  I hope to have proposals in this regard finalised shortly.</P>

This amount is paid to the legal representatives, who are engaged independently by asylum seekers, on certification by the Appeals Authority that the representatives have acted in the case.

      <P>To assist the Legal Aid Board in dealing with the present demand on its services I am allocating an extra £1.1 million in funding to the board for 1988, thereby bringing the board's grant in 1998 to £9,495 million.  This should help to alleviate the situation in the law centres.</P>

      <P>My Department is having ongoing discussions with the Garda authorities about the designation of places under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, for the purposes of detention of persons suspected of concealing drugs in their bodies.  To date the Garda authorities have indicated that one such place will be required in the Dublin area.  Work will have to be carried out to ensure that the particular location has facilities suitable for this purpose. Consideration is being given to what the requirements will be for the area outside Dublin. In the circumstances, I am not in a position to indicate precisely when regulations will be made <Col N="1482" /> but, as I indicated in my earlier reply to the Deputy, the absence of such regulations does not prevent the operation of the detention provisions of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume from the Deputy's question that a community police force under the control of the Garda Síochána would be along the idea of a reserve police force.</P>
      <P>The question of the establishment of such a force has been considered from time to time. However, it is not clear that any possible advantage arising from the establishment of such a force would outweigh potential difficulties which arise from it.  For example, one would have to be concerned with the rights of individuals faced with a new law enforcement group who would initially lack the expertise and training of full-time police.  A reserve police force would also cost money and, given the potential difficulties and the problems of acceptability of such a force, I am in no doubt that the money would be better spent in providing increased capacity for the Garda Síochána.  This can be achieved through the recruitment of additional gardaí to the force and by increased civilianisation of the force thereby maximising the number of gardaí which can be released to operational duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in line with this belief that in our Government programme we have committed ourselves to bringing the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000 members, and I am also endeavouring to <Col N="1485" /> maximise the number of gardaí engaged on operational duties which can only be performed by members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It has always been the policy of this Department and the Garda authorities to encourage all law abiding citizens to assist the gardaí in law enforcement.  This policy is being implemented by the concept of community policing in the urban context.  We have the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes and various other community based voluntary initiatives.</P>
    <P>The first neighbourhood garda was appointed in the Loughlinstown-Ballybrack area of south County Dublin in November 1987 and there has been a gradual expansion since then.  A total of 195 gardaí, 27 sergeants and one inspector in the Dublin Metropolitan Area are engaged in neighbourhood policing duties.  The Garda authorities consider that the neighbourhood policing scheme has proven a very successful way of putting gardaí in closer touch with the community they serve and of providing a more visible Garda presence locally.  The scheme has been further expanded to include other major cities in the following Garda divisions: Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Sligo, Dundalk, Longford-Westmeath and Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that a reserve police force is needed.  As I have outlined I intend committing the resources that we have to strengthening the Garda Síochána and continuing our existing community policing initiatives.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Freeflow Three came into operation within the Dublin Metropolitan Area on Monday, 1 December 1997 and will remain in place until 5 January 1998.  The Garda plan was drawn up following consultation with the various agencies including the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Dublin Corporation, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann, and the Dublin Transportation Office.</P>
      <P>The main objective is to ensure that the transport system works with as much efficiency as possible during the Christmas period.  To achieve this objective, an additional 162 gardaí from the Garda college are being allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Area over the Christmas period to augment existing Garda resources for the duration of Operation Freeflow Three.  As a result, there will be approximately 200 Garda personnel on duty at any given time.</P>
      <P>The Garda have identified 21 arterial routes into the city and key black trouble spots which will receive sustained attention and enforcement. A feature of the Garda action plan is high visibility intensive patrolling by mobile Garda resources, particularly motor cycles and foot patrols.  I have been assured by the Garda authorities that there will be rigid enforcement of the bus lane and clearway regulations in order to maintain rapid public transport movement.  Four Garda tow wagons are being deployed exclusively to deal with traffic congestion and obstructions, particularly in the areas between the Royal and Grand Canals.  A blitz method of enforcement incorporating both tow away and tow aside actions will operate.</P>
      <P>There is a system in place which allows for instant communication between the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation traffic control centre and the public utilities which will assist the co-ordination of effort.  I am confident that these measures, with the co-operation of the public, will go a long way towards alleviating the traffic problems in the Dublin area during the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>The drug treatment unit based at Mountjoy Prison's health care unit which was opened in July 1996 was the first dedicated facility for the treatment of drug addicted offenders in any of our prisons.  The treatment <Col N="1488" /> unit provides a structured detoxification programme followed by a six week therapeutic course.  The unit has medical, nursing and psychiatric services in place and all personnel are experienced in addiction treatment.  The therapy programme is co-ordinated by a senior probation and welfare officer and draws on the experience and expertise of a number of community based agencies which are active in this field.</P>
      <P>A drug free unit, based at the training unit which is adjacent to Mountjoy Prison, has been in operation since June 1996.  It currently accommodates over 90 offenders in an environment where a drug free existence has become the norm.  Prisoners with a background of chronic drug abuse who have come to terms with their addiction, as well as those who have had no prior involvement with drugs, are availing of this facility.  The regimes in the health care unit and the drug free unit are underpinned by a strict drug urine testing programme.  These initiatives have been developed in response to a real demand for treatment and avoidance options for prisoners.  They are working well and I intend to expand and develop both models throughout the wider prison system in order to maximise their effect and availability.</P>
      <P>In all institutions treatment for drug addicted offenders has been and continues to be provided as part of the general medical services available to all inmates.  Any offender who is willing to make a real effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation will be supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling.  It is unfortunately the case that despite the availability of the treatment options which I have outlined above, many offenders continue to fail to grasp the opportunities provided to address their addiction.</P>

      <P>It has been recognised, not least by my Department, that the formulation of sound policies in the criminal justice system requires quality research founded upon a reliable statistical base.  It has also been acknowledged, most recently in the Department's discussion document on crime, Tackling Crime, that such research is not well developed in this country.</P>
      <P>To address this real and serious deficiency, my Department commissioned a Research Needs Study from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in May 1997.  The purpose of this study was to identify how the Department could develop its capacity for generating and utilising social research on the criminal justice system in discharging its policy planning function.  The ESRI submitted its report in November.  It recommends a particular approach to the management of a programme of research within the Department as part of a broader policy planning brief.</P>
      <P>I have accepted the main recommendations of the ESRI report, and to ensure that their implementation occurs as speedily as possible a provision of £250,000 has been made in the 1998 Estimates for research purposes within my Department.  Work is now progressing on establishing the arrangements to manage the research programme and I look forward to the considerable benefits which I expect will accrue to policy development in the area of criminology as a result.</P>

      <P>As is the case with all other <Col N="1490" /> areas of expenditure, the specification of annual requirements for the funding of third level education courses followed by members of the force is primarily a matter for the Garda authorities. Competing demands for the allocation of scarce resources have then to be prioritised within overall expenditure limits.  Funding for third level courses has been increased over the years in line with inflation and I am not aware of any demand from the Garda authorities for any significant increases over and above current levels of expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities avail themselves, as far as possible, having regard to operational commitments, of opportunities which arise for exchanges of personnel between the force and other law enforcement agencies.  There are numerous examples of such arrangements.  These include exchanges between gardaí in the Garda training college and their counterparts in other police training colleges and exchanges of personnel for the purpose of language training.  These exchanges facilitate the study of criminal justice systems in other jurisdictions and help to establish useful police contacts.</P>
      <P>There are also more structured exchange arrangements in place.  During its recent Presidency of the European Union Ireland brought forward proposals in the Justice and Home Affairs Council for the establishment of a framework, including funding arrangements, to develop and enhance co-operation between European Union police, customs and other law enforcement authorities.  This initiative, known as the OISIN Programme, was adopted at the Dublin Council on 20 December 1996.  The programme envisages co-operation between member states' law enforcement authorities in the form of exchange and training.  A number of projects of an operational nature, particularly in the drugs area, submitted by the Garda Síochána under the programme have already been approved for funding by the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda resources is an operational matter for the Garda authorities.  In so far as the investigation of murder is concerned, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation of all crime, including murder, is the responsibility of the local district officer.  The resources of the national bureau of criminal investigation are available to investigate any serious crime, should the district officer require same.  This is in addition to the specialist services available such as fingerprints, ballistics etc.  The expertise of other units &mdash; such as the Garda national drugs unit or the Garda bureau of fraud investigation &mdash; can also be called <Col N="1491" /> upon to assist in any investigation where expertise in these areas is required.</P>
      <P>The national bureau of criminal investigation was set up by the commissioner early this year to enhance the co-ordination of Garda central investigatory expertise.  This includes expertise in the investigation of murders which, as I have indicated, is available to district officers as needed. I have been informed that experience to date in relation to murder investigations is that the national bureau is providing expert assistance to murder investigations which is more focused and effective than that which was available with the former murder squad.  Nevertheless I believe the intrinsic value of having a dedicated unit for murder investigations, even within the national bureau, merits being kept under review and, as necessary, changes made to ensure that expertise remains so focused as to achieve optimum results in the investigation of murders.</P>

Firstly, it targets the child sex tourist by providing that Irish citizens or person ordinarily resident here who engage in sex with children abroad can be dealt with by the courts here.  Secondly, the Act also targets organisers by making it an offence to arrange transport for, or to actually transport, child sex tourists.  It is also an offence to publish information on child sex tourism.</P>
      <P>The Act gives the Garda Síochána substantial powers to deal with this evil.  If experience shows that additional powers are needed I will not hesitate to seek Government approval for them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that in September the Government approved the drafting of a Child Pornography Bill the purpose of which is to enhance the measures already in place to protect children under 17 years from sexual exploitation and abuse.  The Bill is currently being drafted and I hope to publish it shortly.</P>

      <P>I am of course concerned at any decriminalisation of illicit drugs and the development of practices in certain EU countries which may reflect a tolerance of certain illicit drugs.  The Irish Government is opposed to the decriminalisation of drugs, including the so called &ldquo;soft drugs&rdquo;.  The Government is conscious that tolerance of drugtaking may send the wrong message to our vulnerable young people, if not provide them with an avenue of access to drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the concerns raised by him are shared in other EU countries and that efforts are being made to achieve a consistent EU approach to the drugs problem.  This has been reflected in a joint action agreed by the Council of Ministers concerning the approximation of the laws and practices of the member states to combat drug addiction and to prevent <Col N="1494" /> and combat illegal drug trafficking.  I am forwarding a copy to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>My Department has for some time been committed to the use of information technology.  This has been evidenced by the continuing commitment to the PULSE project which has seen a substantial investment in information technology for the Garda over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year my Department also commissioned a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand on the information technology needs of the Department in the context of the major organisational reforms now under way &mdash; in particular the setting up of the Courts Service and Prisons Authority and the recently announced expert group review of the probation and welfare service.  This study has now been completed, its recommendations approved and additional resources have been provided in the 1998 Estimates for all Votes under my aegis. This significant new investment further demonstrates the Government's practical commitment to new information technology systems for the Justice area.  Underlying this investment is a commitment to appropriate integration of systems.</P>
      <P>Some 20 projects have been identified for completion over the next three years.  Among the major projects identified, is a detailed analysis of the information flows between the various agencies in the criminal justice system under my aegis. This will also identify the points where data needs to be exchanged with other agencies such as the Office of the DPP and Chief State Solicitor's office which, as the Deputy will be aware, are outside my area of responsibility.  It is expected that this project, with the development of major case tracking systems within the courts and prisons areas and the delivery of Garda operational systems under the PULSE project, will lay the foundation for the increasingly effective use of technology in the criminal justice system.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to provide the precise information sought by the Deputy in the time available.  However, the daily average number of persons on temporary release in the period from 30 June to the 30 November 1997 was approximately 527.</P>
      <P>All categories of sentenced offenders are eligible for consideration for temporary release except those imprisoned for contempt of court (including civil debtors).  It is long-standing policy, however, that persons serving sentences for serious crimes such as sex offences, importation or supply of drugs, armed robbery (including robberies where a syringe was used) and other cases involving serious violence are not granted periods of temporary release except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Prisoners are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons ranging from a few hours to attend a funeral to full temporary release which is, in effect, our system of parole.  Parole, a feature of prison systems world-wide, is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  In addition, it must be said that in a substantial number of cases the timing of the consideration of a prisoner for temporary release may be affected by pressure on prison accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State, at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 and 452 together.</P>
      <P>The previous Government established a Cabinet drugs committee to bring a coherent approach to tackling the drugs problem.  This committee, which was chaired by the Taoiseach, gave overall political leadership in the fight against drugs; reviewed all trends in the drugs problem; assessed progress in the strategy in dealing with both supply and demand; and resolved any policy or organisational difficulties which may have inhibited an effective response to the problem.</P>
      <P>Recognising the links between social exclusion, drug abuse and alienation, the present Government decided that the most strategic way to tackle the problem of social exclusion was to reconstitute the drugs committee and give it a wider remit encompassing disadvantage in the broadest sense.  This committee &mdash; which continues to be chaired by the Taoiseach but whose membership has been expanded to include other relevant Ministers, such as Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs, will link the work being done on local development and the national anti-poverty strategy, as well as the national drugs strategy.</P>
      <P>The national drugs strategy team &mdash; which comprises representatives from relevant Departments and agencies, as well as persons from the voluntary and community sectors and has responsibility for implementing the Government's drugs strategy, reports through me to the Cabinet committee.  The work of the team is overseen by the national drugs strategy policy group, comprising assistant secretaries from relevant Departments and chaired by my Department.</P>
      <P>At local level, 13 drug task forces have been set up in the areas identified as being worst affected by the drugs problem.  These task forces &mdash; which comprise representatives from relevant statutory agencies, as well as the voluntary and community sector &mdash; were mandated to prepare action plans to tackle the drugs problem locally in an integrated, coherent manner.  The national drugs strategy team is currently finalising recommendations to the Cabinet committee on funding to implement these plans.  A sum of £10 million has been provided for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the structures which I have outlined have, in my opinion, contributed significantly towards the development of a co-ordinated, integrated approach towards tackling the drugs problem.</P>

      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997.  The notice was also published in the Irish daily newspapers on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by 5 p.m. on Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within the deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997, invitation to tender documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intentions to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 November, for so doing.  These six applicants, who will be responsible for providing a site for the proposed development, have three months to submit their tenders, that is by the end of January next year, following which the tenders will be assessed.</P>

      <P>The article in question appears to draw upon a first draft report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in which the expenditure for each college was divided by provisional full-time equivalent student numbers to arrive at the cost per student.  Such an arithmetic exercise on provisional figures is of very limited use and can be very misleading.  The cost per student betwen colleges can be affected by a number of factors, for instance, the spread and nature of the courses, the relative balance between part-time and full-time students, the balance between laboratory and non-laboratory based activity and the level of provision for apprentices, undergraduates and post-graduates.</P>
      <P>The annual budget allocation by my Department takes into account the complexity of the particular institution and the range of courses and facilities offered to students (both full-time and part-time).  Following a review of the 1997 allocation for the technological sector generally and as an indication of commitment to the development of WIT, it was decided to increase the total budget for 1997 for WIT to over £14 million.  This represented an increase in £1 million over the 1996 budget for WIT.</P>

Accordingly, she is not eligible for further grant assistance in respect of the further postgraduate study she is currently undertaking.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support of students attending PLC courses.  The commitment in the programme for Government reflects the importance which the Government attaches to students in the PLC sector.</P>
      <P>The cost of introducing a means tested support scheme for PLC students along the lines of the higher education grants scheme would be of the order of £13 million per annum.  My Department is providing over £39 million this year towards the running costs of PLC courses which are playing a key role in preparing young people for employment and further education-training.  These courses are a significant element of the Government's response to meeting the skill needs of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>In the international teleservices area, I have approved the provision of 690 places in 20 selected centres under which a two year NCVA level three PLC course is being provided as part of the national response to emerging skill needs of the industry.  This has been accompanied by an investment of £1.5 million in the selected centres to enable them to provide a quality programme consistent with industry needs.  As this new initiative involves extensive placement abroad, a new student support scheme is being introduced towards the cost of the overseas placement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the new education technology investment fund, under which £250 million will be provided in the next three years for technology investment at all levels of education in partnership <Col N="1508" /> with industry, includes specific provision for the PLC programme.</P>
    <P>Through action to properly resource different aspects of their work, I am confident that, over the lifetime of this Government, we will consistently demonstrate our commitment to recognising and promoting the role of the PLC sector.</P>

      <P>My capacity to allocate additional <i>ex-quota</i> teacher posts to the remedial and home-school-community liaison services in any school year is dependent on resource availability in that year.  In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial or home-school-committee liaison posts to schools in the area mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The report of the advisory committee on third level student support, chaired by Dr. Donal de Butléir, was published in February 1995.  The advisory committee found the present system of student support to be fragmented, cumbersome <Col N="1511" /> and very confusing for grant applicants.  It identified overlaps and duplication with up to 70 different organisations involved in the administration of the grant schemes.  It also found that payments were too frequently delayed and that students were often disadvantaged by various administrative problems in the system.  The advisory committee recommended that the three existing schemes, which have the same means test, the same rate of grant and cover virtually the same courses, should have a single application form.  It also recommended significant changes in the processing of grant applications and payments.</P>
      <P>In August 1997 a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs commenced an examination of various options for the future administration of the student support schemes including the case for and against transferring this activity to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  I expect to receive a preliminary report from this working group shortly which will outline the issues that will require detailed examination before any recommendations can be finalised.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for any detailed examination, including the participation of interested parties, can only be considered following receipt of the preliminary report.  However, I would like to emphasise that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.</P>
      <P>I accept that the current administration of the student support schemes need to be improved. Apart from reservations about the need for a new body I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  My priority is to ensure that the system properly addresses the concerns of students and parents.</P>

On examination of this feasibility study by technical staff in the building unit of my Department, the design team were presented with a number of options concerning the future of the school.  A meeting was held in the Department with the consultant architect recently to discuss the way forward and a number of issues were clarified.</P>
      <P>The design team have recently been asked to submit an expanded feasibility study to the Department concerning the various options discussed.

It is normal practice for the Government to review and adjust the expenditure provisions in the context of finalising the budget and in the light of more up-to-date outturn figures. Moreover, the Estimates provisions are only the first stage in the process of determining sepcific allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education.</P>
      <P>No specific allocations have been determined for 1998 for individual colleges in the technological sector.  The allocation for Waterford Institute of Technology will be considered in the context of the on-going discussions with the institute and its 1998 programmes and budget submissions.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to amalgamate the convent of the Sacred Heart, Ferrybank and Slieverue vocational school and provide a new community school.  Following the results of a feasibility study carried out on the proposal, it has been decided to locate this new facility on the Ferrybank site.  Arrangements are under way for the selection of consultants to participate on the Department's design team for the building works.

    <P>Pupils who enrol in second level schools for the purpose of repeating the leaving certificate examination are liable to pay a course fee of £100. Pupils whose parents or guardians are the holders of a current medical card are exempt from payment of the course fee.  Under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme, eligible pupils may avail of transport, only on payment of the appropriate contribution for each term. Where the parents or legal guardians of eligible pupils are medical card holders, they may be excused the contribution in respect of such children. In designating schools as disadvantaged, the level of medical card holders among the families <Col N="1516" /> of the pupils in the school is one of several criteria-socio economic indicators used.  The level of medical card holders is also used in selecting schools for inclusion in the breaking the cycle pilot project.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 491, 503 and 504 together.</P>
      <P>At present, a total of 55 remedial teachers and 12 resource teachers are deployed in primary schools in County Galway.  In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
      <P>These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial and 26 resource teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997. Remedial and resource teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  Such posts are allocated on a shared basis where the level of need in an individual school is not such as to warrant a full post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial or resource teacher posts to primary schools.  However, I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including remedial and resource teacher provision, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which <Col N="1518" /> they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional allocation of special supports which may be undertaken.</P>

      <Quest>the number of remedial teachers currently working in primary schools; the number of schools served by these teachers; the duration of tuition given to necessitous pupils where the teacher works exclusively within one school and where the teacher serves a number of schools on a shared basis; the study, if any, which has been undertaken by his Department on the effectiveness of the remedial service; if all needy pupils have equal access to remedial teachers; and if there is consensus on the optimum level of remedial tuition that should be available to primary school pupils.</Quest>

      <P>There are 1,242 remedial teacher posts allocated to 2,459 primary schools.  The working week for a full-time remedial teacher in a primary school is not less than 28 hours and 20 minutes. Where a remedial teacher is assigned to a cluster of schools, travelling time may reduce the number of hours available for teaching.</P>
      <P>An initial survey of the remedial service by my Department's inspectorate demonstrated a need to reorganise existing provision to achieve a more effective targeting of resources.  It also identified a need to place much greater emphasis on preventative strategies in schools, including early identification strategies and differentiated teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> In order to address these matters, my Department, in consultation with the education partners, is currently involved in a thorough remedial education study.  The study is focusing on: the numbers of pupils receiving a remedial service; the criteria for inclusion in and withdrawal from remedial classes; the organisation of remedial teaching in schools; the development and implementation of policy on remedial teaching in schools; and record keeping and reporting.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the study will be of value in the context of future development of the remedial service and in determining the optimum level for the remedial service.</P>
    <P>Pupils who are performing at or below the tenth percentile on standardised tests should have priority for the remedial teacher service attached to their schools.</P>
