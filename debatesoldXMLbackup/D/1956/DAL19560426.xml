      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out last night the valuable contribution which farmers' organisations can make towards increasing the volume of production so urgently required from the land at the present time.  We must remember that the only immediate prospect of improving our balance of payments position is to increase agricultural exports by at least £50,000,000 as soon as possible.  Now that can be done.  It can be done because there is a huge acreage of potentially fertile <Col N="972" /> land waiting to produce food.  The experience of our farmers in the past has been that, if they produce a surplus of any crop, they cannot find a market for it, and they are, therefore, obliged to put that produce on sale for home consumption at sacrifice prices.  I emphasise home consumption because I realise that, if we expect the farmers to produce more live stock and more surplus crops, we must be in a position to export that surplus, since our population here has a limit, so far as consumption is concerned.  Indeed, we can all too easily produce too much food for our own people.</P>
      <P>Our objective, therefore, must be to find a market outside for our surplus produce and we must find a market which will pay our farmers a reasonably profitable price.  Now the difficulty, so far as farming is concerned, is that production costs are so high the surplus produce from our land cannot be sold outside the country. We can produce here too much of most types of food and, when we try to sell the surplus outside, we find ourselves competing in a world market.  Owing to our system of production, a system which is out-dated, our production costs are so high that we are unable to sell our surplus produce economically on the world market.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I believe that the various farmers' organisations, such as Muintir na Tíre, the National Farmers' Association and the Young Farmers' Clubs, have a very valuable contribution to make towards improving our agricultural economy.  Looking back over the past, it is obvious that we must look to these organisations now to guide the farmers whom they represent, by voluntary effort and co-operation, in relation to both production costs and modern methods of production. In addition to that, we shall have to devise better marketing schemes throughout the country for our surplus of both crops and live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, the only surplus which can be easily marketed is beef and we have a ready market for all the beef we can produce.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about other surpluses which we are also capable of <Col N="973" /> producing.  From that point of view, I think the farmers organisations should get down to the business of costing the various items of food for the guidance of farmers, so that they, in turn, can bring down their costs of production, thereby enabling us to compete in the world market.  Nobody can deny that we have three acres of land for every unit of our population and, from that point of view, we are capable of producing a huge surplus.  If we succeed in producing that surplus at the right price, we can certainly get it sold on the world market.  We cannot ask the farmers to produce at surpluses and then sell their produce at sacrifice prices, so we must set about cutting down costs for the various products which can be produced quickly in the immediate future so that we can export to improve our balance of payments position.  Were it not for our agricultural exports at the present time, this country would be in a very bad position.</P>
    <P>When we examine the figures, we see that in 1947, £40,000,000 worth of livestock products were exported as compared with £120,000,000 worth to-day. Even with that huge increase in the monetary value of our exports, it is not sufficient to put our balance of payments in proper order.  Therefore, we must immediately set about adopting some kind of policy which will enable a huge increase to take place in our agricultural exports.  We need not look to industry to improve our balance of payments to any considerable extent within a short time but most people familiar with agricultural conditions will agree that there is a reasonable prospect of a sure market for the products of the land if the farmers could increase production dramatically.  They are nervous of doing so having regard to past experience when they succeeded in producing surpluses of various crops.  That is why I consider that the farmers' organisations have a very important part to play now.</P>
    <P>If we cannot get into markets outside this country with our food, we need not consider ourselves an agricultural country with an agricultural economy.  For that reason, I feel that <Col N="974" /> by adopting modern methods of production and better systems of marketing we shall get that export trade which is needed very urgently now by the country.</P>
    <P>When we are considering these things we should also consider the farms from which those exports should come.  We must expect the export trade to come from the small farmers of this country; two-thirds of the total number of farms are occupied by small farmers.  We must ask ourselves what type of surplus can be produced on a small farm.  If we take a 20-acre farm, we need not hope that such a farm will be capable of producing a large number of either cattle or sheep.  We must look to those small farms to increase dramatically the production of pigs and poultry.  The small farmer's wife in the past contributed a very large share to the national wealth by her efforts on those small farms, by feeding calves, pigs and poultry.  It is to that side of our economy that the small farmers can make the greatest contribution.  When we decide that the small farmers of the country can give us a surplus of pigs and poultry, we must immediately get down to the problem of costings for those two items in order that they will have a certain market and a certain profit on those two items.</P>
    <P>We have seen in the past that production costs in the poultry industry have been very inconsistent.  Poultry farmers made good profits in one particular year or in one part of a particular year and then they suffered a loss in the latter part of the year or in the year following.  They were going out of poultry and then going into poultry, usually at the wrong time, instead of keeping consistent stock.  When we consider that there are people engaging in poultry production who have not the facilities which are available to the small farmers, we realise that if the small farmers could be assured of a steady and stable market for their poultry produce they could engage in a consistent way in that sphere of production.</P>
    <P>The position as far as pig production is concerned is not so difficult.  There has been a reasonably steady market <Col N="975" /> for pigs during the last few years. There again, if we ask our small farmers to increase dramatically the number of pigs produced and the amount of bacon supplied to our factories, which will, in the long run, be exported, we must be able to give them guidance in the matter of costings in order that they will have a certainty of profit and a sure market.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the particulars given by the Minister in his Estimate.  He devoted a considerable amount of time to the problem of pig production when he was introducing his Estimate and showed clearly the value that pig production can be to this country.  He showed also that pig production is not a matter of chance any longer.  Costings have been cut down to a very fine position in the matter of pig production.</P>
    <P>We are now able to calculate to the last pound the amount of food and proteins fed to the pigs and the weight that will result from such feeding. That is very useful for any man who desires to go into pig production.  I am going to ask the Minister to start a campaign for pig production amongst the small farmers and to ask them to follow the various feeding systems and rations which are now made available to them by experts in pig production. If they can get a profit from it, we shall be able to increase our exports in that sphere.  We can increase our pig population more rapidly than any other form of live stock.  The number of pigs can be increased more rapidly than either poultry, cattle or sheep.  I think that, if the Minister appeals to the small farmers to increase their pig production and adopt this form of feeding, he will get good results.</P>
    <P>Most farms in this country are understocked but I feel we ought to concentrate, for the present anyway, on starting activities on the small farms which will result in profit to the families living on those farms.  We have seen that since the war the volume of production has increased mainly on the larger farms and the explanation of that is that modern machinery and mechanisation has enabled a greater amount to be done in a given time.  The machinery is suitable for <Col N="976" /> those larger farms, but when we consider that by far the greater number of our farmers here are small farmers, we must direct our attention to them first, because I believe that the larger farmers will follow, if there is a sound economy created on the smaller farms.</P>
    <P>On that point, I should like to know from the Minister whether there is a limit to the amount of credit which can be made available through the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the purchase of sows which would enable small farmers to go into pig production right away.  I know there are formalities to be complied with, and possibly a farmer desiring to go into pig production may have to wait a short time in order that a sow can be made available to him.  I believe many small farmers would be prepared to avail of that very useful scheme through the Pigs Marketing Board, if they were assured of a ready market for all the pigs produced on their farms.</P>
    <P>When I speak about production on these small farms, I feel that farmers there should concentrate on producing their own food for those pigs.  It will hardly be economic for them, if they have to purchase certain classes of food from the neighbouring farmers in order to feed these pigs, because neighbouring farmers will expect, naturally, to make a profit on those crops and it will only be the surplus that will be put on the market for those small farmers.</P>
    <P>Most of our farms are understocked, and I was glad to hear from the Minister that he is going to start a vigorous campaign asking farmers to devise whatever means may be possible to increase the number of cattle.  It is obvious that even if we had twice the number of cattle we have at present, we have a ready sale&mdash;only across the water&mdash;for all the cattle we can produce. It takes some years for that population to be brought up, but the sooner the farmers start to increase the number of live stock on their land, including cattle and sheep, the better for the country.  We have to depend on the farmers because our industries are earning by their exports only a small proportion of our national income at the present time.  In the face of world competition, we cannot expect <Col N="977" /> our infant industries to go into the traditional markets to sell the goods produced here in our own factories but, indeed, some of our manufacturers are going into the foreign markets successfully.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the past few years we see that the real change in agricultural policy took place when the present Minister took responsibility. It began with the 1948 Trade Agreement with Great Britain which took the place of the 1938 Trade Agreement Agreement.  The 1938 Trade Agreement between Great Britain and this country was too long in force and resulted in the farmers here selling their cattle at depressed prices during the war when there was a really strong demand for them in a free market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no free market during the war.  The Ministry of Food was buying from 1941 onwards. Do not confuse matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; they were buying under the 1938 Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices were fixed by the Ministry of Food.  It was not a free market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, the point I am making is this: until we got the 1948 Trade Agreement we were selling cattle very cheaply to Great Britain, and, when the 1948 Trade Agreement was completed, there was a very sudden increase in the price of cattle. That is the argument I am making.  If we had a trade agreement between this country and Great Britain sooner than 1948, it is probable that our balance of trade would have been much better.  On this issue, when we hear the Fianna Fáil people talking about the balance of trade, let us remember that when our total volume of agricultural exports amounted to £40,000,000, in 1947, the adverse trade balance was £30,000,000.  That was three-quarters of our total volume of agricultural exports for that year.  If we took our agricultural exports at £120,000,000 now and brought our adverse trade balance up to £90,000,000, it would be far more serious than it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="978" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is not serious now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good news from Deputy Rooney.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out that it is foolish for Fianna Fáil to talk about the balance of trade between this country and Great Britain at present, while they forget their own situation in 1947.</P>
      <P>In addition to the large amount of fertile land we have in this country, we must remember that the Dillon scheme, as it is known, has increased the number of fertile acres of land here by 1,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The figures show that almost 1,000,000 acres of land have now been rehabilitated under the Dillon scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have 1,000,000 acres producing which were not producing before but, unfortunately, this land is producing for home consumption, and we will have to bring about a change in the scheme.  The people who are producing on that rehabilitated land can concentrate on producing live stock and crops, which can be exported, so that we will then get the real return that was anticipated from the land that has been drained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there are many farmers who are not fully aware of the many useful grants which are available to them and, in that respect, I believe their growing organisations such as the Young Farmers, Muintir na Tíre and the National Farmers Association, could be a great help, if they pointed out to them the advantages of these grants and the results obtainable from them in the matter of improving <Col N="979" /> farm conditions.  Very frequently, farmers only discover they could have got a grant for carrying out certain farm building work, say, or some other amenity, when the job has been completed.  I feel it would be better if the farmers knew these grants were available because it might encourage them to do the work sooner rather than wait until they could afford to do the work themselves.</P>
    <P>The greatest change which has taken place in this country since the present Minister for Agriculture took office in 1948 has been in the grain market.  Before 1948, farmers were being forced to grow wheat at 55/- a barrel whether they liked it or not. That was the highest price they ever got until the present Minister took office.  The price of wheat from that year on was stepped up according to the price of wheat obtaining on the world market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>By what amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It went up by £1 a barrel during the time the present Minister for Agriculture was in office, from 1948 to 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>£1 a barrel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rooney is entitled to speak without interruption.  If it is desired to challenge what he says, that can be done by some other Deputy afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to say that the farmers were being compelled to grow wheat at 55/- a barrel prior to 1948.  At that time, they were getting an average of, I think, four barrels per acre.  That shows they were getting a very small return per acre for wheat at that time.  No attempt was previously made to give the farmers any guidance which would enable them to increase the amount of wheat that could be produced per acre on their land so as to give them a better return per acre. In 1948, the ground limestone scheme was started.  The liming of the land meant that farmers got a greater quantity of wheat from a smaller acreage of land.  In addition, they got the extra prices which were given at <Col N="980" /> that time by the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Similarly, we have had a situation where the farmers were forced to sell malting barley at 35/- a barrel.  When malting barley was sold at that price, the balance of our requirements was being imported at £4 4s. a barrel. When that system of forcing farmers to sell malting barley at 35/- a barrel was abolished by the present Minister, the price immediately went up to over £4 a barrel and the farmers got the advantage of the very sudden rise in barley prices during those years.  The prices of grains, particularly on the world market, have since fallen.</P>
      <P>The fall in the grain prices on the world market has certainly had its effect even in this country because, when the grain prices are related to the cost of animal feeding, it certainly makes things difficult for us in the world market.  I hope that, during the coming year, efforts will be made to convince the farmers that animal feeding produced on their own land is just as good, and perhaps better, than animal feeding produced outside this country.  When, in years past, animal feeding could be obtained cheaply by this country there was an argument in favour of it but, in view of the change in currencies in other countries and the monetary cost of these feeding stuffs now, it is no longer economic to use those imported feeding staffs compared with the relatively high prices of our own feeding stuffs.  For that reason, I feel we could use our own feeding stuffs although, on present costs, the finished article resulting from the use of our own feeding stuffs may be rather high in price and difficult to get into the foreign market.</P>
      <P>The credit facilities available to farmers at the moment are not sufficient. It is too difficult at the moment for farmers to obtain the necessary credit to enable them to engage actively in agriculture and particularly to enable them to increase their stocks as quickly as possible, whether it be a greater crop of grain or extra pigs, poultry or cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister to improve the system of credit facilities for farmers.  Most <Col N="981" /> farmers need only short-term credit. The Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash; as it functions at present, anyway&mdash; is found to be rather cumbersome by many farmers who desire a certain amount of capital to increase the stock on the farm.  I do not know what alternative there is but certainly the majority of farmers are not able to avail of the advantages which could be obtained from the credit facilities given at the moment by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  There is in the Department a scheme whereby farmers are enabled to purchase machinery over a long term which would, in the long run, pay for itself and enable the farmers to produce crops more economically.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of land in this country which is fit only for sheep feeding and sheep farming.  There, again, a lot of that land is derelict.  If we could arrange in some way to increase our sheep flocks it would be a great help. Examining the figures, we can see that, since the war, the number of sheep has increased considerably. They cannot be increased as rapidly as our pig population but I feel that if the farmers were encouraged to engage in sheep farming, especially on what might be described as marginal land, we could get the increase which we desire.</P>
    <P>We must depend on the agricultural organisations in the matter of scientific education for farmers.  The Department of Agriculture has a job of work to do at present.  I feel that the only extra activity in which the Department of Agriculture could engage, with advantage to the farmers, would be the gathering of costings even if they are not reliable and not accurate, so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>It would be a great help if the Department of Agriculture could gather from other countries, where there is scientific and modern agricultural production, statistics which might be useful for the guidance of any organisation which would be prepared to undertake the preparation of costings. I feel that most farmers do know what it costs them to produce a particular article on the farm.  I think <Col N="982" /> that is a very great disadvantage.  In particular, when the question of marketing arises, they do not know accurately whether they are making a profit or not, or whether they are wasting their time by pursuing the methods under which these various items of produce are produced on the farm.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Agriculture went to the trouble of getting these costings from countries well known for efficient agricultural production, it would be a great advantage to our farmers. Certainly there would be the terms of reference there and there would be the main items which are to be included in any calculation of costings. Having got those things, the other aspects peculiar to our own climate and country could be taken into consideration in order to arrive at a reasonable accurate figure.</P>
    <P>I do not see, so far as agriculture is concerned, that we can arrive at any exact figure for costings, because there are so many aspects to be taken into consideration, climate not being the least of them.  For that reason, I feel that the Department could be of great help to the farmers, if they would get that information.  The voluntary farmers' organisations could do their part by carrying out various local experiments and schemes for the guidance of farmers.  I feel that in these days our farmers must be given the advantage of all the scientific advice that can be made available.  For that reason, I ask whether it would be possible for the Department of Agriculture, the farmers' organisations or the committees of agriculture to make lectures available in every national school in this country.</P>
    <P>The national school is a centre at which people can gather.  In these days the farmer should have the advantage of scientific advice and also the results of experiments.  The national school would be the most suitable place at which those lectures could be given.  In certain areas farmers have the advantage of certain lecturers or, perhaps, pictures which can be made available through the various committees of agriculture.  I think that in other countries farmers <Col N="983" /> are encouraged to come to various centres for the purpose of doing specified courses.  They might be anything&mdash; they might be courses on the production of pigs or courses regarding poultry production, or anything else.  I feel that the local national school would be the best centre in which that scientific advice could be made available to our farmers.  In these days, with transport so very much improved, the farmers would not find it so difficult to attend those lectures as they might have found it in the past.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the question of milk costings, I feel that there has been too much misguided agitation regarding the matter.  The commission, as we know, was set up by the previous Minister for Agriculture.  It was set up as an independent body between the farmers and the Government.  On previous occasions, when the price of milk was to be adjusted, it was a matter for direct negotiation between the Government and the creamery milk suppliers, but in 1952 the previous Minister for Agriculture decided that no longer would the Government negotiate the price with the creamery milk suppliers; that, instead, they would pass the work to this milk costings commission.</P>
    <P>It was expected that the milk costings commission could give a report which would be satisfactory both to the farmers and the Government.  There is a feeling, however, that the milk costings commission were not given a free hand in this matter of calculating costs; that they were told by the previous Government what costs were to be taken into consideration and what aspects were not to be considered, when these costs were being calculated. For that reason, there is a feeling amongst the milk producers that the report of the costings commission is not going to be to their advantage, having regard to all aspects of milk costings.</P>
    <P>However, the present Minister for Agriculture took over a position where the milk costings commission were already functioning.  They were already getting the data which was to be put together in order that the cost of milk production could be arrived at.  There is a very big difference between the <Col N="984" /> cost of milk production in the creamery areas and the cost of producing loose milk for sale and the conditions under which it is produced.  All those aspects have to be taken into consideration when the approximate final cost is to be arrived at.  It is doubtful whether in the long run the report of the costings commission will be satisfactory to the farmers or to the Government, but in any case they have been asked to do a job, even if they have not been given a free hand to do it.</P>
    <P>They have been given a free hand to some extent, but they have not been given an opportunity of taking every aspect of costings into consideration, so that a final figure can be arrived at. The milk producers are certainly becoming impatient and now there is a feeling that, perhaps, the various farmers' organisations could do their part in trying to prepare milk costings which could be put side by side with the costings being prepared by the commission.</P>
    <P>In any case, I think there is a feeling on the part of the Government that it is time for a result to come, whether it be good or bad for the farmers. Certainly, it will give the farmers an opportunity then of examining whether every aspect of costings that should be taken into consideration was considered.  It will give them an opportunity of making their own case regarding the cost of milk production. In previous times there were direct negotiations between the milk producers and the Government.  That was hardly satisfactory either, because before the war, I think, the creamery milk suppliers were forced to take something around 6½d. a gallon for milk and it was certainly an uneconomic price even at that time.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I say that we witnessed the present Minister for Agriculture giving great leadership to the farmers from 1948 to 1951?  He championed their cause and he was very successful during those years, particularly because he changed the policy in regard to agriculture.  That policy has since been pursued and we have other problems to face now because we are in a world where we are settling down to peace conditions and more difficult competition in world markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> The population of the world is increasing, I believe, at the rate of 20,000,000 persons per year.  Modern agricultural science has enabled various countries to increase the amount of food made available for that extra number of people but I feel that this fertile land we have should enable us to do our part in producing food for those extra 20,000,000 people in the world.  I doubt if there is any other country with only one person, man, woman or child, for every three acres there are.  For that reason, I believe if the benefits of agricultural science were brought to our farmers and modern methods were introduced we could participate in a huge volume of exports.</P>
    <P>The real problem for farmers at the present time is the difficulty of marketing surplus produce and it is a problem that must be tackled immediately.  The Minister should examine the various classes of produce from the farms of this country which, from one year to another, show a surplus which causes the farmers to accept a price below the cost of production, discourages them and upsets the consistent production of any particular crop.  When the Minister has examined these classes of produce I feel he should then set about devising a scheme for the marketing of that produce in order to steady prices.  The rise and fall of prices and inconsistent fluctuations are the worst things that can happen farmers from one year to another or from one season to another.  If a proper system of marketing could be devised the Minister would bring to the farmers that great measure of security which they need and which will strengthen the confidence they have in him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important Votes, as far as the welfare of our nation is concerned, to come up for discussion here.  We have been listening since this debate opened to a number of criticisms and also to a number of defences by the members of the Government Party.  The first thing that the Minister in charge of the Department of Agriculture, let it be <Col N="986" /> the present Minister or his predecessor, would be expected to do is to take stock of what we were able to consume in our own country.  If we are importing goods which we are capable of producing at home, then that Minister should see that that importation should cease and that we would not import even a pound's worth of goods if we were capable of producing it ourselves.</P>
      <P>Not alone should the Department of Agriculture not be the plaything of various political Parties but it should have a national outlook, giving farmers encouragement to proceed along certain lines so that they could be confident that a change of Government would not be responsible for upsetting their planning.  That view was adopted under the Fianna Fáil administration. We believe in producing first the foods for which we have a market here, namely, wheat, beet and various other items in regard to which I will not go into detail.  In regard to wheat and beet we believed in producing them here because we knew we had a market for them.  We wanted then to carry on and produce many other commodities which we were importing heretofore.  We hear a great deal of talk about our adverse trade balance and if any Minister for Agriculture insists on importing what we are capable of producing at home I hold that that Minister is doing the country harm.  The Department of Agriculture should act as an adviser to our farmers and say to them: &ldquo;Grow a certain amount of wheat, beet, oats and barley.  You have a market for it.&rdquo; Then the Department of Agriculture could go further and, through their advisers here and their representatives abroad, try to get a market abroad for our surplus produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the smaller countries throughout the world that have succeeded in building up their agricultural economy, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, have approached the problem completely from the national viewpoint and they were able to tell their farmers how much should be produced for export.  Here our farmers during the last few years did not really know how they stood.  The change of Government was often responsible for <Col N="987" /> a change of opinion as to what should and what should not be grown.  In 1948 we had the experience that our farmers were told to give up wheat and to grow oats instead.  We found that the whole country was glutted with oats whereas there was a market for our wheat at that time as there still is.</P>
    <P>If we are to go ahead and survive as a nation, the whole approach to our agricultural industry must be altered and our farmers will have to get greater assurances of markets.  They will have to be encouraged to grow at least the commodities which can be consumed at home, that is, animal food or human food.  When we have reached peak point in that respect, we shall be on the road to doing something worth while for this nation.  It is easy enough to stand up here and, for political reasons, throw stones, but I regard this whole matter as too serious; the time has passed for bandying words here or playing about irresponsibly with the situation.  If we do not develop the main industry by every means in our power the country will not survive.  Other small countries have succeeded in developing agriculture and I do not see why we cannot do so.</P>
    <P>Many times I have defended certain farming interests.  I did so for one reason only, that I took the national view.  I have been misrepresented here because I have indicated that certain goods were too dear.  The position to-day is that there is an adverse trade balance of over £109,000,000.  We import goods for which we have the raw material here.  There is a great potential in the arable land of this country.</P>
    <P>A German economist said that if the people of Holland had the land of Ireland they would feed the world.  Our farmers are as clever as the farmers of any other country and all they want is a lead from the Department.  I have the honour to represent an area where there are the best farmers in Europe. The Minister for Agriculture should indicate the line of production the farmers should adopt and tell them the quantities for which there is a home market.  Then, if the farmers produce a surplus, the export market should be developed.  Our trade representatives <Col N="988" /> abroad should be able to indicate the commodities that other countries will take from us.  In that way, agricultural output can be stepped up with advantage to the national economy.</P>
    <P>Agriculture should be dealt with on a national basis.  It must not be dealt with on the narrow basis of what Deputy Dillon or Deputy Walsh did Every Minister for Agriculture in this country has done his best, but I maintain that the Fianna Fáil policy was the best policy for the Irish farmer and was gradually building up agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney said that farmers were compelled to grow wheat.  The farmers of Ireland knew that it was essential during the emergency period to grow wheat so that the people might survive.  There is no comparison between the emergency period and the present time.  During the emergency, it was a case of trying to feed the people, even on a ration, and anything that was done was done in the national interest.  Deputy Rooney's comment is not worthy of a reply.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which I am concerned is disease in corn crops, tomatoes, mushrooms and fruit.  I have put down questions in the House directing the attention of the Minister to the necessity of setting up a research laboratory in a centre in or about Dublin.  While the secretary of the county committee of agriculture and the instructors are doing a very good job in my constituency, nevertheless, the farmers must get immediate assistance when disease makes its appearance in corn crops, root crops, tomatoes or mushrooms.  The diagnosis should not be delayed for a fortnight or three weeks, when the harm may have been done.  Farmers and the nation are losing a great deal as a result of disease, even in cereal crops. There are hundreds of acres of tomato houses in County Dublin.  A number of market gardeners and farmers have developed mushroom growing.  Sometimes disease sets in in mushrooms.</P>
    <P>In one case where disease appeared in the mushrooms, although the officers of the Minister's Department did everything they could to eliminate the disease, a man who had gone to a great deal of expense in connection <Col N="989" /> with mushroom growing was completely put out of business.  In another case one acre of tomatoes were destroyed by disease.  The Minister's advisers have done their best but there is an urgent necessity to set up a research laboratory which would help in the elimination of disease in horticultural and agricultural production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>He is there and he is doing his job well but he has not <Col N="990" /> got the scientific methods to help him along.  Up to ten years ago, very few tomatoes and fewer mushrooms were grown in this country.  Up to 1940 there was very little fruit grown in comparison with the present time.  The enlargement of production in this field calls for greater scientific research in order to combat the increased numbers of diseases affecting production.  I think an immediate speed-up of the testing of crops for diseases is essential. The chief agricultural officer for County Dublin is a very efficient man but he could do a lot more work if he had the help of the Department in combating fruit and plant diseases.  I should like if the Minister gave an early decision to lend such a hand to county committees of agriculture so that these diseases could be counteracted in the same way as action has been taken against cattle disease at Abbotstown and elsewhere.  I believe we should speed up this disease testing, particularly in the tomato growing industry.  First of all, it is essential to find out what is responsible for these diseases.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about his parish agents, each of whom will serve three parishes.  I think he should consider the establishment of a research station under each county committee of agriculture in order that plant diseases might be eliminated and production accordingly increased.  We are covering very little ground in this direction at the moment and, the sooner we find out exactly what is responsible for tomato and fruit diseases, the more we will be encouraging people to go in for greater production of these crops throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker made reference to our pig population and, like many other speakers on the opposite side, he picked out 1947 when he was dealing with the position.  That has been the practice of Coalition speakers down along the line.  Everybody knows that in 1946 and in 1947 we had the worst harvests, winters and springs for 50 years.  In 1946 we had the big harvest campaign during which 84,000 people from Dublin went out to help the farmers of Dublin and five other counties. Following that harvest, you had a very bad winter and spring and the <Col N="991" /> result was that the ensuing harvest was also very bad.  Thousands of cattle and sheep died all over the country.  Accordingly, I cannot understand why the Coalition speakers take this mean, low political advantage of picking the worst seasons we had in living memory.  We were lucky that the farmers of the country survived those two years.  We have not had such bad weather since and I would ask Coalition speakers to try and find some new tune to play because they have played out that one.</P>
    <P>Frequently farmers have to contend with great difficulties because of bad harvest and spring weather and I should like to see that easier credit facilities were made available to them to tide them over difficult periods.  At the moment, they find great difficulty in getting credit at all without very substantial securities.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation was established with a view to helping farmers but in my opinion the Agricultural Credit Corporation look for too substantial a security for loans.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a good deal about pig production.  When I was a child, everybody in the country, particularly the poorer people, reared pigs.  To-day very few people produce them.  Some years ago it was part of the economy of rural Ireland to rear a few pigs and I would like to see the Department of Agriculture making an all-out endeavour to revive that economy.  The Minister should make it part of his policy to encourage widespread pig production by letting people know that a good market exists for them.  It is the Department's job to encourage that kind of production instead of to criticise those who engage in it.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been voiced about the administration of the grants for the reconstruction of farm outbuildings. A farmer recently told me that he reconstructed a farm outhouse at a cost of £300.  After inspection, he got a grant of £40.  I believe that owing to changing circumstances much bigger grants should be available to encourage people to reconstruct their farm outhouses.  That was the object which Deputy Smith had in mind when as Minister for Agriculture he introduced <Col N="992" /> that scheme.  He also had in mind the necessity to house farm animals properly.  Therefore, I think greater grants would give greater encouragement to farmers to increase their production.</P>
    <P>During a dry summer and harvest, cattle often get diseases from drinking bad water.  I would suggest that a lot of bovine diseases come from the consumption of bad water by cattle. A Tipperary Deputy at one time always advocated proper water supplies for animals as well as for human beings.  I agree with him and I would suggest that action should be taken by the Department of Agriculture to encourage farmers to put down proper pumps on their land.  I think that proper water supplies would give healthier herds of cattle and would accordingly increase production.  For that reason alone, I would press the Minister to be more generous in giving grants in order to enable farmers to have proper water supplies for their live stock and not have the cattle drinking from old water holes which are often responsible for cattle dying.</P>
    <P>Some few years ago, the Minister made an effort, about which we heard a good deal, to drown the English people in eggs.  When we had nobody to encourage it, our egg production was better than it is to-day; and I often wondered what was the reason for that. In the old days, the way of living of the people, especially in the small farms, was that they sold their eggs, butter and pigs.  We seem to have centralised this industry of egg production and the people who used to engage in it in every cottage and small farm seem to have given it up completely. The Department should try to encourage our people to go back to the production of eggs on the lines on which it was carried out in their mother's time or their grandmother's time.  As I say, at that time, we had no advice on egg production and we were completely under an alien Government; yet we seemed to do it better than we are doing to-day.  I think it is a reflection on us here.</P>
    <P>I did not get an opportunity of defending the farmers of County Dublin against a statement made by the <Col N="993" /> Minister for Agriculture that there was a number of farmers in County Dublin who were wheat ranchers. There are a number of progressive farmers in County Dublin with sufficient business acumen to grow any crop that will pay them best, and that is really what happened.  As far as the growing of wheat in County Dublin is concerned, that was done to produce more wheat and it was done on purely economic grounds by intelligent farmers.  It was implied here that these farmers were starving their land, but they did not do any such thing. They treasured their land because they knew what it could produce.  The sooner these irresponsible statements, maligning farmers and saying hard thing about them in this House, are given up, the better.  It is not good for the country.  If the Minister, or any successive Minister, feels that production of a certain kind is being abused, he can make a statement about it.  In every community, you may have certain people&mdash;maybe one or two&mdash;who may take advantage of a certain thing, but the majority of our farmers are intelligent enough to take advantage of some crop that will pay best, and nobody can blame them for doing that.  That is all the farmers in County Dublin did at that period, and, coming after a reasonably bad harvest, they took a very poor view of the fact that the price of wheat was cut down. That was responsible for disheartening them and it disheartened them so considerably that a number of them will not go back to tillage production and the growing of wheat again.  These are most serious matters.  If you destroy the confidence of any section of the community which is doing something worth while, then you are in trouble and you will find that they will not easily go back to that production again.  I am sure that that is what is happening, not alone in County Dublin, but in the remainder of the country.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to discuss is the production of fruit.  We are still importing certain fruit, and I would like to see if we could produce more of our own fruit here.  I should like to see the Department of Agriculture and the county committees of agriculture <Col N="994" /> encouraging our people to grow the fruit best suited to the market in this country, so that we shall not be importing from some other country fruit that we can produce here ourselves.</P>
    <P>Dealing again with fruit trees, we have a large number of orchards in North County Dublin where the fruit trees have not been doing so well.  The soil has been tested and various other tests have been carried out by the experts of the Department of Agriculture and the county committee of agriculture. It only brings me back to the point I made at the beginning about the urgent necessity for carrying out more research in trying to eliminate disease and to increase production.  I would again ask the Minister to try to do something worth while on that score.</P>
    <P>We should step up our tomato production and particularly we should have more of our people heating their tomato houses to produce the tomatoes earlier in the year.  The Department of Agriculture should meet the tomato growers and try to formulate some scheme which will have that effect.  In that way, we would be producing our own tomatoes earlier in the year and not buying them from foreign countries. During the tomato season, we are now able to supply the whole country, and that has happened in a few years as a result of the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>I want to say finally that, in this very critical period of our history, the Minister for Agriculture has a very serious national responsibility.  He and his Department have the ball at their feet now, if they do their work properly.  For pity's sake, give up the racket of accusing Fianna Fáil of doing this, that and the other.  The policy of Fianna Fáil was that adopted by other nations in a similar position to ours and those nations succeeded in proving that they had implemented the correct economy in relation to agriculture.  The policy of Fianna Fáil was not a new policy.  It had been adopted successfully by other nations, nations which succeeded in building up their own economy.  We have made some progress here and I appeal to the Minister now to continue that progress <Col N="995" /> and improve on it, until such time as we make our agricultural industry what it should be, namely, the primary industry essential to give our people a good standard of living and redress our balance of payments position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene very briefly indeed in this debate. Having regard to his opening statement and after a full study of the notes circulated in relation to the activities of his Department, one cannot help being impressed by the vast field of activity which the Minister has to survey and the magnificent manner in which these activities have been and are being carried out in the most efficient possible manner.</P>
      <P>The constituency I represent is, from the farming point of view, a mixed one indeed.  Part of it fits in very normally into what might be termed the average economy of the country as a whole.  The remaining part of it consists of the congested areas, which do not fit in so well; but, nevertheless, it is heartening to observe from a survey of the activities of the Department that these congested areas are being catered for as adequately as the financial position will allow.  In fact, I would venture to say that these areas have been more than generously catered for in relation to the various schemes the Department operates.</P>
      <P>I am very keen on an agricultural bias in education, particularly in primary education.  This may well be a matter more appropriate to the Estimate for the Department of Education, but I believe that, if we give an agricultural bias, we will probably make people, particularly in the congested areas, more agriculture-minded and thereby give them the impetus to form a resolution to use the little bit of land at their disposal more effectively and therefore more productively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that affects my constituency is the peat land experimental station at Glenamoy.  I referred to this on a Supplementary Estimate for the Department a short time ago. From my observation of the station and the way in which the work is proceeding there, not alone has the Minister an excellent supervisory <Col N="996" /> staff, but he has the goodwill and cooperation of the people, too.  I do not think he overestimates the future when he says that this has great possibilities indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said the Minister has a serious national responsibility.  Of course he has.  So have all other Ministers in their respective Departments. Other people have serious national responsibilities, too.  From that point of view, I would like to comment on a matter which has arisen in this debate in relation to the publication in newspapers, principally the <i>Irish Press,</i> of comment and headlines concerning cattle prices and the state of agriculture generally.  I think the Minister has done the <i>Irish Press,</i> if that organ is prepared to listen to him seriously, a great service, because he may possibly bring those who control it to a realisation of the fact that they have a very serious national responsibility. It is one thing to report news; it is another thing to report it with comment, comment by way of the physical nature of the presentation of the news, and scare headlines imply in themselves comment.  Comment is all right in the editorial or on the part of special correspondents; but, in my respectful opinion, news should be printed impartially and not carry with it any sort of implied criticism.  I read these articles myself in the <i>Irish Press</i> and I could not help feeling that each headline carried implications that the present Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, were responsible for the fall in cattle prices and it was because this Government were in office that cattle prices had gone down.</P>
    <P>That kind of thing is bound to affect people and these slogans are bound to have a more far-reaching effect than the voice of the Minister himself asking the people to keep calm and hold their cattle.  Time has proved, of course, that the Minister was more than justified in giving that advice.  It is an elementary principle of economics that, when there is a period of trial or stress, when markets are unsteady and we are struggling to keep our place, the old advice is always the best: &ldquo;Don't shake the boat.&rdquo;  If the <i>Irish Press</i> and those who are responsible for the presentation of the news <Col N="997" /> in it could appreciate and follow that advice, they would have a greater sense of national responsibility towards their public.  Possibly from this debate some good will emerge, namely, to make people like that appreciate that they have a national responsibility rather than a Party one.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his staff are to be complimented on their activity.  I want to say a special word in praise of the Minister's outdoor staff, the men in the country who have vast areas to cover, who do outdoor inspection and field surveys and who have, in addition, an enormous amount of clerical work to do.  When people complain about officials not being up to the mark and not showing the efficiency and speed they think ought to be shown, I think they lose sight of what the work entails.  It is only when one knows all the difficulties involved in combining field survey, inspection and travel with clerical work that one can appreciate the difficulties under which these men work.  Speaking for my constituency, I am satisfied that the officials in charge of the various activities relative to the Department of Agriculture are giving excellent service indeed.</P>
    <P>So much has been said about this Estimate that there is very little left that one can say with effect, but I want to join with Deputy Burke in saying that these matters are serious national responsibilities and there should be no ramps about them.  The people creating the biggest ramps of all are the Opposition themselves.  It is a feature of Irish life to try to down the other fellow at every opportunity, but the Opposition should say to themselves that they are in opposition, recognise that fact, and offer constructive criticism.  Nothing will be achieved by destructive criticism.  It is better to acknowledge the facts and play your part as a constructive Opposition and give advice.  During the life of this Parliament, and particularly in relation to the Department of Agriculture, which is the principal Department of State, everybody should play his full part in offering the best advice possible and not be annoyed when that advice is rejected after being fully considered.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, I wish to <Col N="998" /> compliment the Minister and to wish him well, not alone in the forthcoming year, but for the remaining years of his office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this annual debate on the Agriculture Estimate, I take it, is to enable the Minister to review the position in agriculture, to refer to any new schemes he may have introduced during the past year and to show the House to what extent they have been successful. It also provides an opportunity for Deputies on both sides of the House to offer criticism of the manner in which the Minister has discharged his responsibilities. I presume that criticism should be helpful and constructive.</P>
      <P>The constituency which I represent is mainly a dairying constituency.  The majority of the people derive their means of livelihood from dairy farming.  I propose to devote my contribution to this debate to certain of the problems that confront dairy farmers at the moment.  During the course of the debate on the Vote on Account, both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce stressed the need for increased production and increased exports in order to correct the balance of trade and the balance of payments position.  The Minister for Agriculture, for some time, has been advising farmers to keep more cows.  He has asked the man with five cows to keep seven, the man with ten to keep 14 and the man with 20 to keep 28.  That is sound advice, but I wonder is it realised that in the dairy districts we are already fully stocked.  In fact, there are some dairy farmers who are overstocked.  There is not much hope, then, for expansion in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I think that, as a prerequisite to increased production, the farmer should be given an assurance of an economic price for his existing milk supply and for the increased supply available, if he can add those extra cows.  There are people who put forward the view that the farmer can increase his income by stepping up production per cow.  These people forget the fact that we have accepted in this country the dual purpose Shorthorn cow as the most suited to our needs. <Col N="999" /> You cannot have it both ways.  We want beef and we want milk, and that type of cow is giving us both meat and milk.  The present Minister and the previous Minister both approved of that type of cow.</P>
    <P>Those people who believe that the farmer can step up production per cow say to the man who has ten, 15 or 20 cows: why not have all 800 to 1,000 gallon cows?  We know from practical experience that, while you might have an odd cow with a yield of up to 800 gallons, it is really a rare thing in the average bawn.  You have the man in the town or village who keeps two, three or four cows.  They are pampered and hand-fed and the plot of ground on which they graze is fully fertilised with ground limestone and superphosphates, etc.  That man is concerned only with filling the bucket. He is not concerned so much about profit and loss, because that business of keeping these cows is a mere sideline with him.  The Minister made no reference in his opening speech to the question of an economic price for milk and I hope that, when concluding, he will touch on that vital question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of an economic price for milk.  I am speaking about the creamery areas.  A good deal has been said about the commission which was set up in 1952.  Farmers are disappointed that they have not so far received the report of the activities of that commission.  They expected it well in advance of the present milk season.  That commission was to determine what would be an economic price per gallon for milk delivered to creameries.  That was the purpose for which that commission was set up, and I wonder if, even at this late hour, there is anything that can be done to expedite its report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that there should be a permanent costings body that would determine well in advance each year what may be regarded as a fair price for milk, both in the creamery areas and in the cities and towns.  This matter of bargaining and haggling between <Col N="1000" /> the farming representatives and the Minister is hardly the proper way to approach this problem.  Why should the farmer have to go hat in hand to anybody?  The industrialist has at his disposal expert costings systems in regard to his manufactured goods.  He has to determine the net price at which he can dispose of them in order to leave himself a profit.  I think the farmer is entitled to the same service.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I am sure it is accepted that agriculture is the greatest factor in our national economy, but there are people in this country yet who are not sure about that.  After more than 30 years of native Government, during which every effort has been made to develop our industrial arm and increase industrial exports, the experts have now apparently decided that, in the main, we have to depend on agriculture.  In our agricultural economy, the basic producer is the dairy cow.  From the dairy cow we get the store beast as well as the milk products.</P>
    <P>It might be asked where are we to sell the products of our dairy cows? If we convert the milk into butter, we have no market for it across Channel. The chocolate crumb industry seems to be in danger of collapse.  What else have we?  We have cheese and so on. That is all very fine, but something will have to be done about it, or otherwise the whole agricultural economy will collapse.  If the remedy is to subsidise the export of butter, that must be done.  The New Zealand farmer can sell his butter in the English market at lower prices than those at which we can sell it.  I do not know how that is achieved, but I presume it is through subsidies.  Of course, I know the New Zealand farmer has grass almost the whole year round.</P>
    <P>Coming to that question of grass, I think we now recognise that grass must be looked upon as a crop in the same way as corn or any other cereal.</P>

      <P>We are very much behind the times in so far as grass culture is concerned.  It might possibly provide a solution of the vexed question <Col N="1001" /> of milk prices, if we could extend the grass season here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now not more than from 1st May to say, 1st December, at the most.  If that grass season could be extended, say, from 1st April to 20th December, it might give us that extra yield, or at least it might give us the 600 gallon cow and maintain, at the same time, the dual purpose animal.  What is the position at the moment?  The farmer has to feed his cattle certain concentrates during the spring.  He has to keep them in the pound or stand until 1st May, because he cannot afford to let them out in whatever fresh grass is available during April, because, when they have that consumed, their milk supply drops immediately.  Intensive grass cultivation is the only way a solution can be found to that problem, by making available to the farmers scientific experts who will show them, by proper seeding and so on, how to get deep down into this question, in every sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sent you down two or three parish agents in your constituency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my view, and I think, as we are on the question, the parish agent or whatever expert is available, should also include in his programme a visit to the national school.  If he could attend the national school, say, one day a week and take the children out and give a demonstration, it would be a great help.  In my young days at school, the only instruction we got was through weeding the master's garden.  The parish agent could instil into the minds of the children a greater love for country life and agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter the parish agent could advise on is composting.  We know there are two schools of thought on this question of fertilisers.  There is the believer in the compost fertiliser <Col N="1002" /> and the man who is entirely on the artificial side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy distinguish between compost and farmyard manure&mdash;dung?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>What I mean is the manufacture of compost through what we call yard muck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, in order to get that, you must make machinery available.  You will not get workmen to collect that at present.  You will have to have what we call a muck gatherer and the farmer must be instructed about the value of manures. Liquid manure, for instance, at the present time, is allowed to flow down the drains, instead of being trapped by vegetable waste and so on.  There is also ground limestone.  There is a scientific way of doing these things and most farmers do not seem to understand the value of that at the present time, so that the parish agent could help very much in that respect.</P>
      <P>Coming back to this question of the 1,000 gallon cow, that type of animal would seem to be out of the question as far as I can see on the ordinary dairy farm.  Even people who profess to speak on behalf of agriculture do not seem to understand that completely. One might as well say that a blood-stock breeder should make sure that all the fillies are going to be &ldquo;Pretty Pollys&rdquo; or &ldquo;Melds&rdquo; and that all the colts should be stepped up to the Tulyar or Panaslipper standard.  That cannot be done.  We must take the good with the bad.  We cannot have selective breeding within the confines of the herd, the dual purpose dairy herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was born in one of the largest dairy farms in the country and at one time we carried over 100 cows.  The farm had its own creamery and was completely self-contained.  I worked there in my young days and milked cows before going to school and I saw how good milkers came into existence. They were carefully selected from high milk-yielding dams.  These animals were very much sought after in the <Col N="1003" /> fairs and markets.  At that time, there was no selective breeding, no cattle breeding Acts or anything else.  It was done by the farmer, himself basing his judgment on his own experience.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to credits for farmers.  I am against people who represent the farmers as being in a depressed condition.  The farmer is not in a depressed condition.  He is not a millionaire and he is not a wealthy man; the average farmer is comfortable and he has been enjoying that prosperity for the past eight or ten years People who say otherwise are destroying the farmer's credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, they are depressing him and his family on the social scale.  When he sends his children to boarding schools or to the university they are not considered in the same class as the town man's child. They are looked upon as the children of the &ldquo;God-forsaken farmer&rdquo; down the country.  That is one of the reasons why farmers find it difficult to get credit to day from the banks and perhaps from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>We must realise that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is more or less an independent financial concern.  You get a loan for a fixed period which is repayable in half-yearly annuities.  In the case of the commercial banks, you get a short-term loan.  Somebody once said that the policy of the banks in relation to farmers is like giving out umbrellas when the sun shines and taking them back when it rains.  In the good times, the bank lends money freely and then they take the borrower by the throat when bad times come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the <i>Irish Press</i> reports on the market prices, the Minister said: &ldquo;God help the poor &lsquo;mugs&rsquo; who swallowed those reports and sold their cattle&rdquo;.  In the cattle trade, and in farming generally, you will find the shrewdest people in the world.  In my time, I have seen very few &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; knocking about either in the cattle trade or amongst the ordinary farmers. I do not believe the reports would have <Col N="1004" /> the slightest effect so far as the sales of cattle are concerned.  If the Minister's advice to hold their cattle until April had been taken, I think there would have been a glut in April which would have further depressed prices or which would, in any case, have balanced out the improvement which took place in the month of April.</P>
    <P>These are just impressions I have gained myself over many years of practical experience of farming.  I think responsible Deputies in this House should try to approach this matter in a common-sense way.  This attempt to get political kudos out of the agricultural position is unnational, as Deputy Burke said.  No matter what Minister for Agriculture may be in power, nobody will criticise him unduly if he carries out his responsibilities in a satisfactory way.  I hope the present Minister will try to end the conflict with the dairy farmers.  I am not in favour of public demonstrations.  That sort of thing seems antiquated to me. It does not seem right to see a respectable farmer leave his farm in Cork or Limerick in the early hours of the morning and come to Dublin and parade himself through the streets before people who have not the slightest understanding of what the whole thing is about.  Possibly there is a satisfactory explanation for that action by the farmers as a result of the delay in the issue of the Milk Costings Commission report.</P>
    <P>The Minister should endeavour to iron out any little antagonisms there may be so far as the dairy farmers or any other single section of the agricultural community are concerned.  It is vitally important that there should be a round-table conference between the Minister and representatives of the various farmers' organisations and, exclusive of the Milk Costings Commission altogether, they should try to arrive at a reasonable price for milk. The present price was fixed in 1953. In the interval, farmers' costings have gone up considerably as, for instance, fertilisers, machinery and wages.  The fact of the matter is that whatever price was considered economic in 1953 is not considered economic to-day.  I <Col N="1005" /> put forward these suggestions for the consideration of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I represent a constituency which is, in the main, a dairying constituency similar to that of Deputy Colbert.  I must compliment him on his very fine approach to this debate and on his speech.  His approach has been most constructive. I agree practically <i>in toto</i> with most of his remarks.  He may not have intended to be so extreme in his statement but he referred to the chocolate crumb industry and said the feeling was that the industry was collapsing.  That is the only remark he made on which I disagree with him, and I disagree very strongly with that statement.  I do not believe that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that the industry has had some troubles but certainly this year the prospects are pretty good.  The factory in my constituency in Mallow has gone into production earlier this year than it did last year.  A very big concern has a factory in the adjoining constituency of South Kerry and it derives its supply pretty well in the main from my constituency.  There, also, all the indications would point to a continuance of production.  Consequently, the fears which existed last year have fortunately not materialised.</P>
      <P>In regard to the marketing of our agricultural produce, I think tribute is due to the best market that exists for the produce of our Irish farms, that is, the market in this country.  The Irish consumer is to-day the best purchaser of Irish produce.  That is indicated by the fine market we have in this country for Irish butter.  I think it was a good day's work to reduce the price of butter and make it available to more people in order to have greater consumption at home.  By so doing, we were guaranteed a bigger market in this country and we ensured that prices would be obtained that could not be procured abroad.  At the same time we were providing an excellent food for the benefit of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a good development. <Col N="1006" /> If our standard of living to-day is such that our people are in a position to consume more and pay reasonable prices for butter, meat and the other commodities, which come off the Irish farms, then all the better for Irish agriculture.  At the same time, we must keep the spotlight on the absolute necessity of increasing our exports. That was referred to by members on both sides of the House.  At this late stage in the debate, there is little to add to what has been said about emphasising the necessity of improving those exports.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in that respect there has grown up over some years amongst farmers a fear of increasing production&mdash;a dread that if they do so prices will be reduced.  They are apt to ignore the lowering of costs that would accompany increased production.  They do not compare like with like.  At any rate, they fear that if they go all out to increase production in a particular section of agriculture, there is the danger of a collapse in prices.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has made the arrangements in relation to the pig industry because it is true there were some fears that, on the termination of the current agreement this month, the industry might run into extremely troubled times.  Over the past year there was a vacillation, or an up and down movement in regard to prices even though prices were good. When this was occurring, there was uncertainty in the industry.  I think what has been done will have an excellent stimulating effect as will the guarantee to the producer of a price for a good period, over 12 months, below which pigs cannot go.</P>
    <P>I think, furthermore, that it will remedy the situation in relation to grading that developed over the past year.  In that respect, the producers must remember they must cater for the public taste and that, not even in the rural areas to-day, will people eat the type of bacon they ate 20 years ago.  Therefore, it would be unfair to expect people in cities and towns and people abroad to consume goods which the producers themselves would not consume.  Acknowledging that, there are also widespread complaints in <Col N="1007" /> regard to grading and there have been charges of abuses.  Deputies Barry and Lynch advanced a case with which I completely concur.  I have come across throughout the country, particularly in the constituency of North Cork, statements by producers that they would not mind so much if bacon were available over the counter at a graded-down price similar to the grading-down they experienced in relation to the sale of their animals.</P>
    <P>If some method could be worked out by which there would be a clear stamp on the bacon coming into the shop, which would guarantee to the consumer that this bacon is available at a lower price, it might stimulate the market for this lower-grade bacon and at the same time ensure that the consumer would not be mulcted.  It is true that the discerning purchaser will go to the shop where he is treated fairly.  The retailer would be most unwise to abuse the situation and deprive himself of a customer by such methods but it is also true that, in rural parts, there is not the same choice in shops, so that the people have more or less got to take what is before them.  However, now that this new arrangement has been made, there is no doubt but that it will result in the removal of some of the abuses that were alleged to have taken place in recent months.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pig industry, the Minister advised producers in regard to the best means of feeding pigs with a view to securing a reasonable profit from them.  He has advised them to concentrate upon the use of feeding barley and skim milk.  There is no doubt that a new vista has opened up in that regard in recent years with the extension of the growing of feeding barley.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh, referred to the reduction in the number of pigs and later in the course of his remarks he referred to the reduction in the amount of milk going into chocolate crumb.  Perhaps, these factors are allied to each other. When the amount of milk going into chocolate crumb was at its peak, there was less skim milk available for pig <Col N="1008" /> feeding.  There is no doubt that a considerable extension in the use of feeding barley and skim milk could be brought into being in relation to the feeding of pigs.</P>
    <P>Recently efforts were made to make some progress in relation to progeny testing.  It is acknowledged that an improved strain in breeding would assist considerably in the production of a pig which would make the A grade.  I feel it is long overdue but now a start has been made to assist producers considerably in obtaining a type of pig which will be more conducive to securing the top price.  I think our farmers' organisations could assist considerably in this respect by bringing it home to their members and, through them, to the producers in general, the advantages of aiming at producing top grade bacon.</P>
    <P>I think that one bacon factory in particular is to be complimented on inviting Macra na Feirme to their firm and having there a competition.  They invited the Young Farmers to grade the live pig and then showed them, when the live pig had been slaughtered, how the exact grading is arrived at.  I think that is a good idea which could possibly be extended.  It might also be a good idea to have a short film made capable of showing the N.F.A. and Macra na Feirme the advantages to be gained by aiming at top grading.  That would be a worthwhile measure.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the course of the debate to the activities among farming organisations in recent years and their rapid development.  The N.F.A. was afforded recognition not alone by the Minister's own Department but by other Departments of State.  It would be well if that recognition were mutual.  Here and there we see extreme statements where the Department is reviled and suggestions made that alternative means should be adopted which would produce better results.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we find that in the report of the N.F.A. some very interesting tributes are paid to the Department.  It has even pointed out that, in reference to the establishment of a nitrogen factory in this country, a <Col N="1009" /> delegation was received by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that this was the first time ever that organisation of farmers was recognised and received by the Minister in that Department for a consultation in reference to that matter.  It is a good thing that that happened and it is also a good thing that the N.F.A. would place on record their appreciation of it.</P>
    <P>The N.F.A. report has also recorded that in reference to representation that was made to the Department in connection with double grants for cow byres, within 24 hours of its being brought to the notice of the Department that certain farmers had not received the double payment grants, the awards were made.  I do not think that anybody could ask for more prompt attention than that.  Further on reference is made to the information being conveyed to the Department of outbreaks of trichomoniasis and that within a few hours the Department's veterinary officers came in and started on the eradication of the complaint. These are praiseworthy occurrences and the tributes that are here to the Department from this organised farmers' body are admirable.</P>
    <P>However, I would introduce a little note of criticism of other statements made from time to time.  I cannot fathom why an organisation such as the N.F.A., which is formed with the express purpose of looking after the interests of the farming community and doing a very useful job in that respect, should avail of their movement throughout the country to express and, they say, express with some authority, doubts in relation to the setting up of the proposed oil refinery.  I think that organisations who do that, in ignorance possibly of many of the advantages that would flow from such concerns, could do harm.</P>
    <P>May I say also that circumspection is necessary at times when the Government and the Department are engaged in marketing negotiations?  With the best intentions in the world, if statements are made at that time which would receive much publicity relating to our weakness in one sphere or another, they could be very embarrassing <Col N="1010" /> for those engaged in the negotiations. The criticism that we are offering of the action of the <i>Irish Press</i> in relation to its heavy headlines on a reduction in cattle prices is particularly prompted by the fact that negotiations were in progress at that time in Britain between the British farmers and the Treasury and that one of their points in support of obtaining an increased price was the cost of store cattle in Ireland.  The fact that a national newspaper at that time carried headlines indicating a serious drop did not assist in securing the results which would be reflected in our fairs here. It is well that ultimately the price which was secured was followed by increased prices in this country.</P>
    <P>The greatest development in agriculture in this country in recent years has been the reclamation of land.  Many people who are working hard in making drains, removing scrub and fertilising are annoyed when people who are non-agriculturists charge them with not producing more.  When we look at the figures of production, we should not just regard the agriculturist as being solely engaged on productive activity. After all, he is making up for many years of neglect in the reclamation of land, the erection of out-offices, in the extension of rural electrification, in improvements to his farmyard and in the eradication of T.B. from his herds.  All these activities demand an extraordinary amount of attention and endeavour from the farmer, his family and his worker and also considerable capital outlay.  All praise is due to the fine State assistance that has come to each one of those projects.</P>
    <P>When people stand up reading papers before chambers of commerce and other arenas and speak slightingly of the agricultural community as being a section that are not pulling their weight in the national effort, they completely ignore these facts.  There is no doubt but that it is an epic achievement if, at the end of this year, we can claim to have rehabilitated 1,000,000 acres of land.  When one considers what land means to us in this country, the addition of that acreage to our productive activity is bound to have wonderful results in the course of a <Col N="1011" /> short time.  If the results are not yet apparent one must realise that the good effects will not come overnight, that very few people have succeeded in completely reclaiming that part of their holding which requires reclamation.</P>
    <P>It is not, I am sure, an exaggeration to say that the land project has changed the whole face of the country.  The first effect, to my mind, was social in its impact.  Down in my own part of the country, in regard to the progressive young farmer taking over any farm which heretofore had not provided him or his family with anything like a reasonable income, from the time he got any influence in the management of the farm his eyes were on the faroff hills.  He has never had any ambition other than to set aside as much money as he could, looking forward to the day when he could move out into better land.  That was his ambition and there was no incentive to him to improve the holding which he then had.  He moved away 40 or 50 miles into a new community and he was then faced with overheads that he had not experienced previously, higher valuations, higher rates, and he was living where, quite possibly, people had very different methods and, in many cases, he very much missed the old system of neighbourliness that he enjoyed where he formerly lived.</P>
    <P>Now that man can improve his own holding to a very considerable extent. In many cases farms that were incapable of providing a living for more than one member of the family are now doing so and will provide even more than that in the future.  That is a good thing and the results that flow from it will be very effective inasmuch as it is being done without displacing anybody else.  The man who lived in his own place and went away and bought better land was just taking up where somebody else left off.  In the kind of land which is being reclaimed, refertilised and brought into production, the most of it for the first time, the remainder to a negligible extent, whatever increased production will flow from it will come from land that formerly, if producing anything <Col N="1012" /> was producing a negligible amount.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General Mac Eoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide the necessary legislation in relation to prisoners of war and enemy aliens so as to enable, so far as Ireland is concerned, effect to be given to and advantage taken of certain of the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war and of the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war which were signed on behalf of Ireland at Geneva in December, 1949.  The conventions had, earlier in that year, been drawn up at a diplomatic conference, at which this country was represented, convened at Geneva by the Swiss Federal Council.</P>
      <P>The first mentioned, or Prisoners of War Convention, enumerates the categories of persons who, on falling into the power of the enemy, are prisoners of war and entitled to treatment as such.  It regulates, in a most detailed manner, the treatment of prisoners of war under the headings of: (i) protection; (ii) conditions of captivity and internment (including quarters, food and clothing; hygiene and medical attention; religious, intellectual and physical activities; discipline; transfer; work; financial resources and communication with the exterior); (iii) relations with the authorities (including complaints and representations); (iv) penal and disciplinary sanctions; (v) termination of captivity.</P>
      <P>The convention also provides for the institution and operation of national information bureaux and a central information agency for prisoners of war.  It makes provision, as well, for the activities of relief societies, including religious organisations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, operating on behalf of prisoners of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention replaced in a revised and up-to-date form the 1929 Geneva <Col N="1013" /> Convention for the treatment of prisoners of war.  It contains a number of novel and very important features and represents a big advance in the evolution of humanitarian treatment for prisoners of war.  &ldquo;Prisoners of war&rdquo; now include certain additional categories of persons, notably members of organised resistance movements, operating in or outside their own territory, even if that territory is occupied.  Such resistance groups, in order to benefit by the convention, must, however, be commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; have a fixed distinctive sign recognisable at a distance; carry arms openly and conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.  In addition, members of regular armed forces professing allegiance to a Government or authority not recognised by the detaining power and members of merchant marine and crews of civil aircraft who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under other provisions of international law, are to be regarded and treated as prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>There is an important new provision affecting neutral countries in relation to prisoners of war.  The broad effect of this provision is that members of the prisoners of war categories received or interned in neutral countries shall be treated as prisoners of war without prejudice to any more favourable treatment which a neutral country may choose to give.  Formerly, neutral countries found themselves faced with problems which could only be overcome in their dealings with belligerent forces by the application of the then convention as far as possible &ldquo;by analogy&rdquo;. Another new feature provides that all persons entitled to be treated as prisoners of war must be issued with identity cards by their own Governments.</P>
    <P>There is a great improvement on the former position in relation to pay. Every prisoner of war must in future receive from the detaining power, on behalf of his own country, a monthly advance of pay.  Formerly, only officers received ordinary pay and N.C.O.s and men not employed at some remunerative work were entirely without <Col N="1014" /> money for ordinary day-to-day needs.  The convention provides for the necessary financial adjustments as between the belligerents at the end of hostilities.</P>
    <P>Conditions of work for prisoners of war are also now more closely related to those governing similarly employed civilian workers in the same locality. For the first time a minimum rate of working pay is stipulated in the convention. Another important new feature provides that repatriation of prisoners of war shall take place without delay after the cessation of active hostilities instead of, as formerly, as soon as possible after the conclusion of peace.</P>
    <P>The convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war, or the Civilians Convention, is an entirely new convention.  It defines the categories of persons who are to be regarded as protected persons for the purpose of the convention and details a number of the fundamental rights of such persons.</P>
    <P>Protected persons must be afforded a means of existence.  Where a party to the conflict applies measures denying them opportunities of supporting themselves that party must ensure their support as well as that of their dependents.  Subject to the national interests, protected persons in the territory of a party to the conflict may be permitted to leave the territory.  If interned or assigned to a fixed residence their position must be open to periodical review.</P>
    <P>Civilian internment conditions are prescribed in detail in the convention and are on a par with those set out for prisoners of war under the Prisoners of War Convention.  The Civilians Convention will not be applicable to aliens interned in neutral countries in time of war.</P>
    <P>This is the second measure which it is considered desirable to have enacted before the Geneva Conventions of 1949 are ratified.  The first measure dealt with the conventions in relation mainly to Red Cross matters and has been enacted as the Red Cross Act, 1954. Deputies will have read the two conventions to which the present measure <Col N="1015" /> is related.  They have been presented to the House by the Minister for External Affairs and are available in the Library.  The present Bill is related closely to those provisions of the two conventions with which the Bill is concerned and contains several references to particular portions of the conventions. In this regard the Bill, to a large extent, relates to powers for the making of regulations.  It is obviously necessary to have the Bill in this form because the mass of detail provided for in the conventions could only be satisfactorily dealt with by regulations. Deputies will, however, have an opportunity of examining the regulations which will be laid before the House and be capable of annulment.</P>
    <P>Section I of the Bill provides for the usual definitions.  In sub-section (2) of Section I the expression &ldquo;prisoners of war&rdquo; is related primarily to the definition of that expression in the Prisoners of War Convention.  That convention (paragraph A of article 4) defines the expression as meaning members of the armed forces of a party to a conflict who have fallen into the power of the enemy, and as including certain other classes such as militias, volunteer corps and organised resistance movements fulfilling certain conditions; persons accompanying the armed forces without actually being members thereof; merchant seamen who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under other provisions of international law and the inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who take up arms to resist the invader, provided they carry arms openly and obey the laws and customs of war.</P>
    <P>The convention also provides (subparagraph (2) of paragraph (B) of article 4) that persons belonging to any of these categories who have been received by neutral or non-belligerent powers on their territory, and whom these powers are required to intern under international law, shall be treated as prisoners of war under the convention without prejudice to any more favourable treatment which may be accorded.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the expression &ldquo;Enemy Aliens&rdquo; is related to protected persons <Col N="1016" /> within the meaning of article 4 of the Civilians Convention.  The principal feature in the definition of protected persons in that article is that such persons are those who find themselves, in the case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a party to the conflict or occupying power of which they are not nationals.  Some notable exceptions are: (i) nationals of a State not bound by the convention; and, (ii) nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a cobelligerent State, if their country has normal diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with the internment of prisoners of war and enemy aliens.  Provision is made that internment shall be by direction of a Minister.  The Prisoners of War Convention provides that the detaining power may subject prisoners of war to internment.  The Civilians Convention, however, provides that the internment of a protected person may be ordered only: (i) if the security of the detaining power makes it absolutely necessary; or (ii) if, acting through the representatives of a protecting power, he voluntarily demands internment and his situation renders this step necessary. The convention provides also that where internees so request, their children who are left at liberty without parental care, shall be interned with them.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (8) of Section 2 provides for the making by the Minister or the Minister for Justice of regulations in respect of various matters relating to internment.  The Minister for Justice would be concerned in so far as the internment of enemy aliens might be his responsibility, because Article 99 of the Civilians Convention provides that every place of internment shall be put under the authority of a responsible officer, chosen from the regular military forces or the regular civil administration of the detaining power.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (9) of Section 2 details the nature of the regulations which can be made.  Regulations under paragraphs (a) and (b) of the sub-section will deal with matters relating to the establishment of internment camps, <Col N="1017" /> the administration, control, etc., of the camps and the maintenance of discipline among internees.  The regulations under paragraph (c) of the sub-section will cover a wide variety of matters detailed in the portions specified of the Prisoners of War Convention. Briefly, those portions of the convention may be explained as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) (i): The chapters referred to deal with conditions of internment under such headings as the type and location of prisoner-of-war camps, parole, etc., quarters, food and clothing, hygiene and medical attention, religious, intellectual and physical activities, rank of prisoners of war and transfer after arrival in camp.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) (ii): This portion of the convention deals with the type of work in which the labour of prisoners of war may be utilised and generally with the conditions of work, including occupational accidents and diseases and medical supervision.  Officers or persons of equivalent status may not be compelled to work but if they ask for suitable work it shall be found for them.  N.C.O.s may be required to do supervisory work only.  The working conditions of prisoners of war may not be inferior to those enjoyed by nationals of the detaining power and the national legislation concerning protection and safety of workers will apply to them.  Unless he volunteers to do so a prisoner of war may not be employed on work of an unhealthy or dangerous nature such as the removal of mines.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) (iii): Section IV, Part III of the convention deals with the financial resources of prisoners of war.  The detaining power is required to pay prisoners of war a monthly advance of pay (apart from working pay) ranging from the equivalent of eight Swiss francs in the case of prisoners ranking below sergeants to 75 Swiss francs in the case of general officers.  These advances, the amounts of which may be modified by agreement between the powers concerned, are subject to recovery from or adjustment with the other power at the end of hostilities.  There is also provision for fair working pay, not less than the equivalent of a quarter of a Swiss <Col N="1018" /> franc for a full working day.  This portion of the convention also sets out in detail the management of prisoners' accounts and how final adjustment is to be made on the termination of captivity.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) (iv): Section V, Part III of the convention deals with matters relating to correspondence, relief shipments and the preparation, execution and transmission of legal documents.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) (v): Section VI, Part III of the convention sets forth the rights of prisoners of war in regard to the making of complaints respecting the conditions of captivity.  It makes provision for the election and duties of representatives elected from among the prisoners of war.  It deals also with provisions concerning penal and disciplinary sanctions, the application to prisoners of war of the laws in force in the armed forces of the detaining power, penalties, punishments and generally with disciplinary and judicial proceedings.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) (vi): Part IV of the convention makes provision relating to repatriation and release and to matters concerning the death and burial of prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>The regulations under paragraph (d) of sub-section (9) will cover the various matters referred to in Section IV, Part III of the Civilians Convention. That portion of the convention relates to matters similar to the various matters I have already explained in relation to prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>The provision in sub-section (10) of Section 2 regarding the passing of a sentence involving confinement on an interned person is on the lines of a similar provision in both the Prisoners of War Convention and the Civilians Convention.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for the making of regulations by the Minister or the Minister for Justice to enable effect to be given: (i) to any special agreements made pursuant to article 6 of the Prisoners of War Convention or article 7 of the Civilians Convention; and (ii) to the portions of those conventions referred to in sub-sections (2) and (4) and any <Col N="1019" /> agreements made pursuant to those portions.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the Prisoners of War Convention and article 7 of the Civilians Convention give power to make special agreements for all matters concerning which separate provision is considered suitable, but no special agreement shall adversely affect the situation of prisoners of war or protected persons under the conventions. Similarly, any other agreements which may be concluded under other portions of the conventions shall not adversely affect the rights and benefits afforded by the conventions.</P>
    <P>The following is a brief description of the portions of the Prisoners of War Convention referred to in paragraphs (a) to (f) of sub-section (2) of Section 3:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a): The part in question of article 5 of the convention provides that should any doubt arise as to whether persons having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories of prisoners of war, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b): Article 15 of the convention provides that the power detaining prisoners of war shall be bound to provide free of charge for their maintenance and for the medical attention required by their state of health.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c): Article 33 of the convention relates to medical personnel and chaplains retained to assist prisoners of war.  Under that article, such persons shall not be considered as prisoners of war but may be retained to assist prisoners of war.  They must receive as a minimum the benefits and protection of the convention and must also be granted all facilities necessary to provide for the medical care of, and religious ministration to, prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d): Section 1, Part III of the convention sets out the procedure to be followed and the information which a prisoner of war is bound to furnish on capture.  It lays down <Col N="1020" /> the particulars which shall be included in the identity cards of prisoners of war and deals generally with the questioning of prisoners of war.  It makes provision also for the disposal of personal effects and currency.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e): Part V of the convention concerns the establishment and administration of national information bureaux for the collection and transmission of information regarding matters such as transfers, releases, repatriation, escapes, medical histories and deaths of prisoners of war.  It deals also with the facilities to be afforded to representatives of religious organisations and relief societies.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f): Article 126 of the convention relates to the facilities to be afforded to representatives of the protecting powers and delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoners of war in all places.</P>
    <P>The portions of the Civilians Convention referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d) of sub-section (4) may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a): The part in question of article 39 of the convention contains provisions for ensuring the support of an enemy alien and his dependents where methods of control applied in his case result in his being unable to support himself.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b): Article 43 of the convention makes provision for the designation of an appropriate court or administrative board before which an enemy alien shall be entitled to have his internment or placing in assigned residence reconsidered.  I shall refer to this again in my remarks relating to Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c): Articles 136, 137, 138, 139 and 141 of the convention provide for the establishment and administration of national information bureaux for the collection and transmission in the interest of enemy aliens of information regarding matters such as transfers, releases, etc., similar to those I have already detailed in the case of information bureaux for prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> Paragraph (d): Articles 142 and 143 of the convention concern facilities to be afforded to representatives of religious organisations, relief societies and representatives or delegates of the protecting powers.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill makes prisoners of war persons subject to military law and places them on the same footing as members of the Defence Forces in relation to the penal and disciplinary provisions of the Defence Act, 1954, and the Orders, regulations and rules made thereunder.  This is in conformity with the Prisoners of War Convention which provides under the heading of penal and disciplinary sanctions that a prisoner of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and Orders in force in the armed forces of the detaining power.  There is provision, however, for the adaptation of the penal and disciplinary provisions of the Defence Act and the Orders, regulations and rules made thereunder to meet the particular circumstances of prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 5 of the Bill regarding sentences and penalties are on the lines of similar provisions contained in both the Prisoners of War Convention and the Civilians Convention.</P>
    <P>The Aliens Act, 1935, provides that the Minister for Justice may, if and whenever he thinks proper, in an Aliens Order, require aliens to reside or remain in particular districts or places in the State.  Article 42 of the Civilians Convention provides, however, that the placing in assigned residence of protected persons may be ordered only if the security of the detaining power makes it absolutely necessary.  The exercise of the relevant power under the Aliens Act is accordingly brought into line with the Civilians Convention by Section 6 of the Bill.  There is also provision in this section of the Bill preserving the right of enemy aliens to have their representations against internment or assigned residence considered by a court or competent board which will be established by regulations made under paragraph (b) of sub-section 3 (4) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides that <Col N="1022" /> charges against an interned enemy alien may, by direction of the Minister, be dealt with by a military tribunal. The Civilians Convention does not specifically provide for trial of enemy aliens by military courts.  Neither, however, does it preclude such action and as it is obviously desirable that there should be power in certain circumstances to bring enemy aliens before military courts provision accordingly is made in Section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill makes it an offence punishable by penal servitude or imprisonment for a person, other than a prisoner of war or an interned enemy alien, to assist the escape of a prisoner of war or an interned enemy alien, to harbour a prisoner of war or enemy alien who has escaped from internment, or to procure or attempt to procure other persons to assist the escape of an interned prisoner of war or an interned enemy alien.  Prisoners of war and interned enemy aliens are excepted from the provisions of the section because the conventions provide that prisoners of war or interned enemy aliens who aid or abet an escape or attempt to escape, shall be liable on this count to disciplinary punishment only.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill contains the usual provisions requiring the consent of the Minister for Finance to regulations involving a direct or indirect charge on or a payment into public funds.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides that every regulation under the Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall be capable of annulment.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill contains the usual expenses clause.</P>
    <P>Much of what I have said is contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies with the text of the Bill.  I hope the outline of the provisions of the Bill I have now given, in conjunction with the explanatory memorandum, will be of assistance to Deputies in their consideration of the measure.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputies on all sides of the House will welcome this <Col N="1023" /> Bill, because it is, as I already said, a necessary preliminary to our ratifying the conventions.  It will, I feel sure, be the earnest wish of the House and indeed of the country as a whole, that Ireland should take her place amongst those nations who by ratifying these conventions have proclaimed their belief in the application of the highest principles of humanity in time of war and their willingness to put these principles into practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would not be incorrect to describe this Bill as an offspring of the Geneva Convention. In doing so, I should like to express the hope that there will be very many similar offsprings throughout the world.  Without seeing a copy of the convention we must, of course, rely on the information contained in the explanatory memorandum, together with an examination of the Bill.  I agree with the Minister when he says that this Bill is a very big advance on the position as it obtained hitherto.  I hope that the lot of prisoners of war in the future will, as a result of Bills of this kind here and in other countries, be made much easier.</P>
      <P>The convention in so far as it relates to civilian persons should go a long way towards eliminating the possibility of a recurrence of the horrors which those unfortunate people were alleged to have had inflicted on them in the past.  The convention gives the right to such persons to practise their religion, and it also provides against the use of prisoners as hostages.  These provisions alone should recommend the Bill to any fair-minded person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone in this nation, and indeed in every civilised State, will welcome the protection which this Bill provides. I feel that at a time such as this, when something like ten years have passed since the cessation of hostilities of the last war, it is not civilised that there should be tens of thousands of prisoners of that war still in captivity.  There is nothing that the nations appear to be able to do to remedy that state of affairs.  I do not know whether questions of that kind were given consideration by the membership of the Geneva Convention.  If the question of <Col N="1024" /> the holding of prisoners of war after a certain period following the cessation of hostilities was not considered, then I think that it would be very desirable that the delegate or delegates representing Ireland at that convention should, at the first available opportunity, raise that question in the hope that something will be done to bring about an easement of that situation. I cannot see why a matter of that kind cannot be dealt with by a convention of that kind.</P>
    <P>I can realise full well that the question of the enforcement of that regulation might present some difficulty, but it should present no greater difficulty than the enforcement of any of these regulations which have been passed by that convention with such goodwill and high hopes.  However, the question of having all these regulations enforced in time of war is something that we can only hope for.</P>
    <P>Another point which I would like to raise is that concerning the title of &ldquo;war criminal&rdquo;.  We all know that the term &ldquo;war criminal&rdquo; was applied only to those who were vanquished. In the circumstances with which we are dealing in this Bill, we should consider seriously the question of whether nations, vanquished or victorious, who have contravened the ordinary rules of civilisation should not in the circumstances be brought to book.  We can only talk about what we have read; we cannot see for ourselves definite proofs of any of the statements which were made but we all know that there has been a volume of evidence to show that some of the things to which I am referring have occurred.  I think that they could be dealt with perhaps by the non-participating nations who could provide the best legal men in their respective countries to deal with the question of the contravention of regulations which might be put into force by a body like the Geneva Convention. It is only in matters of that kind that I can see any hope being brought to the world as far as war is concerned.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is hardly possible to humanise warfare but we could at least make an effort to humanise the treatment of unfortunate victims of warfare. If we do that we, as a nation, will have <Col N="1025" /> achieved something of usefulness to civilisation itself.</P>
    <P>I would on behalf of the Opposition welcome the advent of this Bill.  I think it is a tremendous step forward and I do know as far as our nation is concerned we will give wholehearted effect to the convention.  We will do all that we can to carry out these principles contained in the convention and in welcoming the Bill I would express the hope that it will be possible to enforce the regulations it contains in the course of time.  At the same time I would like to say that I sincerely hope that it will be a very long time before it is necessary to take effective action under this Bill.</P>

      <P>An important discussion of this kind on an international convention should, I think, take place in the presence of an interested audience.  The present discussion is taking place with only the Minister present and nobody behind him to support him.  There would be general welcome for a measure of this kind and the only doubt one would be likely to express would be as to the general international application of the principles enunciated in the Bill. In so far as it is a step forward, as Deputy Traynor has already stated, in the interests of humanity and the humane treatment of prisoners of war, the Bill is welcome indeed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was not here when the Minister made his introductory statement and I do not know if he told us in how many countries these conventions have been approved and adopted by the respective Parliaments. It would be interesting to know that. I take it the conventions will have only a limited application internationally. Could the Minister tell us, for instance, what countries behind the Iron Curtain have adopted these conventions?  Are any of them willing to give effect to them?  It would be interesting to know whether these countries are as willing to adopt them&mdash;somehow or other, I am inclined to doubt that they are&mdash; as are other nations, like ourselves.</P>

      <P>The conventions were published so long ago I think we have nearly forgotten the provisions of them.  It is unfortunate that time is so limited that it is not easy to implement these things immediately. There are a number of detailed matters in this Bill, the effect of which will be to mitigate conditions for prisoners of war generally.  During the last international conflagration, we had to intern certain people who were regarded as enemy aliens, and some others, too; I do not think any of them could complain of the treatment they received in the rather benign conditions under which they were interned.  I am afraid the same cannot be said of other countries.</P>
      <P>Of course, when countries are actually engaged in war, no matter what international conventions are adopted, the human element will enter into the question of the treatment that is meted out.  As far as we are concerned, I do not think anyone could complain of conditions.  The only thing we can hope for now is that those countries which are adopting, or have adopted, these conventions will implement the principles enunciated therein.  I hope it will receive international approval.  Equally, I hope that the necessity for implementing these principles will never arise again, at least in our lifetime.  But if the letter and the spirit of these conventions are applied, then the lot of prisoners of war in the future, should we be faced with such an eventuality, will be mitigated to a very great extent.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if any of the provisions of the Emergency Powers Orders are incorporated in this measure.  Having read it and the explanatory memorandum, I doubt if they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us a detailed and factual explanation and went to a good deal of trouble to interpret the provisions in the Bill.  Indeed, he gave us a great deal of valuable information. It is a rather involved and somewhat difficult Bill and, in order to study it <Col N="1027" /> properly, it is essential that one should have the terms of the conventions before one; but the Minister has certainly done his best to explain the Bill as fully as possible and we are grateful to him.  We welcome the introduction of this measure.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the manner in which the House has received these proposals.  I shall place on record now the contracting or consenting parties.  Forty-six countries have ratified the conventions and 23 are in process of ratifying; we are one of the 23.  These conventions were signed in 1949, but, for some reason or another, there has been a bit of delay and I am now trying to speed things up by having the necessary domestic legislation passed before we ratify.  Ratification cannot take place until all the essential domestic legislation has been passed.</P>
      <P>The following countries have ratified: Austria, 1954; Belgium, 1953; Bulgaria, with reservations, 1955; Byelorussia, with reservations, 1955; Chile, 1951; Cuba, 1954; Czechoslovakia, with reservations, 1951; Denmark, 1951; Ecuador, 1955; Egypt, 1953; Finland, 1955; France, 1951; the Federal Republic of Germany, 1955; Guatemala, 1952; The Holy See, 1951; Hungary, with reservations, 1955; India, 1951; Israel, 1951; Italy, 1952; Japan, 1953; Jordania, 1951; Yugoslavia, with reservations, 1950; Lebanon, 1951; Liberia, 1954; Liechtenstein, 1951; Luxembourg, 1954; Mexico, 1953; the Netherlands, with reservations, 1955; Nicaragua, 1954; Norway, 1952; Pakistan, with reservations, 1951; Philippines, Convention I in 1951 and Conventions II, III and IV in 1953; Poland, 1955; Roumania, with reservations, 1954; Salvador, 1953; San Marino, 1954; Spain, 1953; Sweden, 1954; Switzerland, 1950; Syria, 1954; Thailand, 1955; Turkey, 1954; the Ukraine, with reservations, 1955; the U.S.S.R., with reservations, 1954; the Union of South Africa, 1952; and Vietnam, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The countries who are in the same position as we are in&mdash;namely, those that have signed but have not yet ratified&mdash;are the following: Afghanistan; <Col N="1028" /> Albania, with reservations; Argentina, with reservations; Australia; Bolivia; Brazil, with reservations; Canada, with reservations; Ceylon, Conventions I, II and III; China; Columbia; Ethiopia; Greece; Iran; Monaco; New Zealand, with reservations; Paraguay; Peru; Portugal, with reservations; United Kingdom, with reservations; United States of America, with reservations; Uruguay and Venezuela.</P>
    <P>That, as far as we know, is the position to-day.  We cannot start condemning anybody for not having ratified when we have not done so ourselves, but I am now trying to get into the proper line.</P>

I was under the impression that they had got them. I admit that they were only placed in the Library of this House in January of this year, but documents placed in the Library of the House are almost in no-man's land.  I know the difficulties about that.  I will send my predecessor a copy of these documents for his immediate consideration.  It is impossible to read the Bill, without having these documents in front of you.  You are legislating by reference and taking article so-and-so of the convention and seeing what its effect is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Traynor raised the question of the trial of alleged war criminals. Article 129 of the Prisoners of War Convention and article 146 of the Civilians Convention provide for the trial and punishment of persons who commit grave breaches of the provisions of the conventions.  It is the Minister for Justice who has to bring in the domestic legislation to deal with that here.  These articles set out the procedure to be adopted in future for the trial of all persons charged with grave breaches of the Prisoners of War Convention and the Civilians Convention.</P>

      <P>The whole thing is laid down.  I suppose that in the case of a neutral country, such as Ireland, the person charging has to make out a <i>prima facie</i> case that will satisfy this country that we should hand them over.  There must be some agreement in those cases that there is a case and that they are guilty of breaches of these conventions, that they have been guilty of serious offences under these conventions.  The article is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The High Contracting Parties undertake to enact any legislation necessary to provide effective penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be committed, any of the grave breaches of the present convention defined in the following article.</P>
      <P>Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts.  It may also, if it prefers, and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party concerned, provided such High Contracting Party has made out a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
      <P>Each High Contracting Party shall take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present convention other than the grave breaches defined in the following article.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances, the accused persons shall benefit by safeguards of proper trial and defence, which shall not be less favourable than those provided by article 105 and those following of the present convention.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was referring to the effect that the land project had in bringing to the farming community a new outlook in relation to improving their lot.  I would like to add that it is my feeling that the employment of heavy machinery is considerably overdue in clearing away wasteful banks of earth and scrub.  In recent months we saw a vast amount of work being performed by heavy machinery, work which seven or eight years ago it would not have been thought possible to do economically. The number of people engaged in contract work in clearing scrub and removing banks is very gratifying and the grants that are being paid to make this possible, I contend, is money very well spent.  It will bring into productivity much land that was lying derelict up to now and which will be capable of producing more in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it regrettable that the heavy machinery that was engaged on road works over the last few years was not engaged inside the fences on the land. If that had been done, possibly our production would be higher to-day and <Col N="1032" /> we might then be in a position to engage that machinery on road works. First things should come first.  Even now it is very satisfactory to see the amount of work which has been done in such a short time.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the need for improving the advisory services available to farmers.  It is unfortunate that some controversy has developed in connection with the advisory services that operated so well for some time past through the county committees of agriculture and that the parish agent has not been received as he should have been received&mdash;with just a little bit of understanding and common sense and a realisation that he was coming to add to the services that were already being provided by the committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is natural with the growth of farm organisations, Young Farmers, Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre, and other rural organisations, that there should be a greater demand for advisory services.  It is, of course, true that, even though the excellent officers that were attached to the committees of agriculture were doing good work, they could not give the specific attention to particular places that might be desired by the people of those localities.  Under the parish plan that is being provided for.  We know of one or two instances where co-operative societies have thought it worth while to contribute in whole or in part towards the expenses of maintaining an officer to assist in a particular area.</P>
    <P>The extension of the parish plan, to my mind, will have a snowball effect like rural electrification.  When it was introduced many people refused a supply, but when they saw its advantages, after their neighbours had got it, they became clamorous in looking for it.  I think when people see the parish plan working effectively, and live side by side with it, that they will increase their demand for similar services and that even if the committee of agriculture officers are relieved of some duties in the area where the parish plan is operating, there will be a much greater demand for their services in adjoining areas to which the plan has not yet been extended.  I <Col N="1033" /> think some of the opposition to it has been rather too extreme.  It is only when it has been tried for a while that the real effect of it will be realised.</P>
    <P>Another great improvement effected in recent years and over the past 12 months is the improvement in farm buildings.  It is surely necessary, before we can look to the increased numbers of live stock which we now aim at and which are so vital to increased production, to see that the necessary accommodation is there to house these animals.  It will also be reflected in the improved health and improved condition of the animals when they are offered for sale.</P>
    <P>Increased storage space, to my mind, will also lead to more tillage because many people have to estimate how much grain they can store before they proceed to sow in the springtime.  I am not referring now to areas where grain is sown as a catch crop, but where the grain is converted on the farm itself, thus providing the means to maintain an increased number of animals.  The improved land as a result of reclamation and the increased accommodation for farm buildings will work together towards bringing about the improvement we need in production. In relation to grain storage I think tribute is due to those co-operative societies that are at the moment expending quite considerable amounts in the erection of silos.  The earlier siting of storage facilities at the ports did not indicate a very optimistic attitude in relation to grain growing.</P>
    <P>The use of feeding barley, of course, has revolutionised production.  The increased output per acre, mechanisation, the introduction of varieties of grain that are capable of being profitably produced on almost any soil here, the production of ground limestone and the more intelligent appreciation of the value of fertilisers will mean that people can look forward to producing what they require to market and enable them to maintain the remainder of their live stock in better condition than they thought possible half a dozen years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have much more to add to what has already been said on <Col N="1034" /> both sides of the House.  The debate has been very constructive.  I would just like to mention that a tribute is due to those people who, while not owing land, have given all their lives to working on it.  In the agricultural labourers, we have people who are vital in this aim to increase production.</P>
    <P>Some of them work a lifetime with the one farmer or with a family.  These men and women make very valuable contributions.  As they advance in old age, we should do something more for them and give some recognition to those who have given that service. Organisations like the R.D.S., in a little way, do their part in giving them some little recognition.  If we could facilitate them in the matter of housing or to a better degree so far as social welfare is concerned or by some means attract them to a life on the land rather than to look for employment under very different conditions across the water, we would do a very good day's work.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on the note on which I started.  I want to refer again to those people, non-agriculturists, who lecture and talk down to the agricultural community for not working harder and producing more.  They are not being fair to the agricultural community. If somebody took the time to evaluate the capital, endeavour, working hours and efforts which have been put into the reclamation of land, the erection of out-offices, the reconstruction of farm buildings and all the work that is going on now and that is directed towards the elimination of bovine T.B., it would be seen that the farming community deserve great praise.  When we bear in mind all the work which they are doing, and when we realise the disrupting effect which the bovine T.B. scheme has on the work of the farm, it must certainly be agreed that our agricultural community deserve great praise.</P>
    <P>I feel that, in his introduction of the Estimate, the Minister reviewed the whole position in a very fair way and most of the Deputies who have spoken in the debate have been very constructive in the contributions they had to offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have been facilitated, as is usual, with a document issued by the Department of Agriculture setting out in cold print and in very prosaic language, under a large number of headings, some of the activities of the Department during the past year and for some time previous to that.  This is a very useful document. It gives a fair idea to any Deputy of the activities of the Department over a wide range.  It also gives a good idea of the items of agricultural production and of the extent of agricultural production in the country in recent times.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture stated that there has been a 24 per cent. increase in agricultural production.  He does not say over what period of time this alleged increase has taken place. It appears to me that the Minister for Agriculture wishes to be regarded by the public as a person whose mission in this country is to do for farming something that was not done previously. When the Minister makes political pronouncements on the agricultural situation like his outburst here, when introducing this Estimate, on reports on cattle prices in the <i>Irish Press,</i> I am reminded very much of pantomime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister wishes to be regarded as the &ldquo;Prince Charming&rdquo; of Irish agriculture.  Every time any crux occurs or any situation of an adverse nature arises, he wishes to place upon other shoulders the responsibility for those matters.  He tries to convince the public that the job of continuing to do for our farmers the work that is necessary to permit them to increase production on their holdings is retarded and prevented by the forces of evil such as we see portrayed in pantomime.  On some occasions these forces of evil are the leaders of the creamery milk suppliers of this country.  Of course, before these people become the forces of evil, the Minister will take good care to tell the public that they have been brain-washed or indoctrinated by Fianna Fáil propaganda. On another occasion they may be self-styled economists who write and contribute to newspapers.  On other occasions these forces of evil may be the cartels and the rings that, over the years, have been strangling production <Col N="1036" /> on Irish farms.  On other occasions it may be the cattle traders &mdash;the &ldquo;tanglers&rdquo; and the Fianna Fáil people who try to depress the cattle trade and who try to get the farmers to sell cattle at ridiculously low prices. On this occasion it happens to be the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Above all, a great organisation is standing in his way of doing something big for Irish farming and, of course, it is the Fianna Fáil organisation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to sit down and wait for the fairy queen to come along and dispel what he considers to be forces of evil, he will be waiting a long time.  It is true that the present Minister for Agriculture took over this country after a long period of Fianna Fáil administration.  It is admitted by practically everybody&mdash;including the Minister, I am sure&mdash;that conditions generally, and especially in Irish agricuture, have improved immensely since we became a self-governing State.  If it is a fact&mdash;which it is&mdash; that considerable improvement has taken place in farmers' housing, in farmers' outbuildings, in land improvement before ever the land project was initiated, in cattle breeding and in other similar activities on farms, it is attributable in a large measure to the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party down through the years.  Consider the statement by the Minister in regard to the prices of Irish cattle as they were featured in the <i>Irish Press</i> during the months of January and February.  Every Coalition Deputy must think the public are very innocent, if they are going to believe that the British Government negotiators with the farmers' organisations&mdash;in their negotiations in regard to the fixing of agricultural prices for the ensuing year&mdash;had to wait until they read the <i>Irish Press</i> that cattle prices in Ireland were depressed, and that they did not know in advance of any publications in the <i>Irish Press</i> that such was taking place.</P>
    <P>It seems strange to me that the British Government, with a long history behind it, noted, as it is, for being well-informed on matters of foreign interest and with a diplomatic background, should have to wait, until the <i>Irish Press</i> appeared, to read <Col N="1037" /> that cattle were making bad prices at Irish fairs during the months of January and February.  The Irish cattle traders engaged in the business of sending cattle to the market knew that the price of cattle had fallen in England.  They knew, when they received the returns for what they were sending across to England during January and February, that they were not getting what they were paying the Irish farmers for them.  They kept in business as long as they could and then they sat at home and said: &ldquo;We cannot continue in this business until prices return to a normal trade figure so that we can know what prospects there are in Britain of getting our own back for the cattle we purchase at Irish fairs and send to Britain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They knew immediately that there was a fall in the price of cattle. Farmers in England who purchased cattle here last October and November knew what they were getting for their fat cattle.  When the farmers put them on the market in January and February, they knew they were losing what it cost to feed these cattle along with some of the money they paid for the cattle.  British farmers were probably losing £20 or £30 on every beast they sent to the British market and sold as beef during February.</P>
    <P>It is clearly demonstrated in the document issued by the Minister that the prices of beef cattle in Britain are now on a trader-to-trader basis.  The law of supply and demand in the British market will govern the price at which beef cattle will be sold to the British market in the future and the British farmer, as well as the Irish farmer, is faced now with competition in the beef trade from the Argentine.</P>
    <P>Our job, as far as I can see it, is to produce beef cattle in which we will have the least competition so far as Argentine meat is concerned.  We have a method of doing that, I think.  The Minister is responsible in my opinion for providing the basis of the method through the I.A. stations.  If we can induce our farmers to produce a type of animal in Ireland from Hereford and Aberdeen-Angus crosses and good Shorthorns which will mature early; if we can endeavour to induce our farmers <Col N="1038" /> to produce a finished beast at two year old or less, it means, of course, proper breeding at the outset.  It means breeding to secure a finished beast at a certain light weight.  It means feeding the calf from birth and it also means the cultivation of grass as a crop.  That is my candid opinion on this matter.  The Minister shakes his head and says the Deputy here agrees with him.</P>
    <P>There was a time in Ireland when we engaged in the cattle business even in competition with other countries.  We did it with a type of beast not now wanted.  That was prior to the 1914-1918 war.  We had cattle that were of a tremendous weight.  We had them a long number of years on the one farm and men could afford to wait for their return.  The British people wanted to get large joints of meat and they ate meat in greater quantities than they are eating it now.</P>
    <P>There was not much activity at that time with regard to the provision of continuous work for the people who did not own property in this country.  By reason of the fact that the outgoings on actual wages and costs were very low, the landowners could indulge in that class of business but the 1914-1918 war brought a change in Britain and it brought a change here.  Conditions were so depressed in agriculture after the 1914-1918 war that many men were almost forced out of business here.  It is hardly worth while referring at length to the situation which developed here then but the shape of the Irish cattle trade changed a bit between then and 1939.</P>
    <P>The emphasis for a long number of years during that period was on the Aberdeen-Angus and Hereford cross cattle, as I pointed out previously. With smaller joints, more meant to the bone and a greater percentage of meat per carcase required, a different type of meat was needed by the English housewives and we developed what was known as a Polly trade.</P>
    <P>We started sending in large numbers this class of cattle mainly to Scotland and the North of England for a period, three, four or five months as the case might be, according to the finish of the animal exported.  Many farmers during that period failed to realise that the <Col N="1039" /> day of these older, stronger and rougher type of cattle had passed away and they did not take the necessary steps to recondition their land in the grazing areas to feed to maturity a younger beast.</P>
    <P>When the 1939-1945 war came and when both Britain and this island were virtually blockaded, meat became scarce and fertilisers could not be procured. Meat and fat were at a premium and were needed both here and in England.  The weight-for-space animal came back to its own.  They wanted meat in England and the bigger the beasts, the more weight in meat was carried by ship to Britain.</P>
    <P>Since the war, that situation has ceased and we are now faced with this competition from the Argentine and so is the British farmer.  I want to impress on the Minister the utmost necessity of inducing our farmers to produce the type of cattle that I ask for here.  We have to take active steps to make certain that we go in for that type of beef product.  That is what we must do if we are going to keep in this business.  The difficulty I see is that, when there is a depression in prices, our farmers are inclined to go out of production of the particular produce concerned.  The Minister, his Government, this Party and all of us who have the long term interests of this country in the forefront of our minds wish to see a substantial increase in the number of cows kept in this country, and in the number of cattle.  It would be very shortsighted of our people if, because of the present lowering of the price of live stock in England, they ceased to produce in that direction.</P>
    <P>In an endeavour to meet the situation that has come upon us in regard to the balance of payments position, the Minister's Department has been called upon to secure an immediate increase in the production from our land.  That increase will mainly come, and the Minister wishes it mainly to come, from live stock, from cattle.  He speaks of a five-year plan and he does not give any details as to how this plan will operate.  He speaks in a general way of an increase in the number of milch cows up to 2,000,000.  That would be <Col N="1040" /> an increase of 715,000 cows on our present figure.  By what method does he intend to attain that increase?  Will the N.F.A., Muintir na Tíre or the young farmers' clubs, those rural organisations, be asked to help in this matter?  He will have to make certain that the increase is uniform throughout the country.  However, I am sure you will not get a large increase in any particular area, but that it will have to be spread over every parish.  Will the parish agent or the local instructor under the agricultural committees be asked to see that the farmers in the areas they are serving will be asked specially to have an extra heifer this year brought in calf so as to enable this increase in the cow population and the necessary increase in the number of cattle to take place?</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to the other types of agricultural production and the increases that are needed.  The Minister has not given us any details as to how he proposes to get the increases, the number of acres of tillage necessary or the increased numbers of any other type of agricultural production necessary, except in the case of pigs.  He has, of course, announced a method of endeavouring to secure an increase in the number of pigs by guaranteeing a fixed price on the foreign market for a grade A pig.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A minimum price, not a fixed price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant; a minimum price.  If we are to continue in agricultural production, we will have to cater for the foreign market and we will have to take our place in that foreign market at competitive prices.  Therefore, we must change our whole attitude of mind in regard to this question of price, a higher price per head, a higher price per unit, and endeavour to secure from our farmers the admission that it is necessary for them to take advantage of the facilities that are placed at their disposal to enable them to get at a cheaper rate per unit an increased production from their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I pass from the subject of cattle, I wish to refer to the ear-marking of artificial insemination heifer <Col N="1041" /> calves which is mentioned in this document. I mentioned that in the first debate in which this artificial insemination station was mooted.  I am pleased to see that steps were taken in this connection.  It takes a practised eye and wide experience for an individual to recognise the Shorthorn heifer suitable for breeding purposes and to distinguish such a heifer from beef Shorthorn, but here we have a method by which a farmer can have a very reasonable chance of knowing that if a particular heifer is put to milk he has a beast that, with reasonable management and feeding, will give the quantity of milk necessary for economic production.  That is a very good method of getting our farmers to increase their cow population from the best foundation stock.</P>
    <P>I also noticed from this document that the Department is engaged in a campaign for the eradication of T.B. in our cattle.  This has been in operation for some short number of years now and there are apparently three areas in the country being worked intensively.  There is here in this document a note on the matter which should be widely publicised, that is, the fact that we have in the western and northern areas especially many herds that have been found on the initial test to be T.B. free.  In County Sligo the percentage of herds that are found free from T.B. stands at 55 per cent. and the same applies in just a slightly lesser degree in Clare, in the northern areas and in the whole West of Ireland, west of the Shannon.  If the Minister by any detailed plan or method proposes to induce our farmers to increase the numbers of cows, he should concentrate on having a higher number of cows kept in those areas than in other areas that show a higher percentage of T.B. in the cattle population.</P>
    <P>I wish to give every encouragement to the Minister in his efforts to complete the job of making the country T.B. free and T.B. tested.  With regard to our live cattle trade with Britain, we will not be able to keep in business at all, unless we are in a position to send our live stock for feeding to Britain under T.T. certification. Britain has come a long way, <Col N="1042" /> has almost completed testing of the entire country.  It is generally known in the cattle business that farmers on attested farms in Britain cannot purchase cattle from us that are not T.B. tested.</P>
    <P>There was a time when Ireland did a considerable business with Britain in milch cows and in-calf heifers.  If we were in that business now, it would help us to increase our cow population. Unfortunately, we lost that trade in years gone by and are now exporting virtually no milch cattle to Britain, or very few.  British farmers undertook T.B. testing of their dairy herds. They also changed their herds from crossbred Shorthorns to pure breeds. We in this country allowed that trade to disappear and did not do much about it.  At the time, of course, men in this House and others outside the House, when referring to that trade, advised all and sundry that we were exporting the entire dairy cattle population of this country to Britain and that we were exporting the dairy and cattle potential of this country.</P>
    <P>Farmers, like everybody else, follow the money.  The punters on a racecourse follow the money.  Farmers in Ireland follow the line of production that pays them.  When beef cattle are making high prices as against milch cattle, and when beef is more profitable to them than milk, the cattle that they rear, whether they are heifers or bullocks, beef cattle or dairy cattle, in the main, get into the beef market and are fed to meat.  In recent years, we have been putting our dairy potential down the drain in beef production.</P>
    <P>That has been happening.  There must be an intensive propaganda or educative campaign carried out, either directly by the Department or through farmers' organisations, or by some other method, to instruct the farmers that they should make certain that the maximum number of heifer calves of Shorthorn breed that it is possible for them to maintain and rear on their own farms should be brought to milk and put to breeding purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to adopt the rôle of adviser or lecturer to farmers.  Far be it from me.  I know, of course, that the organisations I have named have, <Col N="1043" /> over a number of years, taken it upon themselves to study methods of production and to acquaint themselves with new techniques and modern ideas, so that they may be able to do the job that is expected of them and to keep themselves in business.  If we could get such an educative campaign as I have suggested carried out through these organisations, so much the better.  The pity is that, so far, we have not got farmers' organisations at a higher pitch and better and more extensively organised than they are at present.  We hope that that may come about in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney said, in regard to the production of grain in this country, for feeding, that, when the world price of grain was low, it was the policy of the Government to import grain for animal feeding.  He implied that it was good business to do that.  That is not the way in which I regard this matter and I do not think it is the way the Fianna Fáil Party would regard it. The Fianna Fáil Party, during all the years they were in office, endeavoured to secure greater production of grain within the country.  When the Minister for Agriculture took office, he was looking forward to cheaper maize.  He felt that we could import more maize and feed more pigs.  Of course, since then, we have learned that maize is not the ideal feed for the production of Grade A bacon.  I wonder how many more acres the Minister is setting up as the target for the farmers of this country in his five-year plan?  I hope that when he is replying he will indicate to the farmers, under the various headings of grain production, the extent to which he wants them to increase their production in acres over the next five years.</P>
    <P>It is true we have increased the area under barley considerably in recent years, but I feel we could increase it further.  The same applies to oats, but we must organise a system by which the people who grow this extra grain can dispose of it.  On many occasions, the Minister advised people who grow grain to feed it to animals on the land and walk them off.  That is all right as far as it goes, but there <Col N="1044" /> are farms on which there will be a big surplus of this grain.  There will be farms on which people will engage on grain production alone and for which it behoves us to organise a market or a business into which we can place this grain when it comes for sale.  We must take steps to provide storage for the grain and facilities for selling it to the trade.  This grain must be distributed throughout the country to the places where it is needed, just as we engaged over too long a number of years in the distribution of imported grain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the appalling cost of storing grain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but, nevertheless, I feel sure the difficulties can be surmounted if they are properly looked into.  Greater difficulties were surmounted in time in this country.  It may be that the Minister or Deputy Rooney may have something at the backs of their minds, but I hope that, if foreign grain falls to a low price again, we will not engage in the wholesale purchase of it from the ends of the earth and thus let our own farmers go by the board.  I do not believe in that policy at all.  I believe we should take every means possible to keep our own people in production and to secure a home market for them.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Sullivan, seemed to be annoyed by statements from people who were not agriculturists in admonishing farmers for not producing more, that they were not sufficiently hard working and that they did not take off their coats.  He referred to those people as having made statements publicly before meetings of chambers of commerce and other such organisations in this country. I wonder was he referring to a statement made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, when he addressed the Dublin Society of Chartered Accountants?  I wonder was the Parliamentary Secretary referring to this statement by the Tánaiste:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The plain fact had to be faced that in 1956 they found the all-over volume of agricultural production was substantially the same as it was 50 years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> The Minister for Agriculture says it has increased by 24 per cent.  The Tánaiste goes on in this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In other words, the farmer was endeavouring to enjoy a 1956 standard of living on a 1906 volume of production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 18th April, 1956; I am not quoting from <i>Pravda</i> of which the Minister speaks.  There is an admonition in this to the Minister to get on with his job or get out.  The Minister for Agriculture, when he was in opposition, was very fond of saying that the Department of Agriculture was dominated by Merrion Street and here we have Merrion Street now telling the Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nobody could pretend to be pleased with the results so far.  They must give some special benediction to methods, processes, organisations and individuals that produced goods for the export market in stimulating a greater industrial and agricultural output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder what are the methods the Tánaiste has in mind?  Has he methods not yet known to the Minister for Agriculture in his endeavour to secure a greater output from our farms?  Is this statement of the Tánaiste addressed to the Minister for Agriculture a plain suggestion that unless he succeeds in increasing agricultural output he should get out of office?  The Tánaiste also said that the biggest difficulty they had to face was the fall in agricultural production.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was the export of our cattle and of agricultural production generally that enabled them to buy goods which they could not produce themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste also says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this, the State will have to take a hand in dealing with the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what he means by that.  Perhaps when the Minister for Agriculture is replying he will be able to tell us if he is satisfying the requirements of the Tánaiste when he made that statement before the Society of <Col N="1046" /> Chartered Accountants on April 17th, 1956.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not take the advice tendered to him by Deputy Giles in regard to the breeding of racehorses, greyhound breeding, racing and betting in this country.  Deputy Giles said that increased income to farmers in this country was very badly used, that it went into horse-racing, racehorses and dogs.  It is true, of course, that the bloodstock industry in this country is a useful addition to agricultural production and it is helpful in its own way to remedy the balance of payments position.  It gives useful employment within the State in both racing and hunting, a business that has been regarded as the sport of kings. It also forms the pleasure of the ordinary individual and, in addition to that, it is a very useful adjunct to our production.  I would not care to make any overstatement in regard to the value of our bloodstock to the country. It has an export value and it has also a tourist value.  You cannot have a racing or a bloodstock industry without holding race meetings and you cannot have meetings without public attendances. Apart from that it is a business from which the Minister for Finance gets a considerable sum of money with which to meet current expenditure.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to household coal.  The Deputy will appreciate that the importation of coal is a matter for private enterprise and that it is the primary duty of the coal importing trade to see that the market is provided for.  I may say, however, that, following representations which I made last summer to the National Coal Board in Great Britain and which resulted in an increased allocation last year, the Coal Importers' Association have been advised of a further increase in the allocation for the current year.  I am satisfied that the revised allocation should be adequate to meet all foreseeable demands.  I have impressed on the importers, however, the imperative necessity for ensuring that sufficient of the allocation is imported during the summer months to guard against any possible shortage in the early part of the winter which might arise if shipments were delayed and there was a sudden onset of harsh weather conditions. I have received satisfactory assurances on this point from the importers and I have arranged that my Department will obtain monthly progress reports from them.</P>
      <P>So far as anthracite is concerned, the supply over the past year has been only just sufficient to meet the overall demand.  There is little likelihood of securing increased supplies from abroad and I have met the Irish producers and have enjoined upon them the importance of expanding their production.</P>
      <P>The prices to be charged for domestic coal are kept under review by the Prices Advisory Body in the light of importers' costs and costs of distribution, and that practice will be continued in respect of the coming season.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that during wet weather rain comes through the roof of the school.  I am, however, arranging that the Commissioners of Public Works will have the premises inspected with a view to ascertaining the works which may be required to keep the premises in a serviceable condition, so that steps may be taken to have them carried out.</P>
      <P>It is considered that a new school for senior girls and infant boys and girls to serve the needs of the area should be erected on a new site and that the present school should be utilised for the accommodation of senior boys for some years longer.

I take it other people can answer for themselves; but as far as the Department is concerned, I should like to know is there anything that the Minister for Education or the Department can do, or that has been left undone at any point?  If the Deputy wants to go back over the past 12 years, very well, let him do so; but I assure the Deputy that the matter has received very active consideration and active attention so long as I have had any connection with the Department, and a very considerable amount of assistance has been given to remedy the urgent defects in that area.</P>

Under Section 9 of the Courthouse and Provisions Act, 1935, the county registrar has the right and power to control courthouses and he has a right to let them under certain conditions.  In this case, a rent of 10/- is being paid for the use of the office in the courthouse and that amount, when collected, will be handed over to the county council.</P>

    <P>

    <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&mdash;(Deputy Walsh).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would impress on the Minister that he should do everything he can to encourage the bloodstock industry, not alone for the employment it gives, but because both the bloodstock industry and hunting are valuable assets to the country.  The industry not only brings in a large income from the sales of horses abroad but also in the attraction that it offers to tourists coming here.  The name of this country is very high amongst the bloodstock breeders throughout the world and it would be, I think, a very retrograde step if any action were taken by the Minister which would interfere in any way with this valuable industry.</P>
      <P>Much has been said in regard to the parish plan.  The objects of that plan are to encourage the people of the various parishes to come together, increase the productivity of the land and, according to the pamphlet I have here, to improve the material, cultural and social welfare of the people.  With that idea everybody is in agreement. That is a work to which we should bend our energies, but there is a division of opinion as to how the plan should be operated.  No activity should remain static.  All countries and all peoples are progressive and we must progress with them.  We have a system of county committees of agriculture which has been in existence over a long number of years.  I am sure that if we are to solve the difficulties that now face the people those responsible for the inauguration and prosecution of the parish plan now in operation in 18 parishes in 15 counties, according to this document, will have to see that the work is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> There is at the moment a certain degree of friction between the officers of the local committees of agriculture and the parish agent and a divergence of opinion in these matters.  I wonder what steps are being taken to secure information in regard to increased production within the area in which the parish agent is operating?  What steps, if any, is he taking, or is he taking any steps, to measure up that increase in production in the area in which he is working?  If that could be worked out in some detail, I feel it would be a good guide.  Possibly the officials of the Department may be in a position to supply the answer to that question. The parish agent should know before he starts operations what the volume of production is, so that he can compare that with whatever increased volume may be procured under his guidance.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a parish agent does not necesarily connote the successful operation of the parish plan. The men who own the land will have to co-operate with the officials assigned to this work.  The farmers will have to be in a position to assimilate the advice given and put it to good purpose. In order to do that, our farmers will have to be capitalised to a considerable extent.  It is admitted by most thinking people that our agriculture is very much under-capitalised at the moment.  I do not want anyone to take the impression now that I am advocating that money should be made available to the farmers for this, that and the other.  That is not exactly what I mean.  I mean the land must be capitalised in order to increase the volume of production.  Our farmers should be put in a position where they can obtain the necessary plant, erect the necessary storage and provide themselves with all the other requirements which go ultimately towards increased fertility in the land.</P>
    <P>All that will have to be done on an organised basis.  Possibly, if we had more highly organised farmer organisations, the farmers might be able to do the job for themselves, in the same way as farmers elsewhere have met the problem of under-production in agriculture <Col N="1060" /> and successfully solved it by their own banking system.  It might be unfair to ask the State to intervene or to give very considerable assistance. Nevertheless, if we are to attain the objective adumbrated in the parish plan, we shall have to ensure that in those areas which we represent, every encouragement will be given to our farmers to co-operate fully and to avail to the greatest possible extent of the knowledge and facilities placed at their disposal to do the job they have been asked to do and to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should seriously consider this lack of capital in agriculture at the present time.  I cannot offer any rough-and-ready solution to the problem.  I wish I could.  If I could, I would make a contribution along those lines here.  We all know that if you put money on the market to allow people to purchase something, they straight away purchase in competition with one another.  That is not what is needed.  What is needed is capital to increase production and to get from every acre of land the further unit so essential at the moment in order to balance our economy.</P>
    <P>The parish plan will, of course, be related to all the available advisory services, to the research service and to the proposed institute of agriculture. As a Party, we have expressed our opinion on that institute of agriculture and in that opinion I fully concur.  I am one of those who are all in favour of increased educational facilities for farmers and for the rural communities in general, even if they are not farmers because they can all contribute in their own way to the national wellbeing. I believe that the differences which may exist at the moment in relation to this institute of agriculture will, in time, be solved as have other differences in the past.  It is only natural that innovations should give rise to controversy.  When the institute is established, we will then be in a position to see exactly how it works and any alterations necessary can then be made.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of research.  I think the Minister and his Department should do everything to enable research <Col N="1061" /> to be carried out here.  It is true that in recent years veterinary surgeons have been doing a tremendous job of work and we have now reached the happy position in which we need have no great fear of any serious inroads by disease into our cattle population.  Calf mortality has been practically wiped out.  That will add considerably to the number of cattle.  Naturally such diseases as foot and mouth and anthrax have to be dealt with in a different way.  The possibility is that they may create a certain amount of difficulty in the future, but they can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I come then to the county committees of agriculture.  I do not think it would be fair to by-pass the committees. They have done very useful work over the years with the limited facilities at their disposal.  There may have been occasions when members of these committees indulged in activities that did not come quite within the province of such committees.  These things happen everywhere and it is nothing new in Irish life to have debates on one subject or another at such committees. All in all, these committees have done very useful work.  There might perhaps be a case made for a change in the method of election, but I do not want to go into that matter now.  I know I am not entitled to advocate legislation on the Estimate and apparently such a change would necessitate legislation.  I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Let us deal now with this question of milk and the price of milk.  The price of milk was, apparently, fixed in 1947 by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, and it has not changed since.  I am subject to correction on that.  It was in 1951.  It is true that the cost of production to farmers has increased since then, and there are people engaged in the business, no matter what their political affiliations are, complaining that it is not a paying proposition at the moment.  I have no method of knowing whether it is or not, but I meet these people in business.  We will have to wait until we hear the report of the Milk Costings Commission, whenever we are going to get it.  I think this matter should be considered, and considered <Col N="1062" /> now, so that the people engaged in this business will know exactly what to expect in the matter of prices over the coming year and whether or not they are going to get an increase or a reduction in the price of milk.</P>
    <P>So far as milk production is concerned in the Dublin sales area, we know that, by the fixation of prices, there is a floor put into the market for the people engaged in that business. They have not to depend on the fluctuation of prices in a foreign market for the sale of their milk.  These men are engaged, most of them, in the production of milk on small farms and they are concerned with the supply, on a contract basis, to the firms that purchase the milk.  They buy their cows and feed them and they do not, in many cases, milk them a second year. The cows are sold off these farms either as fat cows or half-fat cows. They go to the beef market, anyway.</P>
    <P>There is, in that, a wastage from the cow population that could be arrested to some considerable extent.  Many of those cows are first class cows, with high milk yields, and are capable of carrying calves for many years.  Owing to the circumstances in which these producers of milk find themselves in regard to the area of land they own, they cannot operate on any other class of policy and they are bound by contract to supply milk at all times of the year.</P>
    <P>These cows are sold for whatever they will fetch in the open market. Any of them that are put in calf, their calves are sold at birth, so that there is no question of these farmers making use of the services provided to increase their herds from calves reared on their own farms from high milk yield cows.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here by Deputy Rooney that farmers are bedevilled by sharp fluctuations in prices.  I do not know whether Deputy Rooney, in making that statement, was bearing in mind the sharp fluctuations inprice dealt out to the farmers for their wheat by the present Minister for Agriculture when he slashed the price by 12/6 a barrel.  Depute Rooney sought to convey also that there was a steady increase in prices for farmers from the date the present Minister <Col N="1063" /> became Minister for Agriculture in the first Coalition.  There was no increase in the price of wheat fixed by Deputy Smith, when Minister for Agriculture in 1947, until the Fianna Fáil Government increased the price by 5/- a barrel in July, 1951.  That is a fact shown by the record and Deputies like Deputy Rooney ought to think twice before they make statements such as he made in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is true that farmers want to have a long-term policy in regard to prices, but the only place in which the Government in this country can give a long-term price for farmers' produce is at home in Ireland.  It has been the policy of this Party, since 1932, to do that in so far as we possibly could.  It is the policy of this Party, now, to have the prices of all our cereals, including oats, related to the prices obtainable for the animals to which they are fed.</P>
    <P>In so far as the tinned meat and dead meat trade is concerned, some of the Deputies opposite do not seem to think much of that business as a trade. I feel that it has a useful function in this country.  It was unfortunate that the business commenced operations here at a time of boom when meat was making fabulous prices on the American market for a short time. Many people rushed in to establish factories and take advantage of the good times that were going.  Many of those people have learned that that business was not as lucrative as they hoped it would be and they are feeling the pinch of the times now, in loss of business and loss of capital.</P>
    <P>I feel it would be unsound to allow businesses such as these to go out of existence.  I know it is difficult for a Government to deal with an individual business and to do anything for it when it is not paying.  In normal times, when meat is not as dear as it has been over recent years, there could be a useful business developed from our tinned meat factories or plants in this country.</P>
    <P>The trouble here is that, when it comes to certain times in the year, we are not in a position to maintain the surplus live stock, and in the fall of the <Col N="1064" /> year when the grass season ends, it is normal for our people to have heavy selling of live stock.  In the year that has gone, that did not happen because the animals were not needed on the far side, and we were left with a carryover. I think there is an opening for the development of this dead meat trade, and as far as tinned meat is concerned, it would provide a means of holding over supplies from the glut period to a time when meat would be needed.  Along with that, it would be a method of giving useful employment within the country.  It has always been the aim of nationally-minded people to do everything possible to process all goods as far as possible before they left the country.  I think some action should be taken by the Government to implement that policy.  I cannot advocate any particular action.  I know it is a difficult matter and something that needs to be carefully investigated and considered.  I am just making a plea, for what it is worth, that this matter be looked into.</P>
    <P>In County Meath, there are several items of agricultural production that merit attention.  While constituting only a small part of the national output, to the individuals concerned they may mean a lot.  Reference was made to this, I think, by Deputy Tully when he spoke on the Estimate and it was also referred to by Deputy Giles and others.  That item of production is fruit, soft fruit, hard fruit, apples, damsons and all the rest of the fruit that is produced within the country. The Minister seems satisfied&mdash;as the previous Minister seemed satisfied&mdash; that everything necessary has been done when the necessary restrictive Orders have been made to prevent the importation of fruit juices or fruit pulp, but something more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister can readily answer by saying: &ldquo;Why do not these people do what was done in Dungarvan?&rdquo; In Dungarvan, they set up a co-operative processing plant and the Minister quite properly makes a contribution from the State to that undertaking, and it is provided for in this Estimate to the extent of some thousands of the pounds.  If our fruit-growers <Col N="1065" /> in County Meath could be induced to go into that line of business, so much the better; but it is very difficult to get them to do this, because such a small amount of fruit is grown per head and the amount of land they have for this business is small.  It is very unfortunate to find, at times of glut, or when there is an increased volume of production from these small holdings, due to hard work by a hardworking class of people, that they have the goods but cannot get the prices. If the officials of the Department were to see some of these people and endeavour to get them to organise themselves into a co-operative society to deal with their own produce, it would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that we have now reached the stage when speakers from this Party who call upon farmers to produce more will not be charged by anybody with making statements leading on the farmers and forcing the farmers to work harder to produce food for people who do nothing except draw public assistance.  We want to get away from that attitude of mind entirely and create among our people a different attitude in regard to this question of farm production.  We want to get away from the idea that has been impregnated into the minds of the people in certain parts of the country, where the small farmers sell their produce to the larger farmers, that the larger farmers are waxing fat and battening on them.  We should aim to get it into the minds of those people who live off the land&mdash;whether in the large cities or the towns in good or middling occupations&mdash;that it is to our lasting welfare that the farmers who produce the food should be paid above the cost of production and that they should get a fair and honest price for it.</P>
    <P>The determination of that price is the problem that is hard to solve.  I admit that, but if we could get that attitude of mind of which I speak, it would be possible, I think, within the next three or four years to secure from our land the increased production necessary for us as a nation to survive, and which would bring to our own <Col N="1066" /> people the benefits that hard work and industry bring to any people.</P>

      <P>I think this is the third week of this Estimate.  Many good things have been said about it and there has been quite a lot of criticism.  I think the best thing about it is that it is not an Estimate introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister.  If we take the previous three years, we had the self-same Minister as we have at present and we had the Government during those years instilling confidence into the farmers&mdash;and there is no section of the community that needs confidence more than they do.  Under the present Minister and the present Government, as for three years previously under the inter-Party Government, the farmers acquired that confidence and they have it to-day.</P>
      <P>I must agree with Deputy Hilliard when he said we must make the farmers appreciate and let them know that they are not ground down or compelled to do this, that or the other.  Is that not how they were treated during the years 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947 while Deputy Hilliard sat idly there as a back bencher and was not allowed to open his mouth, and while the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture compelled the farmers in every possible way to do what Fianna Fáil wanted them to do? Is it not a big change when one hears Deputy Hilliard sitting on the opposite side now saying that we should establish confidence in the farmers and that we do not want to batten them down?</P>
      <P>Let me take his mind back to the year 1947.  He sat behind the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith &mdash;the very man Deputy Hilliard was listening to, the very man Deputy Corry was listening to&mdash;who told them how he would break into their fields and fill them with inspectors, how the clods and the &ldquo;cods,&rdquo; as he put it himself, would be treated if they did not do what he told them.  Then you have Deputy Hilliard and the people of the Fianna Fáil Party saying they always stood for greater production in tillage crops.  You see the way they stood for it&mdash;to compel the farmers to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> When I hear Fianna Fáil talk of milk costings, I wonder if they remember the time they put the dairy farmers into Mountjoy Jail.  They are on the Opposition Benches to-day and they are as mute as mice.  I am glad they are turning over to the policy of encouraging the farmer and of helping him in every way possible because when I look back to the 6th May, 1953 &mdash;a famous day&mdash;I remember the Budget that Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Finance, introduced. What did he say in that Budget?  He said that taxation presses lightly on the land.  What did that mean?  It meant that if, by any trick in the bag, they could remain in office for a few years longer, the farmers would be taxed out of existence.  However, when they are on the Opposition Benches, Fianna Fáil are the most generous people in the world.  When they are on the Government Benches &mdash;never again&mdash;they do everything they can to injure the farmer.</P>
    <P>When we hear Deputy Hilliard and Deputy Corry talk about the cattle trade and about meat production it is very difficult not to think of Fianna Fáil's policy in 1932.  Will Deputies throw their minds back to the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1932?  Do you remember the free meat scheme?</P>

      <P>They went back to 1932, when they should be ashamed to go back that far.  Do they remember what happened the cattle producers then?  Do they remember anything about calves?  Do they know what happened the tens of thousands of calves in those days and do they realise the loss those calves were to us in later years?  They are the people who keep this debate going for three weeks.  I suppose it will go into the fourth week and I should not be a bit <Col N="1068" /> surprised if it went into the fifth week. They have nothing to say: they just keep talking.</P>
      <P>I have some quotations here.  They are not a few wild statements by Deputy MacEntee when he was a Minister and they are not a wild statement by Deputy Smith when he happened to be Minister for Agriculture. Let me refer to a shrewd speaker whom we once had in this House&mdash;one of the three who stepped on the band wagon at one time.  I remember sitting on the Opposition Benches when ex-Deputy Noel Browne stated from the Fianna Fáil benches when Fianna Fáil were in office that it was the job of the Government of which he was a member or of some Government to ensure that people on the land who were not using it properly would either do so or else the Government would take the land from them and give it to people who would be willing to work it.  That was the policy of Fianna Fáil right along the line.  That was not a wild statement by one of them: it was handed down the line to each of them.  The policy was to batten on the farmer and to belittle him everywhere in the world. I do no blame Deputy Hilliard or Deputy Corry who, in those days, sat and listened to that statement by ex-Deputy Dr. Noel Browne.  They had to do it.  They had to sit nice and mild and listen.  I suppose they are glad to-day when they hear about the things which this Government are doing to help the farmer to increase production.  I believe they are glad of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to a statement which was made in the Seanad, a House in which less politics are talked than here.  A very important Fianna Fáil representative in the Seanad said that cattle should be taxed in this country.  There is the attitude&mdash;right along the line.  I put it to the House, through the Chair, that, since I first came here in 1943, in every way they could, Fianna Fáil tried to belittle, injure and take from the man on the land.  They talk about the big farmer and the small farmer.  We in the West fully realise the advantage the larger farmer is to us.  Without him we <Col N="1069" /> cannot live.  In the West we rear the young stock for him.  They are very welcome at Tuam Fair and at other fairs where we sell our stock.  They produce the finished article.  The more they get for it, the better.  They are producing now regardless of the wild statements in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  At the cattle market, yesterday, beasts fetched not less than £6 a cwt.  It is a bad day the <i>Irish Press</i> would bedevil the farmers and the producers of this country with their scare headings. It is all built up for one purpose, namely, to injure the farmer in every way they can.</P>
    <P>The very day that ex-Deputy Dr. Noel Browne told this House that the Government of which he was a member or some Government would have to take away the land from people if they would not work it, and give it to other people who would, we heard another Fianna Fáil Deputy, Deputy Seán Flanagan of Mayo, say that he considered it a privilege to speak after ex-Deputy Dr. Noel Browne's valuable contribution to the debate and that he agreed with every word Dr. Browne said.  Just think of a prominent Deputy from Mayo agreeing that the land should be taken from the people if they did not use it properly and given to other people who would use it.  I wonder who are the people who would use it?  Are they the people of Dublin City?  What do they know about it? Farming is an honourable profession and it is handed down from generation to generation.  I do not intend to delay the House.  I just wanted to point out the fallacy and the codology in the arguments of the people across the House, in their expressions of sympathy for the farmers and in their talk of what they have done and would do for them.</P>
    <P>Since I first became a member of this House in 1943, I have listened to Fianna Fáil and watched their actions. The difference to-day is very great compared with the position some years ago.  It is not merely a question of what the Minister for Agriculture has done.  The important thing is that he has instilled such confidence into the mind of the man with a bit of land, whether it be five acres or 500 acres, <Col N="1070" /> that neither Brownes will take the land nor Smiths will fill it with inspectors nor MacEntees will put taxation on it.  The farmer has that confidence to-day in our present Minister for Agriculture and in this Government. He knows what this Minister stands for and he is not impressed by the codology we hear from the Opposition Benches to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>While listening to the Deputy who has just spoken, and who professes to be a spokesman in the present Government for the farming community, one might be tempted to follow with a speech of a similar type in reply to the one he made, but I do not propose to allow myself to be tempted to follow that line.  I did, however, listen patiently to what he said and I ask the House did he, from start to finish, make one solitary statement of a constructive nature in relation to farming?</P>
      <P>If we are to discuss farming as it should be discussed in this important debate&mdash;a debate to which every member of this House should contribute&mdash; we have to ask ourselves certain questions regarding the position of our whole economy.  There are certain tests which must be applied and if the reactions to them are negative, then we have got to bring about a complete reorientation of agriculture in Ireland. I do not see much point in either a Deputy or a Minister trying to give himself credit for some little improvement that took place in the whole sphere of agriculture, or to denounce somebody on the opposite side of the House for something that went wrong. It is very easy to pick out points on either side to suit a debate here.  Let us ask ourselves a few important questions with regard to what is agreed by all to be the most important industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask myself these questions: Has production improved?  Is there increased production from the land?  Is the number of persons employed in the land increasing or declining?  Is the standard of living for those on the land improving?  The answer to all these important questions in this year, 1956, <Col N="1071" /> is in the negative and while it is so I defy any Minister or any Government to say we have done anything worth while for the industry which we profess to praise on every occasion as the leading industry of this country.</P>
    <P>What has been done to prevent the flight from the land?  Why is it, with all the mechanisation we have in this country, that production is decreasing? Why is it that the actual social standing of a farmer is lower than that of any profession in this country?  Anybody who gets up to argue the contrary is deluding himself.</P>
    <P>There are farmers and farmers. When this Estimate is discussed each year, we are all bent on hearing from the person in charge of the Department what progress was made and what the future may hold with regard to agriculture.  I listened very carefully to the Minister's opening statement, and, while he referred to occasional improvements, innovations or efforts in different fields of endeavour here and there, he has nothing really constructive to say about the future of agriculture.  In fact, if there is one thing to be inferred from the statement he makes, it is that the emphasis is put on grass production and cattle sales, to the detriment of tillage.  When anybody gets up on the Fianna Fáil side of the House to talk about tillage, he is misrepresented by somebody on the other side as denouncing cattle production.  We hear those old slogans about the British market being gone forever.  Even some people still refer to the slaughter of calves and the issue of free beef.  I wonder where these statements are getting anybody now?</P>
    <P>One does not need to be a great economist to be able to see that if we were to concentrate on cattle production and export of cattle, particularly cattle on the hoof, this country would support a very small population indeed. One of the acid tests of progress in any country is an increasing population, with an improved standard of living, and if our economy is not tending towards that end, then we are not, in so far as it is our job, carrying out our duty towards the people of this State.  If our population is declining, <Col N="1072" /> if there is a flight from the land and if actual distaste for remaining on the land becomes psychological, then if that is not killed or completely changed, it is very difficult to say what is going to be the outlook for agriculture generally.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things that could be done.  The land project is held up as a very useful scheme.  Like many other things done for the farmers of this country, it is very useful, but while some of the things to which I have referred remain as they are, anything such as the land project is merely like putting a new slate on a very bad roof.  We have got to try to bring about a complete reorientation of the whole agricultural outlook.  If anybody goes through rural Ireland to-day to the homes where large families were brought up in decency and honesty in the past and sees the number of derelict holdings in each townland, can he truthfully say the farming industry is a desirable one, while so many holdings remain vacant?  They cannot in many cases even be given away.</P>

      <P>That will never get the Deputy anywhere.  Is there any attempt being made to change that situation?  There is not.  Until we reach the stage where the best son in the family will decide to remain on the holding, instead of doing the opposite, which is the case at the moment, we cannot say we have really put agriculture on the proper plane.  The smallholder is the best known in West Donegal where, indeed, we have every type of farm from the large tillage farm and the mediocre type of farm to the small uneconomic holding but, generally speaking, it is the small farm which predominates.  What is the outlook for the smallholders?  What does the future hold for them and their families?  Why do we find so many of these people selling their holdings and buying a single ticket to go across the Channel?  They try to sell their holdings or let them.  They give up their houses and clear out, because they know that if they remain, they must submit to a low standard of living, to <Col N="1073" /> a life of drudgery, to a fear of poverty, with no hope for their families.  When some of these people become of school leaving age, immediately they can get away from the primary school, they emigrate, if they cannot find a job at home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if they find a job at home, it is not on the land.  In regard to the question asked by the Parliamentary Secretary, let me say that I raised in the House recently a parliamentary question to try to ascertain what is the number of such holdings in the country and the Minister pointed out that the information was not as his disposal, which I think is correct.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary or any other Deputy particularly those in touch with the Land Commission, is in a position to know something of the huge number of vacant holdings, derelict holdings, holdings let to neighbours, holdings for sale which cannot be sold on the western seaboard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people who have left their holdings on the western seaboard in the past year is probably greater&mdash;and goodness knows it has been bad enough in the past&mdash;than it has been for a long time. I can say in my own capacity as a small country auctioneer that, no later than yesterday, we had the unpleasant task of selling out the goods and chattels of a smallholder to allow him to emigrate with his family.  It is sad that anybody should stand up here and say that that position is not prevalent. There may be farmers in the Midlands who are wealthy.  I am sure, if they are, it is the result of their hard work, but I do not think that a smallholder in West Donegal, if he went to a bank to-day, would, on the strength of his holding, be given credit for a £5 note. <Col N="1074" /> While that position remains, I do not see much hope for the future of a smallholder in this country.</P>
      <P>Let us ask ourselves is there much that any Minister in charge of the Department can really do to bring about a change in that state of affairs; to what extent should the farmer be assisted or let alone in order that things may take their natural course and find their own level?  There is a tremendous amount of money being directed or channelled into the pockets of the farmers by way of assistance under various schemes, but is it improving the overall situation with regard to our agricultural economy? Is it bringing about an increase in the number of persons employed on the land?  Is it putting any kind of stop to the flight from the land or, above all, is it having any effect on the psychological distaste for remaining on the land?</P>
      <P>It is very easy to find non-farmers telling the people about the grand times there are for the farmer on the land, but the obvious reply of the farmer at the hearthstone at night is: &ldquo;Why did he not remain on the land?&rdquo; That is one question I have never found properly answered.  The farmer's job, and particularly the smallholder's job, is from sunrise to sundown, and long after it.  His standard of living with regard to food, clothing, and so on, is not what he would like to be made public.  When his son returns from England well dressed, with money in his pocket and talks of the time that he has outside the country, it is no wonder, that one, two, or, in some cases, three brothers return with him after his fortnight's vacation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much that could be done for the smallholder, if <Col N="1075" /> we are really to tackle in a serious way the whole position of improving his land, but, until capital is made available for the smallholder or any farmer, there is not much use in putting into effect any of the schemes which, while they are good in themselves, may not dovetail into the general scheme of things.</P>
      <P>There are three things I should like to advocate and to advocate very strongly in so far as the smallholder is concerned.  Number one is more readily available credit facilities.  If farming is the great industry we say it is, why do we not trust the farmer with a little credit, if he goes to the bank or elsewhere to secure it?  Any business or profession in the country will more easily get credit to-day&mdash;and goodness knows, it is not easy to get it at the moment&mdash;than will the farmer.  Yet we are told that he is in the key position in this country, the man who must feed everybody.  That is the first thing, that better credit facilities should be more readily available, especially to the smallholder, if he is to be given that confidence which is necessary if he is to take an active interest in remaining on his holding.</P>
      <P>Number two is the fostering of a greater spirit of co-operation, especially amongst the smallholders. It is not always possible for a smallholder to have, for instance, all the machinery which he would like to possess.  It might be possible, and it is certainly desirable, that a number of farmers in a district should possess between them the necessary machinery to carry out their work.  That is only one phase of co-operation which, if properly established, would take a lot of the drudgery out of farming, would make it easy for the farmer to possess the most modern means of operating his farm with the greatest possible comfort and facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know what co-operation in farming means.  We have seen it working in the past in ways that may now be regarded as antiquated or obsolete. We know how the local farmers, five, ten or 12 of them came together and made their stack of hay.  They spent days with each other and probably <Col N="1076" /> the work would not have been accomplished otherwise.  We know how the farmers come to the bog and cut their turf by means of the co-operative system.  If the system of co-operation with regard to machinery and farm operations generally were officially sponsored and financially assisted by the Government, it would be one very important step towards creating a little more satisfaction, confidence and contentment among the smallholders on the western seaboard.  Thirdly, I agree with all others who have spoken that a better standard of agricultural education should be made available to these people.</P>
    <P>If these three things are made available, they will bring about a complete reorientation of the whole farming economy of the country.  We have various schemes which are all good in themselves, such as the farm-building scheme, the land project, the limestone scheme.  I should like to see the subsidisation of fertilisers extended so that our farmers would have the same advantages as farmers in the North of Ireland with whom we must compete in outside markets.  These are all only parts of a scheme which would tend towards the improvement of the national economy, but certainly, unless credit facilities are made available to the farmer and a better spirit of co-operation infused into agriculture, unless co-operatives of the type I have mentioned are established and improved facilities provided for agricultural education, I do not think it can be said that a really serious effort is being made to do anything of which any Minister can boast in this House.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, no Minister can adopt the rôle of Messiah of the farming industry in this country. Nothing sufficiently important has been done, if anything has been done, to merit that rôle being played by any Deputy or Minister here.  In fact, if we were to add a fourth point to the points I have already made, it would be that the agricultural industry in its relationship to the Government should be lifted completely out of the field of Party politics.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who has just spoken and who is a member of what is supposed <Col N="1077" /> to be the Farmers' Party in this House, devoted his entire speech to reminding the House of what Fianna Fáil did that was detrimental to farming and what they did not do that would have been good for farming.  He was pleased to sit down after that contribution. I do not think that is the proper spirit.  If the Minister takes the same view, that he must arrogate to himself things that have gone right and attribute to world conditions things that have gone wrong and must deride the actions of his predecessor, he is not making a serious effort to fill the responsible rôle of head of the most important Ministry in this country.</P>
    <P>Agriculture affects the life and economy of every individual, irrespective of his calling, to such an extent that a Minister who embarks on any worthwhile scheme is bound at all times to have the backing and support of every member of the House in so far as that member is fit to see that a scheme is advantageous to a particular branch of farming.</P>
    <P>One of the things to which most Deputies referred as one of the nightmares of the farmer is the instability of markets.  The law of supply and demand enters into the whole life and planning of the farming community.  It is really the great bogey against which the farmer has to work.  The farmers are told at one stage that poultry is the most profitable industry and everybody goes into poultry.  Supply improves; prices drop and everybody gets out of poultry.  Next, the farmers are told that the bacon industry is the most prosperous branch of agriculture. The outlook is good; everybody goes into bacon production; the supply exceeds the demand; the price drops and people go out of production again.  So on, with practically every commodity.</P>
    <P>That is not an easy thing to overcome. An effort is being made at the moment to stabilise the bacon industry over a short period.  Personally, I think the period should be longer. To be worth while, it should be a five year period instead of one year. Stabilisation over a period of five years of the price of anything produced on the land is essential to create an assured interest in the production of <Col N="1078" /> the particular commodity.  It is not an easy thing to do.  Nobody should pretend that it is.  It is a very difficult thing but it is one aspect that should be seriously tackled.  Where there is a will there is a way.  Some solution certainly could be found, even subsidisation. Across the Border, from Donegal, there is subsidisation in every direction to encourage farm production. There are subsidies for heifer calves, subsidies for fattened cattle ready for the market, subsidies for practically everything, so that the beast has many punches in the ear by the time it is ready for market, each punch representing a subsidy.  We wonder how we can compete against that.  There is a great deal we can do and a great deal that we would need to do.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything will be achieved by talking about what Fianna Fáil did during the economic war.  I do not want to go into irrelevancies but I have a right to say, and I have said in this House and on public platforms, that when we were fighting an economic war there was a certain principle at stake and we had a right to do anything which we thought would bring about, to our success, the end of that campaign.  All right-thinking people stood behind Fianna Fáil on that occasion, as was demonstrated in their return with overall majorities in each succeeding election.  Some high dignitaries of the Church found it necessary to make public pronouncements in favour of the principle for which we stood at the time.  If the slaughter of calves or the distribution of free meat was a part of a scheme of things which we had to adopt in order to fight that economic war, nobody has a right to get up in this House afterwards to deride the action that was taken.</P>

      <P>Coalition speakers frequently talk of spoon-feeding the farmers.  There has been talk from those benches frequently about what should be done to get more money from the farming community.  A member of the Labour Party recently questioned the Minister as to the feasibility of introducing a tax on tillage. Other members of the Coalition have put the same suggestion in more discreet terms.  There is an urban outlook in the Government and very little sympathy for the rural dweller as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have been talking about confidence in the farming community and about the stability of agriculture should remember one thing.  We have had a serious upward trend in the cost of living recently.  Every time the cost of living increased by a point or two, a certain section of the community went to their employers and demanded an increase in their wages.  They were awarded increases, and rightly so, I suppose.  A suggestion was made by the Parliamentary Secretary that Fianna Fáil had suggested a tax on farmers, as if the farmers were not paying sufficient taxes already.  But let me not deviate from the point I was about to make.  While every other section of employed workers could go to their employers and demand increases <Col N="1080" /> in their income to meet the increased cost of living, what can the smallholders do to-day to cushion themselves against increases in the cost of living which have brought them to ruin?  All they can do is get out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>He cannot do anything to recover himself.  He has got to pay his share of the taxes and he is paying them pretty well at the moment.  Yet, somebody insinuated that he is tax free.  A suggestion was made that Fianna Fáil had actually considered putting a tax on tillage. The small farmer is paying heavy taxes and all he can do is sit back and watch the vicious spiral, and he has no means of cushioning himself against the impact.  The only thing he can do is tighten his belt, reduce his standard of living, or get out.  That does not make for confidence or stability in agriculture.  While we may say certain things with the object of placating somebody or of scoring a point, what really does the small farmer think? Does he think he is living in a paradise?</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may be referring to a few ranchers or large holders.  The smallholder is being put to the pin of his collar.  He is surviving only because he has tightened his belt and submitted himself to a lower standard of living. The people who get up and tell that man he is living in luxury, that he <Col N="1081" /> has confidence and stability may be believed.  If that is so, well and good; if the position is like that nothing we say here will alter it.  Somebody is living in a fool's paradise.</P>

      <P>Here is what the Minister said in his opening statement which I regard as significant:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A great many people over the last 17 years have become so accustomed to living in a sellers' market that they forget, or are prone to forget, the fundamental change that is introduced when we find ourselves in these times in a buyers' market.  We are back once more in the atmosphere of petty, acute competition in the foreign markets in which we trade.  Fortunately we have been able by a series of trade agreements, principally with Great Britain, substantially to mitigate the severity of the impact of that competitive atmosphere; but, more and more as it impacts on us, our success or failure to expand production here will depend on our ability to expand it on terms which will enable us to meet competition, and beat it, both as to quality and price in the markets where we trade.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the farmer should produce more and should accept a lower price for his produce, in order to compete in a foreign market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>Now the Minister goes on to demonstrate how we should increase our cattle population and suggests in column 419 of that report that the future of industry in this country is dependent on an increase in the cattle population.  Let me not give the impression that we should not increase our cattle population.  For some reason or other, Fianna Fáil is very often represented as being against the export of cattle.  But I say, and I defy contradiction, that the economist who says we should concentrate solely on the export of cattle on the hoof is either interested in some other country or does not understand what the economy of this country means to the people.  You cannot have an increase in population on a decent standard of living, if you are to concentrate on the export of cattle alone. If we are not going to build up side by side with that an increase in tillage and home production of food and feeding stuffs for our people and our cattle, then I do not think we are tackling our agricultural industry in the proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a well-known English politician of yesteryear who was reputed never to have read the newspapers, and I am in a somewhat similar position because I confine my <Col N="1083" /> perusal of the newspapers to the &ldquo;Letters to the Editor&rdquo;.  Most of them are intelligent; some of them are idiotic; but all are interesting.  I find that the perusal of these letters keeps me as well abreast of current affairs as if I read the leading articles and the scare headlines.  Since bearing my colleague, Deputy Hilliard, quote from the <i>Independent</i> to-day the words of the Tánaiste, I feel I am not missing much by confining myself to the letters.  They never fail to be informed on current problems by those affected by them.</P>
      <P>I did not discover the slump in cattle prices in the headlines of any newspaper. As the representative of a rural constituency, I could not fail to get the information about it from the farmers of my constituency.  I did not blame the Minister one iota for the fall in the cattle prices.  He had nothing to do with it&mdash;it was due entirely to external circumstances.  However, despite the fact that a rise in cattle prices may also be due to outside circumstances, the Minister also invariably claims credit for that, and on that account he is always open to criticism.  I think the Minister, with his broad cultural background, might remember the story of the old general in Greek mythology who, recounting his victories, always said: &ldquo;In all this the gods had no part.&rdquo;  Whatever gods or gremlins there may be in Merrion Street, the Minister might take care that they would give him a knock, too.  He might remember that there can be no virtue without humility, and he appears to be entirely devoid of it.  Anything that happens for good happens because the Minister wills it; anything that happens for evil happens probably because Fianna Fáil willed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feint attack is good tactics; it diverts attention from any dangers and it covers up any weakness, and I have been wondering if the Minister's attack on the <i>Irish Press</i> was something in the nature of chasing an alibi, and if he had a certain fear of the newspaper's exposures of his inconsistencies and of his failure in certain aspects of his policy.  I would suggest, to go back again to his cultural background, <Col N="1084" /> that he remember the story of &ldquo;Tarquin and the Tulips.&rdquo;  I would prefer to discover points of agreement with the Minister rather than disagreement and continual misunderstanding, and I agree wholly with him that the economic future of the country can only be safeguarded by greater agricultural production.  I agree with him that, so far as cattle and dairy produce are concerned, the home market is entirely saturated.  But every farmer knows that greater production means greater risks, harder work and the investment of more capital, and it is the Minister's responsibility to evolve a policy that will assure the farmers that the risks and efforts they undertake will be justified.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  That has become a platitude, and a platitude is merely the expression of proven truth.  But if the advice that is embodied in that expression is to be put into effect, there must be some encouragement given to those who adopt it.  Waiting for the report of the Milk Price Commission is a drama of far greater interest than &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo;.  It has proved of such deep interest to the dairy farmers that one almost forgets that, when the report eventually comes, it will be probably of mere academic interest.  If we are to induce the farmers to expand the number of cattle in the country, we do not need to wait for the report.  The dairy cow is the centrepiece of our cattle trade and an advance in the price of milk is the method whereby encouragement may be given for an increase in the number of cattle in the country.</P>
    <P>That advance is overdue, and that may be adduced from a fact which we all can regard as proven.  If the price of milk, when it was fixed four or five years ago, was regarded by the Government as reasonable&mdash;and there was no suggestion from any part of the House that it was unreasonable&mdash;then we must remember that, since then, the costs of milk production have substantially increased.  Wages have increased, and the costs of all the materials and equipment needed on farms have increased.  If the price was <Col N="1085" /> reasonable four or five years ago, then an advance in the price of milk to-day seems to be quite justifiable.  If we do not get that increase in the price of milk, we cannot have an increase in the number of cattle in the country. It would be very much easier to increase the numbers of pigs, but a violently erratic market prevents such expansion.  It is not possible, and I think it is even not desirable, to attempt to maintain a dead level of prices, but the continuance of sharp booms and sharp depressions could surely be obviated by some action on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister offers a fixed price for grade A pigs and I hope that the offer will not prove to be a penalty on those who are unable to produce grade A pigs.  It is not by any means a simple matter to reach the grade A standard. Breeding is certainly a big factor in the production of grade A pigs and our progeny testing is as yet merely in its infancy.  Feeding of pigs is also a very important matter and needs a great deal of special attention and personal supervision, if it is to achieve the desired results and if we are to produce a quality that will get anyway near grade A.</P>
    <P>I do not think that much success from the personal or the national point of view can be achieved in pig production by a sort of running in and out of the business.  Only those who keep pigs constantly and make a study of production can hope for a steady remuneration for their efforts.  I believe it is the business of the Minister to create a market condition that will encourage farmers to undertake the work as a constant business rather than on a speculative basis.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to tillage, I must say the record of the Minister is not very inspiring.  Now with the impact of the adverse trade balance, perhaps he will come around to the view that a little extra remuneration for the farmer would be far better business than the continued export of Irish cattle.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to one evil&mdash;the stealing of cattle.  It has become fairly widespread throughout the country. <Col N="1086" /> There appears to be something in the nature of gangsterism or hi-jacking going on in this country since the coming of the lorry.  I believe that a remedy can be found for this evil which is doing a great deal of damage to the cattle trade.  I should like the Minister to examine this matter.  It may be not as bad as it has been reported to me, but I think, nevertheless, that it should be attended to.</P>
    <P>I believe that our farmers generally are as good as those in any other country, but, because of our political and economic history, they are lacking in information of a certain type that has been provided so readily and is at the disposal of farmers in other countries.  I want to say that the fullest use is not being made of education for the purpose of agricultural development.  Strange as it may seem, there is an edict from the Department of Agriculture against the teaching of agriculture in vocational schools.  All the publicists talk about the fact that the teaching of agriculture should be one of the duties of teachers in primary schools.</P>
    <P>I think if the teachers in primary schools concern themselves with the three R's and do that thoroughly, they will be doing a great job for the country.  There is, however, no reason in the world why certain aspects of agriculture should not even be the sole concern of the vocational schools in the country.  As I say, the Department of Agriculture objects to any form of agriculture being taught in the vocational schools.  I think that is completely unwise because we should make the fullest use of our educational resources.</P>
    <P>I know little about the workings of the parish plan.  The Minister's views on it seem to change very often and he has not been quite pinned down. The majority of our agricultural advisers are doing a good job, but some of them are not doing a good job.  I should like to know what directions are given and what supervision there is over these young men going out through the country as agricultural advisers.  Mind you, young men going out through the country, without a direction and without proper supervision, have a very difficult job. <Col N="1087" /> They must be most careful as to their duties, strong in character and they must have the initiative to work so that their job will not become dull and drab.  If the young man does not possess those attributes, he will not take the same interest in his job.  I remember, as a young man, being in the country in charge of other men.  I found that I could direct and discipline these men under my command, but it suddenly struck me one day as to what I did to discipline myself.  In order to try to develop some form of self-discipline, I decided to keep a diary of my activities and I found, as a result, after a month of keeping that <Col N="1088" /> diary of activities, that my production increased substantially.  I wonder if these agricultural advisers keep a diary of their adventures and of what it consists? Are they deeply concerned with greater production among agricultural advisers, because, if they are not, then they will not get greater production from the farmers.</P>
