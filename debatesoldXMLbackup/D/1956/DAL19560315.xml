      <P>When I was speaking last night I had reached the point where I said the time had come to draw attention to the problem in relation to our exports versus imports.  While our exports of industrial products show an increase of roughly 25 per cent., it may be said that the volume of our industrial exports is so small that 25 per cent. may not make a difference. Nevertheless, it is interesting to realise that there is an increase.  The whole problem is in connection with the volume of our agricultural exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in the Labour Party, are convinced that at this stage it is essential not alone for the Government side of the House but for every Party on every side of the House to realise that unless agriculture is placed in its rightful position in this country then, while we are speaking here, the problems which may be aggravated at times outside <Col N="602" /> will naturally increase to such an extent that, financially and economically, our country will suffer most severely.  If we on this side of the House have our problems and responsibilities it must be said that the agricultural community, too, have their responsibilities to the nation.</P>
    <P>In the course of this discussion, some Deputies have been drawing particular attention to the volume of our imports. Let it be said, however, that included in this problem of an adverse trade balance confronting us is quite a large amount of money for agricultural machinery.  It is pleasing to know that the agricultural industry is being mechanised to a greater extent, provided that the mechanisation will tend to increase production.  Those of us on the Labour Party benches consider that if the amount being allocated for the importation of agricultural machinery is included in our adverse trade balance we must be realistic in our approach and say that that, in itself, is sensible spending because the money being provided is for machinery which, naturally, must be classified as of capital value.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past week or so, in answer to a question here, we were told that the number of people employed in agriculture in this country had dropped, within the past year, by about 4,000.  If the members of this House will take notice of the various ploughing matches throughout the country they will see that, while the number of tractors has greatly increased, the number of horses engaged in such contests has decreased.</P>
    <P>With the advantages offered to agriculture and the inducements offered in the way of the encouragement of the provision of machinery for the advancement of agriculture, surely we are entitled to ask what has happened. Surely we are entitled to say that there is something seriously wrong when, in contrast to the increase in the volume of our industrial production, agriculture is lagging behind so much.</P>
    <P>I believe, as the other members of the Labour Party believe, that one of the faults can be traced to this very Assembly.  Rightly or wrongly, all over <Col N="603" /> the years, it has been the habit of members from both sides of the House, in order to outbid other Parties and to secure added votes from the agricultural community, to offer inducements by way of grants of all sorts. Let us, for one moment, consider that last year the amount of money paid out in hard cash by way of grants came to about £12,000,000.  We of the Labour Party realise the necessity of giving the utmost support to agriculture but surely we must be prepared to admit that many of the grants that have been given out have been given for the purpose of securing votes.</P>
    <P>Many of the millions of pounds that have been paid out would have been better utilised to encourage production by way of a guaranteed minimum price or by way of an added inducement such as a bonus for increased production, over and above a set figure.  If we are going to continue our attitude of giving a couple of pounds here and there for the erection of a couple of piers and a few pounds somewhere else for the putting in of a water supply or the building of a hay shed, we should remember that we have been doing that for years without giving any return to the community in the way of increased production.</P>
    <P>Whether the Opposition likes it or not, I, as a member of the Labour Party, am facing this problem as we will all have to face it.  £40,000,000 has been given out under the Land Project Act.  That amount of money must be paid back, plus a tidy amount by way of interest.  That money is being utilised, I hope, for the fertilisation and betterment of the land of this country but it cannot be forgotten that the whole community must pay it.</P>
    <P>While we are severe on the industrial section of the community&mdash;and I am prepared to be as severe on the industrial community as anybody else &mdash;if at any time they think it necessary, for the purpose of securing higher dividends, to keep production lower than the demand, we must also be prepared to speak plainly to any other section of the community which we believe has a vital interest in the <Col N="604" /> country but which has, too, a vital responsibility to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Whether it be this Government, some past Government, or some future Government, that are concerned, they must get away from these attempts to make paupers of the rural section of the community through the method of giving them small grants.  Sooner or later they must come to the time when they will have to put into operation a policy which will give to the rural community a true sense of values, which is badly needed in the rural Ireland of the present time, and which will give to the community generally a better return.  Until we come to such a stage we know that, no matter how we may talk about increasing production, we cannot increase our agricultural exports and until we can do that we must admit the complete failure of national Government here.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible thing to realise that some commodities can be brought in from as far away as New Zealand and sold here, without subsidy, in the home market, at a price lower than commodities produced at home and subsidised. I would appeal to members of the Opposition, that no matter what their attitude may be towards the policy of the Government, it is essential for them to approach this problem, which is so important to the country as a whole, in a national manner.  We know that, in order to achieve prosperity, our exports must increase.  We know also that no matter how we may expand exports in the industrial field these products will be going into markets where the competition is much more keen from the industrial point of view.  We know that from the viewpoint of agriculture a wide field of markets is open to us.</P>
    <P>But the tragedy of the whole matter is that, when we hear Deputies getting up here and drawing attention to the fact that prices are not high enough, that the prices of wheat, barley and oats are too low, we know at the same time that it is the misfortune of rural Ireland that while people want an increase in price they are not interested in increasing the volume of agricultural produce put on the market. That is what is happening in this country to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that it is correct.  The dairy farmers from Cork paraded here in Dublin within the last week or two.  That is their own business but I know that many of these people who are looking for a higher price for their milk keep milch cows which are only giving from 250 to 300 gallons.  If you ask these people to step up their production to put on the market they will say that you are a lunatic or a Bolshie who is looking for their land.</P>
      <P>The fact is that we have been advising the industrial manufacturer to increase his production.  I have been as severe on the industrialist as I have been on anybody else but the industrialists have been doing their best to increase their output to the greatest possible extent.  That means that they are not only supplying the home market but that they have a surplus which they are trying to put on the export market.  We know also, that, as far as agriculture is concerned, although we have 12,000,000 acres of arable land in this country, there are people in Dublin and Cork and other cities who are not able to get as much as they want of our agricultural produce. No matter what Deputy Aiken may say about the one shilling per gallon for milk, the farmer must realise that if he produces two gallons of milk instead of one gallon, he will make more money.  Until Deputies and farmers realise that we must get into the export market with our agricultural produce, there cannot be any real prosperity in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politics will not increase the price of agricultural produce and politics will not put into the pockets of the working people in this country more money to provide themselves with the necessities of everyday life as far as agricultural items are concerned; but if we could face the economic outlook without the political wangling and tangling, it would help the farmer to remember that the State is willing and determined to assist him.  We know that the majority of the Irish people have a sound, sane philosophy of life. If they are prepared to add to that the <Col N="606" /> incentive of increased production and forget a little of the political wangling and tangling that has been going on here for the last 30 years, the community as a whole would be far better off and the farming community would be even better off than it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>In relation to this whole problem we cannot for a moment leave out the terrible national sore of emigration. Speaking last night, I tried to concentrate on the necessity of realising that there are roughly 70,000 or 71,000 people unemployed.  But it is useless for us just to pay lip service to that if we are going to admit that, no matter what Government may be in power, emigration is going to continue&mdash;enforced emigration as distinct from voluntary emigration.  We all know that some people may be anxious at any time to travel; that is their own business. But we have a duty towards the unfortunate people who, through economic necessity, are compelled to emigrate.  We say to the Government that it is essential in the period of time that is left to us that we strive to secure, by way of increased industrial and agricultural production, that the terrible blight of young men and young women having to leave their country and go abroad is remedied. We know it is impossible, even in a term of 20 years, to hope that we could get a big slice cut off it, but we must not waste any time in seeing that, not alone is unemployment brought down to a lower figure, but that emigration is also reduced.</P>
    <P>Speaking for the Labour Party, I cannot say that I could for a moment agree with the policy of Fianna Fáil in relation to emigration.  They may say that emigration is at its highest level when the inter-Party Government is in power; whether that is correct or not, I do not mind.  While I do not usually waste time giving quotations from any member of this House, it is essential at times that we make clear, not alone to this assembly, but to the country as a whole, where we stand in relation to all Parties. Speaking in this House on the 19th October, 1939&mdash;Volume 77, column 866 &mdash;a prominent Minister of the then <Col N="607" /> Fianna Fáil Government is recorded as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it would be a very unwise thing for this Government and for the people of this country to accept as a duty the task of providing employment for everybody who chooses to come back to this country now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely, when Deputy MacEntee, who at that time was Minister for Industry and Commerce, wished to make it so clear in such words that we should not have any responsibility towards unfortunate Irishmen, who at that time were anxious to come back rather than wear the uniform of a British nation&mdash; wear the uniform of a country at that time going into a war&mdash;it must be admitted that one of the most damnable statements ever made in this House in relation, not alone to emigration, but to the return of Irish exiles, was that statement.  I do not believe in that policy.  We consider that, in co-operation with the other Parties in the inter-Party Government, our approach to that problem will be completely different from that which led a member of the Government in 1939 to make such a statement.</P>
    <P>It is strange that, even during the course of this debate when members of the Opposition are belabouring us over the increased cost of living, introduced as they say, by these levies, one of their ablest exponents&mdash;one of the ablest men they have, as we all know &mdash;seems to take a different line.  I am glad he is in the House because this matter and this discussion is of such importance to some of us that we are most anxious to try and get the clear-cut views of people, irrespective of politics.  Is it correct that Deputy Lemass's view is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be said, however, that in present circumstances any rational determination of priorities would put increases in non-productive public services well down the list.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently it is.  If that is so, are we not forced back to the position of asking what is our position in relation to non-productive public services?  Do <Col N="608" /> they classify social welfare benefits as such?  Do they say to the people that in present circumstances such benefits cannot be given to the people&mdash;that they must be far down on the priority list?  If they do, is it not quite clear that the road between the Opposition and between ourselves is widening time after time because, while we plead for the unemployed man, while we strive for increased production either in industry or agriculture, we also say that each Party, whether in Government or in Opposition, is bound by the Christian, moral duty of seeing that no hardship shall be inflicted on those who, of necessity, must depend on what has been termed by Deputy Lemass as one of the items of the least productive public services?  It is because we are convinced of the necessity of providing for these people that we strive to increase the volume of our exports and the number of people in employment, industrially or otherwise, by providing the extra money to secure for these people the right of enjoying a decent life.  It is on that our support to this Government is given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry&mdash;I notice he is missing &mdash;complained last night about the price of razor blades.  Probably he is getting a few now before prices go up.  Deputy Corry spent a lot of time last night complaining about the increased cost of living owing to the various items which are included in the taxes.  The view of Deputy Lemass, as stated in Mallow recently, was that the taxes raised under a Fianna Fáil Government would be those which would tend to reduce the consumption of non-essential imported goods.  If that is so, is it not clear that Deputy Lemass agrees with us?  Is it not correct to say that included in the list of commodities about which we have been hearing so much for the past few days there is a certain number which must be classified as non-essential goods imported into this country?  Deputy Lemass agrees with us in that respect. Therefore, why should we have to listen to so many divergent views from the members of his own Party?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragedy of the <Col N="609" /> whole situation is that politics seem to divide every Party to such an extent that we are going to continue the attitude that anything we do must be wrong and anything you do must be right.  There is bound to be a certain element of right in the views expressed both by the Government and the Opposition.  A period of 35 years has now elapsed since we had a certain situation in this country and the sooner we realise that we cannot expect the people to live on the glories of the past and the sooner we realise our duty towards providing the people with the wherewithal to meet the cost of living now and in the future the better.  The sooner we approach the economic problems confronting us in that respect, the better for ourselves as Party men and the people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, a false impression is being purposely conveyed to the people that the imposition of these levies will mean an increase in regard to every one of the items procured on the home market.  It is well to let the public know that there is no justification for the home manufacturer saying that because there is a levy on the imported article he will increase his price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of a large number of the items on the list, the home manufacturer was able to put them on the market up to the past few days at a given price and nobody can say that the taxes levied on the imported articles can affect the price on the home market.  However different our approach to these over-all problems may be, it is time we endeavoured to stop trying to gull the people.  It is only natural that our approach to all these problems should be coloured by the different political outlooks of the various Parties, but we ought, at least, to be at one in trying to hammer out a constructive policy and to get people outside to understand that the taxes imposed on foreign imported articles will, in the first place, mean increased production of home-manufactured articles which will give increased employment and that there is no justification, as some people are trying to suggest, for the belief that the home manufacturer can now reap the reward of increased prices as a result of the <Col N="610" /> tax on some of these imported commodities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is not to be criticised for at long last doing something about the rapid deterioration in the balance of payments position. They are to be criticised because the measures they have announced are ineffective and inadequate and because they have given no indication of having any idea of how the position can be permanently rectified. They are also to be criticised, and will be criticised, because by their own policy and many ministerial statements during the course of the past year or so they have greatly aggravated the problem with which they are now trying ineffectually to deal.</P>
      <P>This country has had a deficit in its international payments in every year since the end of the war.  In some years it was a considerable deficit and in others not so considerable.  There have been only two occasions upon which the situation appeared to be getting out of hand, requiring immediate action by the Government.  One was in the last year of the first Coalition, in 1951, and the other is now.</P>
      <P>The situation in 1951 was serious enough but not quite so threatening as the situation now because there were international circumstances of a temporary character then operating which do not exist now.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his speech in this debate said that the position which is developing is one that no Government could ignore or fail to deal with.  The most interesting feature of the debate so far has been the marked contrast between the speeches made by members of the Government now and those they made when the Fianna Fáil Government in 1951 was trying to rectify a similar situation.  On that occasion they did not appear to realise that there was such a problem as we contended existed in relation to our balance of payments.  They scoffed at the whole idea.  They denied there was any need to take action and that there was any problem which the Government could not ignore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any widespread public misunderstanding about the gravity of <Col N="611" /> the situation, it is because of the attitude they took then, because of the recollection of the campaign that they conducted throughout the country to disparage the Government then in office and to defeat the efforts it was making to cope with the situation with which they are now faced.  When in 1952, the Fianna Fáil Government tried to handle a similar situation, we got little help from any members of the Government in getting public understanding of the need for action.  We got, on the contrary, continuous assertions from presumably responsible leaders of the Parties now in the Coalition that there was no need for action; that there was no problem to be dealt with and even that what was happening&mdash;the growth in the deficit in the balance of payments&mdash;was, in fact, something that we should welcome.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the present Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, scoffed at the suggestion that the country was spending more than it could afford, more than its production would support. He said, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 9th June, 1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Of all the most ludicrous and inappropriate catchwords which have been produced in the economic debates of this last year, none is more irritating or less justified than the suggestion that we are living beyond our means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, who was then regarded as the financial expert of the Coalition groups, was reported in the Press on the 10th May, 1952, as saying: &ldquo;It is the height of nonsense to say that the country is living beyond its means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, the present Tánaiste, speaking in the Dáil as reported in Volume 127, column 603, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are told that we are consuming too much, that we are eating too much, that we are wearing too much clothes, and that we are enjoying a standard of living such as we ought not to aspire to&mdash;that, generally speaking, we are living beyond our means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> He went on to add, at column 609:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If anybody believes in these theories on economics, he is welcome to them, but I think that they are the economics of the mentally deficient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Finance during the course of the election campaign, as reported in the <i>Leinster Leader,</i> described the balance of payments as a fetish, on the altar of which the employment of many of our people was being sacrificed.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that members of the Government have awakened to economic realities even if they do not know what to do about them and even if the actions they are proposing to the Dáil are suggestive of panic.  It is a good thing that the public of this country should be awakened to economic realities also.  Will the Minister for Finance, who says that the present position is one that no Government could ignore or fail to deal with, say that the position that arose in 1951, the similar position, was one which no Government could ignore or fail to deal with?  The actions taken by the Fianna Fáil Government then were denounced as cruel, unjust and unnecessary, but they put the position right, and when the present Government came into office in 1954 they were able to record that the deficit in the balance of payments was the lowest in any year since the war.  Have they any hope that the measures they are taking now will be equally effective?</P>
    <P>I have said that the proposals of the Government in relation to this situation are inadequate and ineffective. There was in our visible trade last year a deficit of £94,000,000.  Our imports exceeded our exports by that amount. There was, according to the Minister's calculation, a net deficit, taking all items into account, of not less than £35,000,000.  On his own admission the sum total of his proposals here will, if all his expectations are realised, be a reduction of imports by about £7,000,000 and if the terms of trade turn against us this year, as he expects, it is not impossible that the deficit in 1956 will not be less than it was in 1955 and may be more.</P>
    <P>Is the Government satisfied that the <Col N="613" /> measures they have proposed to the Dáil, these 68 new duties which they have imposed, will be adequate to deal with the situation?  Have they any other proposals to make, any more constructive ideas to put before the House for its consideration?  They hope, by these numerous duties, to reduce the value of our imports by £7,000,000.  During last year we imported £10,000,000 worth of wheat, barley and other cereals, and £2,000,000 worth of sugar, that could have been produced here.  Has the Minister or the Government any proposals for getting them produced here this year?  Surely it would be far more beneficial to this country to reduce the adverse trade balance by getting these imported goods produced here where we can produce them than by imposing unnecessary burdens on our people by forcing up the price of goods that they may desire to purchase.</P>
    <P>There is no need for the Government to clap itself on the back and congratulate itself because it is making it harder for people to buy things that have to be imported and things that they may need.  That was not their attitude when this matter was being debated here in similar circumstances before.  Let me read a quotation from a speech delivered by Deputy McGilligan in the Dáil on that occasion, as reported in Volume 127, which I think is not inappropriate to the proposals now before the Dáil.  He said in column 1717:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If people who have reserves want to spend them, why should they not do so?  Have we not got at least to that degree of liberty in this country where a man, if he has a few hundred pounds and wants to buy a wireless set with it or improve his house by putting in a wash-basin or by putting in new carpets or furniture, is at liberty to do it?  What is the merit in preventing him from doing it?  We are getting completely authoritarian if we say that even the owner of savings who has reduced his consumption at an earlier period in order to get those savings cannot put those savings to some purpose which he considers advantageous if not profitable to himself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> It is not an advantage to this country to impose restrictions which will make it impossible for people to buy many of the things upon this list by making them dearer.  That is a hardship which must be recognised and described as such, justifiable, perhaps, as a temporary measure, but only if the Government has behind it proposals for permanent rectification, for making it possible for us to buy and import those things in the future and to have the standard of living which their availability represents.  In that respect we have received no suggestion of a plan or a policy from any member of the Government who has spoken in this debate.</P>
    <P>These proposals, or some similar proposals, might be justifiable or excusable as representing a temporary device pending the effective application of constructive policies or the coming into office of another Government, which would mean the same thing, but they are not to be represented as something advantageous to this country.  It is not contemplated that any of these proposals will have a protective effect.  They may, incidentally, have that, but firms who may benefit have been warned that they are to be regarded only as temporary and removable at will at the discretion of the Government.  It is, furthermore, exceedingly doubtful whether they will have the effect of reducing the flow of imports at all.  If the increase in the volume of imports last year was due, as the Minister said, to excessive spending by the Irish public, to the availability of purchasing power which was in excess of the amount distributed through production and productive effort here, then that purchasing power will find an outlet somewhere and, if it is prevented from being utilised for the purchase of the goods which are listed in the schedule to the Minister's Order, it will be utilised for the purchase of some other goods and, maybe, perhaps imported goods at that; so that there is no assurance whatever that the effect of all these Orders made by the Government will be to reduce imports as a whole, though they may and probably will reduce imports of the listed goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> The Minister has said that if these restrictions are not effective there will be further restrictions.  That is the prospect which they are now holding out to the people of this country.  In view of the unattractive nature of that prospect, there surely is an obligation on members of the Dáil not in the Government, no matter in what part of the House they sit, to urge on the Government that they should start doing some constructive thinking.  For good or ill, they are the Government of this country for the time being, and what they do or say will be decisive in its effects upon the public welfare.</P>
    <P>Are they thinking only of the symptoms of the illness that is affecting the national economy?  Is their sole concern to conceal those symptoms by artificially cutting down imports, many of which are desirable imports, or are they seriously examining the circumstances to find out the real causes of our troubles with a view to cradicating them?  These restrictions are going to have an effect upon employment.  That is certain.  Has the Government made any estimate of what that effect will be?  Have they examined the position in any of the trades that are likely to be prejudicially affected by these restrictions to find out how many men are going to lose their jobs by reason of that Order?  Or do they care?</P>
    <P>Surely a Government that was concerned about the effect of its acts upon the public welfare would have made some examination of the likely consequence of its decision on the employment of workers and be able to give the House some estimate of what that consequence will be.  Do the Government know how many men are likely to be deprived of their employment by reason of the Orders they have made? It is certain that some will be.  Is there any arrangement in contemplation to ensure that new employment opportunities will open up elsewhere to offer the prospect of alternative work for those who are likely to be affected?</P>
    <P>I have said, and I repeat, that to a very great extent the situation with which the Government is now faced <Col N="616" /> has been aggravated by their own policies and by their own statements. The Minister for Finance said in his introductory speech that we cannot vote ourselves progressive increases in our standard of living.  Who told the people that they could?  Who campaigned up and down this country to tell the people that lower prices, lower taxes and better times were to be secured merely by voting, merely by going to a polling booth and marking ballot papers as they directed?  Who told the people of this country all during last year that, if prices rose, people could protect themselves against the consequences of rising prices by getting more money, more wages, more remuneration of one kind or another&mdash;that they could be better off notwithstanding the fact that prices were rising and production was falling?</P>
    <P>When last October I brought in here a motion of no confidence in the Government because of its failure to make any attempt to redeem its election pledges to lower the cost of living, there was an amendment moved, supported by every member of the Government, in which that fallacy was repeated, that people could protect themselves against rising prices by getting higher wages and on every occasion when the matter was debated here that opinion was expressed by some member of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance now tells us that there is some connection between higher wages and still higher prices.  Why is he so mealy-mouthed about it?  Why not say out openly and clearly what the connection is?</P>
    <P>Do they not think the people of this country are entitled to get leadership from the Government in office in a matter of that kind?  Do they not realise how important it is to get it understood by every section of our people that a higher standard of living can come only as a result of higher productivity, higher output?  Is it not about time that this fallacy that people can vote themselves a higher standard of living, vote themselves lower prices, lower taxes and better times, should be finally killed?  The Minister's meagre attempt in his speech to propagate a new viewpoint on behalf of the <Col N="617" /> Government is futile unless all the members of the Government who have been saying the very reverse during the past six months will stand up and reiterate what he has said.  If the speech which the Minister for Finance made here on Tuesday, if the Orders which the Government brought into force that night, have shocked public opinion, it is because public opinion was not conditioned to receive them, because they represented such a complete reversal of the previous attitude of the Government that the public were unable to follow them.</P>
    <P>I have said here in an earlier debate and I repeat now that it was the promise of the Coalition Parties to reduce prices, their assertions that it was practicable to reduce prices and their subsequent failure to do so, that were responsible more than anything else for the general urge that there was last year by every section of our people to get more money, to get the higher standard of living which the lower prices would have represented but which they were denied.  During all that period there was no Minister who had the courage to stand up and say that that was an illusion, to warn the people that there was a connection between higher wages or higher remuneration of any kind and still higher prices, to tell them that they could not get themselves by their votes, their decisions or their resolutions, a higher standard of living, that that could only be got by the road of work and productivity.</P>
    <P>Has the Government attempted to diagnose the cause of this situation which has developed?  Why is it that there has been this increase in imports, this upsurge of spending which resulted in the increase in imports? Was it not reasonable to think that when a Minister came to the House with a whole series of proposals to deal with a situation that he described as threatening he would attempt to explain the Government view as to the origins of that situation?  What brought it about?  It is no answer to say that similar circumstances have developed in other countries.  The Government in these other countries have tried to diagnose the causes and to <Col N="618" /> explain the causes to their people and, in so far as they have done so, the circumstances that operate elsewhere do not operate here.  We have this inflation of imports, this upsurge of consumer spending, in circumstances completely different from those which have created problems elsewhere and there is a need to examine that position, to analyse it and to explain to the people precisely what has happened.  How can the public co-operate with the Government or with any plan that the Government may eventually devise, or how can they be brought to accept the restrictions the Government are now imposing, without having explained to them what is happening?</P>
    <P>Why is it that there was this expansion in consumer spending last year, this enormous increase in imports which has jeopardised the whole national economy?  Is not there an obligation on some member of the Government to attempt to analyse that situation for the public information?</P>
    <P>There are two possible causes.  One is that, somehow, there was an injection into our economy of more money which did not represent more work or more production.  The other is that there has developed in the minds of the people the belief that more money for less work is Government policy, that the Government regard it as a practical policy and that everybody is consequently free to spend up to the limit of his income without any fears of the consequences.  If that belief exists, and I believe it does exist, the responsibility for it rests squarely and fairly on the shoulders of the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>In any case, it is quite clear that anything the Government have done so far can have a merely temporary effect.  It offers no prospect of a permanent rectification of this situation. Have we to reconcile ourselves to steady, continuous lowering of our standard of living?  Is the only prospect the Government holds out to the people one of mounting restrictions upon imports, a forcing down of the standard of living of our people by depriving them of the imported goods which they may desire to buy, goods of a character not now being produced <Col N="619" /> here?  Have they any plan, any idea for a plan, any suggestion to make as to how the people can help them, can help the country, can help themselves to secure the rectification of this position in a permanent way which will enable us to enjoy our present standard of living and enable us possibly to increase that standard of living while at the same time avoiding these heavy deficits in our international payments?</P>
    <P>The Government bleats about increasing production.  Will they come out of the cloud of generalisation and get down to the solid ground of particular products?  What are the classes of goods, the production of which they think can be increased here and what are they going to do to bring about that increase?  All this exhortation to the people to produce more, all this talk about the need for increased production, is futile if it is not followed up with an effort by some Minister to pin-point the directions in which the public can help and in which increased production is practicable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was speaking some moments ago about the attitude of farmers to increased production and he was blaming them for their failure to expand output and criticising all previous Governments for all the grants and assistance they gave to farmers without getting the desired results.  Every member of this House who has any contact with the rural community must know that there is a general belief among the farming community that increased production does not pay.  There is a general belief that higher output invariably means lower prices.  They regard themselves as being urged to risk more effort and more capital in expanding production without any prospect of greater reward.  That is a factor in the situation.  It may be that we may think that idea of the farmers to be wrong; we may feel that in present circumstances, even if it is true, we should still strive to get higher output because the country will benefit by it, but when Ministers talk about the need for higher production they cannot ignore that fact, and it is a fact that has to be dealt with before any plans or any proposals for increasing output can produce results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Has the Government any idea as to how that attitude of the farming community to the matter of increasing output can be changed?  Have they any suggestions to make, any practical proposals to put before the Dáil for its consideration which will deal with that definite fact bearing upon the whole question of national policy here and now?  No exhortation to increase production will be effective so long as that belief persists.  If higher output must mean lower average prices&mdash;and it is difficult to argue that it will not&mdash;has the Government any proposals to bring down production costs so that farmers will gain in increased profits from their greater efforts?</P>
    <P>In relation to manufacturing industry we have the Government apparently building all its hopes upon the illusion that there will be an inflow of foreign capital to develop our industrial potentialities.  That is a complete illusion; it is not going to happen. I do not say that no foreign capital will come in but there will be no very substantial industrial development because of an inflow of foreign capital. I realise politicians are always unwise when they commit themselves to prophecies but that is one I make with confidence.  It is a complete illusion to think that we can sit back and wait for foreign financiers to come in and push our industrial expansion forward. Because that illusion has been created, no attention is being given to the specific problems holding down the development of industry by Irish enterprise and the utilisation of Irish resources. It is obvious there are factors operating at the present time to restrict our industrial development.</P>
    <P>In his speech here the Minister for Finance spoke about the abnormal cost of money and said that capital funds are dear and scarce.  That is a simple problem for the Government because the Government has the power to relieve itself of the consequences of that situation if it choose to use the power.  For the Government it is a problem which can be readily solved if they want to solve it; it is an insoluble problem for the private industrial group that wants to get ahead with a new industrial project.  A number of industrial projects are being held back <Col N="621" /> at the present time because of anxiety about the prospect of raising capital and he would be a courageous man who would urge that any substantial issue of shares to the Irish public would find a ready response at the present time.  There are others who feel that the price of money is such that an industry starting under present circumstances would carry a permanent handicap.</P>
    <P>Why is money scarce and dear?  This was not the Government's policy even a few months ago.  This time last year we had the Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, saying here in this House as reported in Volume 149, column 227:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An essential part of our policy is that the price of money borrowed for capital expenditure must be low. Ours is the policy of cheap money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And on the same occasion we had the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The day of borrowing by an Irish Government at 5 per cent. is gone and gone forever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other declarations of the same kind were made by other members of the Government holding out to the country the prospect of cheap money.  It was asserted that never again would an Irish Government have to pay 5 per cent. for a loan.  What has happened to change that situation?  Have the Government attempted to make any examination of the circumstances that have arisen which have so reversed the position in their view in the course of 12 months?  Why is money scarce and dear?  The Minister for Finance must surely be doing something more than wringing his hands about it.  Can he answer that question here in the House?  Why is it that at the present time in this country capital for public or for private purposes is scarce and dear?  No one can see any development in this country which can have brought about such a change in 12 months as to explain that situation.</P>
    <P>There has been, undoubtedly, a development in Britain and it may be that the explanation for the scarcity and the high price of capital here is what has happened in Britain.  But is <Col N="622" /> that something we are going to allow to continue without any effort on our part to remedy the situation or protect ourselves against its consequences?  In Britain, investment in manufacturing industry has run far ahead of the estimates of the British Government. The British Government publishes an economic forecast at the beginning of each year and in 1955 investment in industry far exceeded what was calculated in that forecast.  Investment in manufacturing industry, according to a statement published in the last couple of days, increased in 1955 by 18 per cent.  There is a demand for capital to finance the expansion of the British economy which is the only possible explanation of the scarcity of capital funds here and of the price our people have to pay for them.</P>
    <P>Other countries have had similar problems to deal with and have dealt with them.  I do not know how effective the measures they took have proved or will prove to be, but is it the view of the Government here that we can do nothing about that except sit back and deplore it?  Are we to see our prospects of industrial expansion here held up until some change has occurred in Britain, some change which we can neither influence nor control, to make capital available for the financing of the industrial projects which are ready to start if these problems can be overcome?</P>
    <P>Ministers are pleading with the people to save, and exhortations have been addressed to all classes of people that they should save money.  Saving committees have been set up.  Exhortations of that kind do little good in the absence of prospects of price stability. Nobody in his right senses will exert himself to save when the outlook is one of continually rising prices.  He faces the probability that the money he saves will buy less one year or two years hence than it will buy now.</P>
    <P>Those who invested in the recent Savings Bonds have no reason to congratulate themselves upon their response to the Minister's exhortation to save money.  They have already lost in capital value more than half the interest that they will get in the first year. I would like to know if the Government <Col N="623" /> knew when they were urging the people to subscribe to the 5 per cent. loan issued a few weeks ago that they were going to issue national savings certificates at the rate of 4 per cent. tax free.  Did they not have their tongues in their cheeks when talking to the investing public about the advantages of subscribing to the bonds and to some extent misleading the public when commenting on the terms?</P>
    <P>If there is to be a permanent solution to this problem, and a permanent solution can come only through an expansion of production, it is clear the Government must take a very definite part in bringing that about.  It will not just happen because they make speeches for the need for it.  The solution will have to be planned and directed and led on by incentives and checks provided by the Government, and in so far as it is possible for them to get a response from the public in that regard, they can get it only by coming down to earth and specifically indicating the things they want&mdash;the things they regard as practicable to do&mdash;and by giving the assurances necessary to get the right response from the public.  There is this problem of the scarcity and dearness of money here when there is nothing in our circumstances to justify it.  The scarcity of capital funds is not due to any sudden expansion in capital investment here in recent months.  On the contrary, all the indications are that there probably was a net disinvestment here last year.</P>
    <P>The increase in consumer spending may have eaten into savings to some extent and diminished the amount available for new investment but it is not the whole explanation of what has happened.  In this situation we just cannot afford to follow routine procedure. This country is faced with a crisis, whether the Government like that term or not.  In relation to that situation they have got to take, and will be justified in taking, crisis measures in order to protect our people against the consequences which are now threatening them, against the situation which present trends indicate may arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> The debate on this Vote on Account has very largely concentrated upon the specific proposals mentioned by the Minister for Finance when introducing it rather than with the Estimates.  In so far as any indication has been given in the Book of Estimates, the Government apparently do not consider there is any obligation on them to do what they are urging the public to do.  There is no sign of any effort on their part to curtail expenditure, no sign of any effort on their part to lessen the burden of taxation which the level of expenditure involves for the people.  On the contrary, the Minister for Finance has warned us to face the Budget with fear and trembling.  That, of course, may have been a political bluff.  He may have been building up these apprehensions for the purpose of allaying them when the Budget proposals come before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>However, if Ministers' statements are to be believed the country has got to face a heavy increase in its tax burden in the Budget because of the Government's failure to fulfil or even attempt to fulfil any part of their election pledges.  They sent one of their most prominent members to Radio Éireann during the election campaign in 1954 to broadcast a statement, heard by hundreds of thousands of voters, in which a pledge was given to reduce the cost of Government by no less than £10,000,000 a year.  Surely some explanation is due why the Government not only failed to keep that pledge but why the cost actually has gone up by £10,000,000.  Some apology is at least due to those whom they misled by that statement by a responsible representative of the Coalition parties. We will have other opportunities of discussing the details of the Estimates. There is not any evidence of any great change in policy in any Department, but the over-all picture is one of administrative costs mounting out of control.  There is no evidence of any efforts being made by the Government to deal with that situation or to apply to themselves the exhortations which they are addressing to the public.  I suppose the only possible solution of this problem is to get rid of this Government. That will come sooner or later.</P>

      <P>Anyone who has experience of hearing Deputy Lemass speaking in this House will realise that the trouble with him is that he gets equally excited about everything.  Whether it is the bursting of a bubble or the smothering of a word, Deputy Lemass brings to those incidents the same exciting form of speech.  I wonder whether anybody listening to Deputy Lemass could find from him what would the Opposition's attitude be were they in Government now, facing the situation that confronts the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any disagreement as to the facts.  It seems to be accepted by Deputy Lemass and by other Opposition speakers that we have a balance of payments problem and the only difference that arises is as to the best method of dealing with that difficulty. Deputy Lemass says that the measures the Government propose are ineffective and inadequate.  Anything the Government propose is wrong and will be criticised.  Seldom can one ascertain what alternative proposals the Opposition might have in mind. Deputy Lemass, admitting the problem to exist, says that what we propose is ineffective and inadequate and reminds the House that this difficulty has occurred for the second time.  The country faced the same position in 1951 as it now faces.  But he says that the position in 1951, while serious enough, was not so serious as the present position is.  Now, it is possible for the country, despite Deputy Lemass's natural reluctance to produce a solution, to ascertain what the attitude of Deputy Lemass would be if he were in Government to-day because, as he says, there was a similar problem in 1951 and Deputy Lemass and the Fianna Fáil Government were then in office and had to deal with it just as the present <Col N="626" /> Minister must deal with the present problem.  What I propose to do now is to ask the House to consider for a moment the methods adopted by Deputy Lemass in 1951 and by his colleagues in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass says this is the second time the country has had to face a similar problem.  As I was saying, it is important that the House should consider the methods taken by Deputy Lemass and his colleagues on the last occasion and judge whether they were effective and compare them then with the methods now proposed, methods, which Deputy Lemass says, are ineffective and inadequate.</P>
      <P>In 1951 the Fianna Fáil Government, through its Minister for Finance, now Deputy MacEntee, referred to the problem created by the balance of payments, which then totalled a sum of £64,000,000, in his Budget Statement on 2nd April, 1952.  He spoke as follows at column 1123 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the necessary corrective measures for dealing with this urgent situation cannot be postponed; we cannot wait until it is clear that the long-term potentialities of increased agricultural and industrial output are being realised and the deficit on external account is being redressed.  We must, accordingly, look into this matter further.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He continues at column 1125:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...for immediate and significant results, it is necessary to import less and specifically to import fewer consumer goods.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is precisely the same problem that confronts the present Minister for Finance and the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, how did Deputy MacEntee proceed to face up to that problem?  What solution did he put before the country in place of the present ineffective and inadequate measures, as Deputy Lemass has described them?  We all know that, prior to that Budget, Deputy MacEntee and his colleagues had had the benefit of the views of the <Col N="627" /> Central Bank as published in their report for the year ending 31st March, 1951.  On page 14 of that report the Central Bank referred to the question of food subsidies, and the report contains the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subsidies are not only a heavy burden on the Budget but also constitute a disguised addition to purchasing power as the money saved through getting the subsidised article at a reduced price is set free for other expenditure.  They can have a twofold adverse effect on the balance of payments by promoting excessive demand for the subsidised articles whether imported or domestic but exportable, and by facilitating additional demand for unsubsidised articles.  The effect of a subsidy may of course be modified to some extent by an associated scheme of rationing and some of the disadvantages of a subsidy may be obviated by a more severe ration scheme.  Reduction or removal of subsidies would, however, bring several advantages in relieving the Budget and allaying inflation and remedying a distorting influence in the prices structure.  It is true that removal of subsidy might tend somewhat to increase the cost of living but some inconvenience in this respect must be weighed against the compensating gains including especially the reduction of consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance had the benefit of that view in proposing how the balance of payments problem should be dealt with then.  Having said it was necessary to import less, and especially to import less consumer goods, he said at column 1137 of his Budget statement&mdash; it is well that these words should be remembered now and I can assure Deputy Lemass the country will be reminded of them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The food subsidies are now, in practice, nothing more than a State supplement to incomes generally, a subvention in which, however, everyone shares irrespective of means. Furthermore, it is not possible to establish any precise point on the <Col N="628" /> income scale at which an individual becomes, as a result of direct and indirect taxation, a contributor to rather than a beneficiary from food subsidies.  The whole system is a wasteful and cumbersome means of conferring an indeterminate net benefit on some classes only of consumers ...The Government have given careful thought to this problem over recent months.  They are satisfied that, as incomes generally have already advanced more than the cost of living and as essential foodstuffs are no longer scarce, there is now no economic or social justification for a policy of subsidising food for everybody.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to be said on any ground for fostering the illusion that food is something that can be provided cheaper for everyone at the expense of others, rather than something for which everyone who can should be expected to work and pay. The Government recognise, however, that for social service beneficiaries of all kinds and also for larger families, even amongst those in steady employment the food subsidies do represent a net supplement to weekly income which it would not be equitable to withdraw without certain compensations which I shall specify later.  Moreover, to ease the process of adjustment to real costs, it is not intended to withdraw the food subsidy completely this year. What is intended is, with effect from the convenient date nearest to 1st July next, consumers will be charged for tea, butter and sugar at their real cost.  The price of bread and flour will be raised but not to the unsubsidised level.  At the same time as prices are adjusted, rationing of all foodstuffs will be abolished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was in 1951 the proposal of the then Minister for Finance to deal with the problem, which is the same problem now, of how to get the people to import less consumer goods.  In that Budget statement the solution proposed was to make the people pay more for the essential articles of food.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, the country can gather from Deputy Lemass's reluctance to state their policy and from their previous experience of Fianna Fáil in office dealing with this problem, that the approaches are completely different.  The Fianna Fáil approach to reducing imports was by increasing prices, to make it impossible for the people to have enough <Col N="630" /> money in their pockets to have an effective demand for imports.  They achieved that by a reduction in the food subsidies and undoubtedly, were it not for the widespread public outcry, the intention expressed by Deputy MacEntee in the passage I have mentioned would have been fully carried out and all the food subsidies would have been withdrawn the following year.  But the people made it impossible for the then Government to do that and it was not carried out.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Lemass says that what we are proposing is ineffective and inadequate, one can just imagine the strong measures which Deputy Lemass and his colleagues would now be proposing to the country&mdash;strong measures designed to make the people pay considerably more for the essential foodstuffs that they must buy in order to keep body and soul together&mdash;in pursuance of the same financial policy which says: &ldquo;If they have to pay more for food they will have less to spend on the import of non-essential articles.&rdquo; That is a clear distinction in approach and I have no doubt that if the people of this country are asked which is the better policy they will say that what we propose is a saner approach to the problem.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Lemass deny that his Government, that took responsibility for that Budget Statement, <Col N="631" /> intended to withdraw all food subsidies?  We all know Deputy Lemass has just come back refreshed from thinking about the next Fianna Fáil Budget.  He went down to Mallow to talk about it.  May the Lord preserve this country from the next Fianna Fáil Budget.  It is a pity that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when he criticises these measures as ineffective, could not find time to tell us in what way they are ineffective and how they could be improved.  It is possible for the country, knowing Fianna Fáil and knowing the methods they employed in the past, to come to a clear decision as to the two ways of dealing with what Deputy Lemass admits is a similar problem.  We all know that the Opposition at the moment are desperately trying to find a policy.  The big thinkers are sitting around big tables thinking hard.  Speeches about producing a new range of taxes in the next Fianna Fáil Budget designed to achieve beneficial results for the community will not cod the people, because the Party that now gives thought to what they call a proper system of taxation or to the great problems of agriculture is a Party that for close on 20 years had full responsibility for this country.</P>

      <P>The Party that is doing all this big thinking about agriculture, finance and all the rest is the Party that had almost 20 years to achieve everything worth while for this country.  We have Deputy Childers of the Fianna Fáil brains trust who in his major statement at the Fianna Fáil thinking club in Clery's Restaurant the <Col N="632" /> other night, took agriculture as his subject.  It is always very interesting to note that when Fianna Fáil leaders want to talk about agriculture they select the Gresham Hotel or Clery's Restaurant.  Here is what Deputy Childers had to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Let us face the grave national issue before us.  Are we to be a vigorous organic society or in our undeveloped state to follow meekly the British tendency to enter a standard of living above what we can afford?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to get £5,000,000 capital into agriculture we have to find other money which could be used for immediate purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A very nice way of stating the obvious.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers further stated on that occasion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our post-war reconstruction plan, in so far as it is related directly to production, may have to be held up because farm production is still at the 1911 level, because for the last three years people have saved less and less.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a comment on agricultural production after 19 years in which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not talk nonsense. After 19 years of Fianna Fáil administration, the custodian of agriculture, farmer Childers, finds that farm production is still at the 1911 level.  In the name of goodness, what were you doing for 19 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Childers said that in recent years the people have been saving less and less.  I suppose that is our responsibility.  Everything, according to Fianna Fáil, is bad, when they are out of office.  Surely it is approaching the schoolboy type of atmosphere to sit back and say: &ldquo;Just because you are in everything is bad.&rdquo; If there is a problem in agricultural <Col N="633" /> production, as undoubtedly there is, and if there is to be a sharing of responsibility, let Fianna Fáil not think that after 19 years in office they can just shrug it away and say it is all Dillon's fault.  They may try that but I do not think that they will find it very successful.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Lemass to imports of wheat and maize as part of the problem in our balance of payments.  It is true that all imports in the form of foodstuffs which we could grow and which are suitable for our economy are wrong, but I would remind Deputy Lemass that in the last year for which his Government had responsibility, the importation of maize was a very serious part of our balance of payments problem and it is not as serious now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>For a very short while there was not, but may I remind the Deputy of what he said 35 minutes ago, that for each year since the war there was a balance of payments problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister remember what Deputy Sweetman said on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only reminding Deputy Lemass of what he said 35 minutes ago in regard to the importation of maize.  The Minister for Agriculture hopes, and I think it is possible, that there will be a considerable increase in the production of feeding stuffs in this country this year.  That, of course, is part of the Government's plan for production.  Everybody agrees that the only permanent way to deal with this problem is to increase production. I think that the House can be quite certain that the Government is well aware of that and we do not regard these measures as more than temporary measures to deal with a problem which we hope will be a temporary one also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Lemass's speech and remembering our experiences after the Budget of 1952, it is possible for Deputies to realise what would be happening to-day if Fianna Fáil were <Col N="634" /> responsible for the government of the country.  We do not think that these measures are ineffective nor do we think that they are inadequate.  If we thought they were ineffective or inadequate, we would not propose that they should be adopted.  We think that they will be effective and we think that they are quite adequate to deal with the problem as we see it now.  In that we may be wrong; Deputy Lemass thinks we are wrong but he does not say what he would do to make these measures more effective or more adequate. As I see it, what he would do would be to tax food and make it dearer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any taxes that we put on are still on and you are keeping them on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The only difference is that we prevented the Government in 1952 from completely abolishing the food subsidies as they intended to do. If that Government were in office to-day, presumably it would find these measures ineffective, and would take a further £8,000,000 off the subsidies on food, thus adding to the prices which the people would have to pay for that food.  That is their method and it is for the people to decide which is the better.  Fianna Fáil's in 1952 took away £8,000,000 which had been provided for subsidies.  The immediate result was to raise the cost of living generally and to bring about a great deal of unemployment and real human suffering.  Millions more in unnecessary expenditure in the subsequent 12 months or two years followed and there was never an approach to a finance problem that was so clearly shown to have been unwise in its results.</P>

      <P>I agree their income is far greater.  This Government does not believe that it is necessary to increase the cost of living as Deputy MacEntee did in 1952.</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy MacEntee did in 1952.  He reversed the chase and made the cost of living, by deliberate Government policy, get ahead of wages because the view was that only by doing that can you make the people of this country do with less and, if they do with less, then they cannot import from abroad.  In any event, it is possible for Deputies and for the country to know how Fianna Fáil's proposal worked out.  It is not possible at the moment to know how our measures will succeed.  We believe they will succeed. If it transpires that these measures do not succeed in dealing with the problem then, as the Minister said, further measures will have to be taken.</P>
      <P>We hope, by these measures, first of all to restrict the import of non-essential commodities.  Secondly, we hope to encourage people into saving as a means of voluntary reduction in consumption and as a means of providing for the State necessary capital moneys. I suggest that Deputies on the opposite side of the House, instead of indulging in the polemics which Deputy Lemass has visited upon the House, should encourage every working man in this country to take a shilling out of every £ he earns each week and put that shilling into a saving certificate.  If that were done generally by the people this problem would begin to disappear. This State would find available to it the moneys it urgently needs for capital development and we could get down to the job of planning in confidence for increased and expanding production which we all agree is the only means of dealing in a permanent way with our balance of trade problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all I want to say on this matter.  I hope that the Deputies who follow from the Fianna Fáil side of the <Col N="636" /> House will not be as shy as Deputy Lemass undoubtedly has been in saying what their proposals would have been.  Mere criticism is never a substitute for a policy&mdash;as, I think, Fianna Fáil Deputies are rapidly beginning to learn.  Our proposal is a clear proposal. It is quite different from the Fianna Fáil proposal some years ago. In our estimation, that proposal failed dismally.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil method in 1952 failed and failed dismally.  It would not be too bad if it merely failed by leaving a balance of payments problem.  The trouble with regard to it was that, not only did it fail but its mere initiation cost the country a considerable amount of money, trade and suffering.  Our proposal is now being tried.  It is quite different from the Fianna Fáil approach.  We believe it will succeed and at least, if it does not succeed, there will not be all the upsetting of trade, disemploying of people and all the hardship and heartbreak that were associated with Fianna Fáil's proposal a few years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health has just given us to understand, as quite a number of other speakers from the Government Benches did yesterday, that all the troubles that have visited the present Government are a direct result of the Budget proposals and the Budget of 1952.  As a matter of fact, one Deputy last night, in talking of this matter, regarded it as a stupid and catastrophic and completely unnecessary Budget.  Let us see whether <Col N="637" /> or not it was stupid, whether or not it was unnecessary and whether or not our ills to-day are the result of that or whether they are the result&mdash;as we on this side of the House maintain&mdash; of bad management by the present Government.</P>
      <P>When the Fianna Fáil Government took office in 1951 we inherited quite a few legacies&mdash;and none of them to our advantage.  We inherited, first of all, a Budget deficit from the previous Government of £15,000,000.  We also found that our balance of payments deficit was then almost £62,000,000.  In addition to that, our excess of imports over exports was in the region of £123,000,000.  With this general picture we then had to find some solution.  We had to grapple with it at that time. We knew that, in doing so, measures which were not popular would have to be taken.  But, because we knew that such measures would be best for the country, we took them and took them immediately.</P>
      <P>We introduced a Budget in 1952 which, although described as stupid, catastrophic, unnecessary, and so on and so forth, proved successful.  We found that, by working that Budget and continuing it in operation until we were leaving office, we got rid of, to a large extent, the evils which we had inherited from the previous Coalition Government who left us with £15,000,000 of a Budget deficit, a deficit of £62,000,000 in the balance of payments and an excess of imports over exports of £123,000,000.  These three figures are well worth remembering&mdash; £15,000,000 Budget deficit, £62,000,000 balance of payments deficit and £123,000,000 excess of imports over exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of our handling of the affairs of the country from 1951 to 1954, our balance of payments deficit by 1954 was reduced from £62,000,000 to an almost negligible figure of £5,500,000. In view of these figures, can anybody say in regard to this matter that our Budget and handling of affairs was stupid, catastrophic or unnecessary?  In the short space of three years, we were able to reduce what was then a stunning figure of a deficit of £62,000,000 in our balance of payments down to <Col N="638" /> £5,500,000 which, I might point out, was the lowest figure since 1946.  On the other hand, and at the same time, we had a reduction in our excess of imports over exports of almost half. We reduced in that same period our excess of imports over exports from £123,000,000 down to £65,000,000 and there was no £15,000,000 of a Budget deficit left behind when we left office in 1954.  Therefore, our Budget of 1952, and our continuing financial policy during our years in office, certainly paid off well.  We had these figures reduced and we handed over this country to the present Government in a sound position and in a position where we were going forward and not backwards as we are going to-day.</P>
    <P>We are told to-day that, as a result of this Government's term in office, they have done many things including the reduction of the unemployment figures of this country, the reduction of the live register.  We are told that that is a result of good policy on their part.</P>
    <P>What we do not hear about here is the large number of our people who are leaving this country who normally would be on the live register.  If they were here, that live register would reach an all time record.  It is easy to say that we have less unemployment when you do not have to take into consideration that emigration, the worst evil of all, has been at work.  There is nothing to boast about in saying that the live register is lower to-day.  That is a misleading statement and one that is quoted so often from the Government Benches in an effort to get the people to believe, against their own better judgment, that the unemployment position is not worse to-day.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience in my own constituency, and in my own parish, that more people have gone out of this country in the last 18 months than went during the last term of office of the Coalition Government.  A greater number is going each month than went the last time the Coalition Government was in office.  Between 1948 and 1951, 120,000 people emigrated from this country, never to return. <Col N="639" /> Despite all that posters were printed in colour and distributed through the country stating that Ireland was building, although many of those buildings were in existence during the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government and many more of them were planned by that Government. Despite all that talk, humbug and propaganda, nobody can get away from the fact that, from the figures, the numbers of people who left the country during that period were the highest of all time.</P>
    <P>From my own personal experience, I have no hesitation in saying that we are now exceeding that all-time record.  If we continue the pattern of these three years, the record for emigration will have reached a new high level and the live register, will, no doubt, have decreased because of the fact that emigration will have taken a greater toll than it ever did before. We have had this type of propaganda spoken in this House for the past few days.  We have been told that up to 1951 our industry was expanding and our employment position was improving and that during that time the plans of the Coalition Government were in operation but that when Fianna Fáil was returned to office we wantonly, and without reason, tore up these plans.  I heard of these plans so much last night that I never want to hear of them again.  I heard of them before and no doubt I will hear of these great plans again but we have never seen a plan.  We did not hear of these plans to-day and no effort has been made by the people in the Government to produce the master plan which was said to be in existence in their previous term of office.</P>
    <P>It has also been given to us to understand that agriculture was depressed by Fianna Fáil.  Let us look at the position in regard to the agricultural structure of this country over the past seven or eight years.  Our financial position was bad when Fianna Fáil took office again in 1951 and, side by side with that, we also knew that our tillage, which is something that we all believe in now, had been left in a bad <Col N="640" /> condition by the Coalition Government. During those three years of the previous Coalition Government, when the master plan was in operation, and our financial position worsened, we had 450,000 acres less tillage.  From 1948 to 1951 we had a drop of 450,000 acres in tillage, of which wheat alone accounted for 230,000 acres.</P>
    <P>That is something of which we should take very serious note.  History, if we could call it history, is again repeating itself now that the Coalition Government is once more in office.  We find our tillage acreage going down and that our wheat acreage has decreased by 129,000 acres while our beet acreage has decreased by 19,000 acres.  Quite a large portion of our balance of payment deficit difficulties can be laid at the door of the Coalition Government's lack of tillage policy for this country.  It can be laid to the door of the Coalition Government to the tune of the £12,000,000 paid out during the past year for cereals and feeding stuffs that we would have been able to grow here if Fianna Fáil was in office.  These things are there to be seen.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance can get £12,000,000 by encouraging the growth of wheat and cereals rather than discouraging it, as has been done in the past 18 months when we had a reduction of 12/6 per barrel in the price of wheat.  Twelve million pounds is there for the picking up to help the balance of payments problem and also to do lasting benefit to our farmers if the Coalition Government will decide to concentrate on encouraging the growth of wheat and cereals for home feeding.  That £12,000,000 is, in the Minister's own words, £4,000,000 to £5,000,000 greater than he can hope to get with the daft list in which 68 items are now being taxed in a manner that we never thought would be necessary in this country and which would not be necessary to-day if the Coalition Government had not come back into office.</P>
    <P>Had this Government handled the affairs of the country in a proper manner since they got back in 1954, when our balance of payments was reduced to a negligible figure, and all <Col N="641" /> things showed a downward, a happy and a good trend, instead of the mishandling there has been of the whole position, our situation would now be very different from what it is to-day. That mishandling of the situation by the Government is responsible for bringing about the economic crisis which, no more than six months ago, the Minister himself said did not exist, despite all the straws that were in the wind then to indicate to anybody that we were heading for a bad time.  The Minister was not convinced until very recently that there was anything wrong. He was saying then that there was no crisis and that the country was still sound.  The Taoiseach, less than 12 months ago, gave us to understand that all the indications of a bad time ahead about which Fianna Fáil talked were so much talk, so much propaganda, so much political capital made by a Party no longer in office.  Less than 12 months ago that was the situation.</P>
    <P>How, then, comes the position in which we find ourselves to-day?  How, then, can the present Government maintain that they are not to blame, that they have no hand, act or part in this worsening of our situation and that we in fact, by a Budget of four years' vintage, are responsible for all these ills to-day?  Why, if the Budget of 1952 was such a catastrophe, so unnecessary and so stupid, and was ruining the country, have the present Government in all their wisdom not removed the impositions of 1952?  Why are they to-day continuing those impositions and adding on top of them something that would not to-day be necessary if Fianna Fáil were in office? The tax on these 68 items would not to-day be necessary if Fianna Fáil had been allowed to continue in office.</P>
    <P>We have in these 68 items something worthy of note and something that is rather contradictory of expressions used by some members of the present Government a few years ago when a few items came in for an increase under Fianna Fáil.  Deputy McGilligan, on 28th November, 1951, was weeping, moaning and gnashing his teeth because of the fact that there was an increase in three or four items, including upholstered furniture and other <Col N="642" /> furniture of wood, carpets, carpeting and floor rugs, general earthenware, and household domestic brushes and brooms.  Deputy McGilligan&mdash;at Volume 127, column 1715&mdash;went on to cry and moan on behalf of the householders and those who expected to get new houses. He talked of Fianna Fáil's want on policy at that time.  Here were the houses built or started by the Coalition available for new tenants and here was Fianna Fáil going to ensure that there would be no furniture in them.  He went on to state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If people who have reserves want to spend them, why should they not do so?  Have we not got at least to that degree of liberty in this country where a man, if he has a few hundred pounds and wants to buy a wireless set with it or improve his house by putting in a wash-basin or by putting in new carpets or furniture, is at liberty to do it?  What is the merit in preventing him from doing it?  We are getting completely authoritarian if we say that even the owner of savings who has reduced his consumption at an earlier period in order to get those savings cannot put those savings to some purpose which he considers advantageous if not profitable to himself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where is this financial wizard of the old Coalition Government?  Where is he to-day?  What has he to say to-day and what have the members sitting in the same benches to say?  Do they not consider that that summary in this paragraph of the speech by the then Deputy McGilligan should apply to-day or has something taken place in the meantime that alters the whole position so that no longer may anyone, whether he has saved in the past or not, spend on anything he wishes?</P>
    <P>Things surely have changed.  The chickens are surely coming home to roost.  The Coalition chickens of Budget deficits, balance of payment deficits and excess of imports over exports&mdash;these are the chickens now grown into fat old hens&mdash;are coming home to roost on the Coalition Benches, coming home because of all the talk that was given out when we were the Government of the things that should not be done and which are <Col N="643" /> now considered right things to do. Things that were then regarded as absolutely crushing the people are now considered the proper things, the right things and the necessary things to do in order that this country may continue as a free and enterprising nation.</P>
    <P>We cannot possibly reconcile the attitude of the people on those benches to-day with their attitude three or four years ago.  It is impossible to regard the statements of those days in any other light than that they were made then without any genuine belief in them, that they were made in the knowledge that they were untrue, that they were made, not with any genuine idea of helping our country or of being constructive, but purely as a destructive criticism by the then Opposition of the measures that the Government at that time were taking.  Knowing that then and knowing it now, we want the people to know, in regard to the speech I have quoted, that that is only a typical instance of the other instances that can be quoted at length. This Government is composed of people who, when it suits them from a political point of view, will say one thing and, when they are a Government, will do the opposite and will say that it is good for the country, that they always believed in it and that Fianna Fáil are the niggers in the woodpile who stand between this country and progress.</P>
    <P>We want the people to realise once and for all that this Government is composed of people who have very little regard for the truth when in Opposition, who have no hesitation whatever when they become the Government of reversing their outbursts of a few years previously and who try to ram down the throats of the people that this is what they always said and that Fianna Fáil are telling lies.  We want the people to know who is telling the untruths.  In regard to household furniture and household goods we want them to realise what Deputy McGilligan, as financial spokesman of the Opposition Parties in 1951, had to say&mdash;that anyone who had saved and had denied himself in previous years should be <Col N="644" /> entitled to spend that money as he wished, whether or not it was profitable for him to do so.</P>
    <P>If that was the position in 1951 why do we find that, to-day, of the 68 items listed in the Schedule, almost 50 per cent. are items the tax on which directly hits the home, the housewife and the wage earner?  I have gone through the list but do not intend to weary the House by quoting the items one by one but there are 32 to 33 items that go directly into the household, that are bought by the housewife, that are being taxed under this list.</P>

      <P>I see the gentleman from Wexford has come in to lend some of his arguments in favour of the present Government's policy.  All I have to say to Deputy O'Leary is that if he has any regard for the policy now being perpetrated&mdash;should I say&mdash;by this Government, the best assistance he can give the Government is to say nothing in favour of it because anyone who knows the Deputy regards anything he says as meaning the opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing I said in Kerry that I will not say here if I am put to it.  Anything I said in Kerry I can say here.  So far as Kerry is concerned, I think the Acting-Chairman knows more about it than most people here.  The victory in Kerry is something the Coalition had better think about before the next election.  They may be without a shoe for one of their feet. The whole position still revolves around the argument that I have been making, that the housewife and the domestic consumer are getting the hammer in a big way under the extra duties being levied by the Government. I am merely pointing out the difference that represents between the position to-day and the statement a few years back by Deputy McGilligan, then the ex-Minister for Finance and who, we took it, was talking with the approval of his colleagues when he <Col N="645" /> condemned Fianna Fáil for raising the price of everything that had to do with the household or domestic consumer or anything whatever that would in any way interfere with the spending of the people's savings.  We find that these savings, which were regarded then as the inviolate property of the persons who had them, to do with them as they wished, are no longer such and that we must now allow the Government to come in and say: &ldquo;Although you have saved in the past, we must now prevent you from saving in the future; you have been buying too much, spending too much; you are not earning enough; you are not working hard enough and therefore we must step in and stop you doing these things in future.&rdquo;  That is what this Government is doing and nobody can get away from that fact.</P>
      <P>There is no point in members of the Government coming in and saying: &ldquo;We did not put up foodstuffs.&rdquo;  What about tea, that is selling to-day at anything from 1/- to 2/4 per pound dearer than it need be, all because of mishandling by this Government, all because the Government some time ago took a chance and that chance did not come off?  They took a chance to get themselves out of a dilemma at that time.  When the price was rising they took a chance on holding it down, hoping it would come down in the future.  The Government of a country cannot do that sort of thing and get away with it; it is all very well for a private individual who is master of his own house and who is not responsible for the people of the country generally to say to himself: &ldquo;I will take a chance.&rdquo;  If it does not come off, it is only he himself who will suffer.  But a Government should not take chances even if it seems politically expedient at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government took a chance on tea and we to-day are suffering because of it.  The people of the country are suffering because of it to the tune of 1/- to 2/4 per pound on their tea.  And they will be suffering because of it to the extent of 2½d. per pound for the next, God knows how many years.  It is like the day-old chicks we got in 1949&mdash;we are paying <Col N="646" /> for them yet.  We will be paying for tea and the chance the Government took ten years hence, and there will be no word from the Government Deputies, who will try to bolster up the Government with noise.  They hope that if they create enough noise they will be allowed to remain in office.</P>

      <P>Getting back to the matter of taxes&mdash;one significant thing is that this Government is doing something in the present year that no other Government has ever done in the country's history, and, please God, no other Government will ever do again in the future.  We are going to have three Budgets within three months. We have had the financial credit squeeze which we can regard as one Budget; we have this new taxation which we are discussing to-day which can be taken as the second Budget, and I am sure the Minister for Finance will not overlook the Budget which he or anyone in his position normally brings in in a month's time.  This Government has, and will have for all time, the unique distinction&mdash;and the one distinction by which it will be remembered&mdash;that it brought in three Budgets within a few months.</P>

      <P>Those were two different years; I am talking about this year, and I am talking about the present Coalition Government which has seen fit to create one record by which they will go down in history.  Once or twice <Col N="647" /> was not sufficient for them to have a right kick at the taxpayer, or the ratepayer, but they have to do it three times.  They are bringing off a treble.</P>
      <P>We can only regard this as a sort of three-card trick.  We have the credit squeeze, the new taxes now imposed and the normal Budget coming in a few weeks' time, and nobody on the Government Benches can say that any one, or all three of these Budgets will have the desired effect of arresting the worsening of our position, but what they are hoping for on that side of the House is that somewhere one or other of the three will turn up and that the lady will be found under some of those three cards.  None of the people in the Government to-day knows under which. We have a three-card trick being carried on by the present Government on the Irish people because the Government had neither the guts, the gumption nor the plans they talked about to carry this country on in the progressive way in which they found it in 1954.</P>
      <P>We find in regard to these items here that the householder or the domestic user is given &ldquo;the hammer&rdquo;.  In regard to this list, I want to say something which I think is a serious thing to have to say.  In regard to certain of these duties imposed yesterday or the day before, which came into effect the other night, I could be told, and my information was fairly accurate, of one particular item, which is a rather large item in this 68-item list here to-day.  I could be told a month ago that it was going to be done and that information came from a member of the Cabinet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming to the Vote on Account, we can ask ourselves how it comes about that certain members of this Government and their supporters could so clearly give an outline a few days ago of what, in fact, has now taken place.  Reading an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 11th March by Deputy MacBride, one finds there what is as good a bit of anticipation of what was to come and what eventually did come as has ever been experienced or known in regard to such a matter as that with which we are dealing here to-day. He was dealing with problems of trade balance and indicated three or four ways in which he thought the situation could be remedied.  Item No 3 in this article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of the 11th March last says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, following careful examination, hire purchase may have to be restricted.  Exception should, however, be made in regard to agricultural machinery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Item No. 4 says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That in order to induce savings some entirely new type of non-depreciating <Col N="659" /> bonds will have to be evolved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of the things I would very much like to know and possibly the Minister for Finance, with all the information at his disposal, can give the House some indication as to what type of bond this new non-depreciating bond is, whether there is such a thing and how it works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the published report of my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a new increase in the interest rates of the Post Office Savings Bank the answer to this item No. 4?  As I already said, this whole article is certainly an anticipation of events to come which are and, we accept, were secrets of the Cabinet and I must say this thing certainly rubs the varnish off it very closely.  That naturally enough is a matter, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has said, for each member of this House and if by anticipation he can pinpoint what the Budget revelations of next month or next year will be it is a question of good luck.  But it does seem that this type of bond that Deputy MacBride talks about, is something that would be a God-send to this country.  I wish we could have him back here to give us a clear insight into how these bonds can be created.  The sooner we get them in this country the better and I would say that every other country in the world would pay us a handsome figure to get the secret of getting non-depreciating bonds.  It certainly would, in my estimation, tend to ease all our burdens and make for prosperity for our country in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave this list of 68 items, I want specifically to address a question to the Minister.  I am sorry I did not address it to him earlier before we had so many interruptions.  I refer to item No. 67 on the list which has to do with imported newspapers.  Are papers originating and printed in the Six Counties regarded under this list as imported newspapers and will the duty be applicable to them?  If the Minister can say they are not regarded as imported, then I will have no <Col N="660" /> further remark to address to him.  On the other hand, if he says they are imported, then there is a case I wish to make in order that some exemption be given.  Will the Minister say whether or not Six County newspapers are, in fact, to come under the duty levied in respect of item No. 67?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

In doing that and in keeping silent, he is putting the House in the position that I must now make a hypothetical case because I do not know whether the newspapers will be subject to duty or not.  I must make the case that this duty should not be charged whereas in fact the chances are that it will not be charged.  The Minister could tell the House but he chooses to be petty and not to do so.</P>

They cater for all classes and creeds, they circulate around the Border, and in some parts of the country around that Border they are the only provincial Press we have.  Taking my own county, for instance, we have circulating there <i>The Derry Sentinel, The Derry Standard, The Derry Journal</i> and <i>The Derry People.</i>  These four provincial papers are established for over 100 years.  They were catering for my county long before there was <Col N="661" /> any question of the Border or Partition.  Surely the Minister is not going to perpetuate the evils of Partition by imposing this levy of three farthings, if it is a preferential rate, or 1d. as it may be, on each copy of such newspapers as will now come into our country.  Surely he is not going to say to these four newspapers: &ldquo;You must pay three farthings per copy for every copy of that paper that you send across this artificial Border.&rdquo;  Surely he is not going to say that no longer can <i>The Whig, The Newsletter, The Irish News, The Tyrone Constitution, The Impartial Reporter, The Fermanagh Herald, The Derry People, The Strabane Weekly News, The Ulster Herald, The Derry Journal, The Frontier Sentinel</i> and all the rest, come in although in some places they have been in circulation for over two centuries.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider that these papers are, to a large extent, the provincial Press of the Border community.  They are, and were in the years gone by, before Partition was even heard of, the papers of the ordinary people of the county.  The Minister by this act may well stop the circulation of some of these newspapers on both sides of the Border and I think for many reasons that would be a retrograde step.  Many members on the other side of the House have said on many occasions that the best way to bring about the ending of Partition was that our people on both sides of the Border should know and understand each other better.  How then can this Government say they are doing anything to bring about this understanding when there are upwards of a score of newspapers with large circulations around the Border that will no longer in fact circulate or, if they do, will not circulate as easily in the future as they did in the past?  If the Minister persists in this idiotic levying of duty on these provincial papers from the Six Counties, he will certainly in his short time do a very great disservice to the cause of the anti-Partition movement and our ideals of ending Partition.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider this matter again.  I have <Col N="662" /> been told by representatives of a number of these papers that they would gladly meet him and discuss this matter with him Associated Irish Newspapers, to which many of these people belong, could and would be available at very short notice in order to discuss with the Minister this imposition of duty which will in fact have the effect of cutting off from the Twenty-Six Counties practically all Six County newspapers.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Pitprops are a traditional export from this country, and licences are freely granted.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,296 hardwood logs for which export licences were granted, 1,141 were logs grown in the Inishowen peninsula, which, because of the remoteness of the area, could not be economically disposed of in the home market; 75 were for conversion into veneers and return to this country; and 80 were logs of sycamore, oak and ash, experimentally exported for the purpose of testing the suitability of these types of Irish hardwoods for the production of veneers.</P>

I do not intend to weary the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and he must have been very weary by the discussions which have taken place here, by going back and making things so difficult that no one can understand what is going on.  The Government are going to make so much smoke and noise in this House that no coherent statement will emerge after the whole thing is over. They want to blacken everything said and take it out of its context so that we can have no proper discussion. That is a very old trick.

He could then say that we could draw cheques upon the money that we have abroad without endangering our external reserves.  I want to know why we cannot draw those cheques to-day? Why do we have to take the money from the pockets of the people rather than, as was then advocated by the present Taoiseach, draw the cheques on our external reserves in order to fill the gap?  If it was good policy then and was something that the present Taoiseach felt he should expound, why is he now, when he is in the position of Taoiseach, not putting that selfsame policy into operation?  Why is he not writing the cheques and drawing on the external reserves rather than drawing on the people who are less able to pay now than they ever were before?  Why should these duties be clamped down on them?  Why should the position in regard to Partition be worsened by the imposition of duties on provincial papers emanating from the Six Counties?  Why will the Minister not say that the Six Counties is not a foreign country and that papers taken in from the Six Counties are not imports?  Why can he not regard this as a practical matter and say, just as he will say it when it suits him to say it from a political platform, that the Six-County area is not a foreign country? When it comes to newspapers and the imposition of tax, it is apparently going to be a foreign country under the present Government.</P>

That is not the only evil, as I tried to explain.  These are provincial papers that circulate along the Border.  We have had them over the centuries.  There is no reason why their circulation should be curtailed by the action of an Irish Government. It is a terrible thing that we have to wait until 1956 to have this position brought about by an Irish Government that should be trying to reverse the position and to bring about better understanding and, in order to do that, bring in more of these papers so that we can truly understand the people of the Six Counties, their way of life and everything about them.  That was preached to us as a good thing in regard to ending Partition but the present Government's attitude is that these are papers coming from a foreign land and that the duty must go on.</P>

Despite all the false propaganda then emanating from the Parties now forming the Government, the first fall to occur in the cost of living from 1950 occurred in 1954.

The cost of living has gone up seven points.  It is seven points higher than it was in mid-May, 1954, when the present Government came into office.  How can they explain that?  Will they tell us that it <Col N="675" /> is because Fianna Fáil had done something in 1952?  Is that the line of argument we will get&mdash;blame Fianna Fáil?  If there is anything wrong with the country, blame Fianna Fáil; if there is anything right in the country give the credit to the Coalition Government.  Even the Blueshirts were worth while in order to do that. The Minister for Health thinks so anyway. I would advise the Minister for Health not to try to put on the little shirt he had in 1933.

What I want to know, and what the people of this country want to know, is what is going to be done to remedy the remainder of the financial mess in which we now find ourselves as a result of bad management by this Government in the past 18 months?  Are we going to be allowed to drift along, and is this £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 to be used as a sop to the people so that they will allow the Government to carry on for another 12 months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is to wake up these people on the Government Benches to the danger of their situation, to the short stay they may have on the seats they now occupy so as not to have them blinding themselves into the belief that they are there for all time. They are there for a very short time and they should realise that and try to mend their ways and give us better government in the coming months.  They should restore the price of wheat, give encouragement to the farmers to grow more wheat and cereal crops so that this gap can be filled to a much <Col N="677" /> greater extent than it will be filled by these proposals.</P>
      <P>That can be done by substituting home-grown cereals and foodstuffs for the £12,000,000 worth of cereals we imported last year.  Let the Government do that and they will be doing something in the right direction.  They will be giving to the people who are the backbone of the country an indication that the Government is learning, and will continue to learn, and do the right thing, an indication that the Government will consider it a duty to encourage the farmers to grow the crops we require in the country and that, having grown them, the producers will get decent prices for them.  That is something that can be done immediately and on which the Government will reap £12,000,000 in the coming year.</P>
      <P>This long list of 68 items can, at the most, yield £8,000,000, but by the growing of more wheat and cereals the Government can get £12,000,000 because, if the price is given, the farmers will grow these crops.  That has been proved by Fianna Fáil and if further proof is necessary, the drop in wheat and cereals last year will provide it.  It does not pay in this country to try to crush down the farmers by reducing prices for their products and it does not tend to make a happy agricultural community.  That is what we have not got to-day because the farmers have no faith in this Government.  They have begun to see&mdash;as most of us see &mdash;that the Government does not know where it is going any more than it knows where it came from.</P>
      <P>The country should be given clearly to understand that the statements made here a year or two or three years ago by leading members of the Government Party were false at the time or that they were made by people who did not know any better at the time and that they have found their mistake since.  We did have a number of Deputies talking at that time.  We had the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, for instance, on the 10th February, 1953, saying as reported in Volume 136, column 553:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is the home policy&mdash;more <Col N="678" /> unemployment, higher prices, more emigration and then a dive into fantasy by investing £500,000 of the nation's money in the privilege of painting green shamrocks on airliners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This has come back to rest very squarely to-day on the Government. The chicken is roosting now behind the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton.  How much he would like to be able to say: &ldquo;I never said any such thing.&rdquo;</P>

Are we not looking for planes at the moment?  We cannot get any that are nearly as good or as big for that money.  Did the Minister not sabotage the plans for our air services, and is he not now&mdash;and good luck to him&mdash;trying to expand them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We must come round to recalling to the public mind some of the statements that were made three or four years ago by certain gentlemen in the present Government, and statements they have made in the recent past.  There were statements made at different times by different members who now occupy very prominent positions in the Government.  One of <Col N="680" /> these catch cries was made by the Minister for Finance himself.  He talked about the question of living beyond our means.  He talked about it in terms that would indicate that such a phrase or description was entirely out of keeping with this country.</P>
      <P>According to him it was entirely wrong to be going around giving the idea that we were using more than we could afford.  He then talked about our balance of payments and described that problem as something that was made a fetish on the altar on which many of our people lost their employment. What is the position to-day? Are our people not emigrating as the result of the policy or lack of policy of the Government?  Are they not leaving this country in their thousands.  Not only are the people leaving, but as I well know, they are closing their doors for good and taking their families with them.  That is a new development in this country.</P>
      <P>In the past, there was a bit of emigration but it is a very new development to have the houses in rural Ireland, along the seaboard and in the congested areas, being closed up, with padlocks on the outside and chains on the doors.  Those houses are being closed and will never be reopened. This Government know that they are responsible for those padlocks and for those chains and for the lack of young people around the seaboards and in the congested areas.  There is nobody now in those districts but tottering old men and small children.  I know it is happening because of where I come from.  There is no tale being pulled that that is not true and that that is not the reason why we have fewer on the register of unemployment.  The cause is emigration.</P>
      <P>That is a fact that we cannot get away from and the sooner the Government wake up to a realisation of it, instead of clapping themselves on the back and saying we have only so many on the unemployment register, the better for all concerned.  Let them get out and go around the country and see for themselves how many thousands of our young married couples and their young families have left the country because of the scourge of a Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Go back to your tricks now.  Go back to the country and your thimbles and give us peace here.  I want the Government to realise and to admit that their statements of policy in the years past have now come to light as a lot of humbug and propaganda, a lot of ambiguous and misleading statements such as the one made by many people now on the Government Benches that the cost of living would be brought down to the 1951 figure.  Everyone in the country knows that the promises were made and were understood to convey that if the Government got back into office food prices would be reduced to the 1951 level, but we find an ambiguity there as in many other things for which the Coalition groups are responsible.</P>
      <P>If they are accused of having made these promises, one of them stands out alone and says he never made them&mdash; that it was the other fellow who made them.  Soon many of them will go out never to come back and that is why so many heads are being buried under the Coalition Benches to-day.  Many of them will never again occupy the seats in which they now sit once the people get them out.  All I would suggest is that in the little time left to them, they should make up for the evils they have done and try to balance the scales somewhat in their favour. They are only passing this way once and that applies to quite a few of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pass away certainly; it is the lot of all of us, but Deputy O'Leary, like John Brown, will go on forever.  We have been given an exhibition to-day of how not to carry on a discussion in this House. That has been sponsored and led by Front Bench members of the Government. They, as members of the Cabinet, realise more than the others the sorry mess the Government have got themselves into, so that there is a chorus from the Front Benches to drown any criticism of their policy. <Col N="682" /> That is why they have excelled themselves in uncalled for interruptions and all sorts of obstruction.  That does not get us away from saying what we set out to say.  In 1951 they left us with a Budget which had a deficit of £15,000,000.  We had to find that £15,000,000.  We also found that our balance of payments was £62,000,000 on the wrong side, that the excess of imports over exports was £123,000,000, that tillage was down by 450,000 acres, that wheat in itself was down by 230,000 acres.  Then we came along and took the only course open to us. It was a course which we knew was unpopular and yet we went to the country and brought in the measures of the 1952 Budget.  That was black-guarded from the tree tops and the house tops.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the answer to our problems lies under the third card and that the Minister will find himself, at the end of the next financial year, if he is still Minister, in the position in which we left him in 1952 as against the position we found in 1951 and in 1952.  We reduced the balance of payments to the negligible figure of £5,500,000 and we reduced from £120,000,000 to £65,000,000 the excess of imports over exports.  That surely was something that can be regarded as <Col N="683" /> a good answer to the criticism levelled at us in 1952 for having taken what were termed unnecessary steps.  The end which we then set out to achieve was coming and coming quickly.  The past 18 months, on the other hand, have proved that this Government have been on the wrong track.  They have actually put us back to the 1951 position when the last Coalition Government left office.  To-day we have reached a £94,000,000 deficit on the one hand and a £35,000,000 on the other.</P>
      <P>Our Budget expenditure and our expenditure on running the country have increased, as has been shown by the present Vote on Account figures which have been given to us.  Our Book of Estimates shows an increase over the year of something in the region of £3,500,000.  All I want to say on this Vote on Account, which shows an increase over last year, is that, like the rates that the ratepayers are now paying down the country, so also will it be in regard to the taxpayer.  Although the taxpayer will pay more this year, the services he will get in return will not improve correspondingly because wages, salaries, higher living costs and higher costs of materials are running away with the extra taxation reaped from our people and we, therefore, find ourselves to-day committed to paying more and getting, in fact, fewer services for it.  That is the position now in regard to the present Government: give less and take more!</P>
      <P>So we find that, more and more, are we getting back to the stage reached in 1951; more and more are we being driven into the position wherein we may find ourselves this year, that the amount of money outlined in this Vote on Account and in the Book of Estimates will not meet the bills at the end of the year, bills which must come up and which we are committed to pay. We will find ourselves in 1957, as we found ourselves in 1951, with a Budget deficit which may be passed on in time to the Government which will succeed this present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gambit at the moment may be that things are being written down for the specific purpose of keeping the <Col N="684" /> wolf from the door for another few months; and, if and when the wolf pack overwhelms the present Government behind that door, they will then be able to get out and leave all the financial mess to those who come after them to clean up just as Fianna Fáil had to clean up the mess in 1951 to 1954.  I want to inform the House now &mdash;because so many interruptions were made earlier much of what I said was lost as, indeed, it was intended it should be lost by those who were interrupting&mdash;that, in addition to our balance of payments, our Budget deficits and our excess of imports over exports, we also have a disimproving position in regard to our cost of living.</P>
    <P>In November last&mdash;and, mark you, it has risen a few points since&mdash;we had an increase of seven points in the cost of living over mid-May, 1954, and a reduction in 1954 of two points as against 1953.  The only significant fact or the only significant variation in these two sets of dates is that Fianna Fáil were in office when we dropped two points and the Coalition is in office when there is a rise of seven points, and the figure is continuing to rise.  We also have a reduction in the farmer's income, a reduction in his wheat price, in the number of acres under the plough for wheat and beet and, because of that reduction, we have a reduction in the number of people employed handling these two crops.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, we have an increase in our imports, such as cereals, wheat and raw sugar, and we must pay for that increase, an increase for which we obviously have not got the money to pay at the moment.  That, briefly, is the position as we find it to-day. All I can say is that, remembering all the hardships that this long-winded 68-point document will impose on the people, the reward which the Minister hopes to reap from it is much too small a reward for the trouble our people will have to bear.  This will also mean a bigger and better cross-Border smuggling trade such as we have not had for years.  The Minister, of course, does not give any attention to that because, just as in the case of the northern and Six-County provincial papers, he does not seem to <Col N="685" /> grasp the fact that there is a Border up there at all.  But we, who live near it, know that it exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Without question, there will be an increasing cross-Border smuggling traffic as a result of this. The Minister may well find that this method of collecting taxes will not even pay off the £7,000,000 or the £8,000,000 he is hoping to collect.  What I want to know is: has the Minister given any clear indication as to what he will do with the £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 extra taxation he hopes to get?  I know he has talked vaguely about it being put into some capital development but I would like to have from the Minister and the Government some specific proposals now before ever he gets his claws on this money.  I would like to be assured that this money will be used in a useful manner and will not be used to fill the gaps in the Budget proposals, because the Budget proposals may not be adequate for the running of the country in the coming financial year.  I would like to have an assurance on that.</P>
      <P>I would like the House to be given the facts as to how this money will be spent, this £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 which will be collected as a result of these impositions.  I want to know if that money will be used for the purpose for which the Minister so glibly explained it would be used, but gave us no details.  Let us have from the Minister in his closing speech a definite indication of where this £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 extra will go.  Let him say that it will, in fact, be used for something which will give lasting benefit. Let us be able to tell the people, whose savings will be eaten into by virtue of their having to pay higher prices for these taxed commodities, that their savings, so reaped from them in these taxes, will go into productive employment in the future by way of capital development throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is, I think, in duty bound, in taking the savings from the people out of their pockets or out of their banks, to give them a clear indication and tell them exactly what he <Col N="686" /> will do with those savings.  He has not done that so far.  I appeal to the Minister to do it when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can only say that the so-called policy of the Coalition has really proved to be a lack of policy. Indeed, it is rather difficult to talk about policy in this connection at all because what we are faced with is a lack of policy.  That lack of policy on the part of the last Coalition ran the country practically on to the rocks. Fianna Fáil came back into office and took the remedial measures necessary, measures which proved to be sound despite all sorts of propaganda against them and despite all manner of obstruction by the Deputies sitting on that side of the House now.  That was the position in 1951.  In 1954 the country was handed over again to the present Coalition Government and, again, we find this Government a Government without a policy.  In a short 18 months all the good that was done and all the measures that were effected by Fianna Fáil to put the country back on a sound financial basis have been wiped out.  Everything has gone by the board.  Lack of policy has again made itself self-evident in our ever-increasing adverse balance of payments position, in our excess of imports over exports and in the great numbers of our people who are emigrating because they know now, that with this Government in office, there is no point and no hope in staying at home on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>We want the people to realise, and realise fully, that this Government have been going along with their heads in the sand.  They have been travelling with their heads down for the past 12 months when all the indications were that some remedial steps should be taken in time.  But, instead of doing that, they pooh-poohed the whole idea and said we were creating a scare on this side of the House in order to bring about a crisis.  We have tried on this side to be as constructive as we possibly could all the time for the benefit of the country, irrespective of whatever Government was in office. Our warnings to the present Government over the past 12 months were <Col N="687" /> constructive warnings offered in an effort to help our country, but those warnings went unheeded.  The Government to-day, despite those warnings, finds itself&mdash;and unfortunately has brought the country with it&mdash;in a state infinitely worse now than the state in which we found the country in 1951 after three years of Coalition rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief as I notice that there are Fine Gael Deputies who are anxious to get in on this debate.  I do not intend to follow the line which was apparently adopted by the Deputy who spoke before me who believed if you spoke long and loudly enough what you said did not matter.  For that reason I will try to make my remarks brief so that as many Deputies as possible can contribute and say something sensible.  I was listening to most of the people who spoke here for the last two days and I think that Deputy Jack McQuillan, who spoke last night, was very sensible in his approach to this problem.  I did not agree with everything he said&mdash;that could not be expected, I suppose&mdash;but he did put the finger where it should have been put by what he said in relation to our small farmers.  Every Deputy in this House, even city Deputies, will admit that the small farmers are still the backbone of the country and that, while they are doing their share, it is the big man who has too much land, who has left us in the position we are in.  I honestly believe that the biggest portion of the land of this country is in the hands of the wrong people who because of the fact that some crop is not paying as well as last year, will switch to something else.  They switch from cattle to wheat and from wheat to something else and their one object is to make as much money as they can; they employ the smallest amount of labour possible and put as much of the money as they can in their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Government gets round to the problem and does what should have been done long ago, that is, create far more tenant farmers, put more people on the land who will work it, thus stopping the drift from the land, we <Col N="688" /> will be going a long way towards clearing up the muddle the country is in.  I believe it is the best way to solve the unemployment problem.  If we put somebody who is able and willing to work a farm on that farm, it means that somebody else is coming off the labour market.  I have myself experience of a Dutchman who came to this country and who got one acre of land.  On that one acre of land he was able, through growing the right type of fruit and vegetables to live very comfortably with a wife and six children.  If we had more of that type of industry, more of the type who know what to grow and who will spend time and energy in growing it, we would not be as we are now importing all sorts of fruit and vegetables, which could be grown here, and paying for them, thus providing an adverse effect on our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which could be approached also by the Government and that is the problem of using Irish timber for purposes at home for which foreign timber is in many cases prescribed in contracts.  If we tackled the problem of treating native Irish timber in the proper way, we could very soon reach a stage where Irish timber could be used entirely on the building of houses and other types of work.  At the present time a tremendous amount of money is going to Sweden, Finland and other places for timber while we have native Irish timber apparently being used only for firewood.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for people who want to criticise the present situation to do so.  At any time people can be critical provided they are not expected to give a solution to the problem.  We have had a typical example of it here to-day.  There was, I think, a very specific charge made by the Deputy who spoke before me.  I would like, for his information and for the information of others, to say that anybody who for the last few weeks could not see that something like this was going to take place must not be very bright or very intelligent.  Deputy Giles could bear me out when I say that we had people a few days ago forecasting&mdash;and they were Fianna Fáil supporters&mdash;as <Col N="689" /> to what was going to happen.  They were pretty close to the mark, but I am sure they will admit nobody gave them information.  They got no Budget secrets; they just used their heads in regard to the situation and I think Deputy Blaney should have been honest enough to admit that that is what probably happened in the particular case to which he was referring.</P>
    <P>We, in the Labour Party, do not want to see restrictions if they can possibly be avoided.  There is a very big difference, however, in the restrictions and the action now and the action taken by the Government which introduced the 1952 Budget.  Most of the items that have been listed here can be counted as luxury goods.  Most of them can possibly be manufactured in Ireland and they are at least nonessential goods.</P>
    <P>In the 1952 Budget we had the real essentials of life taxed and nobody can deny that fact.  I may be wrong but I believe that the number of people who will be disemployed&mdash;and there may be a few temporarily disemployed as a result of this&mdash;will be very small and it will be more than counterbalanced by those who will be put into employment because of the fact that goods which will be bought in the future will be Irish goods.  Unfortunately, we still have people who will not buy goods here if they can get anything at a comparative price from abroad.  These measures will induce people in a big way to buy Irish goods which are in very many cases much better than the imported article.</P>
    <P>There is one other way in which we can help to solve this problem.  Deputy McQuillan referred to the burning of native fuel.  I think that not alone if native fuel in the form of turf is used but if the Government would take the necessary steps to check on our coal deposits they would be going a good way towards substantially reducing imports.  There is also the question of mineral deposits.  A big effort must be made to have Irish mineral deposits developed.  For years it was the habit of the dismal Jeremiahs across the way to go round the country saying: &ldquo;We cannot expect to have mineral deposits in this country.  Were we not told that <Col N="690" /> there was nothing worth developing?&rdquo; This has been said without any effort at obtaining prior knowledge and without going to the trouble of checking whether they may be mineral deposits.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why there should not be mineral deposits here the same as there are in England or on the Continent? There is no reason at all except that the people who were in power for many years considered that for one reason or another it was a good idea to say that they were not here. Even a few years ago they were going around telling the people it was all &ldquo;cod&rdquo; to suggest that there was copper to be found in County Meath. It was proved since that they were wrong and now that it is known they say: &ldquo;We knew it all the time.&rdquo;  I hope the example that has been given there will be followed in other parts of the country and that the mineral deposits will be developed in Ireland and that the export of these deposits will result in a saving as regards the balance of payments and will help to improve the present situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that I did not speak after Deputy Blaney had spoken because if I did, I might have had to withdraw some remarks.  The like of Deputy Blaney's speech I never heard.  It was mean, low, despicable and un-Irish, and the Fianna Fáil Party ought to be ashamed of him.  As a group of men I respect the Fianna Fáil Party, and I have the greatest respect for many of the men in it, but I think they should not stand for that type of conduct.  Al Capone was the king of the gangsters in America for a long time and what we heard to-day was not far short of what he would say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in the least bit worried about the situation here to-day.  We have been told that there is a great danger hanging over the country.  There never was danger.  There was no danger in 1952 and there is no danger to-day. The balance of payments position may be bad, but these things right themselves.  A few short years ago we saw Germany, Belgium and several other European nations levelled to the ground but to-day we see these people up and doing, by their own efforts.  We, <Col N="691" /> who escaped all these disasters, must do all we can to put our country on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>We have been blessed by the gifts of the Almighty.  He gave us everything. He gave us a grand and glorious country but here we are whining, cringing and crying that the country is down and out.  This country is not down and out.  It is on its feet.  It is on the march.  It has been on its feet and advancing all the time since we got our own national freedom.  Look at the grand and glorious houses that have been built where there were mud cabins 20 or 30 or 40 years ago.  Look at the happiness and peace in these houses with electricity and all the comforts that we can give to the people who are in them.  That has all been brought about by Irish capital and Irish labour.</P>
    <P>We have done as much as any other country in a short space of years notwithstanding the fact that we fought a civil war and an economic war and have been squabbling and fighting amongst ourselves.  Nevertheless this country is up and doing and on the march.</P>
    <P>Balances of payments are always problems.  I know about ten or 15 different problems that this country has gone through but always in a year or two we were on our feet again.  Listening to Fianna Fáil one would think that we were completely down and out and that the inter-Party Government was the cause of it all.  We are not down and out.  Instead we are in the happy and glorious position that we were never in before in this country of having farmers, businessmen and labouring men joined together in one big effort to make the country prosperous and well.  That is what we have been doing for the past two or three years and, thanks be to God, we have a Government with the courage, confidence and experience necessary to lead this country in the right way.</P>
    <P>In 1924 we started to electrify the country and to-day every hamlet and home on the farms and hills of Ireland is electrified.  Every man has light and heat and fire.  Did any of us believe <Col N="692" /> that that could happen in 30 years?  Thanks be to God, I am alive to-day to see it and I am proud of it.</P>
    <P>We have had land resettlement taking place over the last 30 years.  I have seen tens of thousands of acres divided and happy families settled on them.  It makes no difference to me whether they are Meath men or anybody else.  They are all Irishmen and they are settled there in happy homes where there was nothing but a bog for hundreds of years.  I see bog development where we had nothing but a waste of prairie, water and dirt of all kinds.  I see our bogs being utilised to-day and thousands of men working on them where only one man got work 100 years ago.  Those things have been going on under various Governments. National reorganisation is going on by leaps and bounds and we see the Irish people being employed in their own country.  Are we not proud of these things?  We ought to be.</P>
    <P>Then we see land reclamation in progress.  For hundreds of years the land of Ireland was allowed to go to waste in furze and bushes but now we see money being given to reclaim it and the Government are giving to the farmers lime and fertilisers and all the things that go to make land good.  Are we not proud of that?  We see progress being made with the drainage of our rivers for which the people have been asking for almost 100 years.  Full steam ahead is the order of the day and when we come to the next 30 years we will hardly know this country for the development that has taken place.</P>
    <P>We have had serious problems to surmount but we will never surmount these problems by squabbling and fighting.  If the Fianna Fáil Party wishes to get back to power, and if the people wish to put them back in power, we will gladly walk across the floor of the House if the people want us to do so, but while we are here we will get on with the job.</P>
    <P>There has been great talk in this debate about the balance of payments. To hell with the balance of payments. We have the Irish nation and the Irish people here and what more do we want?  We have here good Irish farmers with their families settled <Col N="693" /> deep on the land.  I saw these same farmers smashed in 1921 and in 1934. I saw them smashed to the ground and I saw them starting again with their families in a little bit of land.  To-day they are fully on their feet, working in peace and doing a good job, forgetting the past and getting on with the things that matter for the future.</P>
    <P>The only drawback I see in the whole matter is that Fianna Fáil is not big enough to join in the endeavour of the national Government to make the country prosperous and put all the people on their feet.  Look at what we could have done over the last 20 years if a fully national Government had been in power.  If they had joined us we could have dealt with our banking system with which no Government has been able to deal up to the present. Why do you people not come in and join us to do that?  Why do you not give the Irish farmer a chance to get the credit and the money he needs? This country is starved of credit in the right place.  Those who do not need credit can get thousands overnight or on the telephone but the small farmer and the middle-class farmer are starved of credit.  The land is not half stocked or worked as it should be.</P>
    <P>I say to the Government and to Fianna Fáil that we have a duty to the middle-class farmer and the middle-class people.  They are bearing too heavy a burden.  The 20 to 70 acre farmer is crushed.  If these men were put on their feet and given the credit facilities they need, this country would produce more than its needs and the balance of payments problem would be very small.  The weakness lies in the fact that the small and middle-class farmers have not the requisite credit facilities.  With Deputy McQuillan I say that these are the people who carry the load, the people who right the wrongs every time our nation is in danger and they are the people who are always neglected.</P>
    <P>I want to see banking facilities made available to these people and money harnessed to the task of giving these people their rightful place in the nation.  These are the people who <Col N="694" /> always stood four square for everything decent and honourable and Irish. They always responded to the call whether it was for work or war or peace.  This Government and succeeding Governments should do their duty towards these people.  If that is done, there will be very little trouble in the balance of payments.  They will pull their weight, work their land and there will not be a perch of waste land.</P>
    <P>I certainly agree also with Deputy McQuillan that something must be done about the vast prairies that are held by men who are not pulling their weight.  Thousands of acres are lying idle, not half stocked.  They are set on the tillage system or ranching system where a man can take over 300 acres, and till as long as he likes and get all the wheat and the big money he likes.  These estates should be broken up and divided amongst the Irish people.  They should be tilled by farmers who live on their own holdings, not by ranchers who try to get rich at the nation's expense.  Deputy McQuillan is quite right.  This country is crying out for more land resettlement. Resettlement should be the order of the day and more money should be spent on it.</P>
    <P>I come from the Pale and know what I am talking about.  Thousands of acres are not being worked as they should be worked.  I do not want injustice done to anyone.  I am proud of the farms of 200 to 400 acres in the Midlands that are worked to full capacity and that give employment but there is too much waste, too much idleness and too much misery surrounding the big estates.  The Government should give the price that is needed in order to obtain the land and should build houses and make happy homes for the people.  The land should be restocked.  Half our problem is created by depopulation of the villages and towns.</P>
    <P>If a decent man is given 50 or 60 acres and a home, he and his family will remain there.  That system obtained in the Midlands and no one sold out.  The people there can trace their families back for generations. They had a sturdy foundation on which to build.  These are the people who are being neglected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> Stop squabbling, get on with the work, unite if it is at all possible and give us an Irish national Government of regeneration and tackle the problem that has been unsolved over the last 30 years, namely, the banking system.  Money has us by the throat. The financial system of the British Empire is held in the grip of the Masonic Order.  Money can be loosened or tightened at will.  We are just pawns in the game.  It is time we smashed that system and took control of our destiny.  We may not be able to do it but we should try.  We tried to overcome big obstacles in the past and we succeeded in most cases.  Are we afraid to tackle this obstacle to progress and prosperity?  If we are, we are cowards.</P>
    <P>I say to the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party: &ldquo;Forget the past; forget the squabbles.&rdquo;  Pearse, Collins, de Valera and the other leaders gave us something that should be handed on. The one thing that is keeping us down is the Masonic grip on the banking system.  If we unite for ten years and face that problem, we will solve it or, at least, if we do not solve it, it will be a glorious failure.</P>
    <P>When a small farmer looks for credit to the banks, he cannot get it because the powers that be who control money want to keep this small Irish nation down, to use it as a pawn.  There are some movements in this country and outside it working to smash the independence of the Irish people.  Nobody can do anything about that but the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Stop the type of speech we had from Deputy Blaney and Deputy Corry and all that rubbish.  I could give as dirty and bitter a speech as any man in this House but why should I?  I have been too long through the mill.  I have been inside prisons and barracks, in wars and civil wars, but I always held my head up and was respected by friend and foe.  I did my duty as others did. We did not do it for the sake of getting something for ourselves.  We did it to get a better Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is a shame to fight and wrangle over small things.  It is said that the inter-Party Government will break up, <Col N="696" /> that it is ruining the country.  What is wrong with the country?  There is a small problem in relation to the balance of payments.  Germany, Belgium, Poland could be ground to the dust, but by their own strength could rise again.</P>
    <P>The main structure of the State should not be changed every time there is a change of Government.  Agriculture should be put on a permanent foundation and not subjected to change by every successive Government.  The good schemes adopted by the present Minister for land reclamation, drainage, liming, should continue.  Then we will know where we stand.  On fundamentals we must be united even if we disagree in small matters.  Fifty per cent. of the trouble between us would disappear if first things were put first. We should see where we can agree.  We should not squabble about fundamentals that are sacred to the nation.</P>
    <P>I certainly agree that the Book of Estimates is far too large.  I have said it for 15 years.  Everybody else has said the same thing.  Something must be done about it.  I would appeal to the Government to endeavour to reduce the load which the people have to carry and see if it cannot be pulled down in some way.  The burden is too much; administration is costing too much.  There are far too many heavy men being carried at the top and the people who are carrying them are the small struggling people down the country.</P>
    <P>I would ask this House to face the problem before it, unpleasant though it may be.  When I started in Meath County Council, 20 years ago, there were about a score of people there while now there are hundreds and hundreds, all paid and pensionable, and one of them cannot be removed.  When I came in here this was a reasonable Parliament, but now it is a streamlined Parliament trying to follow the pattern of the British Empire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but one of your comrades ran off the rails.  I would say that the inter-Party Government has laid the foundations on which the nation can be built up and has brought the farmers, the labourers and the business people together into a common pattern.  We were told in the past that you could not have a farmer and a labouring man sitting at the one table, but how could the farmer do without the labouring man or the labouring man do without the farmer? How could the businessman stand behind his counter if he had not the labourer and the farmer coming in? Is it not the essence of national development to have the three elements combined, and would it not be the essence of development if Fianna Fáil were to throw in their weight with us and let us get down to fundamentals?</P>
      <P>If we are not to go back to misery and slavery, there is one obstacle that must be faced by this generation and that is the Masonic grip of money which has this country by the throat, between London and Belfast.  The grip can be loosened or tightened as it suits them, and we must face that problem and solve it, or we will spend our time for the next 30 years in wrangling and fighting but making very little progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do say, however, that we have made considerable progress, and anyone who died 40 years ago, if he could come back to-day, would not know this country.  We have come through some good times while every other country abroad was ravaged.  We have had, from 1939 to the present time, a peaceful period.  Good prices ruled for the farmers with an odd slide up or down. We should thank God for the good things He gave us instead of whining and complaining about being down and out.  Will anyone here stand up and say this country is down and out to-day?  If he will, I will say he is a liar.  People are earning more to-day; I see three or four in one family earning £20 or £30 a week which they were never able to do before.  I see the farmers getting good prices.  I know there is a bit of a problem in regard to cattle at present, but I am quite satisfied the cattle situation will ease itself. The farmers down the country are not fools; they know the position and they <Col N="698" /> know things will right themselves.  They know they have in their Minister for Agriculture a leader who knows how to lead and whom they will follow.</P>
    <P>All that is wrong with the Fianna Fáil Party is that they are afraid his schemes will prove successful because if they work out Fianna Fáil will be ruined.  The Minister for Agriculture is a manly and a brilliant man, who knows his job; he is harnessed to it and he will enable the farmers to succeed in spite of Fianna Fáil.  He will certainly see that the Irish farmer who is the beginning and end of the Irish nation will get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil was in power they went mad on industrial development. While we do need industrial development, I do not agree that you should kill agriculture to set up industries. Why clutter up the City of Dublin with Jews and Gentiles from every land, coming in to get an easy living at the farmers' expense?  Agriculture should have been put ahead of industry because it is only agriculture that will carry industry on its back.</P>
    <P>We set up industrialists 20 or 30 years ago and gave them a royal living. We can see them with big dividends, big cars and streamlined factories and we know they do not think of the struggle that the farmers had to make to give them those things.  If they do not want to expand and give more employment as they should, it is time we took away the protection we gave them for the last 20 years.  We do not want anybody sitting behind the tariff wall which was given to him to put him on his feet.  When he is on his feet we want to see him walk and then to run &mdash;not to skulk and hide behind those walls.  There are too many like that, having a royal life at the countryman's expense.</P>
    <P>I believe we should face our responsibilities because the country is ours for the making.  Let us make it.  It is a grand little country with a glorious heritage of which we may be proud. We have a grand Christian faith and it is up to us now to do our part.</P>

      <P>We have listened to an exposition of sentimental clap-trap the like of which I have never heard <Col N="699" /> in this House, but I suppose it is better to forget it and assume above all that the Minister for Finance does not agree with Deputy Giles on the difficulties of the present situation or with his views in relation to the banking system, or as to the position of a particular religion in this country.  We take it that is as much sentimental clap-trap as the rest.  I call on the Minister for Finance, if he thinks it worth while, in view of all the allegations that have been made in the country on these matters and in the interests of there being some chance of settling Partition, to contradict Deputy Giles, in the interests of the movement for unification.</P>

      <P>Having said that, we might as well get down to realities. The admissions of the Minister for Finance that we are facing serious balance of payments difficulties now completes the complete prostration of the Minister for Finance to Deputy de Valera and are the last in a final series of admissions that we told the truth of our economic position and that, at last, the Government have had to believe that what we said was right.  We were accused of being grossly extravagant in our Government courses; that has been disproved.  We were accused of levying excessive taxation, taxation that was unnecessary even to raise the excessive cost of Government, and that has been disproved.  The people were told that the cost of living could be reduced and that has been disproved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people were told that all our warnings about the balance of payments position were nothing but the worship of the golden calf, an attitude of humility towards the British people while we were secretly carrying out the propaganda of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in this country.  That is what we have been told in the past few years.  Now we have the solemn, funeral statement of the Minister for Finance that the balance of payments <Col N="700" /> has reached a serious point, that we have been importing too much and exporting too little and that, at last, he has to take drastic remedies in order to overcome the difficult situation.  As I have said it is all in the nature of a tribute to Eamon de Valera and when the economic history of the country is written I feel quite sure those in charge of that work will see this.</P>
    <P>All the sentimental slush talk about the development of the Irish nation began in 1947 with the appalling and disreputable efforts of the Clan na Poblachta Party.  The Fine Gael Party, who always appeared to keep up a conservative and zealous front about savings and the desire to restrict development, seem to have swallowed this propaganda and to have adopted it as their own.  This has brought this country into its present mess and into its present misfortune.</P>
    <P>I blame Deputy MacBride and Clan na Poblachta for the whole of this. They started the easy talk, the idea that, by some miraculous change in our system of credit, we could get happiness overnight, that it did not matter whether we worked or not, that as long as we had the money abroad we could earn ourselves a living without any exertion.  It started largely with the by-elections in 1947 and it is a sorry thing to think that Fine Gael, in order to revive their falling fortunes, had to adopt what I might describe as confused mixed versions of this new system of economic policy.</P>
    <P>If you study the economic policy of other countries in northern Europe you will actually hear less of this slush talk about a country's ability to vote for an increase in its own living standards without expanding its production. That policy has been freely advocated in this country since 1947. It began in that year when the propaganda of the present Government Parties was more or less on the lines that the country should never have experienced the difficulties suffered during the war, that the economic difficulties were largely the responsibility of the Fianna Fáil Party, that the sharp rise in the cost of living between August 1946 and 1947 was proof that <Col N="701" /> the Fianna Fáil Party was not looking after the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>The propaganda went on to tell us that taxation was too high, that the taxation was unnecessary, that it was time the Irish people enjoyed a good living without any exertions, that they were making excessive exertions and that they were not getting a true reward for their hard earned cash.  The propaganda sought to point out that everything would come right with the least possible effort by the people.  A suggestion was freely made that we were in the grip of a foreign economic system, that the capital bound up in Britain during the war was there for the asking, that that money did not require to be spent on greater production.</P>
    <P>It did not matter, according to the propaganda, whether the money was spent on hospitals, playing fields or housing; there was no limit to what we could spend; no matter how much we spent, we would get out in the end. The suggestion was that we and Fianna Fáil had a grasping, mean attitude towards all this expenditure, that we were not willing to go out on a tremendous capital spending spree in 1948 in order to make the people happy without any effort on their part to earn their happiness.</P>
    <P>That policy has been going on ever since.  So when I heard the statement of the Minister for Finance when he announced those levies I could not believe my ears that, for the first time since the war, someone in Fine Gael, apparently supported by other Coalition Parties, had at last begun to talk realities, and not trying to add up two and two as five instead of four.  The solemn talk of the Minister for Finance is a great vindication of everything we have tried to say since the war.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, when we temporarily adjourned to get a House, this propaganda started in 1947.  This attitude of mind was created in the minds of the Irish people largely, as I have said, by the initial efforts of Clann na Poblachta and was adopted by Fine Gael in their efforts to revive their fortunes.  It was repeated more or less continuously throughout all these years up to the present time, and it was based on the conception that if people knew very little about the balance of payments or how they worked, about external reserves or the system of trading with our neighbours abroad, and the more sentimentally you talked about it and the more dramatic your statements were, the more likely you were to gain the support of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose that, taking it by and large, the average person in this country fell for this talk that we could go on spending, that nothing could ever happen, that there would always be the money abroad to act as credit for our foreign purchases and that we need never concern ourselves.  People were led to believe that there was something between £400,000,000 or £500,000,000 invested in securities abroad, which formed so huge a reserve that we need never deprive ourselves of the privilege of spending money.  For years and years, I have heard the Minister for Defence, General MacEoin, down in the County Longford refer to the £400,000,000 of private and public foreign invested reserves that were there for the spending.  I have heard him talk about them to people who came from small farms and who had neither the time nor the wish to study complicated economics.  He simply dangled that figure of £400,000,000 before them until it almost made everything I said about taking care of our national economic position sound like mere lunacy and gave the people the impression that I was a <Col N="703" /> foreigner in County Longford with great banking interests in Great Britain and that was why I was talking to the people about preserving some kind of reserves in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>That kind of approach could hardly be exaggerated.  It has been going on ever since 1948.  Deputy MacEoin, now Minister for Defence, never once in my hearing, speaking in my constituency, referred to our liabilities abroad.  He never balanced the account. He just spoke of this wonderful and glorious sum, varying from £400,000,000 to £500,000,000, according to his whim, and he never mentioned the fact that we had any liabilities to put against that and that our liabilities amounted to anything up to £250,000,000, virtually wiping out a great part of this enormous reserve that was supposed to exist in order that the Coalition could promise everybody an indefinitely good time.  That liability was never mentioned.</P>
    <P>It has been infrequently mentioned in this House.  I have always heard our assets abroad mentioned but nobody liked to turn the page and give the account on the other side of the balance sheet in order to show that the sum was not unlimited and one could not go on spending indefinitely; there were liabilities abroad, debts we would have to honour and, of course, another common habit of the Coalition Parties was to omit the statement completely that a great part of the £400,000,000 cannot be touched at all, that it is in private hands and that we can either confiscate it or else try to persuade the owners of that money to reinvest it in productive projects here. But, unless we communise the country, it cannot be touched.  It does not genuinely affect our trading position.</P>
    <P>If anybody in this House imagines that dyed-in-the-wool supporters of the Coalition Government and Deputy MacBride really at this moment believe that there is just a very, very modest sum of some £400,000,000 of liquid cash available in Great Britain for our trading manipulations and our importing and exporting operations, one would find very few of them who <Col N="704" /> had even been given the idea that the sum to-day is as small as that.  They all live on these glib £400,000,000 mark figures and that is what has been wrong all the time in this country. Unfortunately, nearly one half of the people has been given this idea of easy money.</P>
    <P>When I look back and remember all the vilification of the Central Bank in 1952 by the members of the present Government, their attitude of contempt and contumely and their definite suggestions that every statement made by the Central Bank was that of woefully pessimistic men, men with no regard for the country and men who were so crippled by conservative conceptions that they had no idea of the great new coalition in Ireland that was springing up, I think it is about time some people in the Coalition paid a belated tribute to the Central Bank, because every single word they said about the financial trend in this country since 1952 has been amply fulfilled and proved by the present Minister for Finance in his speech.  I hope now that someone on the Coalition side will have the chivalry to say something about the directors of the Central Bank before the termination of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We said on this side of the House that they were naturally conservative and that we did not intend to adopt all their proposals.  We did not adopt all their proposals, but I notice that the Minister for Finance is now beginning to put into operation some of the proposals which were regarded as utterly fantastic in 1951-1952, when the same sort of situation was taking place as the situation with which we now find ourselves confronted. Not only has the Minister for Finance bowed to Deputy de Valera; he has bowed low to the Central Bank because he is now asking the people to spend less.  He apologises for the fact that his own Government is unable to spend less and he has made it quite clear that, if he could, he would spend less.  He is doing something to discourage the purchasing power of the <Col N="705" /> people through this levy and through the arrangements made in connection with hire-purchase.  On all fronts he is adopting the one-time hated policy of the Central Bank, several years after that policy was adumbrated.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Central Bank statements, even the most recent, may tend to be over-conservative.  They may honestly be warning the Minister for Finance and the Opposition of what will happen if remedial measures are not taken but, as I have said, it would be desperately unfair if someone in the Government did not now pay tribute to that report in 1951-52, which showed that, even if what was said then was exaggerated, the directors prophesied most accurately and most carefully a trend that has been tending to develop ever since that time. There was a halt in that development in 1953.  Things were more or less put right in relation to our balance of payments. The position in 1954 showed a slight disimprovement, but it was not serious.  Here, in 1955 and 1956, we have a repetition of the same situation as that which existed in 1951.</P>
      <P>In 1951 the then Minister for Finance also proved himself to be a good prophet. He took his own line and did not follow slavishly the Report of the Central Bank.  Reading his speeches now, one can see that he formulated his opinions independently, as he has always done, and he gave warning that the country was spending too much of its saving, that the position was not satisfactory and would have to be corrected. Torrents of abuse were hurled at him.  Not only did the Deputies opposite, who were then in opposition, indicated that his statements were incorrect, but they repeated all the slush talk that started in 1948 and set a headline to the people as to their attitude of mind towards the expenditure of money, the use of our foreign reserves and everything else.</P>
      <P>Probably some of the most interesting statements in that connection were made by Deputy Norton at the time. In a debate on the Supplies and Services Bill in November, 1951, Volume 127 of the Official Report, columns 603-604, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that we were consuming <Col N="706" /> too much, that we were eating too much, that we were wearing too much clothes, and that we were enjoying a standard of living such as we ought not to aspire to: that, generally speaking, we were living beyond our means...  What is wrong with having a disequilibrium in the balance of our payments if we have utilised our foreign assets for the purpose of buying goods to put into our own granary for the use of our own people instead of allowing our money to remain under British control and British domination depreciating there in accordance with Britain's current economic and military fortunes?...  The people who talk about wanting to repatriate capital and still hold their hands up in horror at the prospect of a gap in the balance of payments do not understand the economic forces which go into action once you try to get your foreign investments out of another country.  I am not worried about the gap in the balance of payments, so long as we can see it, and so long as we have resources to keep that gap under control.  We have an abundance of resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 609 he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If anybody believes in these theories on economics, he is welcome to them, but I think they are the economics of the mentally deficient. So long as we want consumer goods or capital goods, we should use our sleeping money, which is being lent to Britain, at practically no rate of interest so far, to buy goods, consumer and capital for the use and benefit of our own people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He got a little bit worked up later on and as the balance of payments was slowly sinking in 1951, sinking at twice the rate it was sinking even last year, Deputy Norton waxed even more sentimental and he said, as reported in column 715:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The economic philosophy of the report and of the White Paper&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that was issued by Deputy MacEntee warning people of the troubles to come&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and all the gloomy ministerial <Col N="707" /> speeches are the economics of a demented recluse who just wants to live in squalor, misery and penury while his money is wrapped in the miserable rags that hang from his body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the atmosphere we have lived in since 1948 so far as the Coalition is concerned.  That is how we have lived. That is what a great many people in this country have been taught to believe, that any kind of holding on to financial reserves, any suggestions that increases of wages should be related to production, was simply the work of people who were self-appointed puritans deliberately determined to reduce the living standards of the people for some incredible purpose. We never understood why Deputy Norton or the others thought we wanted to be self-appointed puritans, why we thought it was either good for the country or for our political fortunes to see that the people consumed less. This was the time when anything that was said in the way of suggesting a more controlled attitude towards finance was labelled immediately as part of the hair-shirt economy of the day.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Coalition members are now wearing the hair-shirt themselves. I hope they itch because they deserve it.  Every one of them deserve it if they itch to the last minute of their office. I hope they have spikes on them for what they put this country through, for the appalling deceptions they have practised and for the state in which this country has been forced to live since 1948.  I hope everything is given back to them in full measure.</P>
    <P>As I said, in 1951 we had a further dose of this inflationary talk and we were given the impression that you did not have to worry about the balance of payments, that you did not have to worry whether production rose or not, that you did not have to worry as to the amount you could dissipate of the reserves we required for particular purposes.  People were never told anything about how easily we could import too much and above all nothing was ever said by the Coalition to indicate <Col N="708" /> to the people that it was utterly impossible for them to attempt to equalise, either nearly or faintly, with the English standard of living unless they produced even more than the British were producing in the way of exportable goods.</P>
    <P>In other words, every time the British progressed in their production and exports, we would have to progress three or four times as quickly as they, if we are going to attempt to enjoy the English standard of living, to compare ourselves with the English in regard to their consumption of goods whether in the line of tobacco, drink, refrigerators or anything else. There was never a suggestion made by the Coalition that we could not imitate their standards without overcoming years and years of stagnancy in our production, without making enormous technical advances in agriculture without reorganising our whole system of agriculture.  They were never told that we could not do it, that once a boom occurs in England and we started to try and vote ourselves a better standard of living by increased wages, and so on, once we started to compare ourselves with Great Britain, we inevitably end up in national bankruptcy unless we take the sternest possible measures to prevent our people importing goods for which they are not paying.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that a great number of people in this country have followed the present situation without knowing much about what I might describe as the professional economics of the balance of payments.  There are plenty of small farmers and workers down the country who supported Fianna Fáil and, without having to hear complicated lectures, they understood all this quite clearly.  Without having to have any complicated analysis made for them, they understood the necessity for preserving savings and for realising that you could not vote yourself a better standard of living simply by getting more wages without doing more for it.  I am glad to say we have had people like that, because if the Government had not always had the very strong Opposition they had, I do not know where we <Col N="709" /> would be.  The Opposition luckily was there and we did all we could, during our three years of office, in correcting the position and we left office with the position reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>It is a strange fact that in 1953 after all the talk of depression and unemployment and all the talk about the hair-shirt economy, the personal savings of the people of this country in 1953 were four times as great as they were in either of the two previous years.  They were saving money, maybe not enough, maybe not nearly enough, but they were saving far more than they were in the years when they were being told everything was fine so long as there was enough capital spent and enough ideal economic theories practised.  They saved a great deal more in what was supposed to be called the years of depression, the years in which the country was bound with a hair-shirt.  The position was then relatively stable and so far as the balance of payments was concerned it was, so far as I remember, of the order of £5,000,000 to £7,000,000 and we were more or less paying our way.</P>
    <P>One of the things that distresses me about the whole business is that we have not got the £100,000,000 we lost in 1951 and in 1955.  I wish we had it to spend on fertilisers, on production, on reorganising the pig industry&mdash;to spend it even on more land drainage in the country.  I wish we had some of that £100,000,000 to spend on making grants on even a more lavish scale for export industries in the undeveloped <Col N="710" /> areas.  If we had even half of those lost savings we could spend them well.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have had to face since the war is the fact that we have been engaged in this controversy over the cost of living and over the balance of payments, so that it has been almost impossible for anyone in any Party, either this or the other Parties, to suggest to people that if you spend £1,000,000 on fertilisers you would be able to do without half the housing grants that are given to build houses.  That kind of thing is very difficult to say because we have got into this atmosphere that have been created.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to say that if we had spent half the money on fertilisers we have lost on buying consumer goods, we might well at this moment be able to complete our housing programme with very much reduced housing grants because the productive capacity of farmers would have been greater, their earning capacity would have been greater and the wealth of the country would have been greater, so that the amount of grant required for any specific house built might have been less and that money might have been spent again on other more essential projects.  It was difficult enough to retrieve the position in 1951.</P>

    <P>These waiting lists refer almost exclusively to the County Hospitals and the cases are mainly children recommended for tonsil and adenoid operations.  The number of additional beds necessary to deal with these cases is not large.  No case requiring urgent treatment had to be refused admission in the year.</P>
    <P>There was no effective waiting list for tuberculosis in the three counties in the year.</P>
    <P>With regard to (3), increases in the bed accommodation have been approved as shown below.  No increases in the number of tuberculosis beds are envisaged.</P>
    <P>OFFALY:</P>
    <P>
      <i>County Hospital, Tullamore:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Plans have been approved for the reallocation of the staff accommodation in this hospital as patients' accommodation, the work to be carried out when the new Nurses Home that is under construction is completed.  The increased accommodation will be 20 general medical and surgical and 10 maternity beds.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost is £3,500.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Birr District Hospital:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Approval has been given to a general scheme of reconstruction and extension at this district hospital.  Eight additional maternity beds are to be provided as an extension to the hospital.</P>
    <P>The cost of the general scheme of improvements is estimated at £44,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Edenderry District Hospital:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Approval has been given to a general <Col N="667" /> scheme of reconstruction and extension at this hospital.  The patients' accommodation will be provided in the extension. There will be an increase of 3 medical beds and 8 maternity beds.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the scheme is £53,000.</P>
    <P>COUNTY ROSCOMMON:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Roscommon County Hospital:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Approval has been given to the provision of a new maternity unit of 26 beds at this hospital.  This represents an increase of 16 maternity beds.  There will be a resulting loss of 6 medical beds.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing the new maternity unit is estimated at £44,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Boyle District Hospital:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Approval has been given to the provision of a maternity unit of six beds in an existing ward that has ceased to be used for other purposes.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the work is £5,000.</P>
    <P>COUNTY WESTMEATH:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mullingar County Hospital:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Approval has been given to the provision of a new maternity unit of 20 beds, this represents a net increase of 4 maternity beds.  The 16 existing maternity beds will be set free for general purposes.</P>
    <P>A tentative estimate of the cost of providing the new maternity unit as an extension of the hospital is £40,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Athlone District Hospital:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Work on the general reconstruction of this hospital is in progress.  The total <Col N="668" /> number of beds will not be increased but there is likely to be some increase in the number of maternity beds available as the maternity unit planned on the female corridor allows for flexibility in the number of maternity beds as required.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the reconstruction scheme is £112,000.</P>
