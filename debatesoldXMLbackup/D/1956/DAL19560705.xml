      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, <Col N="364" /> 1956, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the position is that the pension scheme for secondary teachers was first introduced in 1929.  In 1951, certain retiral, disablement and marriage grants were added to the scheme and certain minor changes have taken place in the meantime.  From time to time, but particularly since 1951, there have been representations to give teachers who are not in the scheme or who, while in the scheme, have not covered themselves under the scheme for the whole of their term of office, an opportunity of getting into the scheme.  At conciliation level it has recently been arranged that this amendment will be introduced so that persons not in the scheme at present will have a six-months' period to come into it and people who are in the scheme at present but who have not been covered back to the earliest days of their teaching period, not further back than 1929, will have an opportunity of coming into it.</P>
    <P>There are one or two minor matters added.  Where persons in the past, who had a ten years' breach in their teaching service, wanted to come back into the scheme, they could come back but they could not get in at the earliest period of their teaching period.  They are now being given an opportunity of covering up that breach.  The scheme as it stands at present will still continue.  In future, when persons leave secondary teaching for a period of longer than ten years, they will not be able to bring their earlier teaching period into the scheme.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that, in certain circumstances, people who taught in reformatory and industrial schools were able, when the schools became recognised as ordinary national schools, to bring their period of teaching in the industrial schools into their pensionable service under the national teachers' scheme.  Now it is proposed that secondary teachers, who were formerly national teachers and had service in industrial schools, can, under certain arrangements, and by paying <Col N="365" /> back suitable payments from a particular date, be regarded as pensionable under the terms of this scheme.  As the salary upon which the superannuation payments are assessed consists of the basic salary, that is the school salary on the one hand and the incremental salary on the other, and as there was a difference between the minimum basic salary for men and for women, it has now been arranged that the basic salary for both men and women will be regarded as recognisable at £200.  Under the scheme, the contribution is made partly by the school, on the basis of the basic salary, and partly by the teacher.  Hitherto the contribution made by the school has been at the rate of 2½ per cent. in connection with the general scheme. Under the Order it has been made at a rate of 5 per cent.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 36 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking last night in connection with Section 36.  I hope that the Minister this morning, after a restful night, will see the desirability of listening to the proposals put forward from this side of the House, designed to improve this Bill, and that he will be more amenable and reasonable, in order to make the Greyhound Racing Bill one which will be acceptable, not merely to the owners of greyhounds, but to the outsiders who enjoy the sport and are prepared to pay admission charges, and so forth, to attend these meetings in the belief that they will be run above board and that they will hear no more complaints of malpractices or corruption in the sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 36 the board has the right to lay down the conditions governing permits for coursing and coursing meetings.  Having regard to the past history of the Irish Coursing Club, and having regard to the composition of the new board, which will be largely constituted by the present members of the standing committee, <Col N="366" /> it is necessary to define the powers that it is intended to give to the members of that board when they are issuing permits for coursing.  We may have the situation of a group of persons in a particular parish, in good coursing country, with a plentiful supply of hares and with good coursing ground, anxious to run a coursing meeting, but, because there is another club within a parish or two, or within a radius of five or six miles, there may be an objection to the new club starting off.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given in the objection might be the difficulty of providing hares for the two clubs.  It might be that, because of the influence used by the old established club which may not be catering for the interests of the people to the greatest extent, it may have sufficient support among the members of the board to influence it to refuse a permit to the other club. That has happened in the past.  It is already a recognised feature of the management of the Irish Coursing Club that where you have an existing club and a new group comes in with the intention of establishing another club, very often the new club is refused permission to hold a coursing meeting.</P>
    <P>This is very unfair, because in many cases it is well established that some of the older clubs are no longer taking the interest in coursing that they should take and that a new club coming in might provide better sport. Because of the constitution of the new board I doubt if there is going to be any change.  If the new board were differently constituted there might not be any necessity to urge the Minister to look into the conditions that may be laid down by the board.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the suspension and revocation of such permits.  What offence has to be committed before the penalty of revocation is applied?  We have had, down through the years, cases of corruption and malpractices at coursing meetings. It has been admitted, even by members of the Irish Coursing Club, that there have been such occurrences. They have gone so far as to say that <Col N="367" /> they regretted they were unable to cope with them.  If they were unable cope with them for the last 25 years, what reason have we to believe that they will be able to cope with them in the future?  If the same people are to be responsible for the management of coursing and greyhound racing is it not feasible to assume that the same conditions will obtain in the future?  I would suggest that the Minister should define the functions of the board in regard to the issue of new permits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputies again that our purpose under the Bill is to give the greyhound industry a charter under which it will govern itself.  I think it was agreed on the Second Stage that if it was not prepared to do that prudently and honestly there was very little that Parliament could do. The best that Parliament can do is to give them the machinery which, if properly used by themselves, will enable them to run this industry for the benefit of all.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to the constitution of the board.  The board, the Deputy will recall, must consist, as to four members, of people elected by the members of the coursing clubs and of the greyhound racing tracks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Within 18 months.  That is the present structure and there are a chairman and two other members, nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, one of whom will represent the bookmakers.  I said last night, at the request of certain Opposition Deputies, that in regard to this section I was prepared to define the categories of persons as managers, graders, judges, hare drivers and stewards, who would be subject to licence, and that I would consider whether, for the purposes of paragraph (d), which relates to suspension and revocation of licences, it would be possible to provide appeal.  I said, and I want to <Col N="368" /> repeat, that I asked Deputies not to press me that these regulations must be subject to the approval of the Minister for Agriculture because to do that is to strike at the whole basic principle of the Bill which is to give the industry its own independence to run its own business and not to place it under the Department of Agriculture. Deputy MacEntee said he felt that such a reservation to the Minister was desirable because he felt he should not consent to a proposal to render bureaucracy supreme.  That is the very thing I want to avoid.</P>
      <P>I yield to none in my admiration of the services rendered by the public servants of this State but I do not believe that civil servants are best equipped to exercise a day-to-day surveillance over the greyhound industry. No matter how you express it in an Act of Parliament, if a Minister's approval is required for a number of detailed matters in a greater or lesser degree with the change in political appointments taking place in a modern democratic State, it must be more or less the civil servants who exercise this power.  It is just because I want to avoid bringing bureaucracy into the management of this business that I ask the Deputy not to press to make these matters subject to the Minister's approval.  I shall examine the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry to hear that the Minister is still not prepared to consider the suggestion I made that these regulations should not come into effect until they had received the consent or approval of the Minister. I think that is one protection the general public and the individuals who will have to operate under the controlling authority of this club will have that they are not unfairly dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the one thing he wanted to avoid is the day-to-day interference with the management and administration of the club by civil servants.  No person suggested that the club should function under the day-to-day supervision of civil servants or officers of the Minister.  That is not implied nor is it involved in the suggestion that these regulations should receive the consent of the Minister <Col N="369" /> before they become operative.  There is no suggestion that these regulations will be varied from day to day.  We hope that if they are properly drawn up in the first instance they will come before a Minister only once in the lifetime of the club.  Therefore, there is not any question, as I have said, of the club functioning under the day-to-day supervision of a civil servant.</P>
    <P>The difficulty here is that, as the Minister has just announced, we are, in fact, giving a charter to a body consisting of a number of individuals who, according to the report of the advisory committee, have acted on occasions in a very arbitrary and very tyrannical fashion.  If we are to give this Bill a fair start and to ensure that the reformed club is to be properly conducted, it seems to me that there should be some objective and independent mind remote from all personal interests involved which will examine once and for all the regulations which the club proposes to make.  The amendments do not involve day-to-day interference with the control and administration of the club, which the Minister suggested.  Far from it.  There is a very great difference between the immediate departmental advisers of the Minister and the gentlemen who will constitute this club and who will have the control and management of its affairs.</P>
    <P>Every civil servant is immediately and directly responsible to his Minister for what he does.  Even the most humble and the most exalted civil servant bears personal responsibility to the Minister and the Minister in turn has a personal responsibility to this House.  Therefore, if a civil servant is guilty of wrong doing he can be called to account through the Minister.  The Minister will have to carry responsibility for the wrongdoing and in turn the Minister will ensure that the wrong-doer is suitably dealt with.</P>
    <P>That is not the situation here.  We have no intention of interfering with the activities of the club once this Bill is passed.  We want to ensure that, when the regulations are made&mdash;regulations which will have the force of law and regulations which, if they are <Col N="370" /> broken, will subject the person to legal action and to a fine&mdash;before a new crime can be created the Minster in these circumstances should have an opportunity of saying: &ldquo;Well, now, that regulation is a right, just and valid one and I consent to it.&rdquo;  He will have to do that, I hope, only once in the lifetime of the club.  That is a very reasonable request to make in regard to this section.  Is the Minister not going to look into the matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Before the Minister finally closes the book in this matter, may I refer him to Section 33, which provides the regulations for payment of levies on course bets?  The section gives the board power to make regulations but the Minister in relation to that section has, in fact, accepted the point of view which I am now stressing.  He has said: &ldquo;Regulations for the purposes of this section shall require the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are quite satisfied that any fears we might have in regard to the future operation of this section would be removed if a sub-section of this kind were added to Section 36.</P>

      <P>Before that section is put, I should like to draw attention to sub-section (7) which provides that rules under this section shall not be made before the day appointed by the Minister under sub-section (6) of Section 26 of the Bill.  I want to ask the Minister what precisely is the purpose of that sub-section.  I do not know why it is there.  Perhaps it is a matter of pure curiosity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (6) of Section 26 brings into operation the scheduled new constitution.  The object of sub-section 7 of Section 37 is to provide that the Club would not purport to make the rules under the powers given under this Bill until its new constitution is in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a point there.  I did not perceive it in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The board must consult with the Club.  We do not want the Club to make rules regarding the training of greyhounds and so forth, until the club is duly constituted under the scheduled constitution which is brought into operation on such a day after the establishment day as the Minister appoints by Order under sub-section (6) of Section 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it wise to do that? I am putting this now merely for the purpose of having some consideration given to the section.  As I understand it now, sub-section (7) of this section will, in fact, stop the board from taking immediate action to deal with some of the abuses which are known to exist, until such time as the Minister, some considerable period later, makes the Order under sub-section (6) of Section 26.  The board, I apprehend, is to be constituted forthwith. Surely, if there are patent abuses, as some people allege there are, existing in regard to the training of greyhounds, the board should be allowed to try to remedy these abuses at the earliest possible moment?  Perhaps the Minister would look into that before Report Stage because it is a point which may not have occurred to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion a very important question is raised here.  The purpose of this section is to give the board the right to appoint auctioneers. It gives the board the right to say who the auctioneers should be.  What evidence have we that the present system is not as good a system as one that may be produced by the board? We have a system already in operation under which greyhound sales are carried out.  We have the report of the Greyhound Advisory Committee on those sales.  Very nasty things were said about those sales in the past.  We have no guarantee they will be any better in the future if auctioneers are appointed by four or five people from the board.  The best people to judge whether the auctions of greyhounds are properly carried out are the owners of greyhounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the advisory committee stated that in the past certain malpractices and corruption were suggested regarding the sale of greyhounds in some of our tracks, such as Dublin and elsewhere.  However, if we look at the record of the sales during that time we will find very little reason for agreeing there was anything very wrong.  It was suggested that in cases where greyhounds were offered for sale in the past, the owners put a reserved price on an animal when it was being entered for the sale and that that information was conveyed to some people outside who are acting as agents for greyhound purchasers across the water.  These people across the water, it was alleged, were told that such-and-such a dog was for sale at a certain price and the owner was told in turn that the reserved price being placed on his dog was much too high but that he would get within £100 or £200 of that price if he were prepared to sell.  In many cases the owner had no alternative but to sell. These people coming across were the <Col N="373" /> best, the only buyers.  These agents knew the price the buyer was going to pay and the reserved price the owner had on his dog and, in that way, were said to have raked off substantial sums for themselves.  That was one of the suggestions made at the time to the advisory committee.  It was not borne out in evidence.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the owners of greyhounds were the best judges as to whether a sale was properly carried out and apparently, because more greyhounds were being offered for sale year after year, the owners were satisfied.  No reason has been put forward as to whether the proposed system would be better than the one now obtaining under which the track owners have their auctioneers.  The people are prepared to continue as they have been in the past with the holding of trials and of sales afterwards. Everybody can see the performance of a dog at a trial.  If the potential buyer is satisfied with the way a dog performs there is nothing to prevent him from offering a price. If the board claim the right to appoint auctioneers, greyhounds must be tried on one particular track.  There is no guarantee the performance of a certain dog will be any better on a particular track; there is a distinct difference in the timing on many tracks throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are many of the country tracks much faster than Dublin tracks and some, of course, are slower.  A dog that can do 30 seconds in Dublin might be able to do 29.80 seconds on some of the tracks in the country.  It can quite often happen that a dog coming from one of the faster tracks in the country will get a slower time on a Dublin track and there may be those who might think that there was something wrong, but in fact the actual timing depends on the type of track the greyhound has to run over.  If all our greyhounds were tried, for instance, on one track we would have a fair indication of their merits.  I suppose there would be no sport, however, in greyhound racing if we establish definitely that there was one outstanding greyhound that could win over every track.  The great gamble in <Col N="374" /> racing is that you may have one track faster than another and one greyhound might not be able to do as good a time on one track as on another.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why the board should appoint auctioneers or have the right to say what auctioneers can sell greyhounds.  Any man holding an auctioneer's licence should be entitled to sell greyhounds if he carries out the rules and regulations regarding trials and timing laid down by the board. In no circumstances would I give authority to the board to say that Mr. So-and-so will be the auctioneer for Dublin and that someone else will be the auctioneer for Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that the danger that the Deputy seems to suspect is present in Section 38&mdash;that the board has power to say who should be the auctioneer for Dublin or who should be the auctioneer for Cork or Limerick.  I think what the section proposes is that auctioneers are to carry out trials and preliminaries in accordance with the rules that the board lay down and that any auctioneer prepared to conform with these rules and regulations would become a licensed auctioneer for the purpose of selling greyhounds under a licence held from the board.  So long as he carries out these rules and regulations he would continue to be licensed to sell greyhounds.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I am influenced in recommending this section to the House by the strong advice that is contained in the advisory committee's report.  Paragraph 175 on page 76 of the report concludes with the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We feel satisfied that certain malpractices which exist in connection with sales here contributed to the decline.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They are there, of course, referring to the decline in the sales of greyhounds.</P>
      <P>Again on page 77 in paragraph 177 we have the words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have received much evidence in regard to the present conduct of sales.  Witnesses asserted that incalculable damage has been done <Col N="375" /> through irregularities and quoted instances in this connection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again on page 79, paragraph 182, the committee say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend, therefore, that the control board should, if necessary, appoint independent auctioneers to conduct public auction sales of greyhounds at selected centres in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the board and that no auction sales of greyhounds should be held except under licence from the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A recommendation appears further in paragraph 179 on page 79 and details of the main complaints that were made are set out in paragraph 178 of page 78.  These are the recommendations of the committee and I think the equitable way of dealing with the matter, without giving the board power to appoint auctioneers, would be to give the board power to make regulations and to attach these regulations to the licences of auctioneers so that any auctioneer of good standing who took out a licence from the board and undertook to carry out the rules and regulations prescribed in that licence would be free to carry on the business of auctioneering greyhounds. I think that is a sensible arrangement and a necessary reform because I believe the board ought to have some power of supervision of the conduct of greyhound auctioneering.  I would ask Deputies to bear in mind that we are trying in this Bill to put right whatever was wrong.</P>

      <P>The proposal here is to license auctioneers and to provide for their supervision by the board.

I think Deputy Walsh assumes that I am <Col N="376" /> approaching this matter in a Draconian way but the proposal I think goes as far as the report would have it go. I think it is a reasonable provision.  I do not want the impression to be created abroad that you cannot buy an honest greyhound in Ireland because I do not think that that is true.  I think this section will operate to stop any abuses that may have existed in connection with the auctioneering of greyhounds.  I think that probably something of this kind is necessary for that purpose and I suggest that we give these powers of control with a view to bringing this matter into the state in which we would wish to see it.</P>

      <P>It is very gratifying to hear from the Minister that at last he is going a little bit of the way with the advisory committee.  Much of the long debate that has taken place on this Bill has been occasioned by the fact that we thought that the Minister was ignoring the report of the committee. I suggest in this instance that he is going a little bit too far and a little bit too much of the way.  In this Bill the board is to have a monopoly control of the whole greyhound industry, and of every activity associated with it, whether it be coursing, racing, breeding, selling or exporting dogs. That is a very far-reaching monopoly to confer on any body of individuals. Therefore, everything associated with it deserves to be very carefully scrutinised before we give effect to it in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section we are giving that monopoly power to breed minor monopolies, power to restrict private enterprise in a way which the Minister would be first to denounce if it happened to be introduced by any other Government or by any other person than himself.  The question we must ask ourselves is whether it is in fact necessary to give this board these general powers of prohibition which are set out in paragraph (a), which prohibits persons from holding public sales of greyhounds save under and in accordance with licences granted by the board at its discretion, and in paragraph (h), which prohibits persons from acting as auctioneers at <Col N="377" /> sales save under and in accordance with permits granted by the board at its discretion or when otherwise approved of by the board, or save when appointed by the board as auctioneers.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary, in order to clear up the abuses which have been alleged to exist, to confer these powers of prohibition on the board?  I suggest that it is not.  The Minister has referred to the conclusions to which members of the advisory committee were driven by the evidence which was submitted to them.  Surely the Minister must also be aware of the fact that the advisory committee ascribed the existence of these abuses, where they did exist, to the fact that certain members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club were themselves suspected of profiting from these malpractices and therefore could not, since their own hands were unclean, take the necessary action to prevent them.</P>
    <P>That is important because one of the things that we on this side fear is that when this Bill becomes law the existing vested interests in that club will be given a statutory right to continue in control of the whole greyhound industry. Therefore, we must scrutinise very carefully and must be most reluctant to accept any proposal which would confirm these vested interests in the control which they now exercise. I am suggesting to the Minister that instead of giving the board power to prohibit persons from engaging in what is an ordinary commercial occupation or activity, instead of saying that a person may not hold a public sale of greyhounds unless he has a licence from this board, the Minister should give the board power to compile a register of persons who, they believe, would conduct sales of greyhounds honestly in the interests of the buyer and seller, as an auctioneer is supposed to do, power to issue a licence or a certificate that such and such a person is registered by them in the auctioneers' register and to give him that endorsement which I think will enable him to secure the confidence of those who may want to have dealings with him.  It could then be left to anyone else who wishes to sell greyhounds <Col N="378" /> to conduct a sale if he so desires.  The mere fact that a person is on an official register of that kind will be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he is a man of good faith, a man who will be honest in his dealings with both buyer and seller. That will enable individuals who at the present moment might not be powerful enough to secure a permit from the board to conduct their business and to build up their reputation as honest dealers.</P>
    <P>The Minister might look at the question from that point of view.  I do not think he is in favour of monopolies.  He has very often denounced in this House the creation of monopolies.  I have listened to him with a great deal of sympathy and I think our views are very closely in accord in that regard. I would suggest that he should not, under this section, allow the board to create minor monopolies as will be the consequence if paragraphs (a) and (h) of this section are enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think there is a danger of monopoly when the board has the function of making rules and regulations?  If people comply with those rules and regulations they will be entitled to a licence and only in the event of a breach of the rules and regulations taking place will the question of the withdrawal of a licence be raised.  I do not see any danger of creating a monopoly.  What I would envisage is that any person complying with the standard of rules and regulations laid down by the board would in the ordinary course receive a licence.</P>
      <P>Where a person is licensed to sell greyhounds by auction, when it is most necessary to maintain the highest standard of integrity lest Irish greyhound auctions get a disreputable name abroad, if any licensed auctioneer does something calculated to bring disrepute on Irish greyhound auctions, then he will be answerable under this section to the board and will be liable to lose his licence.  I see no danger of a monopoly being created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be amazed and I would look at this whole situation again should it transpire that auctioneers who are licensed auctioneers under the <Col N="379" /> Auctioneers Act and therefore men of good standing, were arbitrarily refused a licence.  I would imagine that any person of good standing, with a reasonable guarantee as to solvency, which I imagine any registered auctioneer must have, by way of bond or deposit, who applies for a licence under this Act will get it.  He would then be kept under observation in so far as he purported to auction greyhounds and if he failed to observe the regulations he would be answerable to the board.  If he persisted in misfeasance he might lose his licence to auction greyhounds.  If there is a recommendation in the report which is categorical, it is that there should be a control of greyhound auctioneers. This section is directed exclusively against persons who might conduct dishonest auctions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to castigate anybody who does not deserve to be castigated.  The greyhound report castigates the people who, it said, were responsible for corruptions and malpractices during the boom period of 1946-47.  I would attribute these corruptions and malpractices to the people at the head, the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  We had evidence of greyhound trainers and agents and foreign agents coming in here and picking up non-registered greyhounds. These were as plentiful as registered greyhounds throughout the country. Down through the years, many farmhouses kept a greyhound not to compete at coursing but for tracks and just for amusement&mdash;going out on a Sunday after a hare.  These were not registered.  When the boom period came, if there was a good-looking greyhound at a particular farm an agent offered a price for it.  The animal was useless unless it had pedigree papers.  The Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club issued these papers.  That was the beginning of the corruptions and malpractices we had at the auctions.  On the tracks, many of these dogs proved useless.  They had cost high prices and the people beyond said they had been robbed at the Irish auctions.  Was it any wonder that the sale of greyhounds <Col N="380" /> dropped from, I think, over £1,000,000 in 1948-49 to about £93,000 in 1953 and 1954?  That was the reason and not because you had the corruption at Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross or any other place in the country.  The agents who got these papers so easily were responsible for it.</P>
      <P>In Dublin there were two tracks where sales were carried out&mdash;Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross.  The number of greyhounds sold in 1951 was 4,701 for £409,256.  In 1952, a total of 4,378 greyhounds were sold for £223,250.  In 1953, the number of greyhounds sold was 3,955 for £421,000. Those were the total sales not at Shelbourne Park but for the whole country.  Almost £500,000 worth of greyhounds were sold in those years. The following figures will show that the sales at Shelbourne Park must have been satisfactorily carried out as otherwise they would not have increased their sales.  In 1951, 1,701 greyhounds were sold for £74,973.  In 1952, 1,774 greyhounds were sold for £83,610.  That represented an increase of 73 greyhounds and a considerable sum of money.  In 1953, the number of greyhounds sold was 1,734 for £93,340, an increase of £10,000 on the sales.</P>
      <P>I think that that is a fair indication that, so far as Shelbourne Park was concerned, the people who had greyhounds for sale were satisfied they were getting a fair deal.  I see no reason why or on what evidence the advisory committee should place the blame on the shoulders of those who were responsible for the carrying out of the sales and not on the people who in my opinion were directly responsible, that is, the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club, the people who issued the spurious forms to the owners of these non-pedigree greyhounds.  Therefore, I think it would not be wise to give the board these powers envisaged in the Bill of deciding who shall or shall not be an auctioneer.  I believe it should be left an open matter and that there should be no restriction, provided the proper facilities are made available for the track trials and the timing of the greyhounds under the stewardship, if you like, of an inspector of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>

It seems they will prohibit people from acting as auctioneers.  Let us take Kilkenny as an example.  Suppose the track there decide to bring in a fully qualified licensed auctioneer to sell the greyhounds. The board may say that they will not license him.</P>

He must have a timing apparatus before he gets a permit to auction greyhounds.  He is acting as an agent.  Remember, it is not the auctioneer who gets the licence. It is the track which gets the licence to sell because the track has the equipment and all the essential requisites. It is the track which brings the auctioneer as an agent.  But the board may say: &ldquo;No, you have not the equipment to carry out our regulations.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In the giving of licences to auctioneers.  Now the board, for some reason or other, may not like a particular track owner who has facilities for sales and, rightly or wrongly, that may result in changing the whole system or rendering the position disagreeable.  Earlier, we <Col N="383" /> dealt with the point in relation to track managers and the Minister stated that he would accept an amendment. Here, we propose to change the system. I do not think that change will be in the best interests of the industry.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, sales in the past have been carried out impartially and fairly on the tracks with which I am familiar.  I do not know why the board should come along now and interfere.  Any track owner who has a licence for the sale of greyhounds will do nothing except try to improve the good name of his track and make his sales the most lucrative in the country. That is the human way of looking at this and, for that reason, I cannot understand why we should interfere with things which are already going reasonably well.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to drop this section and to leave things as they are, so far as sales are concerned.  If the new board feels, in the light of experience, that they have not enough control and if they feel they can improve the position in relation to sales, there is nothing to stop the Minister, or any Minister who may be in office at that stage, coming in here and amending the Act. A number of Acts have been amended here from time to time.  I do not like this idea of too much interference with something which is doing reasonably well.  Sales are one part of the greyhound industry at which no one can point a finger in relation to the manner in which they are carried out by the track managers.  Very often people will say things, but, if they are asked to give evidence in public in support of their statements, they are not quite so forthcoming.  It is easy enough to say things casually behind another's back; it is another thing to sustain such statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, I have attended a number of these sales and, as Deputy Walsh said, any irregularities that may have occurred did not occur in the sales ring.  If irregularities occurred, <Col N="384" /> they were possibly caused by the wrong people getting licences by some means or other, means of which I am not personally aware.  I have heard rumours.  I appeal to the Minister to leave things as they are and withdraw this section.</P>

Auctioneers' fees will be 5 per cent. As was stated here, the auctioneers can act only as agents for the committee.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, taken in conjunction with the two foregoing sections, certainly is, to say the least, a surprising section to emanate from its present sponsors.  It is not so long <Col N="386" /> ago when the Fine Gael Party in particular made it a particular platform and a plank to talk about the coercion of the citizen and of private enterprise by rules, orders and regulations.  It is not so long ago when it was part of their campaign of attack on their political opponents to point out, not only the admitted evils that can flow from over-regulation and over-prescription by the central authority, but even to exaggerate those beyond all the reasonable limits the actual facts of the case imposed.  Perhaps I may claim a certain entitlement to make the charge I am going to make in regard to this Bill, in so far as I was one of the Deputies at that time who always took the view that legislation by order and regulation needed to be carefully confined and was an expedient which should be resorted to only under the compulsion of necessity.</P>
      <P>Here we have in three sections, in particular the section with which we are dealing, a prescription which goes far beyond the general prescriptions and constrictions which were so frequently the subject of condemnation and anathema by Deputies like the Minister for Agriculture, and the Attorney-General when on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I would for a moment invite the Minister, if he can, to recollect some of his former views in regard to the restraint of and interference with the individual in the matter of regulations. It is unnecessary for me to remind the Minister of his stricture on inspectors, but I think I could, without much difficulty, find passages in the Minister's former utterances which would paint in rather lurid terms the evils and the scandals which he alleged flowed from such regulations and their implementation through inspectors, police, and so forth.</P>
      <P>It is with that background that I invite the Minister for Agriculture to consider his present proposal, in the form of this section before the House to-day.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The board may make regulations for the control of the holding and conduct of public sales of greyhounds. Regulations under this <Col N="387" /> section may, in particular, make provision for...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first question I want to ask the Minister is this: with regard to &ldquo;public sales of greyhounds&rdquo;, has the Minister or has anybody defined exactly what the scope of those words &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;sales&rdquo; is, particularly the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;?  It might seem to the uninitiated that the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; meant a public assembly of interested persons and the disposal of the greyhounds, in this case, by auction in that assembly, or something like that.</P>
    <P>I should like to call the attention of the House to the fact that, in the context of this section, the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; appears and I think is broadened to include any sale whatever, however carried out, provided it follows an invitation to an unspecified number of persons.  To make that more definite, the only type of sale that I can conceive that can escape the terms of this section is a sale where, say, A owns a greyhound and B may like to buy it. B knows of the greyhound and A knows of the buyer, and either A approaches B or B approaches A. That would be a private sale which would escape the terms of the section, but if there is any wider casting of the net, any wider solicitation of either purchasers or sellers, then it strikes me that the section captures the sale in question.</P>
    <P>The implications of that are rather startling.  I trust my cursory reading of this in general terms is correct, because I must confess to an abysmal ignorance of the details of greyhound racing and all connected therewith, but let the Minister mark that I am taking my stand on this section on the general terms of the unnecessary restriction of rights, of the unnecessary restriction of private enterprise to which so much lip service is paid, even though apparently it continues to be the practice to curtail it and to block the initiative of private enterprise at nearly every turn.  To get back to the question of the specific terms of the section, as I conceive it, you will prohibit commerce in this commodity, <Col N="388" /> greyhounds, in every case, except where you have a private negotiation of the very restricted type which I mentioned.  As soon as the owner of the animal finds that he is unable himself, through his own endeavours, directly to contact the purchaser, or as soon as a purchaser who wishes to buy a dog fails through his own personal efforts, in contacting those who have dogs to sell&mdash;as soon as either party fails and is compelled to seek the intervention of a third party&mdash;the sale is captured by the terms of the section.</P>
    <P>It is not only a question of blocking auctioneers&mdash;and here I think there is a question involved of a legitimate profession and the commercial rights of a recognised group of practitioners &mdash;but apart from anyone in this category, if a mere third party should be asked to intervene to seek a purchaser or a seller that is in definite contradistinction to &ldquo;specified&rdquo; or already identified purchasers or sellers, as soon as it comes to the seeking of a purchaser or seller by unspecified arrangement, then the section rules and that person&mdash;he might even be a friend or relation&mdash;contravenes the regulation under this section and is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50.  I think that that in itself is a sufficiently serious aspect of the case to require reconsideration.</P>
    <P>For a moment, with your indulgence, Sir, I think it is opportune to draw attention to Sections 36 and 37 in the same context, to say nothing of Section 39.  Take the case of the auctioneers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apart from the wideness of the section&mdash;and the section is uncritically wide&mdash;I think in <Col N="389" /> all objectivity I would be justified, if not in making the charge, in raising the question, as to whether this aspect of this part of this Bill has been adequately considered at a level beyond the executive level, which is merely interested in the implementation of the provision.  After a certain number of years' experience of this type of thing and having made inquiries, I do not at all blame the advisory bodies that Governments or Ministers have for the attitude which they must take in order to make things workable.</P>
      <P>It is very natural that in first drafts and in drafts emanating to Ministers and Governments there should be a bias in favour of the executive, in favour of the implementation.  In fact, that is really the root of the trouble; there is, frequently, no ulterior malice in the sense which the Minister used to charge in regard to these matters.  It is merely the natural desire of people charged with doing a task to include over-safe provisions from their point of view.  None of us is so omniscient and possesses such a broad perspective that he can balance everything at first sight.</P>
      <P>It is for that very reason that people like the Minister, carrying a responsibility, and Governments in particular, should be scrupulous about their duty in these balances.  Too often of late Ministers take merely the executive view of their function.  That in plain language means simply what is presented to them on a plate, without taking the trouble to analyse the whole thing.  Even there I sympathise with the individual Minister.  It is in this that the Coalition Government fails so lamentably in the country's interest.</P>
      <P>This type of legislation is typical of what can come from a group of individuals without a common aim or policy, and who, with an economic situation driving against them, are unable to keep the community view.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the Minister and the Government on this section, apart from the advocacy of the present Minister, on different occasions and in different circumstances. His adaptability to his case is something to be marvelled at, something which is not his exclusively, but is a characteristic of the Fine Gael Party.  I think that the Minister should reconsider this section in the light of his own previous attitude to restrictions and regulations of this sort.  Why will the Minister not give the critical attention to the provisions in this Bill that he was so ready to give to such matters on this side of the House?  Let us be reasonable.  In anything that has to be done it will be necessary to provide a practical <i>modus operandi</i> but does the Minister really seriously contend that starting under this innocuous heading &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo; in this Bill, Sections 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Obviously this is a decision to obstruct the Bill.  It is so obvious that it is unnecessary to mention it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When there is a serious attempt made to deal with a serious matter, we are told we are being obstructive.  If you look at the Order of Business you will see who is doing the business.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out the dangerously wide scope of the words &ldquo;public sales&rdquo; in sub-section (1).  Sub-section (2), however, makes a specific prohibition on persons from holding public sales of greyhounds, save under licence.  That simply means that unless a buyer can make immediate contact with a specific seller, an identified seller, or <i>vice versa</i>, nobody can sell a greyhound without a licence which the board can grant at its discretion.  I have nothing against the board and I am sure this board will be appointed as others, and we have had very few complaints about the functions of these boards.  But boards are not composed of omniscient beings who are able to keep complete balance and keep themselves completely free from prejudice. It means that whatever the mechanics of rearing greyhounds may be, nobody can sell a greyhound in Ireland except in the limited way which I have mentioned, with the permission and sanction of the board.  I wonder if that is a useful provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object on principle that here is a board which is entitled to say who can or who cannot sell greyhounds.  I am dealing with the question of principle. It is gratifying to find that in the long history of boards in this country there has been very little to complain of, in a particular way which might be inferred from this.  In principle it is open to the board to give a person permission to buy or sell and to refuse him permission.  Thereby, by creating <Col N="392" /> that situation there is the risk of creating a situation of fundamental injustice between individuals quite apart from the larger issue of removing free enterprise.  In plain language, you are legislating for the possibility of favouritism or monopoly exercisable on behalf of such persons as the board in its discretion might select, to the detriment and exclusion of all other persons who might reasonably, profitably and equitably engage in that business.  Is that not going very far? What is more, is it not going unnecessarily far?  As I have said, we can all sympathise with the Minister and his officers in their efforts to get a workable scheme.  Sometimes restrictions and constrictions are necessary and have to be adopted all too frequently.  But is it necessary that you go to the extent to which you go in this section?</P>
    <P>If it is not necessary, surely the principle of which the Minister so vocally professed himself to be the champion in previous years should rule in a case like that?  Is it fair that the board should be in a position to create such an exclusive monopoly or monopolies to the exclusion, mark you, of other legitimate interests?  Apart from what is fair, is it good for industry? I am not in a position to quote the Minister.  If I misrepresent him, I shall be only too glad to withdraw, but I think I have heard the Minister argue that commerce should be as unrestricted as the situation will allow in order to flourish&mdash;that freedom fosters trade. Surely, in a case like this, it is freedom of negotiation and freedom of commerce that are needed to stimulate movement in this industry, to stimulate a trade which is alleged to be such an important one for our community from the economic and financial point of view?</P>
    <P>That is a matter which I am not competent to judge.  But if it is so, if this industry is of sufficient importance to merit such legislation or if it is of such economic importance to the community, should we not try to encourage it by giving it elbow room and by giving it freedom of negotiation, rather than have the wholesale policy of restriction which seems to be included <Col N="393" /> in this Bill and particularly exemplified by this section under discussion now?  These are the questions which I put to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think half the Minister's difficulty in this may stem from the words &ldquo;public sales&rdquo; and &ldquo;discretion&rdquo;. Again, in all objectivity, I charge the Minister&mdash;or, rather, I charge the Government&mdash;with having allowed this Bill to come before this House without having provided the proper balances, which any homogeneous Government would provide, and without duly considering the various aspects involved in legislation of this nature.  In particular, I would invite the Minister to consider in Section 38, sub-section (2), paragraph (a)&mdash;I hope I am sufficiently relevant to the section&mdash;in line 29 the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;, the due qualification of that, and the qualification of the phrase &ldquo;while the board at its discretion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly willing, and I think everybody on this side of the House is perfectly willing, to listen to the arguments that may be there for the necessity for regulating certain aspects of this industry and certain aspects in regard to sales.  But I refuse to believe that everybody connected with it is so amoral as to require the sanctions, constrictions and restrictions and I might even say the persecutions, that can be provided for within the terms of this section.  Like many other things, there may be need for a certain ordering, but I think it is wholly unnecessary to assume, for instance, that every auctioneer in this country is a crook.  It seems to me that that is what this section assumes.  It seems to be totally unnecessary to assume that.  In fact, I think it would be a much better approach to these problems if we were to assume that reputable bodies of people in various categories, wherever they impinge, are not only reputable but that it should be assumed that bodies such as that can be given the guarantee of a certain freedom of action, and that these people, who know their business, are the very people whose help and assistance should be invoked towards securing the ordering of whatever of these matters may be necessary&mdash;in this instance the <Col N="394" /> question of the public sales of greyhounds.</P>
    <P>On this section I would ask the Minister this.  Supposing in the course of argument the Minister convinces me &mdash;and, mark you, I will take a bit of convincing on this, and I am not to be taken in making this hypothetical concession for the sake of moving to the second part of my argument, as conceding my first point&mdash;but supposing that the Minister does convince me or could convince me that it is necessary that all sales, other than the direct specified negotiation sales of the sole type excluded from this Bill, as I conceive it, should be regulated, I would then put this to the Minister: what better way could you regulate those sales than to take the readily organised body, the professional bodies that you have available, the people whose business it is and whose vocation in the community it is to provide the interchange and the medium for buying and selling?  Why not invoke these and provide that the auctioneers, the reputable and properly recognised auctioneers of the country, would discharge this function instead of providing a board&mdash;no matter how you look at it there is a certain compulsion on a board; no matter how free it is specified to be in legislation, there is a certain implication of service during the pleasure and so forth&mdash;instead of a board with power to appoint monopolies or power to appoint one person as a monopoly with all the evil that flows from that?</P>
    <P>The Minister may say to me that this is a most unfair charge, that he has no intention of giving it over to one person as a monopoly.  I am not making that charge.  But I am making the charge that it is possible to do that under this section and that, in so far as <i>inter alia</i> it is possible in this section to do this, this section is bad and thoroughly bad.</P>
    <P>On these arguments, taking Section 38, sub-section (2), paragraph (8), I make the specific request to the Minister to qualify, otherwise define, or modify two portions of that section: the words, &ldquo;public sales&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;at its discretion&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have drawn the Minister's attention to his own previous observations on these matters of restrictions and monopolies; I have drawn his attention to the matter of restriction and revocation and I have asked the Minister to qualify the words &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to sub-section (b) which provides for the making by the board of charges in respect of the grant, retention and renewal of licences.  I further submit that that provision is also far too wide because everybody knows that sections of this nature, by providing for fees or charges of this nature, can very often be a very effective instrument in the exercise of discretion in favour of one group as against another.  By a system of regulating charges, it is possible to exclude or to impose restrictions on certain people in the business.  This section could be a very useful instrument to that purpose.  Again you have the suggestion in this section which tends towards the creation and building <Col N="396" /> up of a monopoly, quite aside from the simple and general words &ldquo;the granting, retention or renewal of licences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (b), will the Minister not introduce some restriction or qualification on the omnibus power of the board to charge in respect of the grants for retention and renewal of licences?  He should at least make some provision for appeal and here again you have an organised body which might be presumed usefully to have something to say in this matter.</P>
    <P>I now come to paragraph (c) which deals with the attachment of conditions to licences.  That provision, in conjunction with the provisions of sub-section (1), is so general as to make, if necessary, the board's power in regard to the granting of licences a mere window-dressing procedure.  It simply means, in effect, that sub-section (c) of sub-section (2), in conjunction with sub-section (1) has the effect of saying that all conditions attaching to the granting of licences are the business of the board; that they can conduct that matter anyway they like and that nobody can interfere with them.  That is what it boils down to.  So much for private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (d) deals with the suspension and revocation of licences.  Taken in conjunction with sub-section (b), it means that the board can grant licences, suspend them or revoke them at their pleasure; so much at the pleasure and control of this board that the licensee will be merely in the position of functioning on sufferance or, more likely, under direction.  Is it a licence in the ordinary accepted sense of the word at all?  It can be issued at the board's discretion or refused at the board's discretion; charged for at the board's discretion; the board can put into it any conditions they like and it can be suspended or revoked under the board's discretion.  Where are the rights, even of the favoured ones who will get the licences, not to say anything about the ones who can be refused licences?</P>
    <P>There might be another aspect of this matter.  I note that there is a distinction in this section.  I note that the granting of the licence is at the <Col N="397" /> board's discretion, but a regulation under this section may be made by the board in regard to these other matters. It is abundantly clear that the board is being put into the statutory position of making its own statutory rules and orders.  That is the position.  The Minister may think it unjust of me, but I cannot help remembering the outcry, even under war and emergency conditions, which was made against empowering Ministers to make regulations. Here in the full tide of peace-time, in the matter of the greyhound industry, in the matter of a very specialised activity, in the matter of ordinary business, in the field of private enterprise, we find that the Minister and his Government saw fit to go so far in front of what they were criticising in the past that he will now grant statutory powers to a board. That, I humbly submit, is the position in this case.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (e) provides for the keeping of records by licensees and the production of such records for inspection and the taking of copies or extracts by authorised officers of the board.  Not only are the licensees constrained in their activities by the other sections of this Bill, but they must keep records.  Will they be licensees or employees or serfs?  They must keep their records and produce them for inspection.  Will the Minister for Agriculture note the words &ldquo;for inspection&rdquo;?  Will every licensee live in fear of that inspector?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may think I am exaggerating but I would invite older <Col N="398" /> Deputies to imagine how Deputy Dillon, as he then was, would paint the picture, as he did in the past, from the position from which I am now speaking.  He can hardly blame me for pointing out the inconsistency in his own particular attitude and the dangers from the point of view which he so staunchly took up in the past himself.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised this question of inspection a little bit, perhaps, and I do not think Deputy Dillon will think it unfair of me&mdash;I think it is very fair of me&mdash;to point out to him his own strong stand on these matters in other connections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let Deputy Morrissey be fair to me.  This specific case arises on sub-section (e) and I am specifically dealing with the question of records and inspections.  I think the provision in sub-section (e) is unnecessary, in principle, bad and dangerous in practice, and in peace-time wholly unjustifiable.  Again, I am going to risk a bit of repetition but in not quite the same way.  I have no objection to the Minister restricting in a broader way but it is this approach in principle which is tyrannical.  Why do we have to assume that auctioneers are so amoral&mdash;I will not use &ldquo;immoral&rdquo;&mdash;that such provisions are necessary?  Why can it not be organised under an existing reputable body like that and at least try the experiment?</P>
      <P>I have the report of the advisory committee on the greyhound industry and at page 79, paragraph (181) thereof it says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are satisfied that on the whole and despite the prevalence of these <Col N="399" /> various abuses, auctioneers have endeavoured to perform their duties efficiently and honestly.  Abuses were, however, not confined to public auction sales, since a small minority of private sellers indulged in similar malpractices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have pointed out the way in which the private seller evades this by the use of the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; and I have pointed out at the same time the position of auctioneers.  I can see the need for ordering but why not organise it on the basis that the auctioneers are a reputable body of people who can be trusted to discharge this function for the community and give freedom and objective justice in the provision?</P>
    <P>I make no charges and I hope the Minister understands that I am dealing with the principle.  As I have done in regard to other sections, I submit that in the case of sub-section (e) the Minister would be very wise to delete that provision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the furnishing of information to the board by licensees, that, of course, is merely making assurance doubly sure.  It is merely tightening up the other in case there was any escape in regard to inspection, the taking of records, or anything like that.  It is a mandamus: &ldquo;You will appear and render an account&rdquo;.  That is all that means.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (g) brings up a danger of another sort, the procedure and the conditions precedent to the acceptance of greyhounds for sale.  I am absolutely certain that the Minister's advisers never intended what I am going to point out now.  Nevertheless, within the specific terms of this sub-section, the possibility is so to control the sale of greyhounds that certain people will be denied the right of dealing in greyhounds at all.  It will be possible in principle for this board to say: &ldquo;I will sell the greyhounds if they belong to A and I will not sell them if they belong to B.&rdquo;  It will be possible in principle to say: &ldquo;I will sell greyhounds to X and I will not sell them to Y.&rdquo;  But, even further and worse still, it will be possible for the board to say: &ldquo;I will sell A's greyhounds to X and B's to Y or I will not sell them at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Again, understanding the difficulties of draftsmanship and understanding the Minister's executive problems in this, I think this omnibus coverage of all contingencies&mdash;I do not think there is any more malice in it than that&mdash; shows an appalling disregard for general public rights.  This sub-section perhaps more than any other sub-section in the section cries out in its present form for amendment or deletion.</P>
    <P>Again, I would recommend to the Minister something that was recommended when this whole question of rules and regulations was debated before and which used to be such a point of debate with the Minister's colleagues in the House.  It is, that the specific abuse, evil or point which is to be covered should be covered and no more.  Avoid the temptation to cover all eventualities since you can only do that by prescribing a tyranny.  Do not be afraid of a ghost.  If a ghost materialises into something tangible, there is plenty of time to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It is wrong <i>a priori</i> to start with the assumption that you have got to legislate for everything.  That is just precisely what sub-section (g) does.  It is simply another variant of the whole motive in this section.  The executive, through the board, can do what they blooming well like in regard to greyhounds and the greyhound industry. That is the whole content of it.  I am not saying that is the intention, but it is the content of the section and, as the Minister knows, when it comes to an interpretation in a court of law or executive action, any assurance the Minister gives, any speech I or any other Deputy makes, will not be of any use.  The thing is judged solely, and the intention of the House is expressed solely by what is in cold print enacted by the Oireachtas and signed by the President.  There is no going back on this.  If this is to get to the stage of becoming law there is nothing we can do about it.  What is contained in this section as it stands is what I have pointed out and not the Minister's good intentions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey may make his phone call.  Deputy Morrissey will not tie me, I hope, because I do not intend to stay here until 3 o'clock&mdash;on this section I mean. I was dealing with paragraph (h) of the sub-section, which simply means the permission of the board in general terms.  The word I want to fix on in this respect is &ldquo;prohibiting&rdquo;.  I presume the sales referred to are restricted to greyhounds.  I have not examined the Bill as to the extent the board will regulate auctioneers.  If the Bill is to be interpreted as applying in any respect to the code relevant to auctioneers, the board will be an auctioneering board and not a greyhound board.  I do not think that is intended.  If there is any danger of that calamitous consequence the Minister might examine it closely and an amendment could be agreed upon during the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that the paragraph means that the prohibition applies to <Col N="402" /> auctioneers at sales of greyhounds &ldquo;save under and in accordance with permits granted by the board at its discretion or when otherwise approved of by the board, or save when appointed by the board as auctioneers&rdquo;, there is a peculiar thing about the sub-section.  It says nothing about licensees.  Paragraph (e) refers to licensees, and paragraph (a) deals with the granting of licences.  Paragraph (b) also deals with licences and also seems to envisage the granting of licences, again by the board at its discretion. Again I would ask the Minister if this peculiar variation was unwittingly slipped in here?</P>
    <P>At first flush one would think this section dealt with licensees, but it appears to me that we have a further class, namely a class to whom permits might be granted at the board's discretion. Here, as a matter of interpretation, the word &ldquo;discretion&rdquo; is of some importance because it is part of the operative words in paragraph (a) which give power to the board in respect of the setting up of the classes of persons to be known as licensees.  Here, tucked away&mdash;perhaps even the Minister or his advisers have not noticed this&mdash;there is a further class defined and provided for, and in the operative words again, this very wide endowment of discretion for those to whom permits can be granted at the board's discretion.</P>
    <P>What is a permit?  Paragraph (h) says: &ldquo;or when otherwise approved of by the board, or save when appointed by the board as auctioneers&rdquo;.  The appointment of an auctioneer by the board may be the same thing as appointing a licensee.  They are in the same category, and I would be satisfied if I knew that what happened was that the Minister substituted the word &ldquo;licensee&rdquo; for &ldquo;auctioneer&rdquo;.  I do not think we should let pass without notice in the House two other classes provided for in this section, namely those to whom grants of a permit may be made&mdash;a much wider class, a more unlimited class than the licensee.</P>

      <P>I was saying that, apart from the specifying of auctioneers appointed by the board and of licensees, both of which classes are perfectly all right, you have these further classes.  I think the Minister should give us a definition on the point.  What is the class of person to whom a permit may be granted by the board at its discretion?  It seems to me that that word is included simply because it is feared that the class of licensee, exclusive of appointed auctioneers, is not wide enough to ensure that the prohibition will run to the absolute limits to which the Minister and his advisers would wish or would feel to be necessary to protect their intention in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister may challenge me if I am obstructing.  The Minister has the parliamentary experience and the wit of speech to challenge me if he can show that any point I am making is not in order on the section.</P>

      <P>In regard to this section as I have already stated I am not charging that there is any ulterior motive, but I do think that in bringing in this Bill you have not given sufficient consideration to the matters and that there is too wide scope in many of these sections What class of persons are defined as functioning in accordance with permits granted by the board?  There is clearly a differentiation in this matter as compared with the licences defined in the earlier section.  This is the Committee Stage of a Bill and it is proper that we should go into every detail on this stage thoroughly.  It is a pity that we do not do it more often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What classes of persons are included in this particular phrase?  Furthermore, the class appears to be enlarged <Col N="404" /> by the phrase &ldquo;Or otherwise provided by the board&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Or otherwise provided by the board.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that that section is wide enough.  Having taken all these things into account it could go even beyond the words &ldquo;public sales&rdquo; referred to in the first section.  The section starts off with an unnecessarily wide definition. We find at paragraph (h) a prohibition on persons from acting as auctioneers&mdash; sales by people to whom a permit has not been granted by the board or approved by the board.  It would seem as though that is intended to bring in particular types of sellers who might otherwise escape the section. The prohibition in this case is unnecessarily wide.  In paragraph (b) there is provision for the making of charges in respect of the grant, retention or renewal of licences.  The observations to be made there are the same as on the earlier section.</P>
      <P>In connection with the conditions attaching to permits, the suspension and revocation of permits, you have in regard to these a somewhat clear definition on this class of permit, whatever the permit may be.  I think this thing is altogether too restrictive.</P>
      <P>Now we come to something else, the publication of catalogues at sales and the information to be given thereon, both as regards the greyhounds for sale and otherwise.  I understand completely the need for some regulation and resstriction in regard to that, but I would say to the Minister that having regard to the general drafting of that section, it is unnecessarily wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obviously unnecessarily wide as to the nature of what information should be given or might be required about the dogs.  I take it that some regulation may be desirable in this respect but this section is unfortunately wide enough to enable the board to say they were not going to enter a particular dog in the catalogue because they did not like the owner, so that section could be used as an indirect sanction.  That is a very dangerous sort of thing to have there and it gets <Col N="405" /> back to the question of the section being unnecessarily wide.</P>
    <P>Everyone will agree with the Minister that there should be something to prevent lying or misleading information being given about dogs entered for sales, and being included in the catalogues. In spite of that I still think that this section has come out of a greater caution complex, being in unnecessarily wide terms.  The result is that a dog could be excluded from the catalogue for many reasons.  In fact that section might be interpreted or construed as an indirect sanction against some particular owner or seller, where other methods might not work.  I think this is a section which should be fully examined in all its implications and amended.</P>
    <P>Regarding the publication of information concerning the results of sales, again I do not want to repeat myself but it is hard for me not to refer back to the stand taken by the Minister, Deputy McGilligan and others on matters of that type where a censorship is imposed.  The Minister and the lawyer Deputies in the Fine Gael Party were always very much concerned about the imposition of censorship and said so on every possible occasion.  This section regarding the publication of information concerning sales might possibly lead to a situation almost amounting to censorship.</P>
    <P>For instance, would it be competent for them to make provision for the publication and recording of such information only as the board approved? That is a question I throw out to the lawyers.  If it is competent for them to make regulations in that tenor under the section it simply means that they could refuse to record a sale relating to a particular interest or person.  I leave it to Deputies' imagination to show where that might lead.  Incidentally, I do not think it is intended that they should make regulations for saying how much should be published anywhere beyond the case of paragraph (e) which is limited to the publication of catalogues. Paragraph (m) provides for the recording and publication of information anywhere relating to the results of <Col N="406" /> sales.  Supposing this board wishes to have a monopoly for some particular publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take this purely in the abstract at the moment and to point out the danger.  Let us suppose that this board is to decide that only one favoured medium of publication is to get that information and that they and they alone are to publish that information relating to sales of greyhounds.  There is a matter of considerable public importance in this.  If the principle is pushed a little bit further it could affect other types of sales.  I appreciate the difficulty the Minister is in and that he must depend on his advisers but I do not think the Minister can legitimately charge me with obstruction, with malice or with the abuse of my position in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister come to this sub-section and say if I am guilty of any of these three when I draw attention to that point here?  We realise that every Bill, every legislative provision, will have material for criticism and for amendment.  The Minister has nothing to be ashamed of that his provisions should be criticised in the House.  That is what the committee is for but will the Minister not accept my criticism in the spirit in which I make it and agree with me that some qualification is required in respect of this sub-section?  It is quite clear what the Minister means and what his advisers mean, and I sympathise. In relation to paragraph (1) of the sub-section it is quite clear that provision is being made for an authoritative, reliable and thoroughly honest catalogue and an official record of information in relation to this industry. That is highly desirable and necessary. In order to accomplish that, it is desirable that the board would have power to arrange for the selection and recording of that information.  That is a legitimate function; in fact it would be a primary function.  Therefore, in <Col N="407" /> so far as its own catalogue is concerned it should certainly have the power of both the publication and the recording of that information.  I would even go further and say that the board might have an interest in seeing that such information that is published anywhere is reliable, and I think that is the intention behind the sub-section.</P>
      <P>What I want to point out, however, is that this sub-section goes far beyond that and that it calls for amendment in this sense, that whereas the only information on these particular matters may require the sanction of the board, when that information is ascertained and published at any point it should be made available to all media of publication. In other words what was really intended in the sub-section is the keeping of the specific records right and that in connection with that information as regards bloodstock, and so on, you might go so far as to say that any unofficial records of that nature are to be banned.  That may be all right, but whatever is to be published should be freely publishable in all media which wish to publish it, whether it be a national newspaper, the provincial Press or any other publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (n) which deals with the furnishing of documents (including certificates and guarantees) to persons purchasing greyhounds at sales, I do not think that in a proper context, and not in the context of this section, that would be objectionable. These are my comments on the first two sub-sections of the Bill and I think I have substantiated the general charges which I made at the opening. I think I have refuted specifically, and the record will show the impartial reader that there is no foundation for it, the charge that I was talking for any other purpose than to analyse the section.  It is significant, now that I have finished on these two sections, that neither the Minister nor anyone else challenged me on a point of irrelevancy.  Deputy Morrissey attempted to challenge me on a point of repetition but the Chair had not to go to the unnecessary trouble of calling me back to relevancy.  In view of the <Col N="408" /> Minister's charge, I feel I am entitled to make these statements.</P>
    <P>The third sub-section does not call for comment.  If you have provisions, sanction is necessary.  The details of the section are relatively insignificant compared with the matters that arise on the section as a whole but this section&mdash;and it is not alone in this Bill&mdash; is an unwarranted and, I am afraid&mdash; and I use this word very deliberately&mdash; an arbitrary interference and provision for further arbitrary interference with not only legitimate private enterprise in this country but with a legitimately organised group in this country who are providing a reputable and proper service to the community already.</P>
    <P>The whole conception of the Bill seems to be based on the charge that such people cannot be trusted.  That is a calamitous mistake to make and one that executives are only too often prone to make.  It would be much better if we fell back on the vocational organisations and invoked their help and co-operation&mdash;and I have never known it to fail in any instance.</P>
    <P>It is in that spirit that I commend the Minister and exhort the Minister with all his own exhortations of the past to throw not only the section but the whole Bill into the fire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to say all I have to say not in an hour and 37 minutes, the period taken by Deputy de Valera, but in seven minutes. Deputy de Valera and Deputy MacEntee pretended to be very indignant when they were accused of deliberate obstruction.  The most obvious piece of deliberate obstruction I have seen in this House is the playacting we have had here this morning. Deputy de Valera and the Deputy who, before him, struck the tuning fork for the debate on this particular section, Deputy Corry, pretended to be extremely concerned about the dangers of this section.  Deputy de Valera was so concerned about it that he thought it necessary and desirable to parse every line, not to say every <Col N="409" /> sentence or sub-section in it.  He was concerned about the interpretation of the various words used there.  The concern apparently only arose in his mind when he was asked to come in and speak at length on it this morning because, if he were as concerned as he pretended and had read the section before he came here this morning, I suggest the Deputy would, if he were really concerned, not have failed in his duty as a member of this House to move amendments to the section and to the various sub-sections.</P>
      <P>In so far as anybody has failed in his duty, in so far as anybody has not made himself conversant with the dangers which Deputy de Valera now sees for the first time, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy de Valera have so failed.  I do not mind about Deputy MacEntee: we all know he is concerned only with one aspect of this Bill.  His concern is only with certain individuals who are going to be affected one way or the other by the passing of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Provoked&rdquo;&mdash;and, if I were, the Deputy would revoke very quickly.  I can enjoy a bit of play-acting as much as anybody else but I think I have the right and the duty to object strongly when the Deputy tries to use the organisation of which I happen to be a member as a stick with which to beat this Bill and the Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked about giving a board the right to select an auctioneer as if it were something new.  Is that not the right of every Government Department and of every State and semi-State body in this country and has it not been the right from the beginning?  I am not going to say that it has been abused.  Mark you, I can speak rather objectively on this because neither from this Government nor from its predecessor did I ever get a sale or an auction, and I never sought it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry talked about this being a racket and the way in which the racket would be worked as between the auctioneer and the board.  Now, Deputy de Valera did not say that; but Deputy Corry did.  Of course, there is always somebody to say the things the decent fellows will not say or do not want to say; but, when the other fellow says them, they can listen to them and enjoy them.  Deputy Corry talked about the sharing of the spoils, namely, the commission, being direputable.  Perhaps it is, but Deputy Corry supported&mdash;and still supports&mdash;a Party that not merely condoned that but approved of it, sanctioned it and put it into operation in relation to departmental auctions and sales.  I have had occasion to denounce that in this House in the past.  State property was advertised for sale and it was stated: &ldquo;Terms cash, with 5 per cent. auctioneers' fees&rdquo;, leading, or misleading, the public into believing that the auctioneer would be paid 5 per cent. when in fact prior to the auction, they had invited tenders and had accepted the lowest tender, down to 1 <Col N="411" /> per cent., without any regard whatever to the competency, or otherwise, of the particular individual getting the sale.</P>
    <P>I am provoked into saying that now because it is sought to be conveyed&mdash; both Deputy Corry and Deputy Vivion de Valera tried to convey, and indeed stated it&mdash;that, for the first time, the Minister is in fact making an attack upon a very responsible and reputable organisation.  That is not so.</P>

      <P>This is a very important section.  It deals with public sales of greyhounds and, from that point of view, it is very important so far as greyhound owners are concerned. Strange as it may seem, I have had certain experience&mdash;not unsatisfactory experience&mdash;in relation to this matter of greyhound sales.  I realise how important it is for those members of our community interested in the greyhound industry, in greyhounds and in the breeding of them, to be protected from any abuses. Abuses may have occurred in the past, though I am certainly not aware of any personally.  But suggestions have been made that there were certain abuses detrimental to greyhound owners, particularly to the poor people very often, the small farmers about whom the Taoiseach spoke yesterday, and the working man who had the good luck to own good dogs but who was not very successful in their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of vital importance that the interests of these people should be safeguarded.  To suggest that a detailed examination of the proposals put forward in this Bill is obstruction is certainly carrying the definition of obstruction very far.  There is no intention to obstruct.  In this long section there are a number of sub-sections running from (a) to (n) in connection with the public sales of <Col N="414" /> greyhounds.  If the proposals in the section safeguard the interests of owners better than they have been safeguarded in the past and if they make the position watertight from the point of view of preventing fraud or dishonesty, that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>Now Deputy de Valera is a lawyer and he understands legal language, legal phraseology and legal jargon much better than laymen like us can understand it.  He has analysed this section from (a) to (n).  I was particularly impressed by the dangers inherent in the section, as drafted, to which he drew attention.  It has been suggested by Deputy Morrissey that an amendment should have been put down.  On a previous occasion when we had legislation like this&mdash;the Health Act&mdash;that legislation was opposed by the Fine Gael Party and they did not put down any amendments; they said the Bill was so wrong they could not put down an amendment.  The same can be said of this measure.  The advisory committee made certain recommendations in regard to this matter and many other cognate matters in connection with the greyhound industry.  The previous Government gave instructions to have these recommendations put in the form of a Bill but I am afraid the Minister has departed radically from a large number of the recommendations that were made by this advisory committee.</P>

The Opposition have had no less than four months in which to study this Bill and submit any amendments they thought fit.

      <P>The speech made by Deputy de Valera this morning was made for the purpose of obstructing the parliamentary duty of us all to consider the Bill which is at present before the House.  Any one or all of the objections to which he referred could have been dealt with by amendment. In the course of his statement, and in the course of the statement of every other member of the Opposition who spoke to-day, each one of them said that some regulation of the sale by public auction of greyhounds was necessary.  None contended that there should be no regulation or control of the conditions under which such sales are held.  Therefore, some form of Section 38 was requisite and was necessary for the Bill.  Four months have passed since the Second Stage of this Bill was passed by Dáil Éireann and the Second Stage of this Bill was passed without a division.  The Opposition participated in the adoption of the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that I had not given sufficient consideration to the drafting of this Bill.  I gave protracted consideration to the drafting of this Bill. The Opposition were in Government for two years and failed to bring forward a single section to implement the report of the committee of inquiry which they now profess to commend. I, then, brought forward this Bill, including Section 38, within 18 months of taking office.  The Opposition did not vote against it.</P>

I think that kind of procedure does harm out of all proportion to any purpose that could be served in connection with a measure of this kind.  We who are familiar with the proceedings of Parliament know that if such procedures were repeatedly resorted to parliamentary government would become impossible.  Parliamentary government is a process of give and take.  It may be that where great principles are involved extreme courses may be justified.  We are now discussing a Bill to regulate the running and the sale of greyhounds.  That is a vital matter to a certain section of our agricultural community.  There is no question of high principle here involved.  It is purely a question of investing the industry itself with the machinery requisite to prevent the recurrence of abuses.  It is no occasion to put the parliamentary system to the strain that obstruction of this character imposes upon it.  The plain have is that this Government could have recourse to the guillotine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have explained to the House the purpose for which the section was brought in, but I must ask the House to excuse me from assisting the Opposition to prevent further the functioning of Parliament in respect of this section.  Everybody in the House knows what the purpose of the section is; everybody in the House will know that no amendment has been submitted to it by any member of the Opposition although the Opposition agree that some degree of regulation under such a section as this is necessary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust we shall get a little latitude to reply to the speech to which we have just listened.  We have been accused of obstruction.  This section was flung at the House by the Minister without one word of explanation or exposition in regard make that is a unique proposal in the legislation of our country.  As no parallel to point clear.  We found in any other this section our Statute Books.  The next state is we are taunted with the fact that we allowed this Bill to have a Second Reading without a division. We did, Sir, because we feel very strongly that there were abuses existing which ought to be dealt with.  We feel that the greyhound industry has great potentialities and that, therefore, it should become the concern of the Oireachtas to ensure that everything that properly can be done to assist that industry to grow and develop and prosper should be done.  That is why we accepted the Second Reading of this Bill without a division.  There is no obstruction in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next charge that has been levelled against us is that we did not put down an amendment to this section. Why should we do the Minister's work for him?  The Minister is responsible for Section 38.  These are proposals <Col N="419" /> which come before Parliament and we have pointed out the imperfections in them.  We have pointed out the far-reaching implications in this section.  If the Minister did not think it worth while, in the seclusion of his office with his advisers around him to parse this section, as it was parsed here this morning by Deputy de Valera, and to see what, in fact, the section proposed, the far-reaching powers which it confers upon a body of men not subject to the scrutiny of Parliament&mdash;if the Minister did not bother to do that, why should he expect us to do it?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said we should put down amendments to this section.  We did not do so because, we object to the thing in principle and when you object to a thing in principle you do not try to amend.  We said that this was an unfair and unwarranted restriction on the liberty of the individual and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main object of this Bill is to enable effect to be given to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954.  The Bill also repeals and re-enacts in amended form the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>During recent years the pollution of the sea by oil has reached grave proportions for many countries.  We in Ireland have fortunately not been as seriously affected as some other countries but there have been numerous instances of serious pollution of our coasts and coastal waters.  The amenities at many of our seaside resorts have been affected and there has been destruction and injury of sea birds.  Oil pollution is also a potential danger to fish life and the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The principal sources of the serious oil pollution in recent years are oil tankers and oil burning ships.  Large quantities of oils are discharged into the sea by tankers when washing their tanks and disposing of oily ballast water.  Dry cargo ships which use their fuel tanks for ballast water also discharge oily ballast water into the sea.  Much of the oil which is so discharged, including crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil, persists in the sea for very long periods and can be carried for considerable distances by currents and winds.</P>

    <P>Our existing legislation, the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1926, deals with pollution of our territorial seas and harbours but up to now it has not been <Col N="422" /> possible to take effective steps to prevent the far more serious pollution which occurs on the high seas and which is carried to our shores by winds and currents.  The only hope of dealing with this problem lies in concerted international action.  The League of Nations gave some attention to the proposal before the war but no effective international agreement was reached.  The shipowners of a number of countries, including Ireland, have for many years past, however, voluntarily recognised a limit of 50 miles from any coast within which oil would not be discharged.</P>
    <P>Renewed consideration was given to the problem after the war, particularly by Britain which has suffered heavily from oil pollution.  With the approval of the United Nations the British Government convened a conference in London in April, 1954, which was attended by representatives of 42 countries, including Ireland, and which represented between them about 95 per cent. of the world's merchant shipping. The conference approved of a convention entitled The International Convention for the Prevention  Pollution of the Sea by Oil together with eight resolutions.  The convention has already been presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas and has been published by the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>One of the resolutions adopted by the conference recognised that the only entirely effective method known of preventing oil pollution is complete avoidance of the discharge of persistent oils into the sea.  The conference was unable to reach agreement on such a total prohibition, but recommended that a further conference be held to review the matter within three years and resolved that in the meantime, Governments and other bodies concerned should endeavour to create the conditions in which such a complete prohibition of discharge could be brought about.  The measures which were agreed by the conference and embodied in the convention do represent, however, a substantial advance towards eradicating oil pollution.</P>
    <P>The discharge of persistent oils into the sea by tankers and dry cargo vessels of over 500 tons within certain <Col N="423" /> prescribed zones will be prohibited under the convention.  These zones extend generally for 50 miles from any country but certain larger zones are also prescribed.  These larger zones include the areas from which persistent oils discharged from vessels are most likely to reach the shore; the Atlantic zone, with which we are principally concerned; extends about 700 miles westward from this country for tankers and 100 miles westward for dry cargo vessels.  The convention also provides for the fitting of equipment to ships for preventing the discharge of oil into the sea and for the provision in main ports of adequate reception facilities for oily residues from vessels other than tankers.  Reception facilities for oily residues from tankers would normally fall to be provided at the loading ports.  The convention lays down forms of records relating to oil operations which must be kept on board all ships covered by the convention and will be open to inspection by the competent authorities of contracting parties.</P>
    <P>The convention was signed by 20 countries, including Ireland, subject to acceptance.  The convention will not come into operation internationally until 12 months after ten countries have accepted it, of whom five must be countries with not less than 500,000 tons gross of tanker tonnage.  The enactment of this Bill will enable the Government to accept the convention on behalf of Ireland.  I understand that Britain has enacted legislation to enable effect to be given to the convention and that Canada, West Germany, Norway, Sweden, France, Denmark and the Netherlands are also taking action to implement the convention. I might also mention that Britain, France, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands have each more than 500,000 tons gross of tanker tonnage.</P>
    <P>The shipping industry in this country has always given the fullest co-operation in any steps necessary to combat oil pollution.  They have for a number of years voluntarily observed a 50-mile limit from any coast within which oil is not discharged from their ships. Subsequent to the drawing up of the <Col N="424" /> London Convention in 1954 Irish shipowners agreed to give immediate effect on a voluntary basis to its provisions providing for the prohibition of oily discharge in prohibited zones and to the keeping of records of oil operations on board ship.  All Irish deep sea vessels are already fitted with oily water separators and all but a few of our home trade vessels are fitted either with separators or with oil fuel bilges which enable them to avoid or reduce oil discharges into the sea.</P>
    <P>The convention places an obligation on each convention country to secure that adequate reception facilities will be provided at main ports.  It is, however, left to each contracting country to determine which are its main ports for this purpose.  The conference at which the convention was drawn up felt that only ports dealing with a very substantial shipping tonnage need be regarded as main ports.  It seems probable that Dublin is the only port with which we are likely to be concerned, at least for some time to come, Certain reception facilities are already provided by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  There have been discussions between the Department and the board and no difficulty is foreseen in meeting the requirements of the convention.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the port authorities are being empowered in the Bill to make reasonable charges for providing reception facilities and the service should, therefore, be largely, if not wholly, self-supporting.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that while Ireland suffers comparatively severely from oil pollution, we are ourselves not responsible for causing pollution. Furthermore, compliance with the provisions of the convention will involve no great difficulty for our shipowners. It is, therefore, clearly in our interests that this convention and any subsequent convention which may approach even nearer to the ideal of prohibiting all discharges of oil into the sea should be brought into effect at an early date with the widest possible degree of international co-operation.</P>
    <P>The convention is limited to vessels over 500 gross tons.  A resolution adopted by the London conference, <Col N="425" /> however, urged Governments to apply the provisions of the convention so far as may be reasonable and practicable, to all classes of seagoing ships registered in their territories including vessels under 500 tons.  For this reason it is considered desirable that the Bill should be applicable to vessels under 500 tons also.  Provision is made in the Bill however, for the exemption of any vessel or class of vessels from any of its provisions.  The classes of vessels which may be exempted either permanently or for the time being from any of the provisions of the Bill will be determined in consultation with the interests concerned and it may he taken that no owner, particularly of small vessels, will be asked to comply with any unreasonable requirement.</P>
    <P>The convention may not come into operation internationally for some years but it is proposed to bring a number of the provisions in the Bill into operation as soon as may be practicable.  Thus the initial zones which are provided for in the schedule to the Bill and which are those protecting the Irish coast will be brought into operation as soon as possible. Irish shipowners may not, however, be asked to observe the additional zones provided for in the schedule to the Bill until the convention comes into operation internationally or at least until the other countries affected by such zones have accepted the convention. It would not be reasonable to interfere with the freedom of action of Irish vessels in the sole interest of other parties unless they were prepared to reciprocate.</P>
    <P>Those provisions of the Bill prohibiting the discharge of oil in prohibited zones, requiring the fitting of certain equipment and prescribing the keeping of records will apply in the ordinary course only to Irish vessels.  It will be for other countries accepting the convention to apply similar provisions to their vessels.  The Bill does provide however that the Government may apply the provisions for the keeping of records and the fitting of equipment to non-Irish vessels also while they are within Irish territorial waters. These powers might be used in agreement <Col N="426" /> with the other parties to the convention after it came into operation generally so as to impose compliance with its provisions within their territorial waters on the vessels of States which had not accepted the convention. The provisions of the Bill regarding the prevention of pollution within our territorial waters apply of course to all vessels of whatever nationality.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that there are fairly wide powers in the Bill in regard to the making of rules and regulations. The Bill is primarily an enabling Bill. This is unavoidable because the requirements are mainly of a technical nature, which may require amendment from time to time in the light of experience, and it would be impracticable to deal with them in detail in the Bill.  Furthermore, it is the intention to introduce the provisions of the Bill into operation gradually and the House would not, I am sure, wish to deal with the problem in a piecemeal fashion.  Every order, rule or regulation will, however, be laid before each House and a resolution may be passed annulling it.  Shipping interests may rest assured that before any rules are made, whether they relate to requirements which go beyond the convention or not, there will be fullest consultation with them.</P>
    <P>Enactment of this Bill will enable the Government to accept the 1954 convention and, therefore, help to bring it into operation at an early date.  The Bill will place no undue burden on shipowners, harbour authorities, or the Exchequer and I have every confidence that the measure will meet with the general approval of the House.</P>

      <P>As Deputy de Valera said, this is a highly desirable Bill and I do not think anyone could quarrel with the basic idea of it.  However, there are one or two questions I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the drafting.  In Section 4, sub-section (2), a very wide <Col N="427" /> provision is given to the Minister by way of exemptions.  I am not suggesting for a moment that any Minister would be foolish enough to unllify the entire Bill by handing out exemptions right, left and centre, but am I correct in assuming that the exemptions referred to will not be laid before the Oireachtas?  They do not appear to be referred to as Orders or regulations in the Bill and will they, therefore, not be laid before the Oireachtas?  It is not clear whether they will or will not.</P>

      <P>Very good.  As I am on my feet, may I draw attention to another point?  Section 10, sub-section (1), provides specifically certain oils; then sub-section (2) brings in a different oil and the additional phrase, &ldquo;or other description of oil which may be prescribed.&rdquo;  I can quite see that, to leave the Minister room to frame subsequent amending legislation, it was probably necessary to say, &ldquo;or other description of oil which may be prescribed&rdquo;.  It is quite possible there may be future conventions or changes in the present convention.  But I cannot see the point of separating into different sections, on the one hand, crude oil, fuel oil and lubricating oil and, on the other hand, heavy diesel oil.  There may be some nice drafting point in it, but I must confess I do not see it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my concluding remarks on this Estimate yesterday I was referring to the part played by the Department of External Affairs in promoting trade and tourism for this nation.  From the Minister's speech it is evident that the Department of External Affairs, through its consulates and the diplomatic stations abroad, plays very little part in a practical manner in regard to fostering trade between Ireland and the various countries&mdash;trade that would be of an advantageous nature to Ireland.  When we examine the activities of the Department in the field of tourism, we find those activities are negligible.  I have had personal experience of discussing with high officials in the Department of External Affairs facilities for tourists coming to Ireland.  One particular individual told me that this was not the responsibility of the Department of External Affairs at all; that it was a matter for the Tourist Board.  That may be.  I suppose he is quite right in taking up that attitude, but I feel that, if we are to have expensive diplomatic stations abroad, we should utilise those stations and those offices for more than merely cultural purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that we have cultural contacts with all the <Col N="429" /> nations of the world.  Very often the cultural contacts involved are portrayed by the clinking of glasses and long sessions at diplomatic parties. That is all very well in its own way, but if the taxpayers of this country are to be asked to pay for those luxuries, then there should be some return for the money spent.  I think we should have there should be soem return for the money spent.  I think we should have an overhaul of the Department of External Affairs to see if we can combine with the cultural contacts created between ourselves and the various nations contacts for the promotion of trade and tourism.  There are too many such bodies functionting in this small country to-day, with its dwindling population and the overhead charges imposed on the community are too great for the limited return given.  If we can cut our cloth according to our measure, as far as the Department of External Affairs is concerned, we will be taking a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I know I will be told that I have no culture and so forth.  I am prepared to accept that.  I remember a statement made by a very prominent European that he was sick of hearing the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;Every time I hear it mentioned I feel like reaching for my gun.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nobody objects to art and culture but there must be a limit to the amount of money that we spend abroad on these activities, desirable and all as they may be.  Even yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce sounded a further note of alarm with regard to the condition of our trade situation and the balance of payments and suggested that, it was quite possible that a further tightening of the belt would be necessary here as far as the community is concerned.  The public will judge the sincerity of that statement by the actions taken by the Government to set the good example in the reduction of non-essential expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be the responsibility of another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is Government policy to reduce expenditure and here is one Department in <Col N="430" /> which there is no reduction of expenditure. We have reductions in Departments that are dealing with the capital development of our State and the development of our industries. Surely if the situation is so serious that we must have reductions of expenditure in matters that might create further wealth, it is only fair to suggest that there should be reduction in expenditure abroad.  Instead we have increases in several sub-heads to meet increased expenditure for social purposes abroad.</P>
      <P>I think that good example should be set in Departments like this.  This State is only a short time on its feet and the trouble we have here can be traced back to the time the Department of External Affairs was set up. The idea originally was desirable but it is regrettable that we should model it, to a great extent, on the set-up of the Foreign Office.  We have aped them and followed their example in the appointment of ambassadors, diplomats and consulates on the same lines as the British Empire.  Why should we have to keep up with this wide-flung Empire with the limited resources at our disposal?  We are a Republic with greater pretensions to grandeur than the British Empire itself.</P>
      <P>I think that a little bit of the Spartan outlook would be no harm at all when it comes to the question of alleged prestige.  We are prepared to sound off to all the nations of the world as to how they should run their own countries.  We have the audacity to criticise right left and centre and we are the most pathetic sight in the world in that we cannot look after our own house.  Before we have the temerity to criticise other nations we should put our own house in order.  If the present rate of emigration continues there will be very little room for worry on the part of future legislators as regards the part Ireland will play in world events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think our representatives abroad, our diplomats and ambassadors and the various officials attached to them, should be trained in business and in the problems that are connected with tourism.  I think they should be able-to combine two or three functions.  It is no lowering of their dignity to suggest <Col N="431" /> that our ambassadors should take all possible steps to promote business contacts between Ireland and Germany, France, Italy and elsewhere. Take the problem of tourism.  You could count on the fingers of one hand the number of tourists who come here from France, Germany, Italy or Spain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made it clear that the Department has taken steps with regard to the promotion of trade.  Trade and tourism go hand in hand and I am suggesting that the part played by the Department should be extended rather than limited.  If we have representatives in these countries they should be active all the time in getting the people in these countries to realise that Ireland is there.  We had the statement by a prominent German, some time ago, that he never heard of Killarney.  We were horrified because he had never heard of Killarney.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputies will disagree and maintain that the diplomatic service is separate and that our representatives should not include business and tourism as part of their activities. I do not see why we should accept the views of our next-door neighbours in that matter at all.  With our limited financial resources, we should get that Department to do as much as possible. I would suggest to the Minister that he should examine that aspect of the work of the Department of External Affairs and try to ensure that their functions are enlarged so that the scope of their work would include tourism and the promotion of trade. If he would do that, it would ease a lot of the overhead burdens put upon the community at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have Córas Tráchtála embarking on a widespread drive in <Col N="432" /> Europe and America and there is no end to the number of new officials that will be called on for that purpose.  I think there is no need for this expenditure on the part of a body which is not under the control of the Department of External Affairs.  That type of work could be undertaken by the people already in these countries.  I would suggest that the direction should go out from the Minister to these people that they will have to buck up and do much more than merely maintain cultural contacts with the nations to whom they are accredited as Irish representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. E. de Valera Mr. E. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that every Deputy in the House who may be inclined to criticise some of the expenditure on this Department must realise that no other Estimate presents such an easy target for uninformed or for perverse criticism as this does.  The amount of money intended to be spent is set down definitely.  It is definite and there can be no gainsaying the figures.  The national advantages to be gained from the expenditure are, on the other hand, quite indefinite. They are not tangible except for the benefits that accrue to trade.  It is one of the functions of the Department and of its representatives abroad to have an eye generally to the advantage that can be gained for the country in any respect, not merely in culture but in trade.  If tourism can be advanced it is the duty of our representatives abroad to keep an eye to that also.</P>
      <P>However, even the advantages that accrue from activities in these particular directions are not such that one can put one's finger upon them and say: &ldquo;That advantage is clearly worth the expenditure of so much money.&rdquo; I have had in the past to defend expenditure in that Department and I have found myself with the difficulty that, while the expenditure was clear and definite, the advantages were far from being so definite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, when expenditure has reached the very serious figure, between Votes 58 and 59, of practically £560,000 for the year, the time for serious consideration has arrived.  Our entry into U.N.O. has meant, this year, the provision altogether of a sum <Col N="433" /> of £116,000 odd additional to the expenditure that would have to be met if we were not members.  That is a serious addition.  I think I am right in that figure; there is £78,000 in Vote 59 and £38,500 in Vote 58, making a total of £116,600.  There may be some other items but the least sum is £116,000.  That is a serious addition to the expenditure on External Affairs.</P>
    <P>I think we ought to see whether we could not offset in some way, by economies in other directions in the Department, that increased expenditure.  I am one who approves of the action of the Government in continuing the situation which we created, when we were the Government, by applying for entry to U.N.O.  I think it was desirable in the national interest that we should be in that organisation and that, being in it, we should meet the obligations which membership entails. Therefore, I take it this expenditure has to be met.</P>
    <P>We ought to do our best to see that every penny that is spent is spent wisely but we must not lose the ship for the ½d. worth of tar in the matter. The attitude that I took in the years before the war was this: I saw the expenditure in the Department rising until we were at the £90,000 a year figure, including the expenditure our membership of the League of Nations entailed.  It looked then as if it would not be long until we had reached the £100,000 per year figure.  That was before the war.  We had not reached that figure actually by the time the war started but I did think, even then, that we should not of course have representatives in each one of 50 or 60 countries in the world community. Seeing that we could not have representatives in all these countries, we should, I think, adopt a selective principle; we should choose the countries where it was obvious to everybody we should be represented, and that we should not starve our representations there from giving us the full benefit of their activities.</P>
    <P>It was clear that such a selection should be at the highest level; that we should first of all be represented at the Vatican, that we should be represented <Col N="434" /> in the United States, that we should be represented in Britain and, perhaps, in France which is the door, by air to Europe in general.  The suggestion was that we should be represented in these places at ambassadorial level but that, in regard to representation in other countries, we should be very careful not to begin until we were quite satisfied that these were, I might say, essential.</P>
    <P>As a small country we cannot have all we desire; just as the private individual with limited means, we must allow our desires to be unsatisfied where it is not feasible to satisfy them.  I think I mentioned that we should be represented in Britain, seeing that our trade with Britain is so great.  There are, of course, other reasons for our being represented in Britain as well.  In 1947-48, the expenditure figure, I think, had reached £153,000 for the Department of External Affairs for the year.  It is now £560,000.  I believe that after the 1947-48 period there was a period of indiscriminate expansion.  Be that as it may, the time has now come to consider again what we can do.  Having established representation in countries. abroad, it is a very difficult thing to withdraw that representation.  Consequently, care should be taken before we start.  I had hoped that, now being represented at Strasbourg which, in a sense, was intended to be a sort of European capital, it would be possible for the Minister to get into conversation with some of the other small countries.  Other small countries have the same financial difficulties in these matters as we have.  I had hoped that the Minister would see whether it were not possible to make Strasbourg a general representation clearing house for Europe so that representation in some of the other smaller countries could be managed mainly through Strasbourg.  Strasbourg, after all, is in a very central situation and I think it should be possible for the small countries to come together and see if they could not reduce expenditure by working through Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>I made that suggestion last year. No proposal for limiting expenditure can be made without having certain <Col N="435" /> disadvantages associated with it, but the time has come, I think, in which we should consider very seriously this question of economising or limiting expenditure in certain directions in the Department of External Affairs so as to compensate for the increased expenditure which will arise now by reason of our membership of U.N.O.</P>
    <P>We are now members of U.N.O. and members of the Council of Europe.  I do not know whether any attempt was made to see whether some arrangement could be made with some of the smaller countries in order that expenditure might be diminished by working through Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which naturally occurs to one if one does any fundamental thinking on this matter. The whole system of representation in the capitals of various foreign countries arose at a time when communications were extremely difficult.  Now we have the radio, the telephone, the airplane and so on and the question arises whether representation in these countries is absolutely essential.  I know a case could be made for quite a number of countries in which we are not represented but, even as regards Paris, if we were driven to it and found that the amount of money we had to provide for External Affairs was too great, we might even have to think of Strasbourg as covering France.  However, I would regard that as a very extreme step because France at the present time is really the air door to Europe as far as we are concerned.  I do not know whether the Government considered the Strasbourg suggestion.  The Minister did not refer to it; he has possibly looked into the matter and found that it was not feasible from our point of view or that these other countries were not willing to co-operate and co-operation by other countries would be necessary.</P>
    <P>In regard to U.N.O. itself I thought at first that it would be possible to combine representation at U.N.O. with the ambassadorial position in Washington. I do not know if there would be any objection taken by the United States to, that.  There might be.  In <Col N="436" /> any case, having given it considerable thought, I came to the conclusion that it would not be wise to try to combine the two positions.  America is in a very special position in our regard and as long as the seat of U.N.O. is in the United States it is desirable that we should have at the seat of U.N.O. a representative who will be able to give his whole attention to it. Our ambassador in Washington, because it is the United States, where there are so many of our people with whom we have contacts of various kinds, has also a full time job.  If we were cutting down, I do not think we should cut down by trying to combine the two offices although, as I say, that is one of the thoughts that would first strike anybody who has a passing acquaintance with the problem and is looking for economies.</P>
    <P>I did come to the conclusion that when we were members of U.N.O. we ought to play our part there and take full advantage of our position and that if we want to concentrate on doing that, we would require to have a whole time representative there.  In passing, I would like to support what was said by Deputy Aiken yesterday and say that I do not think a more efficient person could have been chosen than the representative who has been chosen by the Government, a very able officer who has already experience both of the United States and the League of Nations elsewhere.  Therefore I do not think we should look for any economy by trying to combine the ambassadorship in the United States with the permanent representation at U.N.O.</P>
    <P>There is perhaps only one other suggestion I can make for cutting down expenditure.  As most Deputies in the House are aware, we in the Fianna Fáil Party were opposed to the News Agency when it was started. When we succeeded the other Government we felt, however, that since it had been started it should get a chance and that we should not be or appear to be in any way against that agency because we bad opposed its establishment.  It was started against our advice but the desire of the Minister and of our Government at the time was that it should be given every <Col N="437" /> chance to prove its usefulness.  I must say that I was always sceptical about its value.  I know an ordinary news bulletin coming from External Affairs would be useful but I was always doubtful in my own mind.  Whilst I assented to the idea of giving it an opportunity of proving itself I am not satisfied even now that that agency, now costing £35,000 a year, is in our circumstances value for the money. Perhaps the Government might hold quite a different opinion but the fact that a different opinion is held does not as far as I am concerned matter.  What I mean is that I am quite prepared to think that there would be a view taken which would be different from my own but after all, once we get over the half million figure it becomes very serious.</P>
    <P>Every Estimate has increased on account of the diminution in the purchasing value of the monetary unit but taking the average to-day the number of units required for a particular service, the purchase of a certain quantity of goods, for example, the consumer price index has not gone up since 1938 much more than two-and-a-half times.  I am quite willing to admit that in the case of External Affairs, we must consider how the monetary unit, the £ sterling, stands in relation to other currencies, particularly the dollar, because it has been devalued in relation to the dollar.  Therefore, if you were taking a proportionate increase, you would have to take more than two-and-a-half times for External Affairs.  If things were only at the same level as before the war, you would have to multiply the expenditure by about three times, let us say.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the expenditure has gone up since 1948 from £153,000 to £560,000 estimated&mdash;that is, from there 50,000s to 11 50,000s.  My argument about the two-and-a-half and the three applies rather to the 1938 figures.  The appropriate figures for 1948 and the figures just given should be one-and-one-third, not two-and-a-half.  The cost of living figure is now 134&mdash;134,43 I think&mdash;and that is slightly more than one and-the-one-third.  I would be willing even to take the factor 2, double the 1948 figure.  It was then £153,000. It was that figure of £153,000 that we <Col N="438" /> were beginning to be anxious about; the corresponding figure to-day would be, let us say, £300,000 or £350,000, but it is now £560,000.</P>
    <P>While then, as I have admitted, there is no Estimate which can lend itself so readily as a target for uninformed or perverse criticism, I think the time has come when we shall have to consider whether there are not definite economies which we can secure.  First of all, we ought to set our face against further expansion unless we can see some very definite and immediate tangible result from such expansion.  In addition, we should consider some of the suggestions which have been made, such as combining representation at Strasbourg or getting rid of the News Agency.  It is all right to have the News Agency for the purpose of compiling a departmental bulletin; that is an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of the possibility of combining representation abroad to an even greater extent than is done at present, there are, I think, possibilities there.  In relation to external trade, we want to expand our exports.  From that point of view there is no doubt but that permanent consuls would be more valuable than honorary consuls, if we could afford them.  I have always been of the opinion, however, that we have not utilised the honorary consuls to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    <P>We are thoroughly conversant with the position in so far as the U.N.O. is concerned and we are not against our entry into that organisation. Nevertheless, I think it would have been desirable that we should have had a general discussion on the obligations and the advantages inherent in our membership of that organisation.  When the Taoiseach announced that we had been accepted as members of the United Nations, he pointed out that I had indicated what the advantages and disadvantages were likely to be, what our obligations and duties would be, what we would hope to gain and the fact that I had proposed to the Dáil that we should apply for membership.  He indicated that successive Governments had not seen fit to alter that <Col N="439" /> decision.  That is true, but I am anxious that the members of the present Dáil should be fully alive to the obligations involved and that, through discussion here, the country at large would be equally alive to those obligations.</P>
    <P>Now, membership of such an organisation is a splendid thing so long as one thinks only of what one has to gain.  Difficulty arises only when one has to fulfil one's obligations.  We could easily find ourselves again in the position in which we found ourselves as a Government in relation to the League of Nations.  I am glad that the Minister has said that we accept our obligations and we intend to live up to our obligations.  There would be no sense in entering into such an international organisation unless we were prepared to do that.  It is essential, however, that the people's minds should be conditioned to a proper realisation of what these obligations involve.</P>
    <P>When we were accepted as members of U.N.O. the Taoiseach pointed out that our obligations as members would not be so onerous as might appear at first sight.  Certain interpretations had been made which rendered our obligations less onerous than they might reasonably have been expected to be at the time when we first applied for membership.  It is well that all these things should be discussed and this is the first opportunity we have had for such discussion.  Indeed, I think there might be a little more discussion on this Estimate in that direction than we have had so far.</P>
    <P>With regard to the policy of the Department, we are fortunate in the fact that there is no serious fundamental difference between the members of this House, irrespective of Party, in relation to policy generally as outlined by the Minister.  If the policy outlined is implemented, there is not much with which we can find serious fault.  The Minister is perfectly right in maintaining his independence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken seemed to think that there was a commitment in advance in certain directions and that it would <Col N="440" /> not be possible to preserve an open mind when certain decisions came to be taken.  I hope an open mind will be preserved.  The only way in which we can play our part effectively in such an international organisation is by being determined that we will deal with each question on its just merits and will not become members of this bloc or that bloc.  We must be prepared on each occasion, as each issue comes up, to vote, or decide, in accordance with our own outlook upon life, our own conscience, our own outlook upon international affairs and our own interests in so far as our interests may be directly concerned.  To do anything else would be a very, very serious mistake.</P>
    <P>We were able to play quite an effective part in the League of Nations in the past, and it must be remembered that membership of a world organisation, such as U.N.O., is much more valuable for us than membership of the more narrowly constituted Council of Europe.  We were not able to play a generally effective part in the Council of Europe.  For instance, when the question of a United States of Europe, with a federal constitution and so forth, arose, I felt we would be very unwise to enter into such a federation because our representation was so small it was inevitable that it would be practically ignored.  Indeed, some of the issues that affected us most deeply were in fact ignored at the Council of Europe.  We did not, so to speak, fit in.  Our position in the League of Nations was quite different and I am certain it will be quite different, too, in U.N.O.  In U.N.O. there will be a large number of small States, and States that are not so small, too, which will be inclined to work in a direction which we would regard as wise both from a national and an international point of view.  I believe that, given a choice of membership of the Council of Europe or membership of U.N.O., we can although Europeans play a vastly more important part in U.N.O., than we could in the Council of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress, I was dealing with the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister in charge of this Bill.  As he has already manifested in the majority of the speeches which he has delivered in this Bill, he is not concerned to consider any criticism of the Bill or any suggestions for its amendment.  He asks us to be grateful for the fact that he did not push the Bill through the House under a timetable.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate yesterday, the Minister spoke about &ldquo;the prostitution of the parliamentary procedure&rdquo;&mdash;not a very elegant phrase.  It is not a phrase of my conception.  It is the one which the Minister has chosen to apply to the discussions in this House.  I can conceive nothing more calculated to deprive Parliament of all authority and respect than the attitude which the Minister has taken up in the course of the debate on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  This morning, we had from Deputy de Valera a cogent, searching and critical analysis of the section we are now considering.  It was a speech which any responsible Minister would have been concerned to have taken point by point and to have answered.  Yet we had no such answer from the Minister&mdash;no attempt to show that the defects which Deputy de Valera pointed out existed in this section were not so grave as he had demonstrated.  Instead, we had an attack upon myself.  I do not know what I have got to do with this Bill&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that I had opened the debate on this section in a completely non-controversial way. I was alarmed, and I am very deeply concerned, about the precedent which this section proposes to establish.  I said that I cannot recall any provision of any other Act on our Statute Book which gives to a board, which has no responsibility to Parliament or no responsibility even to the Minister, the power to create a monopoly which this section gives to the Greyhound Industry Board.</P>
      <P>I do not think that members of this House who are supporting the Government have read paragraph (a).  This paragraph prohibits persons from holding public sales of greyhounds except under and in accordance with licences granted by the board at its discretion. A power is entrusted to a body of men, mark you, who are not elected, not responsible to any member of this House and not responsible even to the Minister&mdash;a power which they can exercise arbitrarily without any restriction and, in so far as that power may afflict individuals, without any power of redress for the person so afflicted.  I think there is nothing in our legislation to parallel that.  Paragraph (h) of sub-section (2) prohibits persons from acting as auctioneers at sales, save under and in accordance with permits granted by the board at its discretion. Again, the same arbitrary power, preventing men from earning a livelihood in a perfectly normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I opened the debate on this section, I had not had the advantage of hearing the Minister adduce reasons why these extraordinary powers should be given to any board and why these extraordinary disabilities should be imposed upon our people.  He moved the section without justifying any single one of its provisions.  I did say, and I think those who heard me will admit, that, in a perfectly reasonable way, I did point out that I thought this section was going too far.  It has been readily admitted that abuses have occurred in relation to the sales of greyhounds which should be, if possible, rectified.  There may be a right way and a wrong way of attaining <Col N="450" /> a very desirable objective.  Our quarrel with this section is that, while the object is in itself desirable, the means whereby it is sought to attain it are in themselves so objectionable that it could readily be said that the remedy is worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>I would think that, from the point of view of the ordinary people of this country, who, I believe, are entitled to avail themselves of any opportunities that are offered to them to earn their own living, this section, which deprives them of that right, is a mistake and is misconceived.  Nobody can say that that is an unreasonable attitude to take up.  Nobody can say that it is an attitude taken up by me, or by any other member of this House, on partisan grounds.</P>
    <P>Having said that to the Minister, I then suggested to him that there was an alternative way of dealing with this situation; that instead of conferring on, or endowing this board with very far-reaching powers of monopoly and control, a better way would be to provide that the board should set up a register of recognised auctioneers who would hold public sales of greyhounds with the endorsement and imprimatur of the board, but that anybody else, even if he was not on the register, could himself hold sales of greyhounds and act as an auctioneer.  I think that is a reasonable approach to the matter. It is an attempt to deal with the abuses which have developed over the years, but it is a way of dealing with them which leaves an individual free to enter into a business if he wishes to do so and it leaves the public free to deal with such an individual if they have sufficient trust and confidence in him.</P>
    <P>Mind you, we have registers in other professions and occupations, in which the names of individuals are inscribed as an indication that the public may, with confidence, employ them in relation to certain services.  The suggestion which I made was not in any way novel or untried and it would be much more acceptable to the House and to the general body of opinion than the proposal in Section 28.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any great difficulty in giving effect to it.  I am perfectly certain that, after a certain period of <Col N="451" /> time, if the register was established, and if the endorsement of the board was manifested by the inscription of the names of the individuals or firms upon this register, those who were on the register would enjoy the bulk of the business but it would be freely given to them.  The public would go to them of their own free will.  They would not be compelled to go to them because there was not anybody else to whom they could turn.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there might be people whom, at the outset, the board would be reluctant to allow on the register but as time developed, and the business of these men developed, and their reputations grew higher, and their financial status was more assured, the board could quite readily endorse them also.  The sum and substance of it is that you would not permit the board to close the door to people who are anxious to set up as persons who were prepared to hold greyhound sales.</P>
    <P>That is not an untried procedure. There is a certain similarity between the case I am about to quote although it is not quite on all fours with the business with which Section 38 proposes to deal.  I remember when the dental register was set up under the authority of the Oireachtas. People will remember that there was a time when any person could hold himself out to practise as a dental surgeon. There was a provision made then whereby people who were not qualified to go on the register in the first instance, after they had demonstrated that they were in practice for a sufficient number of years, were allowed to go on the register.  That case is not on all fours with this one, but there is a certain analogy.  It shows that it would not be beyond the compass of the board's powers to establish and maintain a register of that sort.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair to the Minister.  I was going to say that I was sorry to see that that suggestion had been turned down by him.  I think he did, in fact, reject it.  He did not indicate that he was prepared to reconsider paragraphs (a) and (h). Instead, he went on to say he assumed <Col N="452" /> that persons who were in business as registered or licensed auctioneers would be granted licences to hold public sales of greyhounds.  But that is not in the legislation.  There is nothing in this section requiring the board to grant licences to recognised licensed auctioneers, to people who operate under the Auctioneers Act.  On the contrary, the whole matter is left to the very wide discretion of the board.  So much for paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>Then we come to paragraph (h). From the point of view of the ordinary individual who will, perhaps, never be able to establish an auctioneering business of his own, paragraph (h) is much more serious because it prohibits a person from even standing up and conducting the ordinary procedure at an auction unless he has a permit from the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody can conduct it now, as far as I know.  But there are certain practical circumstances, certain circumstances of location which have created a sort of monopoly in regard to the conduct of greyhound sales. I think that monopoly should be broken.  I thought it was one of the purposes of this Bill to break these monopolies.  My quarrel with Section 38 is that it confers a monopoly and that also it gives the board the power to create further monopolies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy O'Leary interrupted me, I was saying I thought that paragraph (h) was, from the point of view of the ordinary common individual who would never be in business for himself, a highly objectionable proposal. How would any member of this House like to feel himself in the position in which he could not begin the occupation of a salesman unless he had a permit or licence from some body? We used to hear a lot about totalitarianism, but this is carrying it far beyond the limit.  There are persons who object to the fact that it is very difficult to secure employment unless you happen to be a member of a trade union; the very people who recognise that situation in relation to employment are proposing to give effect to that principle in quite another sphere. <Col N="453" /> I think we are really losing sight of the interests of individuals in this matter.  There are things which we should do, things which it is desirable to do in order to attain public good, but there are also things which we should not do.</P>

      <P>That is what is behind our attitude here.  Deputy de Valera went through each one of the provisions of this section in his speech.  I saw Deputy Finlay sitting in the House, apparently taking notes.  I was looking forward to hearing from him from the opposite side, but we have not had the advantage of Deputy Finlay's erudition, his legal training and experience in the debate.  Instead, we had a speech from Deputy Morrissey which was far off the track.  Really, it was a series of gibes and sneers at the fact that Deputy de Valera had devoted a large portion of his time to this and that, with great clarity, he had put the situation before the House. I think that was an unworthy way to deal with Deputy de Valera's contribution and I just want to put it on record.  It is perhaps not very relevant to what I am saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a deliberative assembly.  We are quite entitled to try to put before the House the imperfections of the Minister's proposal.  It was stated this morning that we had not put down any amendments to this section.  That is true.  There are a couple of reasons for that.  We have, however, many amendments on the Order Paper.  We formed the impression at an early stage that the Minister was not prepared to consider in an objective way such amendments as we might suggest to him.  We were, perhaps, a little bit too hasty in coming to that decision.  In any event, this is not a section which could be readily amended without changing the whole principle upon which it is based.  We would have had to find some way of substituting paragraphs (a) and (h). We may possibly have an opportunity of putting before the House our proposals for replacing these objectionable paragraphs by others, but that is a matter which is still in the lap of the gods.  We would much rather, and I think it would be preferable from every point of view, if the Minister, having heard what was said here in the debate on the provisions of this section, would indicate that he would be prepared to meet us, particularly in regard to paragraphs (a) and (h).</P>
      <P>There are a couple of other points with which I would like to deal before I sit down and await the reply of the Minister.  I trust the Minister will have reconsidered the attitude which he expressed here before lunch.  I, no less than he, I suppose, was a little bit on edge when it was coming close to 2 o'clock.  I would hope that, having had a brief respite, the Minister might be prepared to discuss this across the floor of the House as if we were sitting around a board table and try to find a way out of the impasse which is holding up this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of other paragraphs <Col N="455" /> in this sub-section (2) to which I think some attention should be devoted.  Paragraph (e) provides for the keeping of records by licenses and the production of such records for inspection and taking of copies or extracts by authorised officers of the board.  I do not know precisely what purpose that paragraph is designed to serve.  The Minister must have had something in his mind when he allowed it to creep into the section.  It may, perhaps, have been suggested to him that the board might grant licences to untrustworthy persons, persons who would not fulfil the conditions attached to the licence.  It may be that he had some other purpose in mind but we did not hear from the Minister what, in fact, was the objective which he sought to secure by paragraph (e). That again is a reflection of the Minister's manner in dealing with the Opposition in regard to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is usual, when so comprehensive a section as this, which is not a mere machinery section, is being recommended to the House by the Minister in charge of the Bill, for the Minister to explain the purpose for which its several provisions have been inserted in the section.  We had not the benefit of any such explanation from the Minister this morning.  I do not know whether we shall have that explanation from him before the debate on this section concludes, but again, I think, as I thought in relation to paragraphs (a) and (h), that the section is dangerous as a precedent.</P>
    <P>Auctioneering is a normal commercial occupation, an ordinary business; yet here we are giving to some controlling body the right to walk in and inspect the books of a person or a firm which is carrying on this business.  That is a very dangerous precedent to establish and surely before the House gives its assent to a proposal of that kind the need for it should be fully demonstrated by the Minister who is recommending it to the House.  As I said, auctioneering is a plain, ordinary business, just as ordinary and as commonplace as, say, the grocery business, the tailoring business or the haberdashery business.  Concede this power to the board and it may not be very <Col N="456" /> long before some person will be appealing to the Greyhound Industry Bill as the Minister has appealed to the Racing Board and Racecourses Act of 1945 to justify certain provisions in this measure.  It may not be very long before someone is appealing to what has been done in the Greyhound Industry Bill as a justification for applying the powers which are contained in paragraph (e) to some other occupation or business.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph to which I wish to refer is paragraph (m).  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, it looks very innocuous on the face of it.  It provides for the making of regulations by the board in regard to the recording and publication of information relating to the results of sales.  That is a very wide power indeed.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, it would probably be construed by the court to exclude anything which did not come within the general ambit of the provisions of Section 38.  Nevertheless, even if it has that restrictive force, even if it could be said to deal only with matters which would be the proper concern of the board, I would pose this question: if a newspaper publishes the information that certain named greyhounds were sold at an auction, might the newspaper be held to have contravened some regulation made by the board under paragraph (m)? That might not be impossible.  As Deputy de Valera said, the publication of information relating to sales must be made in conformity with the regulations made by the board.  A newspaper might, however, publish a perfectly genuine article containing information relating to sales not in conformity with the regulations made.</P>
    <P>Now these are the objections we see to the section as it stands.  This section is, in its purpose, quite novel and, I think, unprecedented.  It is unprecedented in so far as any Act of this Oireachtas is concerned because this general power, this almost comprehensive power, which is to be conferred on the board to make regulations, is without any safeguard whatsoever for the public.  The board is being set up as a completely independent authority with power to limit the right of people <Col N="457" /> to carry on a business, with power to limit the right of people to enter into employment.  We have not even the safeguard that the regulations which the board may make will require the consent of the Minister before they become effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the Racing Board.  There are two sections here giving power to make regulations. One of them affects what one might describe as the general body of the public in so far as the public are represented by the bookmakers.  The regulations which the board may make in respect of the payment of levies on course bets are subject to the consent of the Minister.  There is another regulation which says that the board, after consultation with the governing bodies, may by regulations provide for regulating the manner in which authorised racecourses are to be managed and controlled by the executives thereof. Under sub-section (2), the board may by regulations provide for requiring executives of various racecourses to keep such books, accounts and records as may be prescribed; it may provide for requiring the executives of authorised racecourses to furnish to the board such returns and information as may be prescribed, for the production of books, accounts and records by executives of authorised racecourses and for the inspection and taking of extracts from books, accounts and records of authorised racecourses.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that in that section the consent of the Minister is not required.  But the circumstances and conditions are very different.  These are authorised racecourses, long-established concerns, and the board has power to make these regulations because the board does, in fact, contribute very substantially to the finances of the authorised racecourses. We all know how these racecourses have been improved since the Racing Board was established.  We all know that hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent on them and, because the board is providing these moneys, the board is quite properly entitled to supervise the expenditure of those moneys and to ensure that the racecourses <Col N="458" /> are being properly managed and run.</P>
    <P>That is a very different thing from trying to limit and restrict the practice of what is recognised as an ordinary commercial occupation into which people may enter so long as they are of good character and can put up a sufficient bond.  It is because the provisions of this section restrict, in the way I have described, the right of people to earn their livelihood and to enter into business that I say the least the Minister should do&mdash;the least the Minister is in duty bound to do&mdash; is to ensure that, before these regulations are made and come into operation, he will consent to them.  I know the Minister may say, as he has already said, that he does not want to interfere in the day-to-day conduct of the business of the board.  But he is not being asked to do that.  He is being asked, presumably on one occasion, and one occasion only, to say that the regulations which the board proposes to make in relation to all these matters are reasonable, so reasonable that he can become a consenting party to them.  When he has given his consent in that regard and the regulations are published, and I hope laid before this House, then his activities, so far as Section 38 are concerned, will be at an end.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate, we are not want only opposing this section.  We are opposing it because we are firmly convinced that paragraphs (a) and (b) are not in the public interest.  We admit and agree that there are abuses to be rectified.  We think they can be rectified by adopting other machinery, the machinery I have already described to the House.</P>
    <P>Finally, we think these regulations should require the consent of the Minister before they become operative. There is nothing unreasonable in that. These are perfectly rational suggestions and I hope that even now, at this stage, the Minister will consider them objectively and let us, if we can, proceed with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the House that this section is drafted very largely on the recommendations contained in the report of the advisory <Col N="459" /> committee.  In the initial stages of the discussion on this section I directed the attention of Deputies to this specific paragraph.  I did not read it <i>in extenso</i> as it was manifest that Opposition Deputies had made themselves fully familiar with the contents of that report.  The only fault Deputies could find is that I have not gone quite as far as the report recommended.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that I remain convinced that the attitude of the Opposition in regard to this section is an attitude founded on a resolute desire to obstruct and delay the legitimate procedure of this House.  I do not want to have any ambiguity or doubt about it.  I am sorry to say this of Deputy de Valera who usually, even if I do not agree with him, makes useful contributions to the House: I believe he came in here this morning to help to obstruct.  I believe, when he spoke for an hour and a half on a section of this kind, he did it with the intention of obstructing and I think it reflects no credit on him.</P>
      <P>But lest confusion might be created in the minds of Deputies I want to recall the House to reality.  This section deals with persons who desire to hold public auctions of greyhounds.  It does not restrict the right of any person who owns a greyhound to sell it by private treaty or restrict the right of anyone who wants to buy a greyhound to buy a greyhound by private treaty.  But it does operate to confer on the board power to prevent a man holding a fraudulent auction and issuing a fraudulent certificate with a dog, which can be taken out of this country with that dog, and be used for the purpose of selling the dog fraudulently to a foreign buyer to the great detriment of all those greyhound breeders in the country who breed and race their dogs honestly and who wish to sell their patrons nothing but an honest dog with an honest record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person in this country who wishes to enter into the auctioneering business at the present time is obliged to become a registered auctioneer under the Auctioneers Act.  It does not matter whether he desires to auction <Col N="460" /> furniture, or land or property of any kind.  He must submit himself to the regulations of the Auctioneers' Association. That association has statutory power to make conditions for the protection of the auctioneers' clients.  Here we are concerned with something much greater than that; we are concerned to protect a great industry which can be gravely prejudiced by malfeasance on the part of auctioneers.  The report points out at paragraph 180:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are satisfied that cases have frequently occurred where a buyer&mdash; whether an agent or otherwise&mdash;was enabled to give deliberately false prices to the Press, with the object either of later reselling the dog at a price based on the fictitiously high cost of purchase, or, if acting as an agent, of persuading his principal that he had paid that fictitious amount.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is for the purpose of preventing practices of that character, to the great detriment of the whole industry, at auctions of greyhounds that this section is drafted.  It applies to nobody but to individuals who wish to set themselves up as professional auctioneers of racing dogs.  We know from past experience that that practice is susceptible to fraudulent practice.  I am concerned in this legislation for the protection of the breeders of dogs here and the industry as a whole, and I am concerned to confer on the board itself, representative of all participants in the industry, powers to protect itself against fraud.  That is all.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly manifest from the point of view of the industry as a whole that the more people who are prepared to auction dogs and provide an arena where dogs can be legitimately auctioned the better it is for the industry.  It is fantastic to say that a board truly representative of the industry would seek to contract the venues where dogs might be legitimately auctioned.  Of course if we proceed on the basis that the new board is to be corrupt and rotten and inefficient then we ought to confer no power on it.  I am proceeding on the assumption that the board will be truly representative of the industry which in the main consists of honest men and <Col N="461" /> from which we can easily find honest men to constitute the board so that the dishonest minority may be brought under control.</P>
    <P>Here is a section with three subsections and approximately 20 paragraphs involved.  The Opposition says something of this kind is necessary.  They have had this section in their hands for some time; they have purported to find great danger in certain paragraphs, but not one among them took the trouble to put down an amendment, even with the intention of withdrawing it after attention had been focussed upon it.  It is common practice, even though you do not intend to press an amendment to a division, that if you want to focus attention on a particular point in a section, you put down an amendment so that you may debate that section in isolation and then abandon your amendment if you do not wish to pursue it.  Not one single amendment was put in by any member of the Opposition on this; not one point was raised nor a breath of notice given to me that there was any serious problem involved by any Deputy in Opposition in respect to any part of this section.  If I had received no amendments, if no amendments had been submitted, I might have said to myself: &ldquo;Apparently they do not wish to attempt to improve this Bill and therefore I must be prepared to meet all round opposition.&rdquo;  But that is not the case: amendments were submitted by Deputy MacEntee, by Deputy Walsh and by Deputy O'Malley, all of which were most carefully studied to see how far they could be met.  None was put down here.</P>
    <P>What revolts me&mdash;I am not surprised at anything Deputy MacEntee does&mdash; is that Deputy de Valera should come in to be made an instrument, and to engage in jeering and winking with Deputy MacEntee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That confirms the suspicion I entertained.  I agree that that kind of conduct can proceed in a free Parliament such as ours but I want to remind Deputy de Valera and Deputy MacEntee that this Bill was introduced for the benefit of the greyhound industry.  I believe all honest sections of that industry want to see that Bill enacted.  If its enactment is postponed it is by the deliberate obstruction of the Fianna Fáil Party which itself during two years failed to produce any Bill, and which meets this Bill, founded on recommendations of the advisory committee, with every device of parliamentary obstruction that they can employ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it will be to the great detriment of the industry if this board is not set up and given the power necessary to do the work that is required to be done if the industry is to be put on a satisfactory basis.  I think it wholly deplorable that the Opposition should seek to delay that.  Every week's delay, I think, is a detriment to the industry as a whole.  I think it is deplorable for an Opposition to declare that the provisions of Section 38 are necessary in some form and, in the next breath, to admit that they had this section before them for four months and, although they offered amendments to many sections of the Bill, they offered no amendment to this section.  Yet to-day one Deputy can speak for an hour and a half and another Deputy can speak for over an hour, expressing reservations which they now profess to feel but which, on their own admission, they did not think <Col N="463" /> worth while to indicate to me by way of amendment during the four months they had an opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <P>I am patient with Deputy MacEntee, particularly when he manifests the exterior of unctuous hypocrisy.  Deputy MacEntee will be grateful for any assistance he can get to facilitate him in his purpose of obstruction.  I do not propose to facilitate him because I know him too long, but I propose to discharge my duty to this House.  The justification for this section is that the provisions contained in it are necessary, if the board, representative of the industry as a whole, is to have the power to protect that industry against the small minority of persons referred to in page 78 of the report who, to our knowledge in the past, have been using auction proceedings to the grave detriment of the greyhound industry as a whole.  In so far as the Fianna Fáil Party embattle themselves in defence of that dishonest minority, they do an ill service to this industry which we seek to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture seems very aggrieved to-day.  He is bad enough normally, but this evening his biggest grievance seems to be that Deputy de Valera, with his legal training and knowledge, gave this section a thorough analysis and exposed all the tyrannies that may flow from putting that section in the Bill.  The Minister is trying to use the report of the advisory committee to justify the putting of that section into the Bill.  I have read the report of the advisory committee very closely and certainly the Minister cannot claim the report justifies the insertion of that section in the Bill.  In a great number of the paragraphs in the report the advisory committee praised the auctioneers for the manner in which they conduct the sale of greyhounds.  They said that the National Greyhound Racing Company, Limited, decided to conduct sales on their premises at Shelbourne Park and to employ an auctioneer on a salary basis.  Shelbourne Park, when <Col N="464" /> they employed an auctioneer, employed a person of competence and of standing, who carried out the auctions there in an honest manner.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this section are very extraordinary, and it is extraordinary that a democratic institution such as Dáil Éireann should seek to embody such provisions in any legislation. I can well imagine what would happen if the Minister for Agriculture were sitting on this side of the House and if Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Walsh introduced such provisions in any Bill.  These provisions set out that any auctioneer, who must be licensed by the courts of this country, who must keep on deposit annually a sum of £2,000 with the High Court and who must have it from the superintendent of the Guards that he has found nothing objectionable against him and that he recommends him to the district justice for a licence, can sell any property in this country, be it movable or immovable, with the exception of greyhounds.  That is what this section amounts to.  He must ask for special consent from the Revenue Commissioners to sell plate, but that is the only stipulation.</P>
      <P>I am wondering is this the reason why greyhounds have assumed such importance in the mind of the Minister? Before the era of Christianity in this country there was a famous warrior here who had a famous dog. We are told that Fionn MacCumhail had a famous dog called Bran, and that he was a very swift animal.  But swift and all as he was, Fionn MacCumhail, that great warrior of old, was able to beat Bran in a race.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The oldest records in this country mention Bran as a famous hound.  Sometime about the same era, there was a human being with the name of a hound, Cuchulainn, who was <Col N="465" /> also a famous warrior.  Was it for that reason that there had to be special legislation in order to sell these long-tailed animals&mdash;that they cannot be sold otherwise except under the special penal legislation which the Minister proposes to embody in this Bill, if the House will allow him?  Auctioneers are entitled to sell horses, that most important product of our country which brings in millions of pounds at public sales in this country.  There is no special legislation and there are no special laws in this country to prevent any licensed auctioneer from selling horses, cattle, sheep, pigs or any other animal.  But now it is proposed to have special legislation for the sale of greyhounds.</P>
      <P>There is only one place in this country where there are sales of greyhounds at the present time.  That is Shelbourne Park.  As far as the records of the advisory committee go, there is a statement that about one dog in every ten exported was sold by auction in 1950.  I cannot see why there is all the bother about the necessity for this legislation which holds up the majority of auctioneers in this country as a set of crooks and which says that they must be licensed and restricted by this board of control for the greyhound industry.  They must have a special licence and, not only that, but they must also have a special permit before they can sell one of those long-tailed animals.</P>
      <P>The average price of the dogs sold in 1950 reached the princely sum of £50 and things have not improved in the course of the last few years.  The Minister is a bit too late with this Bill.  He should have had it in operation in 1946 and 1947 when there was a big price for greyhounds and when many of them were exported.  There were 2,000 of them sold in 1946 and they brought in £147,000, an average of £72 each. There were only 1,000 of them sold in 1950 at an average of £36 each.  What is the reason for all the penal proposals in this section?  I cannot see any reason for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could withdraw this section from the Bill and, if it was passed without it, it would be far more effective.  The board has no power <Col N="466" /> under the Bill to compel anybody who owns a greyhound to bring it into auctioneers' sales.  These people still have the power to sell privately and I do not think the Minister proposes to interfere with that.  We have the statement from the advisory committee that only one in ten of the dogs exported were sold at auction sales.</P>
    <P>What are the conditions for the making of charges for the grant, retention and renewal of licences? Will the Minister tell us if these licences granted by the board will be sufficient to enable auctioneers to sell greyhounds or will they also require a licence from the Revenue Commissioners? Under the section the Minister is giving power to a body over which he will have no control once it is appointed.  He is giving them powers much more far-reaching than the powers of any Government Department. I do not think that any Department of State, except during the emergency had the far-reaching powers which are being given to this Board to deal with bookmakers and auctioneers. Bookmakers and auctioneers seem to me to be the greatest enemies of the greyhound industry according to this Bill.  If a bookmaker infringes any part of the Bill he can be fined £100. The Minister reduced that to £50 yesterday.</P>
    <P>If an auctioneer does anything wrong he can be fined £50.  He can be fined £50 for failing to furnish documents or for failure in recording and publishing information relating to the results of sales.  He can be fined £50 and have his licence suspended by this board if he makes a mistake in a catalogue of sales or makes a mistake in the breeding.  He can be fined £50 if he does not furnish the proper information or keep the proper records or do any other of all these nonsensical things.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee in its report said: &ldquo;We would, however, in addition, draw attention to the practice of a leading British firm of auctioneers in this respect whereby a guarantee accompanies every dog sold off their benches.&rdquo;  They did not need any of the penal provisions of this section to ensure that a guarantee would be given with every dog sold off <Col N="467" /> the benches.  I doubt very much if any auctioneer in this country would give a guarantee with a dog.  If the board would give a guarantee it would be all right but I do not think auctioneers would give a guarantee otherwise.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 181 of the advisory committee's report goes on to say that they are satisfied that, on the whole, the various auctioneers had endeavoured to perform their duties efficiently and honestly.  They add that the abuses were not confined to public auction sales since a small minority of private sellers did indulge in these malpractices.  It is apparent that a man can sell a dog, which is a biter, to a foreign buyer and he is not being got after under this Bill at all. If the Minister wants to get this Bill through he should give an undertaking that he will bring in an amendment to this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister asks why the Opposition have not put down amendments. The Opposition thought that this section was so bad that it was incapable of amendment and the only decision they could come to was to oppose it and to try and get it out of the Bill altogether. We believe that this Bill would be improved if we could get this section taken out of it, if the Minister would have the Bill re-drafted and take out all the penal provisions which it at present contains in regard to bookmakers and auctioneers.  There is no penal provision in the Bill with regard to breeders.  The great enemies of this industry according to this Bill are the bookmakers and the auctioneers. There are more serious and more stringent regulations made to govern their conduct in the future than to govern the conduct of any other section of the community.  There is no other section of the community of which I know who are trying to eke out their livelihood under such restrictions and fear of the law.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see sense. He has been accusing this Party of obstruction.  We have no desire whatsoever to obstruct this Bill.  We agree with the Minister that some reasonable control is necessary by legislation, and if this legislation had been approached by the Minister in a reasonable way <Col N="468" /> we would have accepted it.  The whole background of this Bill is to be found in the report of the advisory committee. Extraordinary things have happened since this report was published, since this legislation was introduced. Many greyhound owners throughout the country have got extraordinary views.  A document was published recently and considered by a committee of this House.  I found myself, during the past month, in a hot corner because of the same document.  I hear very sensible people accusing the Minister of being responsible, and I had stoutly to defend the Minister.</P>

It is quite obvious to me and to everybody that the Minister handed this report to somebody to have a Bill made out of it.  It is not a democratic measure; some of the sections should not appear in a democratic measure.  Similar provisions were not inserted when the horse-racing industry was being regulated by legislation.  Anybody may sell horses or cattle, pedigree stock worth millions, if they are employed by the owners and if they are qualified. Under this Bill, however, the most reputable auctioneer may not sell greyhounds unless he is specially permitted by the board to do so.  I do not see why Dáil Éireann should pass such legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed his belief to-day about the purpose of my intervention.  I cannot help the Minister for his belief nor do I care very much for it.  I have intervened in this debate from the point of view that has worried a number of Deputies for a long time&mdash;an effort to prevent unnecessary restrictive legislation. I think there is something to be said for the charge that this section is drafted in the easy way.  This board, by this section, is being put in the position of a direct deputy of this House for the purpose of making delegated legislation.  I do not think we should delegate such wide powers to a board whose main function, when all is said and done, is to control the breeding, the traffic and activities of greyhounds.  Is that sufficient justification for handing over all the powers &mdash;I will not go back on details again&mdash; to which I drew attention this morning? Whatever the Minister's belief as to my intentions may be, these are the facts.  I think I was not beyond my rights, nor was I going beyond the legitimate and proper confines of the <Col N="470" /> debate, when I sought to reinforce my own arguments regarding the objectionable character of the Minister's summary provisions in this measure. Surely, if I seek to convince the Minister, it is by way of endeavouring to avoid what has been done on previous occasions on analogous provisions.</P>
      <P>We have dealt pretty fully with that aspect.  The Minister, in his last statement, said that the sole purpose of this section was to prevent fraudulent sales by certain unspecified individuals who are apparently prone to that type of practice.  If it is a question of preventing fraudulent sales, why is it necessary to go to the extent of setting up all the machinery we have here?  This greyhound board is to be vested with autocratic and far-reaching powers, powers that go, not only as far as direction and permission in respect to things immediately related to the subject are concerned but even to go to the extent of censorship.</P>
      <P>I think I made that distinction this morning and the record will show that I thoroughly understand the reasons for this.  What I fail to understand completely is the need for taking this easy way out of it.  It is like saying to a policeman: &ldquo;Keep law and order. If you have to shoot and kill everyone in the street in the course of doing it, if that is the easiest way, go and do it,&rdquo; or if there is somebody in a block of houses who has stolen bananas, to say: &ldquo;Lock up everybody in that block of houses.&rdquo;  It is nearly as bad as that.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the Minister's use of the word &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo;.  If it is simply a question of fraud why is the machinery not directed towards the ordinary courts?  Why is it not brought under the ordinary criminal law which in the long run would be the most direct and the most satisfactory way of dealing with the matter?  I personally think that a wider issue is involved and I do not wish to pursue that point beyond saying that the Minister's suggestion that this provision is merely designed to prevent that type of fraudulent sale is an insufficient and inadequate description of the purposes of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made great play with <Col N="471" /> the suggestion that no amendment was put down in this connection.  This is hardly relevant to the section but the Minister has raised the point himself. The primary purpose of an amendment, as I understand it, is to put down a positive view in order to have something included; a more secondary purpose of an amendment is the negative aspect of deleting or removing something. It is no function, or necessary function certainly, of any private Deputy or even of the Opposition to do the Government's work for them.  It is perfectly proper and legitimate in Committee for any Deputy to criticise the provisions in a Bill section by section. In fact that is his duty.  I have always had a particular interest in this question of statutory rules and orders, irrespective of what Government has been in power.  I think it is too easy to err on the side of making regulations.</P>
    <P>In the long run it is better, in the interests of the community, to run the risk of subsequent embarrassment or even defeat on an individual issue than to impose a general tyranny for fear that the Government might be bested or that the executive might be bested in a small particular by an individual. Only too often, whether consciously or unconsciously, that fear can be operated and I am afraid that that fear has to a large extent inspired that section, and that is the purpose of my intervention.</P>
    <P>I still think the section is dangerous and when I tried to point that out to the Minister this morning for my pains I was told that I was obstructing.  I tried to go a little bit further than the mere general criticism on principle and to indicate the specific points involved. It is not my function, nor do I think it is within the resources of a Deputy, to provide the perfect draft.  The Minister knows very well that under modern conditions it requires the advice not only of the Minister's Department but of the Attorney-General's Department as well to frame legislation in accordance with the intention behind legislation. Therefore, I would not make any attempt at supplying the deficiency that has to be supplied here.  Although <Col N="472" /> I would probably not be able to give a provision the form or shape that would be most desirable, sub-section (m) which is far too wide, could very easily lead to a position where this board could grant the right of publication to some privileged monopoly just as in the other section the same thing might in principle be done for a privileged auctioneer.</P>
    <P>These are things to be guarded against.  These are very solid, reputable and proper grounds for objection in this House.  Therefore, when the Minister says that it ill becomes a Deputy to comment on this matter and charges him with obstruction, might I not equally retort that the time occupied by the Minister in dealing with such matters instead of dealing with the subject matter of the section could be commented on in the same way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to find Deputy O'Higgins in line with the Minister and the other lawyer Deputies of Fine Gael who were so vehement in their attacks on provisions of this sort in the past.  With the principles behind some of their attacks I went further than merely silently assenting; I think I even vocally supported their point of view.  It is rather surprising to find them now on the side of tyranny, regulations, inspectors, and all the rest of it.  Deputy O'Higgins should not have intervened. He only gave me the opportunity of stating all these truths over again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth and nothing but the truth.  These are my fundamental objections to the section. I submit as forcibly as I can and also most sincerely to the Minister that that section is fundamentally bad.  If it related to so serious a matter as would <Col N="473" /> affect the community as a whole, the inroads made on principle there would not be allowed and certainly would not be allowed without the most serious argument and discussion.  To create precedents here merely in connection with a board for the regulation of the sale of greyhounds and to set up precedents for censorship, and so on, is bad and dangerous and it is for these reasons I plead with the Minister to do something with that section.</P>
      <P>The section could do with recasting and only the Minister can do that.  He should at least put in some saving clause on the lines I indicated this morning.  If that is done, I, for one, will be satisfied.  My interest in this, as I confessed earlier to-day, is not due to any knowledge I have of the industry or any connection with it.  I am interested in the general principles involved. I do not care where an inroad is made; an inroad is something that must be watched and we must at all times jealously guard against such inroads being made.  When one finds them being made in a Bill of this nature, then it is high time to draw attention to them.</P>

      <P>When I raised objection to this section this morning I had no idea it would still be under discussion at ten minutes to five this evening.  I thought then that the Minister would see reason and that he would be prepared to accept reasonable arguments. I thought then that he would take the only way out, namely, delete the section because of the dangers inherent in its implementation as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that there is a grave danger that the public will not get the services to which they are entitled if we retain this section in this Bill.  Possibly my doubts are built on a different foundation from that on which the doubts of many other speakers rest; my doubts are built on the element of control and on the composition of the board which will control the sale of greyhounds.  We shall have in the future the same control which has operated for the past 30 years.  There is no change as far as personnel is concerned.  There may be a change in numbers, but there is no change in personnel because the people <Col N="474" /> who now control the industry, with all that that control implies, are the people who were responsible in the past 30 years&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to stress.  In the report of the body set up by the Minister&mdash;remember, it was the present Minister who set up that body, not a Fianna Fáil Minister&mdash;the sales of greyhounds were commented on and we were told of the corrupt practices and the malpractices which took place.  We were told of the sale of fighting greyhounds, of dogs without certificates or dogs that had not been registered, and so on and so forth.  All these things happened under the jurisdiction of the self-same people the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club will appoint&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is there, and the Minister cannot get away from it.</P>

      <P>For the next 18 months members drawn from the present standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club will be the people who will issue permits to racetracks, coursing clubs and auctioneers.  It does not matter what the Minister or anyone else may say; these are the self-same people who have been responsible for the management and control of greyhound coursing and racing and greyhound sales over the past 30 years.  If there was a change in the personnel of the control board and if we had independent members constituting that board, I would not then have the same objection to the section as I have now.  Knowing from past experience what has happened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will agree the section would be all right if the board were all right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Knowing what has happened in the past and the likelihood of no change in the future, I believe the Minister should never have inserted that section and should never have contemplated giving the powers envisaged in this section.  When Deputy Corry was speaking here to-day he raised a hare, a hare I thought someone else might chase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not very far.  If it had been raised yesterday it might have had a good gallop and it might have given a grueller to a few.  As Deputy Corry rightly pointed out to-day, the board has the right to appoint auctioneers.  It has the right to appoint one auctioneer to act as an agent for the board and to draw percentage fees on sales.  The Minister has neither the right nor the authority to stop the board from doing that.  This will be a statutory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not all cod.  If it is all cod, why does it not appear as cod? Will the Minister reply in the negative to these queries: has the board the right to licence the auctioneer; has the board the right to give the sales of greyhounds to one track or to a dozen tracks; can it not specifically name a track here in Dublin where sales are to take place; can it not specifically name the auctioneer who will conduct these sales here in Dublin; can it not do <Col N="476" /> likewise in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Kilkenny, Newbridge, Mullingar or anywhere else?  If it can, there is nothing to prevent it appointing one auctioneer and one track.  That auctioneer will act as an agent with £1,000 or £1,500 a year.  It has been computed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that our income from greyhounds could reach £2,000,000. Greyhounds are needed in Britain.  We could build up a market in America for our greyhounds.  There is nobody so foolhardy at the present time as to say anything against our trying very hard to build up exports.  Many of our old and well-established exports are dwindling.  Here is a new field of which we should take advantage.  We should not be quite so conservative as we have been in the past.</P>
