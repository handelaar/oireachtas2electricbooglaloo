      <P>It is proposed, with the concurrence of the reverend manager, to replace the present national school at Banagher, Country Mayo, by a new school, and my Department has sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the construction of the new schoolhouse.

If suitable arrangements are made locally for the conveyance of these children to the nearest suitable school, my Department will be prepared to consider the question of allowing a grant towards the cost of such conveyance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that land bonds given in payment of the purchase price of lands acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion are now either unsaleable or can be sold only at a fraction of their par value; and if, in view of the grave injustice thus caused to the owners of such lands, he will take such steps as are necessary to reimburse them for their loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms under which land bonds are issued in payment of the purchase price of lands acquired by the Land Commission are laid down in the Land Bond Act, 1934, and the Land Act, 1953.  The rate of interest to be borne by each series of land bonds is fixed with a view to securing that the <Col N="151" /> market price of the bonds shall remain at or near par for a reasonable time after they have been created.  Both the interest and the sums required for the redemption of land bonds have been declared to be a charge on the Central Fund; consequently, owners of land bonds have full security both as to their capital and interest.  As in the case of other stocks and shares, it is not possible to control fluctuations in the market price of these bonds; and as the State already secures the capital and interest, it cannot also be expected to compensate owners for stock market losses.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Re-arrangement of Achill Estate.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (a) the number of proposed migrants which will be needed in order that the re-arrangement of the Dickens estate, Corraun, Achill, may be considered, and (b) the number of people in Louragee, Knocknamona and elsewhere on the estate who have signified their willingness to be transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that to effect re-arrangement of this estate and at the same time bring the holdings up to an economic standard, it would be necessary to migrate more than half of the existing 400 tenants occupying considerably undersized holdings thereon.  As the Deputy will readily appreciate a migration scheme of such magnitude would be a very formidable task, apart altogether from the general reluctance on the part of the tenants concerned to migrate to eastern areas.  It seems that the most that the Land Commission can hope to achieve is to secure the maximum pool of land by way of migration and resumption and to effect as satisfactory a re-arrangement as possible with this additional land.  It was ascertained in October, 1954, that nine tenants on the estate whose combined lands comprised 56 acres, were prepared to migrate and the inadequacy of this area to effect a satisfactory re-arrangement is quite apparent.  The housing conditions on the estate are good. Many of the tenants have availed themselves of Gaeltacht and other <Col N="152" /> housing assistance and generally speaking a fair proportion of the dwellings have been improved and are well kept.</P>
      <P>I happen to know the estate myself and cannot help thinking that it is not a farming area in the orthodox sense; migratory labouring abroad has become endemic there.  The estate, however, is being kept under constant review, but I am unable to promise that it can be dealt with quickly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (a) the amount of money originally budgeted for by the Land Commission for the provision of fences under the re-arrangement scheme for the Westlands-Ballyheane area, near Castlebar, County Mayo, and (b) the actual amount spent on the provision of fences under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that the Land Commission have left only half-completed the fencing of a number of the holdings under the re-arrangement scheme for the Peyton Estate, Bally-heane, County Mayo, and if so, if the commission will take immediate steps to remedy this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together. In connection with the re-arrangement of the townlands of Westland and Cornaveagh on the Peyton Estate, a sum of £1,594 has been expended on fencing to date.  It has been found necessary to sanction an additional free grant of £804 for this work which it is hoped to complete at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the allotment of any estate, other than land purchased under Section 27, Land Act, 1950, all local uneconomic holders are eligible for enlargements. <Col N="153" /> Because of wide variations in agricultural and economic conditions in different localities it would not be feasible to define, by relation to rateable valuation alone, what constitutes an uneconomic holding. In general, a person is regarded as an uneconomic holder if he is mainly dependent for a livelihood on the produce of a holding which cannot be regarded as adequate to support a family in frugal comfort even under the best management.  For the economic and proper working of an enlargement it is desirable that it should be within a reasonable distance of the allottee's residence.  Such distance has been accepted as about one mile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that many of the candidates who were qualified at the last Garda examination have been notified that they will not be called for training, and that many of these men will be disqualified under the age limit from sitting for future examinations; and, if so, if he will arrange that such candidates will be called for training as vacancies occur without undergoing further examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the number of notices sent to candidates, who underwent the recent examination for recruitment to the Garda Síochána, informing them that the educational certificates issued by the Civil Service Commissioners would become invalid in February, 1957, and that they would not be eligible for appointment to the force after that date unless they passed a further entrance examination; and if he will consider making arrangements for the extension of the final date from February, 1957, to February, 1958.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to answer Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations, 1945, prescribe that no person shall be appointed to the force unless he is certified by the Civil Service Commissioners to have passed a qualifying educational examination but they also prescribe that the commissioner shall not appoint or enrol any person as a member of the force by virtue of such certificate after the expiration of a period of 18 months from the date of the certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the last examination held by the Civil Service Commissioners in June, 1955, the number of candidates certified was 454.  As the intake of recruits for the year 1956-57 will be only <Col N="155" /> 150 it was considered desirable to notify candidates, who were unlikely to be enrolled before the expiration of a period of 18 months from the date they were certified, as to their position. Those who will not be recruited during the year and who will be within the prescribed age limits in December, 1956, will be able to compete at an examination to be held in that month should they so wish.  It is understood that all but nine of the candidates who received notices will be eligible to compete again in December next.</P>
    <P>I do not think it desirable to alter the existing regulations.  I consider it would be better to hold another examination and thus to give a chance of competing to other young men as they reach the age for joining the force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the position is that a year, or so, ago when the examination was held a number of candidates sat for the examination?  They understood then that about 250 or 300 candidates would be called during the present year.  On the strength of that, they have been waiting for a full year in the hope that they would be called and now the Government, due to Government policy, have decided that instead of taking 250 they will take only 160. Is the Minister satisfied that justice has been done to these young boys who have been left waiting for the last 12 months and are told at the last minute that they are thrown on the scrapheap?  I think the matter should be reconsidered and they should at least be given a chance to enter the Garda without having to undergo a further examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána is up to its full strength.  I expect only 150 resignations during 1956.  Therefore, I cannot make room for 200 or 300 new members.  There will be only nine in December, 1956, ineligible to compete.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to segregate the costs of the administration of minor employment and rural improvement schemes on the lines indicated in the Deputy's question.

    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> A statement has been prepared for the information of the Deputy setting out the total cost of salaries and travelling expenses of the engineering inspectors engaged on minor employment, bog development and rural improvement schemes in Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon for each of the years in question.  The carrying out of the schemes in Counties Leitrim and Sligo is supervised by the county engineers acting as agent-inspectors for the Special Employment Schemes Office.  They are paid on a commission basis and the amount of the commission paid is shown in the statement.  The commission, however, covers some other items, including the cost of payment of wages to workmen. The inspection and the preparation of reports and estimates of cost in respect of new proposals in these two counties is carried out by engineering inspectors of the Special Employment Schemes Office, and the proportion of the salaries and travelling expenses of the inspectors while engaged in these counties are also shown in the statement.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware. No proposal for the award of increases in salary to officers of Cork County Council has been received in my Department.  The legal position is that a proposal may not be submitted by the manager for the sanction of the Minister, without the consent of the council, and, unless and until a proposal is submitted by the manager with the consent of the council I have no power to sanction any increase.  The council cannot require the manager to submit a proposal in regard to the remuneration of officers or servants.</P>

The proposal of 12/6 per week was carried by a majority of the council and the manager then rejected that proposal and adopted the percentage proposal. Is the manager entitled to increase in this manner his own salary against the wishes of the council?</P>

There was a proposal brought in for an increase on a percentage basis. There was another proposal brought in for an increase of 12/6 per week.  The council decided in favour of the 12/6 and that decision was rejected by the manager, who then brought in a managerial order under which his salary is increased over and above the salary given him by the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring to your notice, Sir, a leading article in a paper known as the <i>Sporting Press</i> in its issue of February 23rd, with a view to seeing whether you would consider sending this document for examination by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and to ascertain whether this leading article is not, in fact, a grave breach of privilege.  I propose to read only short extracts from this article so that you will know its trend. It is headed: &ldquo;Parliamentary Conduct.&rdquo; It begins:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Carrion consuming vultures exhaust their appetites on the flesh of their victims; they leave the dried bones to the ravages of time and weather. It seems to be the special craving only of some public men to deprive the elements of their due and to wallow in dead men's graves, rooting for their sins.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Leprosy of the mind is every bit as revolting as leprosy of the body, and equally consuming.  It destroys without supplementary irritants.  The afflicted are more pitiful than their flesh-corrupted fellow beings.  Pass them quietly on the street.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is sufficient, I think, to read only the first paragraph of these five paragraphs with a view to asking you to examine this and possibly other articles of this nature by this paper for the purpose of ensuring that the House and its members, in the conduct of their duties here, whatever their views may be, will be protected from such criticism.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has given me notice of the article complained about, published in <Col N="164" /> the <i>Sporting Press</i> of 23rd February last.  A question of privilege regarding material in newspapers must always be raised at the earliest possible opportunity, and if this paper were one of the general newspapers circulating throughout the country or any part of it, I would not tolerate that it be raised at this date.  I have taken into consideration, however, that the paper is a very specialised one with restricted circulation and not one that members of the House would be likely to see in the ordinary way.  I am accepting, therefore, that the matter is now being raised at the earliest possible opportunity in this case, having regard to the circumstances.  I have read the contents of the article and am of the opinion that it constitutes a <i>prima facie</i> breach of privilege.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That the article entitled &ldquo;Parliamentary Conduct,&rdquo; published in the <i>Sporting Press</i> of 23rd February, be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is the second Bill of its kind to come before the House.  Its object is to confirm and give the force of law to an Order which I have made under Section 9 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, relating to trade practices affecting the supply and distribution of building materials and components. The first Bill, relating to the trade in radio sets and accessories, recently received the approval of all Parties in the House and, as the principles underlying the present Bill are the same, I am sure that this measure will commend itself to the House, generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Fair <Col N="165" /> Trade Commission undertook a statutory inquiry under Section 7 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, in relation to the supply and distribution of building materials and components. Subsequently, the commission furnished to me a report of the inquiry describing the conditions which obtain in the trade and indicating that, in the view of the commission, certain practices exist which interfere unfairly with competition and operate against the public interest.  The report has been published and copies have been circulated to Deputies.  However, to facilitate the House, I propose, at this stage, to give a résumé of the commission's report and of the recommendations which the commission make with a view to prohibiting the restrictive trade practices which are considered to be unfair or to operate against the public interest.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand that in referring to trade practices, I am referring to the position as it was stated in the commission's report and that I have no means of knowing to what extent, if any, practice has been altered in the meantime.  According to the commission's report most building materials and components are manufactured in this country and are sold mainly through builders' merchants. The goods are for the most part supplied on the basis of a retail list price from which discounts and rebates are allowed at varying rates according as the purchaser is a merchant, a builder, a local authority or other type of user. Up to a short time prior to the commencement of the inquiry by the commission in December, 1953, purchasers had been confronted with a uniformity of prices that indicated collusion between merchants regarding the selling prices of a wide range of commodities essential to the building industry.  About August, 1953, a measure of competition in prices between the merchants dealing in certain materials developed and gradually extended to an increasing range of materials.</P>
    <P>At the time of the inquiry there was, nevertheless, a total absence of price competition between merchants on the resale of some materials while there was an understanding between merchants <Col N="166" /> to avoid price competition where possible in the sale of certain other materials.  Moreover, associations of merchants sought to establish arrangements with manufacturers and other suppliers with the object of regulating the channels of distribution.  In some instances, the supply of building materials has been confined to certain approved distributors with the cooperation or acquiescence of the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The effect of these arrangements has been to discourage competition, and to fortify the position of established merchants. In the case of a number of imported commodities the local associations have endeavoured&mdash;in some cases successfully&mdash;to make arrangements with manufacturers and organisations in other countries for the limitation of supplies to firms approved by the local associations.  There are, also, arrangements between associations providing for the suppression of competition by the territorial division of the market.  Most of the building materials which were the subject of the inquiry are protected either by tariffs or other import restrictions and in certain cases the existence of protection appears to have facilitated the growth of restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the trade is the number of associations in which builders' merchants are organised. There are no fewer than 16 trade associations representing merchants handling building materials.  The commission's report shows that there is a marked similarity of phrasing in the rules of some of these associations which was particularly evident in the changes made in certain rules after the introduction of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill in 1952.  There is interlocking membership between the associations.  As the chairman of one association put it, the associations are dovetailed into one another.  The regulation of the marketing of many items is a stated objective of a number of merchants' associations. There is a marked hostility of organised merchant opinion to price competition, which, where it is allowed to operate at present, is regarded as a lamentable retrogression from the position which existed prior to mid 1953. <Col N="167" /> The modifications of policy which took place in 1953 were effected because of surreptitious competition and not from any desire on the part of merchants for price competition.  The withdrawal effected in 1953 from certain longstanding restrictive practices is tentative, and there can be no confidence that such practices will not be resumed at a more opportune moment.</P>
    <P>Dealing with interferences with price competition through the operations of combinations of merchants&mdash;in what are commonly known as price rings&mdash; the commission point out that it is obvious that any body of merchants, in fixing gross profit margins, will consult their own interests and that their interests do not necessarily coincide with the public interest.  In the opinion of the commission, prohibition of competition in price between merchants results in an enhancement of price to the public, removes a vital incentive to economy in distribution, blunts the benefits to the consumer of competition between manufacturers, prevents or retards the development of potentially more efficient methods of distribution and leads to abuses of various kinds, such as collusion in tendering to public bodies.</P>
    <P>These objections, in the opinion of the commission, are more than sufficient in themselves to justify the conclusion that any measures for the elimination of price competition between merchants in this trade operate against the public interest and should be prohibited.  The views of the commission on horizontal price-fixing by &ldquo;price rings&rdquo; are fully set out in paragraphs 37 to 50, inclusive, of their report.  With regard to price maintenance imposed by manufacturers, whether individually enforced or enforced by agreement with other suppliers, or with combinations of merchants, the commission point out that such price maintenance also denies to the public the benefit of price competition between merchants and removes the incentive provided by such competition to improved efficiency in distribution, and the conclusion of the commission is that the practice operates against the public interest.  In some cases, as is pointed out in different <Col N="168" /> chapters of the report, none of the considerations commonly urged in favour of price maintenance by manufacturers was relevant.</P>
    <P>There is a further consideration relating to the trade in building materials which reinforces the importance of the considerations already mentioned, viz., the degree to which public policy has entailed the intervention of the State and local authorities in the financing of housing and other building construction.  State subsidies of one kind or another, and contributions by local authorities, in respect of housing, have, in recent years, been of the order of £4,000,000 annually.  Other social services involve very considerable annual expenditure by the State or local authorities on the construction of hospitals, sanatoria, schools, etc.  Any arrangements which lead to an enhancement of the prices of building materials inevitably result in a reduction in the volume of housing and construction financed from a particular allocation of public moneys, and must, therefore, be of serious concern to the State.</P>
    <P>The arrangements by associations governing entry to, and status in, the trade in building materials generally take the form of a classification of merchants and the establishment of conditions for entry into each class. Merchants are generally classed as &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;, the &ldquo;A&rdquo; merchants being entitled to a higher trade discount than the &ldquo;B&rdquo; merchants.  Entry into a class is governed by conditions which vary between different associations and between different commodities or groups of commodities, so that a merchant might be classed as a &ldquo;B&rdquo; merchant for the sale of one commodity and an &ldquo;A&rdquo; merchant for the sale of another commodity.  Conditions of entry generally require the achievement of a certain turnover in the goods concerned in advance of entry and the performance of merchanting functions by the applicant.</P>
    <P>In addition, the applicant is sometimes required to show that he maintains stocks of a certain magnitude and that he possesses adequate premises.  In the opinion of the commission, the policies and practices adopted by the associations relating to <Col N="169" /> entry into the trade in building materials are, in their general tendency, unfair.  The restriction of supplies on trade terms to comparatively few merchants may seriously handicap an excluded merchant in his business generally.  A merchant who is not in a position to supply, on appropriate terms to a builder, some of the goods normally provided by a merchant may lose that builder's custom altogether. A merchant prevented from obtaining the best terms is obviously handicapped in competition with the merchant in receipt of such terms because of the difficulty of providing a comparable service on a smaller gross profit margin.</P>
    <P>The commission are of the view that on two principal grounds the practices of associations in relation to the supply of building materials are contrary to the public interest and should be prohibited.  Firstly, by restricting the numbers of merchants trading in particular commodities, the practices limit competition and facilitate the control of prices by the associations concerned. Secondly, by strongly resisting the supply of the goods through alternative channels, the trade associations restrict competition and thereby prevent the interplay of forces which normally leads to the emergence of improved methods of distribution in response to changing circumstances and opportunities.</P>
    <P>The commission consider that a manufacturer should not be prevented from developing his distribution system in the manner that seems best to him in the light of his requirements and responsibilities.  They are of opinion that a manufacturer should, in his own discretion and without pressure from organised bodies of traders, be free to select channels of distribution for his products.  In allowing freedom to the manufacturer in this respect, regard must be had to his position in the market.  Where there is only one manufacturer of a particular product in Ireland it is especially important that the arrangements for the supply and distribution of the product should be equitable as between distributors generally, since distributors who may have reason to feel aggrieved have no <Col N="170" /> alternative source of supply to fall back on.</P>
    <P>The commission have had regard to objections advanced by merchants concerning the distributional arrangements of certain manufacturers and have suggested modifications in these arrangements with the object of removing what appear to the commission to be legitimate grievances. The commission consider that steps should be taken to ensure the avoidance of unfair conditions in the supply of goods while providing that any supplier may, on his own initiative, apply to the acceptance of orders for goods such terms and conditions as are reasonable in the interests of efficiency and economy in production and distribution or are necessary in the legitimate interests of the supplier, provided such terms and conditions are equitably applied.</P>
    <P>With the object of removing the abuses which exist and restoring conditions of free and fair competition in the trade in building materials, the commission recommend in their report that an Order should be made prohibiting the particular practices which are considered to be harmful to the public interest.  The commission recommend for instance, that resale price maintenance should be prohibited and that it should be made possible for merchants to determine their own selling prices in the light of their own operating costs.  As regards arrangements and practices adopted by manufacturers and merchants with the object of regulating the channels of distribution, the commission recommend that it should be made unlawful for a manufacturer to withhold supplies from a merchant on the grounds that a merchant is or is not a member of a particular organisation or association or because the merchant's name does not appear on an approved list.</P>
    <P>The commission recommend that individual or collective action against a supplier with the object of limiting him in his choice of channels of distribution or of customers or in his discretion in the grant of trade terms to any person should be prohibited.  It is recommended by the commission that no manufacturer, trade association or <Col N="171" /> organisation should be permitted to publish lists of approved or non-approved persons which are likely to restrict entry to the trade in building materials or to be used as a basis for regulating the supply and distribution of such materials.  The commission recommend that it should be made unlawful for any person to secure a boycott of any manufacturer of building materials on the grounds that the manufacturer has refused to do any act which would be contrary to the terms of the Order.  Agreements between suppliers, which provide for the suppression of competition by the territorial division of the market, should be prohibited and combinations of suppliers should be prohibited from being parties to any agreement to confine their orders to any suppliers outside the State.</P>
    <P>There are, finally, two recommendations by the commission regarding the imposition by individual manufacturers of terms and conditions for the acceptance of orders.  Firstly, it is recommended that a manufacturer should be permitted to impose certain conditions, including conditions as to the volume and frequency of orders, provided such conditions are reasonable, are equitably applied and are notified on request to the commission which may, if circumstances at any time so require, make fair trading rules in relation thereto.  Secondly, it is recommended that there should be a prohibition against a manufacturer differentiating between customers who should in the normal way be supplied on the same terms and conditions having regard to the size and the frequency of their orders.  The commission do not consider that a manufacturer should be prevented from advertising or specifying a resale price which is a maximum price or from withholding supplies from a merchant if the maximum price is exceeded.  Any such specified price will not, however, be binding on merchants as a minimum price.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission.  I am of opinion that the commission are fully justified in making <Col N="172" /> the recommendations which are contained in their report and I agree entirely with these recommendations.  I am satisfied that it is unfair that manufacturers of building materials, most, if not all, of whom have the benefit of tariff or other protection should discriminate against merchants by refusing to supply them on the grounds that the merchants are not approved by particular trade associations.  I am of opinion also that it is wrong that it should be within the competence of vested merchant interests to restrict or regulate the right of new merchants to enter into the trade.  I am satisfied that it is contrary to the interests of the consumer that the competition should be restricted both by the operation of arrangements between manufacturers and merchants to regulate the channels of distribution and by the enforcement of minimum resale prices for building materials.  As I have already indicated, I have made an Order to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report of the Fair Trade Commission and a copy of the Order has been circulated to Deputies.  Section 9 (3) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is the Confirmation Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order. Deputies are aware that proceedings have been initiated in the High Court seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the inquiry held by the Fair Trade Commission in regard to the supply and distribution of radio sets, and the Restrictive Trade Practices (Radios) Order, 1955 are unconstitutional. The hearing of the action has not yet commenced and I do not wish to say anything that might be regarded as prejudging the hearing, but I consider that, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be proper that the Oireachtas should proceed with its consideration of Bills for the confirmation of the Orders relating to restrictive trade practices.</P>
    <P>In the case of Confirmation Bills of this kind, the arrangement is that the Order, which it is proposed to confirm, would not be capable of being <Col N="173" /> amended by the House but would be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters dealt with in the Order have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission and the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Order are set out fully in the commission's report.  I have no hesitation in commending to the House this Confirmation Bill which, on enactment, will, I hope, put an end to unfair restrictive practices in the trade in building materials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is already aware from the speech made by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with the first of these restrictive Orders, there is a very large measure of agreement among all Parties that we should do our utmost, not only to stimulate fullest production here, but to loosen and encourage forces of competition in our midst.  We are all aware that the distributive system here is far from perfect in many respects, although it has grown as a result of historical and other developments, and that any changes to be made in its character are extremely difficult, if not impossible, in many respects, to effect.  Therefore, it should be unnecessary for us on this side of the House to comment in general on restrictive practices Orders, because we have already given our general views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite evident that here and in other countries efforts made to secure the territorial distribution of materials used in building, with a view to securing higher profits, are entirely objectionable, but we want to make certain that there are, in fact, no savings in costs effected by such territorial distributions or no evidence that this system of distribution ultimately results in savings to the consumers which might be lost to them.  Equally, the arrangements to maintain the rate of profit and to maintain a system of prices in the case of certain commodities can simply result in a lack of competition and prices not being at the very lowest point when the materials enter into building construction. Equally, there are practices <Col N="174" /> abroad in which certain types of distributor make a commission on the sale of materials.  They do very little work, or assume very little responsibility, the commission accruing to them automatically.  In certain cases, they have not even assumed the responsibility of having either to merchant the goods or effect the transport.</P>
    <P>In connection with this Order, there has been the observation of the commission that they are satisfied that, in certain cases, there are too few merchants for various products.  It is very important that we on this side of the House should offer constructive criticism and, above all, that there should be a record in the deliberations of the House of the opposite point of view. In other words, just as the former Minister for Industry and Commerce expressed the views of the wireless dealers in certain respects in regard to that Order, so the Minister will understand that, although we would generally agree with the terms of the Order, it is just as well to say a few words about some of the views that have been expressed on this Order.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister very definitely whether he thinks that, in fact, in respect of a very large number of these building commodities, there are at present too few merchants and whether the Order is going to have a particularly valuable effect in increasing the number of merchants?  We quite understand that the Minister wants, as we all want, maximum competition and the lowest possible prices, but there is a certain amount of evidence that, if anything, there are too many distributors of some commodities, the result being that the costs of deliveries and costs of accountancy increase to a point where the savings effected by a very wide measure of distribution are lost.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied&mdash;and, in particular, whether he is satisfied from what he can read in this commission's report &mdash;if that question is of very great importance.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Order could still have a great deal of value, while the particular statement might not be entirely true of certain commodities.  I think it is time we should say in connection also with this second Order <Col N="175" /> that the Minister is surely aware that there are other forms of restriction in connection with building and in connection with construction and manufacture in general.  There are restrictions in connection with the conditions of workers and I should like to ask the Minister whether he has had any opportunity of examining them sympathetically, but nevertheless with a view to securing the interests of all sections of the community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that.  I am merely asking, in passing, whether the Minister has begun any examination of that.  I also want to ask the Minister whether, in connection with this Order, he has made certain that the absence of collusion, however undesirable it may be, may reduce the total amount and value of applying new techniques to the building trade, whether, as a result of the competition that is now going to take place, if the commission's views are right, there will be a sufficient amount of money to ensure examination of new techniques, sufficient to spend in advertising new techniques, in teaching builders the value of new techniques, in enabling them to have sample stocks of new forms of materials, and enabling them to have samples of new building machinery and appliances; and whether he is certain that that work will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the efficiency of building varies very widely throughout the country.  There are places where one can see, say, 100 houses being built with a very great absence of modern labour-saving machinery, with a consequent increase in the cost of the houses: there are other places where one can see half-a-dozen houses being built and already some of the newer techniques are being adopted.  It has been suggested by the Builders' Providers' Association that part of the financing of that work was done as a <Col N="176" /> result of the quite deliberate policy of price maintenance and price collusion. I should like to ask the Minister whether he thinks that part of the work will continue.  I am not willing to state that the builders' providers were carrying out or entering into new techniques for the sake of the country: they were doing it as part of an incentive for their own business, but I am asking if the Minister thinks it will continue and what he proposes to do to ensure that it will continue.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister, again in a general way, as we are now dealing with a particular aspect of a particular practice, whether he has made any investigation, through the Minister for Local Government, as to how far the method of issuing grants for building houses by local authorities has the effect of increasing the price of houses.  It is a matter on which we have had very little debate in this House; it is a matter which, in many respects, is of quite as much importance to the future of the building trade as the implementation of this Order.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the Minister for Local Government has been asked by him to make any investigation into that, as it might be found to be of very great importance, if we are now trying to ensure reasonable competition, lowest possible prices for the best possible articles and generally enhanced efficiency.</P>
    <P>We have noted that, as in the case of the previous Order, there is a section which enables suppliers to make certain conditions with their customers in connection with the sale of goods, and, just as the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was speaking on the Wireless Order, emphasised that we on this side of the House were keener on the working of restrictive trade practices Orders in relation to collective arrangements, and thought that individual suppliers should be given a fair measure of freedom for the sale of materials to their customers, I take it that the Minister will advise the commission to take a reasonable attitude in regard to such regulations as are made.  In other words, the supplier must be assured that his customer is credit-worthy; <Col N="177" /> that he will keep within stocks; that he will be able to render technical and other services to those who purchase from him; and that equally he has a right to see that there are not too many customers in an area, with a consequent increase in distribution costs, rather than a reduction in the cost to the final purchaser.</P>
    <P>Equally, I think, the supplier is entitled in the case of a number of products to insist on certain local advertising obligations on the part of the merchant whom he serves.  If the sale of a particular commodity requires advertising to be done co-operatively on a basis on which the local merchant enters into all responsibility, the Minister should see that a reasonable attitude is adopted in regard to all these matters.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the allegation made by timber merchants that, taking it on an average even in peace time, timber being a sufficiently valuable commodity, collective arrangements for buying timber through the distribution channels might actually maintain the price of imported timber at a lower level.  That was stated and I should like to have a very definite refutation by the Minister of it.  I should like to ask the Minister for an assurance that that is not now the case and that the free purchase of timber by merchants and freedom of distribution will not have any effect in raising the price of imported timber.</P>
    <P>Let me deal in somewhat more detail with the Order.  I noted the observations by the cement distributors.  I think that there again in the interests of democracy&mdash;I am quite sure the Minister must fully understand the whole position&mdash;I should like to ask the Minister what is his opinion on some of the observations made on this particular Order.  We were told that only six out of the 680 cement handling firms gave evidence to the commission. It was suggested that although the commission, in their own wisdom, believed they received adequate evidence from these six, perhaps the six did not reflect to a sufficient degree the views of the very large majority of members.  I should like to ask the Minister what his view is about that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> In connection with the cement distributors' observations, it was stated that the cost of cement to local authorities was increased by the intervention of distributors.  On the face of it, that would appear to be the case. The reply of the cement distributors was very definite, that, in a very large number of cases, they had to arrange for the transport of the cement, that it would cost the local authority so much &mdash;this apparently applies to other building materials&mdash;that there would be no total net saving to the local authority.</P>
    <P>The interests concerned both in cement and other materials said that the local authorities in many cases were not prompt payers and were, in fact, financed by the distributors, and that that had not been taken into full account by the commission when they decided there would be a net saving to the whole community by the issue of this Order and the effect it might have in regard to the amount of cement and other materials sold directly to local authorities, as distinct from being sold through distributors.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to make any comment on that.  We would want to have a vast array of facts and figures in regard to the credit offered to local authorities, the amount of commodities they bought direct, the percentages of commission received by the distributors and a number of other matters on which there is very little evidence in the actual report of the commission in its abbreviated form and in connection with which it would be impossible to gain evidence upon which to make a final comment.</P>
    <P>It was alleged, equally, that the actual profit to the distributors, in the case of cement, for example, was only 3.9 per cent. on cost and for that they had to carry out a very great number of services, including the giving of credit.  It seems very difficult to imagine how distributors were able to make very much profit on that basis. The observations of the distributors in that regard are inadequate.</P>
    <P>The final statement made is one which is of real interest to the House. A number of these distributors said <Col N="179" /> that the effect of this Order would be to increase the proportion of a number of building materials sold to local authorities and to large users to the point where it might reach one-third of the total, that, therefore, the distributors would be left a much smaller share of these various building commodities to distribute and that, as a result, their costs would go up proportionately and, as a further result, their margins would have to increase. In other words, there might be some saving to local authorities and other very large users through buying direct from manufacturers, and there might be, according to the statement made here, as great a loss, because the distributors with a lower turnover would have to increase their margins, and doubt was expressed as to whether there would be any great net saving to the community.</P>
    <P>It is utterly impossible for us to make any comment on that.  It is equally difficult to make a comment on the effect of altering the incidence and the extent of credit as between one type of distribution channel and another.  Statements were made that if this Order were carried out thoroughly and if it were enforced, there would be a disadvantage to the smaller and an advantage to the larger interests in the business and that the Minister's desire to ensure a more equitable distribution, greater competition, lower prices and greater incentive to sell cheaply and efficiently might be partly offset by the changes that would take place in the channels of distribution and as a result of the alteration in the credit structure of the whole of the distribution of these commodities.</P>
    <P>I trust I have made myself clear. This is a most difficult matter to discuss because we have not got the detailed facts.  The Minister will understand that if there is a big change in the method of distribution, so that a very great proportion of a particular commodity is sold direct to large users, there will be some effect on the business of the smaller distributors. That is clear.  It is equally clear that if one group of distributors have to give larger amounts of credit than they <Col N="180" /> had to give before, in connection with the sale of various products, the effect equally on them will be that their price margins will have to increase, so that there may be a disadvantage to all concerned. I am merely making these statements in order that the views of those concerned with this Order may be given some ventilation in this House and so that the Minister can have an opportunity of replying to them.</P>
    <P>There were also suggestions made that there would be a diminution of stocks in connection with certain materials, due to the application of this Order.  The suggestion was made by the Builders' Providers' Association that it might hinder the distribution of new and untried products, that it might possibly decrease the variety of the products available in certain small centres.  Some of those things have equally been said by interests defending collective price arrangements abroad.  They may have no validity whatever.</P>
    <P>My fear is that, whenever we engage in legislation of this kind, in the long run, we will always find disadvantages we never anticipated.  No legislation of this kind can ever be perfect; it breeds its own difficulties.  It is difficult, as the Minister knows, to enforce such an Order.  There may be various methods of escaping some of the regulations of the Order, and it is because, by long and bitter experience, one knows there will always be contrary arguments to every type of statute which attempts to do good that I am putting forward these suggestions to the Minister, in the hope that they can be discussed in the House and that we can have an effective reply to most reputable organisations who claim, for example, that the price of commodities as compared with that in other countries has not shown any increase as a result of the Order.</P>
    <P>I should like to have the Minister's reply to that also.  It is a very serious statement to make that the actual method of price collusion has not resulted in any increase whatever in the price at which the builder was able to obtain building materials here as compared with the price at which he was <Col N="181" /> able to obtain them in other countries. Of course, there are restrictive practices in other countries; there are such practices, for instance, in Great Britain.  These are things on which there should be some comment in the House before we proceed to pass this Order and to bring it into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many aspects of this Bill with which I must regretfully disagree and, being connected with trade myself and with this particular trade, I have the personal knowledge of the matter which perhaps in some ways helps me and maybe, in others, does the reverse; but I would like to give the House the benefit of my opinions, such as they are.  First, this method of legislation, which is by confirmation of ministerial Order, handicaps us in considering this Bill.  The Bill is a very simple little measure: it has just two sections, but behind that Bill is the Order which was made last September.  That is the real bones of this Bill.  In fact, it is difficult to discuss that, when the gist of the matter does not appear in the Bill in front of us.  I should like to say that I think the Minister has been very fair and that he has, in his opening speech, run through many of the details of the Restrictive Trade Practices (Building Materials) Order.</P>
      <P>Still, the effect of this form of legislation is that the House has not the benefit of considering the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill.  The Bill is thereby handicapped.  In effect, the various paragraphs of this Order are what would normally correspond to the section of a Bill, but, as a result of that, we are deprived of the opportunity of discussing it, and the Bill, as I said before, is weakened by not having our deliberations on those two stages.  That is not the fault of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce. I should not like to stand up here behind the Minister and attack him on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is in the position of a man who has had this Bill left on his doorstep by the previous Minister and only last week, speaking on the first of these Orders, Deputy Lemass mentioned that he had deliberately framed <Col N="182" /> the Bill from which this commission and those Orders flow.  He said that he had framed it in such a way that these Orders would come to the House in the form of a Bill and that there would be acceptance of it, without any discussion on the Order.  I think that is something which is not in the democratic interest and I regret that we have had to carry out this Bill which has had to be introduced into the House in the way in which it is laid down in the Bill, which covers the whole matter.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, when Deputy Lemass was Minister, he did this deliberately in order that the policy of his own Government would be carried out in these Orders and that the House would not be given the opportunity of discussing them.  I think that is something which every Deputy and everybody else in the country should be made aware of&mdash;that this matter is being discussed in this way because the Bill introduced by the previous Government laid down that it could not be dealt with in any other way.  Personally, I think it is a way which hinders the business community from putting their views forward in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly to refer to the commission itself and I do not wish anything I shall say to be taken as in any sense referring personally to the members of that commission.  I think they carried out a very difficult type of job in an exemplary fashion.  They were polite and painstaking with the witnesses.  However, the very form of the commission was one which, of necessity, operated against the business community.  It operated against the individuals who were giving evidence.  They inevitably felt they were in the dock.  In order to arrive at the maximum of information, the commissioners themselves were inevitably bound to take on something of the qualities of a judge advocate.  There was a form of questioning by commissioners who have, at any rate, quasi-judicial functions.  I have seen the commission at work.  As I say, I pay tribute to the fashion in which they carried it out, but I do not think that that method is the best way of arriving at decisions concerning commerce and <Col N="183" /> business matters.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consult his Department as to how that situation could be altered and the commission strengthened and improved.  It certainly makes for great difficulties, I think on both sides, in its present form.</P>
    <P>I read about the matter and I listened with great interest to the Minister and other speakers who talked about the report.  I should like to say that it is not universally held that the regulation and regulating of prices are necessarily against the public interest.  That is something that a lot of people in this country seem to accept automatically, but that is not universally held and it is not universally regarded so legislatively by many countries.  I am informed that in a number of the states of the United States of America there are, on the contrary, regulations actually against price-cutting.</P>
    <P>I should not like to stand here and be taken as advocating any regime of unrestricted price regulation.  The whole kernel of this question is that any price regulation, where it exists, should be fair and reasonable.  I believe that, in those circumstances, a great measure of good is done to the community at large.  I also believe that good is done to the community at large and to business interests by keen competition and, at times, by very keen price-cutting.  However, the facts are, as I see them&mdash;and I think as many, if not all, of the business people in this country see them&mdash;that there must be reasonableness in this matter &mdash;reasonableness, on the one hand, in any degree of price regulation and reasonableness, on the other hand, if a person does not hold to that view, in the advocacy of unrestricted price-cutting which, at the present moment, seems to be in many people's minds a very desirable thing.  I wish to put forward the viewpoint and the opinion that that is not so.</P>
    <P>I would ask members of the House to pose a question to themselves; I have often posed it to myself.  I have asked myself: &ldquo;What are the trades, businesses and manufactures which seem to be profitable, which pay high <Col N="184" /> wages, which treat their staff well and provide very suitable premises and staff pensions&rdquo;?  By &ldquo;staff pensions&rdquo; I mean pensions for workmen as well as staffs.  What are the businesses and the trades that can afford to do that?  I would answer that question quite briefly and say that they are businesses handling or manufacturing proprietary articles where they are selling a product which is well-advertised and which is known to be up to a certain standard, a product which cannot be sold or bought or acquired for less than that price. Behind that article, whether it be a type of beer, a branded type of tea, a suction vacuum cleaner or any of the well-known articles with household names, I would say that if you look at those factories, if you even pass them on the road, you will see that obviously those factories are doing everything in an up-to-date fashion and are obviously paying high wages and have contented staffs.  We have only to look round our own country and see the industries which provide first-class facilities for their staffs, which pay their shareholders adequate dividends and which, at the end of the year, are able to make a contribution towards reducing the difficulties of the Minister for Finance.  I would suggest to the House that those are firms which, again, are selling a product the return on which is adequate.</P>
    <P>Contrast that picture with some of the trades and industries which have free and unrestricted competition especially of a world-wide nature.  We know how, in the years before the war, in the neighbouring island, not only were certain trades hit very severely by world-wide conditions, but whole districts were hit.  Slackness in the steel and heavy industries generally resulted in one town&mdash;Yarrow&mdash;becoming a by-word in the English language. The reason was that not only was there, of course, a slump in those particular trades, but there was a slump of such dimensions that you could practically give away the stuff that was produced.  That meant that there was no money not only to maintain the industry in a proper way, but not even enough to keep up the employment level; there was not sufficient profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> That is the other side of the picture&mdash; the side of the picture which comes to the front when you have free and unrestricted price cutting and competition. I am sure nobody in this House wants to see a situation like that coming back, but we could get a degree of that due to very, very unrestricted competition.</P>
    <P>To get down to a particular instance, Deputy Childers in his reply cited the case of cement.  Cement is one of the materials which is of enormous importance to the building trade.  It is mentioned in the commission's report. Cement is fundamental to the building trade and, therefore, it is a good example to take.  This Order will seriously interfere with supplies of cement throughout the country and the commission, because of the importance of cement, dealt very fully with it in the report.  They stated that margins were allowed by the Cement Company, and taken by the distributors, in the supply of cement to local authorities and that these distributors in that case in fact performed no important function. The cement distributors have pointed out that they have to deliver to local authorities in the same way as they deliver to anybody else; they have to send men to the railway companies, and so forth; and in due course the local authorities have to pay for the cement.</P>
    <P>The commission referred to the credit-worthiness of the local authorities. Now, I would not like to run down the credit-worthiness of local authorities; they are ultimately resting on the rateable capacity of the people in their area, and that is a pretty firm rock for any body or authority to stand on.  At the same time, owing to their system of auditing and owing to their methods of getting money in for capital expenditures, there is very often a long period between the actual supply of the cement to and the actual payment for it by the local authority.  That is inherent both in our system of financial control of local authorities and our system of giving financial assistance to them.  Every Deputy knows that there have been complaints here from time to time of the difficulties which builders have experienced in <Col N="186" /> getting payment.  I do not want to labour the point, but some local authorities are not famous for the speed with which they pay their accounts.  Now, a very important factor in relation to the supply of cement is the period in which the merchant or distributor gets paid.  Deputy Childers mentioned a figure of 3.9 as representing the profit a distributor makes on the sale of cement.  I think the Deputy expressed a wish in that connection; I think he asked for some expansion of that statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer that by saying that cement is such a fundamental and important part of the building trade that anybody who purports to call himself a builders' provider or a builders' merchant, or, in fact, has any connection with the building trade, or the supplying of that trade, would not like to be in the position of not being able to handle cement.  He will, therefore, supply cement, even when the supplying of it represents a loss to himself.  I would not say, of course, that is a reason why any Government should seek, by legislation, to leave a man who is supplying cement permanently in the position of doing so to his own detriment; but the reason why it is handled by the trade is that it is such a very necessary part of the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission recommended, too, that manufacturers of concrete products should be supplied direct, so that all manufacturers would be able to obtain supplies on proportionately equal terms.  That actually is an oversimplification of the situation, because that statement was made apparently on the evidence of one small manufacturer <Col N="187" /> who said that he obtained his supplies from a registered merchant, with whom he was associated, at cost. There was no other substantiation by other merchants of that and the cement merchants, therefore, feel there is no basis for the commission's recommendation that manufacturers should be supplied direct.  Most of the arguments for and against an alteration in the present method are very technical, but, if there is a free-for-all in relation to price, matters will be made more difficult for many merchants, especially for the small merchants, because that will have the effect of reducing the channels of distribution and will leave less credit facilities available; and credit facilities, especially at present, are enormously important.  At the moment, a large number of contractors are financed indirectly by the distributors and the merchants; and any interference with that system will not help to keep down the price of building.</P>
    <P>The distributors feel that the following results will ensue: the situation envisaged under the Order will create anomalies between the various users and will give new and powerful advantages to some.  It will result in an increase in price to many users.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>I would say so. It is very difficult to say without sitting down and working out the exact channel through which a particular order may go.  I referred to another reason, the disruption of present channels of distribution.  It would also lead to the non-availability of supplies in places where they are now available, <Col N="188" /> the use of extra staff and labour by users to carry out duties at present performed by distributors and merchants so that the feeling of the distributors is that the Order as a whole would be unworkable, that many of these sections are extremely difficult to interpret, that they cannot in fact be interpreted and therefore would be unenforceable.</P>
      <P>I referred to the general effect of price cutting.  If you have ever seen one of these cut-price establishments operating, you might get, in miniature, an idea of what may result by the wholesale application of the principles enshrined in this Order.  If any of you are sufficiently interested to go and look into one of these establishments, you will see a very ordinary looking shop, inadequately furnished, with no proper counter and with very young assistants serving the public.  If you contrast that with any well-established grocers' establishment, with its well-trained assistants of various ages and obviously with considerable experience of the trade and of the articles which they handle, you will get some idea of the difference between unrestricted price cutting and the system operated in a trade which carries on with a degree of price regulation which ultimately is in the interests not only of those in the trade but of the public themselves.</P>

      <P>While there are many questions on which I cannot and never did perhaps agree with Deputy Lemass, I am glad to say that on this particular issue I do agree with him.  The report of this commission has come before us and if we are to indulge in a free-for-all discussion again, after the time and the money that has been spent on this work through the commission that was set up, it would be of little use having commissions established at all to go into these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever Deputy Dockrell may say, it is a sad commentary on present business methods in this country when we have to admit that in order to expose restrictive trade practices we have had to set up a commission to show to us in a fair, honest manner, as they have done, what the builders' providers have been doing over the <Col N="189" /> years.  As one of those at the other end of the stick, so to speak, in relation to building, I can say that this report was long overdue.  If we had more time, as Deputy Dockrell said, to go into detail, perhaps we could expose a great deal more.</P>
    <P>The question of credit, which has been mentioned by two previous speakers, was much less difficult in the building trade before the outbreak of war in 1939.  In fairness to the builders' providers let me say that they gave more fair play then than they have given since the commencement of the war.  It is because materials became so scarce, because they and their travellers were able to select their customers throughout the country, that they came to realise how much the years of the war meant to them and had reason to hope that they would never have to return to the pre-1939 situation.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barry and other Deputies are anxious to speak, I will not delay the House except to say that we of the Labour Party welcome this report and congratulate the chairman and the members of the commission on the manner in which they carried out their work and presented that report. Please God, as these matters are being shown up to the whole community, we may soon return to a system of business and commerce whereby we will not have to adopt continuously the procedure of having commissions set up to expose certain methods of business that should never have been introduced into this country and which I hope, as a result of this report, will be obliterated at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dockrell, said it was not possible to deal with this matter as clearly as he would like, because it required excessive simplification.  I think this matter requires to be simplified because there are elementary principles involved here which should be stated and restated in this House.  Deputy Childers referred to it, inadvertently I think, as a restrictive Order.  It is the opposite to that, of course.  It is a freeing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I guessed the Deputy had read it hastily.  We have a con dition in this country at the moment where we are embarking on a line of public activity that is due to history. We are engaged in a great deal of public construction work&mdash;hospitals, public buildings, road-making and bridges&mdash;and engaging in very considerable housing activity.  The costs of the materials we have to buy for these things is, of course, vital.  I have been disturbed to find a very considerable unevenness in the costs of building supplies in the city of which I am a councillor.  I have found that it is possible to build a house at varying rates in this country and the city in which I live does not compare favourably with others.  I have found also that, where we engage in direct labour projects and purchase supplies ourselves and upon our own price basis, it is sometimes possible for us to bring articles many hundreds of miles from the other end of the country although we have very adequate and rich commercial institutions, builders' providers, in the City of Cork.  That is a disturbing reflection.</P>
      <P>I believe it is very closely related to conditions in the rather well-tied-up trade that this trade is.  I can only repeat what I said when the Minister was bringing in a similar Order here last week.  That is that we have got to accept the idea that business should be a free-for-all and that any restriction upon its activity is a movement in a direction away from what we understand to be free enterprise.  Any kind of a restriction on prices is a movement away from free enterprise and we might well injure the community by such measures unless we desire to proceed the whole journey to Communism, in which there is complete regulation of everything&mdash;the sources of supply, prices, operating activities, and the work in which we engage. Unless we move in that direction, which would be a logical extension of this kind of control, I think we had better say that the quickest way out of it&mdash;and I think in this case over-simplication is valuable&mdash;is to decide that no regulation of any kind be permitted except that undertaken by the State to protect the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> My experience in over 40 years of business is that any kind of canalising of supplies is bad in the ultimate and it makes the consumer pay more.  Deputy Dockrell referred to the kind of trading which has always been known as cut-price trading.  It is particularly bad in my trade, but I am willing to admit that, although the cut-price institutions&mdash;and some of them have gone beyond the stage of being the back-room place, ill-dressed and with ill-paid employees&mdash;have grown into bigger businesses, the very existence of these places does have a controlling effect on the general price level.  I would be a hypocrite if I did not state that.  I have had price cutters operating beside my own premises.  Sometimes they went out of business rapidly, and some of them grew into very big businesses, but they started off by selling goods which were referred to last week as loss leaders&mdash;selling a tin of salmon, for instance, practically at cost price.  It did mean that we eventually had to reduce the price of tinned salmon to the public, and the public got cheaper tinned salmon.  I think the principle of free enterprise is fully justified in that case.</P>
    <P>Competitive business is always a very finely balanced thing.  There are no rules about it.  That kind of balance, that stress and flow of competition, that occasional loss and occasional good profit, is the essence of trading. Deputy Allen knows well that, if he goes to a fair and there are very few men with produce to sell while there are a number of buyers he will probably get a good price for his beast.  On the other hand if there are a number of sellers, the buyers will do well.  It begins and ends in that kind of picture. People who would try to upset that fine balance of trading, that continual stress that should take place under a free capitalist system of society, will in the first place injure some of their competitors but they will undoubtedly prevent the entry of fresh competition and will injure the consumers, and the consumer is the community.  We have only to look across the water and we can realise how worried is the great community on the other side of the Irish Sea about this particular problem. <Col N="192" /> They feel that the consumer is being injured by the development of this kind of thing by businessmen. The consumer is the community and this House must protect the community. I think this Bill seeks to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, this Bill has received the same kind of reception as its predecessor&mdash;the Bill dealing with the radio trade&mdash;and I think it may be taken that, generally speaking, here again the House faced with the problem of deciding what it should do in regard to this difficult problem, has come down very definitely on the side of protecting the community.  That is all to the good and I think the previous manifestations of the House's views in that respect should induce those who are still engaged in restrictive practices to mend their ways, with the aid of the Fair Trade Commission, so that it will not be necessary for the House to go through a whole collection of legislation dealing with a whole variety of trades because, if the House has indicated clearly its views, that ought not to be necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers raised some questions arising out of this report and asked a number of questions, some of which would require access, which I have not got, to the transcript of the evidence of the Fair Trade Commission. The Act itself provides that the commission shall be established to do a particular task.  The commission was set up under statute.  It was charged in the statute with bringing in a report and this is the report which it has presented. Deputy Childers has as much information in this matter as I have and he and I must try to apply whatever intelligence we have to ascertaining whether the report, as we have received it, justifies the course of action which the commission recommends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that this matter has been fully examined by the Fair Trade Commission.  On page five of the report it is stated that public sittings were held on 27 days in the period between 7th December, 1953, and 18th May, 1954.  So that nobody can say that the hearings were not fully advertised and an adequate opportunity given to the persons interested to present <Col N="193" /> their evidence.  It is stated also on the same page that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Evidence was taken from 132 witnesses and all witnesses were examined on oath.  A list of the witnesses is given in Appendix A.  They included manufacturers, merchants and agents, builders, building contractors, architects, quantity surveyors, officers of certain local authorities, officers of the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Allied Employers of Ireland and of the Federated Union of Employers and officers and members of the following associations connected with the supply and distribution of building materials and components.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is set out a formidable list of the people who were concerned with the supply and distribution of these materials and component parts, totalling 16 in all.  It is also indicated on the following page, if that were not sufficient, that counsel and solicitors appeared on behalf of a number of the witnesses and the Federated Union of Employers appeared on behalf of all the associations mentioned in the preceding list with the exception of three which are specially marked.</P>
    <P>So that, so far as the Fair Trade Commission was concerned, everybody had abundant opportunity of putting forward the case.  Not merely were officers of the various associations heard, but solicitors and counsel and other experts were brought in to make sure that the viewpoint of those affected by the inquiry was fully heard by the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>Having heard all these views, the commission presented this report.  The commission consists of three persons who have no association with this trade and are in the position of being absolutely neutral in their objective approach to this problem.  As a result of their deliberations and anxious consideration of the evidence, we have this report.  The report recommends that in the public interest this Order which I have made should be made so as to ensure that the public will be adequately protected.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Dockrell has left the House because, listening to him <Col N="194" /> this evening, I rather got the impression that the world is indebted to price rings for avoiding many catastrophes. I am sure that will be news to humanity.  Deputy Dockrell told us this evening that the facility of getting a small number of people together, concentrating all the business in their hands, who select to whom they like to supply goods, fix their own profit margins and generally establish a closed shop to a highly intensive degree, has saved a lot of people a lot of headaches and saved them going into a whole lot of little accountancy details with which they should not be annoyed.  He did not say in whose interests all that was being done.  Let us see what the commission says about it.</P>
    <P>On page 30, paragraph 45, the commission say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is obvious that any body of merchants, in fixing gross profit margins, will primarily consult their own interests, and since merchants stand to profit from transactions with the public, their interests need not necessarily coincide with the public interest.  The more comprehensive the association the greater the risk of excessive margins being fixed. Effectively the only limiting factor in the fixing of margins by combinations of merchants is the fear that a very high margin may lead to price competition, particularly if there are important merchants outside the association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listen to this carefully:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The minutes of the meetings of a number of associations contain statements at different times by members that the prices or margins were too high.  In the case, for instance, of one very important commodity, a merchant with wide experience in the trade concerned is recorded as having strongly expressed the opinion at one stage that the price of the material had been fixed at too high a level and should be reduced. His view was not accepted by the association.  Another merchants is recorded as having stated in connection with the same material and with reference to a quotation to a local authority that &lsquo;on recent occasions <Col N="195" /> he had observed that it appeared to be the practice to price such inquiries as high as possible&rsquo;.  The magnitude of the trade is such that even a small excess in the fixed margin over the average realised margin that would emerge in conditions of competition would amount in itself to a very substantial sum over a period of a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have the minutes of an association revealing that some of the members, who are organised in that association to fix these margins, were suffering from such introspection about the margins they were taking that a number of them expressed the view that the margins were pitched too high and should be reduced.  Is it not obvious to anybody who has the most cursory acquaintance with price rings, that the whole purpose of these associations and rings is to keep them as small as possible, to fix the highest margins they can get from the public and generally to take all necessary steps to protect themselves, even if the protection of themselves involves doing serious disservice to the community?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell gave the impression that if anything interfered with this price fixing and these price rings, serious damage would be done to the whole trade and that, in fact, they might not be able to provide for those whom they employ some of the amenities which he says some of them now provide for their employees.</P>
    <P>At Appendix B on page 143 of the report, one finds a table under the heading: &ldquo;Particulars of turnover and employment of 81 establishments classified under the heading of Builders' Merchants and Providers in the Census of Distribution, 1951.&rdquo;  Particulars are set out there of the sales and it is shown that in this particular group of shops, numbering 81, the sales were £13.3 million; gross trading margin as a percentage of sales was 17.6.  That is not doing badly&mdash;17.6 margin over a range of 81 shops covering £13.3 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Gross trading margin. The net profit is not stated there. When that is tied up with the protestations of two members of this association that certain prices were far too high, one gets a relationship there which is at least understandable even if it is not altogether explicable.  The commission's report in paragraph 45, the evidence in Appendix B and the general experience of the House will convince it that the case for the abolition of these price rings has been more than made.</P>
      <P>What I find difficulty in understanding is that persons should try to make a case for this resale price maintenance. In circumstances where a person buys goods, has paid for the goods, which come completely under his ownership, somebody else, who has nothing to do with the goods, who does not own the goods, purports to tell him that if he does not sell at the price fixed by the non-owner he will get no more goods.  Take an example. Take any type of building material you like, which is ordered by a small merchant, either from a manufacturer or from a supplier.  The merchant orders the goods; he has got them on his premises; he has paid for them; his ownership of these goods is absolutely undisputed, but either the supplier who has been paid and who has no title to the goods, or the manufacturer, through the operation of these price rings, purports to say to him: &ldquo;You must not sell these goods, unless at prices we prescribe.&rdquo;  The retailer owns the goods, but he would not be allowed, under the conditions governing the supply of these goods, to sell them even to a relation at less than the fixed price.  Either the manufacturer who has been paid for the goods, or the merchant who has been paid for them, claims to have the right, under this system of rings, organisations and associations, to prescribe the selling price of an article in which he then has no interest whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can anybody attempt to defend that &mdash;to defend the right of somebody who has no ownership of the goods to fix the price at which these goods must be sold and prescribe the penalty for not doing so, so that the trader will be put <Col N="197" /> out of business, because he will not get any more goods to sell, unless he complies with the edict of the man who has no title to the goods?  Deputy Dockrell did not apply himself to an examination of the morality of that proceeding. I certainly hope that we will hear somebody trying to defend it because opposition to a Bill of this kind involves defence of a principle&mdash;if you could regard it as a principle at all&mdash; of that nature.  The view of the commission and the view of this House is that when a person owns goods, a trader of this kind, he should be allowed to prescribe the selling price of the goods.  That is in the public interest, and that, I think, is the principle for which this House wants to stand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers has raised a number of matters largely of an interrogatory character, some of which, I think, are quite outside the scope of the inquiry and my functions.  The Deputy asked if I had considered the question of restrictions by workers.  My predecessor took the view that whatever restrictions may exist could not be effectively dealt with in a Bill of this kind, that whatever the remedy is it must be found outside the scope of a measure of this kind and that it would be far better to hope that whatever problem exists there would be examined and solved by those who are concerned with the organisation of workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, I have no function in the matter of the effect of this price fixation of building costs on building methods, but certainly the builders' suppliers have no function either, and I have no knowledge that they have ever exerted any function in regard to finding any new techniques. I think Deputy Dockrell&mdash;and certainly Deputy Childers from another angle&mdash; raised the question of those new techniques, but I am sure it will be agreed that it would be an extraordinary thing to allow excess profits to continue, in the hope that they would be used to finance research into new techniques. If that is the only argument for price rings, it is the poorest one I ever heard.  In fact, it is normally the manufacturer of articles who is interested <Col N="198" /> in investigating the market and settling the distribution of new techniques, and I do not think there is any justification for permitting the continuance of price rings in the erroneous belief that the merchant who is part of the price ring has ever devoted much time to an examination of new techniques dealing with problems concerning the trade to which he is selling goods.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers raised the question of timber.  I think he fears that this Order would prohibit collective purchasing of timber.  That is not so. Those who want to purchase timber collectively are not prohibited from doing so, but they are prohibited from collectively fixing selling prices, or collectively conspiring to keep out new merchants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell raised the question of prices and all the work that these associations were performing in the field of price regulation and so on, but the Deputy did not once ask himself why is all that done.  I think there is only one answer to that and that is that these associations undertake to do it for their own substantial reward and are anxious that these arrangements should be made in respect of prices, because, if there was no regulation of prices, they saw the possibility of running entirely into price cutting and a situation which would give them profits which would not have yielded the 17 per cent. gross margin on sales which is set out in Appendix B on page 143 of the report.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers, I think, raised the question of the position in relation to the granting of credit.  This Order cannot require additional credit to be given to any trader.  The supplier of the goods is entitled to fix his own credit terms.  The receiver of the goods cannot fix the credit terms and the supplier of the goods is entitled to fix them.  He is obliged, of course, to be generally reasonable and equitable, as between one person and another, but he cannot be asked to take on dud customers or keep people on who will not pay their accounts.  He is entitled to fix whatever he thinks stands the test of reasonableness in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers referred to the position of Cement, Limited, but that does <Col N="199" /> not arise under this Order at all.  The commission merely exhorted Cement, Limited, to change their arrangement so as to allow in new merchants who could make the grade.  The Order makes no provision about this, but, if Deputies will look at Chapter 20 of the report, they will see that Cement, Limited, are under notice that, if and when they file their terms of sale under Article 11 of the Order, the commission will presumably take the view which they take in Chapter 20.  That is the only extent to which this report deals with the position of Cement, Limited.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this Order will in any way increase prices of distribution of commodities merely by allowing more people to distribute them.  The present scheme of distribution was one designed to allow the minimum number of people to distribute and to keep out everybody else as far as possible, to fix the highest possible margin of profit&mdash;profit margins which drew from two merchants of the association as recorded in the minutes of their meetings a protest that these margins were too high.  I think a wider distribution of articles, abandonment of resale price maintenance, fixation of fair rules of trading and a getting-away from the philosophy and mentality which has produced these price rings must, in the long run, give us freer and fairer competition. If I have to make a choice between free competition and fair competition as against a price ring fixing prices, then, in the public interest, I must come down on the side of free competition and fair competition. I am glad to see that the views of all Parties in the House, as expressed on this Bill and its predecessor, have been on the side of free competition, fair competition, and a fair deal for all and that approach has been designed from the standpoint of protecting the community.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>(5) The board may require the club to contribute towards the general expenses of the board to assist it in fulfilling its functions under this Act such proportion of the net revenue of the club as in the opinion of the board is reasonable.&mdash;(Deputy O'Malley.)</P>

      <P>When we moved to report progress last night, I think the Minister suggested we had not jumped many hurdles.  We might make some progress if the Minister gave way a little and agreed to leave this amendment to a free vote of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I met you substantially in respect of previous amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantially, I agree, but not to the extent we want.  I happen to know that there is a number of members of the House, other than those on this side of the House, who are in favour of this amendment, if it were left to a free vote of the House. If the Minister allowed a free vote on it, the amendment might have substantial support in the House.  I tried my utmost to reason from the Minister's point of view as to why he should object.  I can see no excuse whatsoever for his not accepting the amendment. Deputy Ó Briain last night made some reference to the finance subcommittee under Section 8 of the Schedule.</P>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that he read the last part of paragraph 107, page 44 of the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Greyhound Industry where it states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Indeed, representatives of the Irish Coursing Club stated that they were not satisfied with the performance of a number of their stewards, and asserted that the club was not in a position financially to offer the <Col N="201" /> higher salaries necessary to command the services of more reliable officials, or to employ them in sufficient numbers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We find ourselves unable to agree that the club could not have afforded the expense involved in the employment of extra stewards.  It is apparent from references to the finances of the club in the succeeding section that the club, plus its subsidiary companies, is in reality a wealthy organisation and that it could readily have afforded the necessary outlay on the employment of sufficient supervisory staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This paragraph was written after an inquiry, at a time when it was alleged and substantially agreed that the greyhound industry had fallen rapidly into a very bad state.  Nevertheless, side by side with that, the financial situation of the club had gone from strength to strength.  They could, according to this, have done certain things which might have made the rate of deterioration less rapid and they offered the excuse that they could not afford it.  The inquiry came to the conclusion that that explanation was not acceptable.  They could, in fact, have spent more money on the protection of the industry.</P>
    <P>I raise that as only an illustration. Here you have a club that has very substantial resources accumulated.  We are now establishing a board, a supreme authority, to bring the industry, and all those engaged in it, into a satisfactory and remunerative condition so far as the country is concerned. They will now have what they did not have before and what they claim they regretted they did not have. They will have a statutory position which will enable them substantially&mdash; I use the word again&mdash;to improve their income from fees, and so on.  What they will do with the accumulated funds and the additional accumulation of funds is beyond me, if they will not be asked to make some contribution.</P>
    <P>Formerly the Irish Coursing Club provided stewards.  Now the board will provide stewards, so that there will be a big drop in their financial commitments in respect of expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> Surely they ought to be asked to make a contribution to the board which will take that load off their backs.  I cannot see any reason for the Minister not accepting the proposition embodied in this amendment.  I cannot see any reasonable objection and neither can I see any reason at all in the Minister's approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister may feel we are making slow progress.  We are not making very much progress because we are unable to get a concentration of thought on the conflicting arguments and so come to some decision. What does the Minister want?  Here you had the club formerly supplying stewards.  I understood from another part of the inquiry that certain racetracks had to pay for their stewards. It is obvious from this that better stewards could have been made available, if the club had paid more money. I am glad Deputy Barry is here now. Perhaps he can correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything to extend the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would do one of two things, the discussion would immediately drop.  Is it unfair to ask that an amendment of this sort should be left to a free vote of the House? There is nothing of national or fundamental importance in it.  It is, of course, important to the greyhound industry and to the Irish Coursing Club.  I appeal to Deputy Barry to guide me, if I am wrong in this matter. I do not know whether the Deputy has in his possession a copy of the report of the advisory committee.  I drew attention to a certain statement in that report which I may not now repeat, but which says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going to repeat it anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall only make a reference.  Deputy Barry was not in the House earlier and I would draw his attention to the fact that we are discussing amendment No. 16 which seeks to allow the board to request a contribution to the board's funds from the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="203" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  It seeks to allow the board to &ldquo;require&rdquo; the club. Strike out the word &ldquo;require&rdquo;; insert &ldquo;request&rdquo;; and you can have the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately, a request may not be granted.  We want to see that, when the Irish Coursing Club have increased their swollen income, they should be asked, if the board needs additional help, to afford such help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that they should be asked, but that they should be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That the request should be enforceable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The club will be saving a lot of expenditure at present indulged in which will be transferred to the board.  Their income now will become a statutory obligation on those who are members; they will have the right to enforce fees in the same way as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can enforce the licensing of radio sets.  I believe there is nothing unreasonable in our proposal.  The board must have finances to carry out its obligations satisfactorily.  It has a certain number of sources which are estimated at various possible figures&mdash; some optimistic and some pessimistic. They will get an income from the public through the bookmakers&mdash;a charge on betting transactions.  That can fluctuate up or down.  The rapidity with which income can come in from that source will depend upon the general state of business in the community. If you have prosperity, you will have a bigger income; if you have hard times, the income is bound to suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will then be a percentage of the income from the totalisator.  Again there are various estimates of what that will amount to, but nobody can accurately assess what it will be.  While this is all going on, the board will have certain overheads to meet.  The board must have a full and efficient staff to deal with its commitments; it will have work to do, not only in connection with <Col N="204" /> the running of the totalisator in such centres as Dublin and Cork, but it will also have to provide stewards and facilities for the general overall control and examination of things.</P>
    <P>Another point of view which must be considered is that, notwithstanding the fact that under this Bill the board will have power to borrow, it would probably be more prudent to put them in the position where they would have to borrow as little as possible, because borrowing to-day is an expensive luxury.  We know all about it from our hospitals.  We know that where a hospital runs into a deficit, the luxury of having an overdraft costs them £600 a year.  In the Irish Coursing Club, you have assets estimated at £60,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not liquid assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Assets valued at £60,000, a certain amount of which is liquid.  They will also have income increased and expenditure decreased when this Bill comes into operation as an Act.  Is it unreasonable to ask that the board, which will operate a lot of its transactions for the benefit of the Irish Coursing Club, should be able to say to the club: &ldquo;Knowing that you now have so many thousands of pounds of excess revenue, we need from you a contribution towards our general overheads&rdquo;? Is there anything unreasonable in that?  The Minister can shorten the proceedings considerably by replying to that.  Perhaps the Minister would give us his arguments against this proposal.  We could then compare them, so to speak, with our own arguments. There are members on the other side of the House who are in agreement with the amendment and who should be allowed to express that opinion in a free vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are they?  They are not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they are gone to the dogs.  They certainly are not here at the moment.  The amendment does not ask for 10 per cent. of the club's profits.  It does not say the club shall pay a percentage of its excess income or profits.  I am asking the Minister to give us his clear, lucid explanation as to why the amendment <Col N="205" /> is not acceptable, or leave it to a free vote of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I explained as clearly and as lucidly as I could any objections I had, and I think these objections were cast into crystal-clear form by Deputy Finlay.  I want to reaffirm now that I do not propose to ask Dáil Éireann to give the board power to levy on the assets or income of the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Or profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the income or assets. I would direct the Deputy's attention and the attention of the House to the section which it is sought here to amend&mdash;Section 26.  It says in sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board may advise and assist the club in connection with any activities or measures conducive to the better implementation by the club of its constitution and rules, to the better discharge by the club of its functions or to the improvement and development of the greyhound industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) of the same section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the club to keep such books, accounts and records as may be approved of by the board and to furnish to the board such information in relation to the club's activities as the board may require.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided in this or another section that the board may contribute to the expenses of the club, if the club themselves may require it for the general improvement of the greyhound industry.  If the board thought that the club were piling up an excessive income through fees or any other charges which they were making on the greyhound breeding industry, the board are in a position to control the club and prevent them from doing that, but I have heard no argument made as to why the House should give the board the right to investigate the income or the assets of the Irish Coursing Club.  I do not propose to ask Dáil Éireann to give them that power.  You would really think from Deputy Briscoe that I was trying to <Col N="206" /> take away from the board a traditional right it had to plunder the Irish Coursing Club at its sweet will.  The fact is that all I am doing is resisting an attempt by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he put down the amendment&mdash;to create a new power in the board to corral the assets of the Irish Coursing Club.  I do not propose to do that.  I do not propose to ask the House to do it, and I propose to ask the House to vote against this amendment.</P>
      <P>Really I would urge on Deputies to recall to their minds that it did appear on the Second Reading of this Bill that we all had a common purpose in trying to improve the greyhound racing industry, and that this Bill, in principle, at any rate, was generally accepted as being directed to that end. Surely we are entitled to expect that the board and the club, inasmuch as four members of the board will be members of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club, will be working in friendly collaboration for the common end.  I am coerced by the attitude of Deputy Briscoe and Deputy MacEntee, and somewhat less of Deputy O'Malley, to the view that they are obsessed with the idea that any chance they can get of taking a swipe at the Irish Coursing Club, they are going to take it, and that this is one.  I notice a bland smile spreading over Deputy O'Malley's face.  I do not think he is quite as good as his colleagues at suppressing his more secret thoughts, but I cannot divorce from my mind entirely the belief that this is simply another effort by Deputies on the other side to take another swipe at the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is rational for Deputy Briscoe to stand up more in sorrow than in anger and to say that he deplores the slow progress of this Bill, but that, if the Minister would prove more accommodating, the Bill would travel faster.  I agree that if the Minister would let Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Briscoe walk up and down on the Irish Coursing Club and then jump on it, and plunder it, and wreck it, I have no doubt the Bill would pass <Col N="207" /> through the House like greased lightning; but I have not the slightest intention of allowing Deputy Briscoe or Deputy MacEntee to do so, or to co-operate with them in any way in that direction.  I should like to think that I have the solid support of the Deputy from North Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in resistance to that desire to defame, plunder and generally eviscerate the Irish Coursing Club. I want to see substantial justice done to all and, God knows, other Deputies in the House should lend a hand in achieving that desirable end, so that we could make useful progress in the consideration of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is reading into the words that have been recorded and interpreting the words that have been spoken to bring about an attitude of mind in other people which is most dastardly and unfair.  I challenge anybody who reads what I have said on this amendment to find any evidence whatsoever that we want to confiscate, that we want to plunder.  Those are the words the Minister has introduced as his interpretation of what I said on this amendment&mdash;that we want to corral, we want to coerce, we are obsessed with the idea that we must swipe the Irish Coursing Club, trample it underfoot out of existence, that Deputy MacEntee and I are so clever, as distinct from my innocent colleague here, who, I am sure, feels the very same as we do about it, speaking quite frankly and openly as we are, that we have been able to develop in ourselves a magnificent ability to suppress our most secret thoughts, that we are out to wreck the Irish Coursing Club, to defame and eviscerate it.  It is nothing of the kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister is expressing that type of language.  When we say that those people should be made to pay their fair share as a contribution, if it is necessary, towards the management of the national greyhound industry, the Minister says it is plunder, confiscation, wrecking, eviscerating. I wonder did the Minister ever see anything eviscerated.  Did he ever see the operation?  It is easy to use those words, but one must understand what they mean.  Did he mean that we will do it while they are alive?</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister would be delighted if he could bring in a motion to have the closure to this now, because every word uttered on every section and amendment is a great offence to him; but those of us here feel that we must make every effort we can to protect the just interests of all persons concerned. I said before, and I make the offer again, why not leave this to a free vote?  Is the Minister afraid that the exposure would be such that it would be carried by the majority of members of this House, and does he think, with that knowledge in his mind, that it is fair to steamroll this section through, without this amendment?</P>
      <P>I took great care to be quiet and reasoned in my arguments.  The only impression I could make on the Minister was to draw from him all those horrible nightmares to which he gave expression and which had got into his head as a result of my mild language. If I had been angry and if I had used some of those words, if I had said: &ldquo;This is an amendment deliberately designed to plunder these people, to confiscate what they have, an amendment deliberately designed to corral them, an amendment deliberately designed to swipe them as I suppose the plagues swiped the Egyptians&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>All we ask is that the board &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;they may not, if they do not need it, but if they do need it, they have a right to enforce it.  We shall probably agree on a figure for the levy to the public.  We shall probably agree on what the maximum charges will be to bookmakers going in to do their business.  We shall probably have to agree on the maximum charge on the totalisator.  The Minister must not be obsessed with the idea and must not go home night after night while this Bill is before the House afraid to go asleep for fear we shall think out some new horrible dose of medicine to embarrass further the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned about the personnel of the Irish Coursing Club.  I know very little about it.  I met the secretary of the organisation only quite recently when he came on a deputation to see a couple of our people.  I do not know the man.  He has never done me any harm.  I do not do business with him.  I am only interested in the overall position.  If you want this Bill to be a success, you must have regard for the opinions of others.  All the wisdom in the State is not locked up in the secret archives of the Department of Agriculture, with the key in the Minister's pocket.  There is a certain amount of wisdom over here, too.  I appeal to the Minister to forget all these swashbuckling words and to bear in mind that when a fellow raises his hand to salute a person, he is not raising his hand to strike that person. That is the Minister's attitude.  If he sees somebody raising his hand to salute him, he immediately defends himself as if the fellow were going to strike him.  The Minister should get rid of that outlook.</P>

      <P>I heard only the tail-end of the Minister's reply, and I have listened to what Deputy Briscoe had to say.  I am beginning to wonder if Deputy Briscoe appreciates the meaning of Section 26 at all.  I am beginning to wonder if he appreciates that, in the main, the functions set out in Section 26 would be comparable with <Col N="211" /> the three functions more or less exercised in racing by the stewards of the Turf Club, the stewards of the National Hunt Club and the Keeper of the Match-Book.</P>

      <P>Let us face reality. I am not going to be associated with swashbuckling expressions of threatened annihilation or anything else.  Let us take the question on its merits.  For a moment, leave out the extraneous argument which has to be resolved with regard to the question of ultimate control within the club itself.  However, take the club as an entity, performing the functions set out in Section 26.  I do not think the amendment set out by Deputy Briscoe would achieve any purpose other than the complete stultification of the efforts these people may be able to make to develop the industry. Deputy Briscoe may have a perfectly reasonable argument on the questions of the constitution and personnel of the club.  But, if it is going to keep various types of records, if it is going to be <Col N="212" /> responsible to the board for much of the administration and record detail of the greyhound industry generally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll, I do not think she understands the distribution of prize stakes and contributions made in prize stakes from the Racing Board towards the general set-up.  I presume this section is really designed to try to make the same pattern effective within the greyhound industry.  There is no reason why we should contemplate it as being anything else.  It would be very fortunate if the fees and all that are collected under the Schedule would defray what the administrative costs of this scheme will be within the club itself.  I can see that, far from their being able to make a contribution, they will ultimately be looking to the board for a subsidy to keep them going.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any reason for heat on any side in this matter.  In the present successful operation of the Racing Board, you have a substantial contribution through the registry to the various prize funds throughout the country.  It may well be that, again, through the pattern of Section 26, the coursing club will be able to discharge certain types of carriage fees for dogs to meetings as the Racing Board carries transport costs of horses to race meetings.  It may well be that, as this pattern develops, that will be the design that will take shape.  In that possibility, I say quite seriously to Deputy Briscoe that the amendment proposed by him would be defeating what might be a reasonable opportunity of success for this body.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll interjected to say there is no analogy between the functions the Irish Coursing Club will have to perform and the combined functions performed by the different sections of the stewards, whether they be Turf Club or National Hunt, and the Registrar and Keeper of the Match-Book.</P>

    <Title>Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill 1956&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill, which is a short one, similar to those introduced for each of the last ten years, proposes that the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, which is due to expire on 31st March shall be extended for another year.</P>
      <P>In introducing a similar Bill last year, I referred to the formidable legislative programme to be undertaken before the Supplies and Services Act could be allowed to lapse and indicated that an extension of the Act would be necessary if it was not found possible to complete this programme within the year during which the life of the Act was then extended.  Despite very considerable progress the year intervening since the 1955 Act has not been sufficient to permit the introduction of all the necessary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1946 enables the Government and Ministers to make Orders for the control of essential supplies including control of prices, control of imports and exports, reduction or suspension of customs duties and various other matters.  As I assured the House last year, and now repeat, it remains my desire and the desire of the Government to dispense with this temporary legislation as soon as possible and to provide by permanent legislation for such powers <Col N="214" /> conferred by the Act of 1946 as it is essential to retain in the public interest.</P>
    <P>So far as my own Department is concerned such alternative legislation has already been enacted for the control of export by the Control of Exports Act, 1955, and for transport matters by the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1955.  The powers exercised to control the importation and wholesale distribution of tea are provided for in the Tea (Importation and Distribution) Bill, 1955, at present before the House.  Matters still remaining to be dealt with are the control of prices, the control of subsidised flour and the suspension or amendment of customs duties.  While it has not been possible as yet to introduce Bills covering these controls the progress towards that end has been as rapid as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards other Departments, many of the controls formerly exercised under the Supplies and Services Act are now operated under powers conferred by recent enactments.  I referred last year to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, and the Exchange Control Act, 1954.  In the meantime the Agricultural Produce (Meat) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1954, the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act, 1955, the Seed Production Act, 1955, and the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1955, provide permanent legislation for various controls for which the Minister for Agriculture is responsible.  The Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) (Amendment) Bill, 1955, is before the House and two other Bills dealing with the controls which he also proposes to retain over milk and dairies, and pigs and bacon will be introduced at an early date.  The Minister for Social Welfare will shortly sponsor a Bill to continue certain social services (the cheap fuel scheme, cooked meals scheme and public assistance footwear scheme) at present operated under the Supplies and Services Act and the Minister for Local Government has a new Bill under consideration to amend the Road Traffic Act which will provide for the maintenance of such controls, at present exercised under the Supplies and Services <Col N="215" /> Act, as are considered necessary to retain.</P>
    <P>In all seven Bills have already been enacted, and two further Bills are before the House.  Some nine Bills will require to be enacted before the Supplies and Services Act can be permitted to lapse.  The matters still remaining to be dealt with require very careful consideration and the controls pertaining to them operated at present under the Supplies and Services Act must be retained until alternative legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>The control of prices, in particular, is a matter to which I have given the most careful consideration.  On the outbreak of war in 1939, it became obvious at once that the price control arrangements provided for in the Control of Prices Act, 1937, would be totally inadequate to meet the emergency conditions then prevailing.  That Act, which with an amending Act of 1938, represents our only permanent legislation dealing with general price control, was, therefore, immediately superseded by the emergency powers legislation which has constituted the statutory basis for our price control arrangements right up to the present time.  Although not repealed, the 1937 Control of Prices Act was left in abeyance and is now moribund.  I am satisfied that it would be neither practicable nor desirable to attempt to revive the 1937 Act and that it would be preferable to make an entirely new approach to the problem of permanent price control legislation.</P>
    <P>Out of the experience of the operation of the emergency price control arrangements, there has emerged a certain pattern of procedure which could possibly form the basis of permanent legislation.  There can be no doubt but that the flexibility of the existing arrangements has proved advantageous in dealing with the wide variety of price problems which have arisen&mdash;particularly over the past 12 months.  To mention but a few, investigations have been undertaken in relation to the prices of bread, coal, gas, cigarettes, intoxicating liquor, fertilisers, and motor car insurance. The public has become familiar with <Col N="216" /> the procedure of public inquiry and representative groups are now more ready to appear and support by direct evidence their views in relation to price increase proposals which may be under investigation.</P>
    <P>Whilst certain criticisms have undoubtedly, and perhaps unjustly, been levelled at the Prices Advisory Body, I think it will be agreed that the body represents for the community generally its best assurance against unscrupulous price exploitation in the difficult situation in which, in common with many other countries, we now find ourselves. It would be a relatively straightforward matter to devise permanent legislation to provide only for the methods of price control in force to-day, but I am not satisfied that that would represent the most desirable solution to this difficult problem.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements were primarily designed to meet the problems arising from emergency conditions and the fact that they are so readily adaptable to the circumstances of to-day merely reflects the near-emergency situation through which we are now passing.  It is not so certain, however, that the present arrangements would represent the ideal approach to the problem if we returned&mdash;as I hope we may soon return&mdash;to a more tranquil economic situation in which wide fluctuations in the prices of essential commodities would be very much the exception.</P>
    <P>Above all else, it is, in my view, essential to ensure that the public will have the fullest confidence in the methods adopted to control and stabilise prices.  Any disturbance of that confidence could well defeat the whole purpose of price control arrangements. It is for this reason that I feel a considerable reluctance, at this particular point of time, to substitute for the now familiar arrangements, new and untried arrangements.  It would be most unfortunate if any new price control arrangements became, at the outset, associated in the public mind with the rising costs inseparable from a general inflationary situation and the harmful economic consequences which inevitably follow, or became discredited through inability to hold prices <Col N="217" /> stable in circumstances, like those at present prevailing, in which increasing costs stem primarily from external factors which it is beyond the capacity of any authority here to control.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I feel that it would be wholly unjustifiable for me to attempt to introduce permanent comprehensive price control legislation at this stage.  I consider this question of timing to be one of some importance. If a suitable economic climate for the introduction of such legislation should not develop before the expiry of the Supplies and Services Act, then I shall have to consider the expedient of introducing a temporary measure designed to maintain the existing price control arrangements in operation until a more appropriate opportunity offers to deal with the problem in a fully comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>The House may be assured that the legislative programme necessary before the Supplies and Services Act can be allowed to lapse is proceeding as rapidly as possible.  The continuance of the Act is still necessary to retain vital controls pending the completion of the programme and I am, therefore, asking the House to continue the Act in force for a further period to 31st March, 1957.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate on this Bill last year, the Minister said that permanent legislation was under investigation and he has repeated the statement again this year. He has made the excuse that there are some special conditions prevailing this year which would make any new permanent price control legislation unpopular or unacceptable to the country. I should like to ask the Minister whether there has been any year since the war in which any kind of new price legislation was liable to be accepted by the public, unless the Minister clarified for the public, once and for all, the extent to which a Government can control prices when there is competition, except in the case where prices can be artificially raised either by monopolies or through the kind of control of prices <Col N="218" /> which has been the subject of two Orders under the new Restrictive Trade Practices Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister's excuse for deferring the making of new price legislation is simply that he has not properly considered the matter.  He has never faced the lessons that have been learned since the war.  He has not faced the fact that ever since 1947 we have engaged in sordid discussion on the cost of living, that it has been the subject of three general elections, that it has prevented the public of this country from considering the far more fundamental issue of productivity.  It has prevented a great deal of sound thinking about greater investment and more productivity, and it has brought the public mind to a state of cynicism which is bad for the nation and which certainly, I must admit, would make it difficult for the present Minister to bring in legislation which would be considered effective by the public at large.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows there has been an inflationary situation.  There was an inflationary situation after the outbreak of the Korean war which lasted for two years.  The same situation occurred then but the attitude of the Minister at that time, when he was in Opposition, was entirely different from what it is now.  The fact remains that there is no clause in the Constitution which, in reality, permits the continuation of emergency legislation of this kind.  If we are to have faith in our Constitution, if we are to observe its import, if the people are to respect the Constitution, we cannot go on prolonging year after year emergency legislation which was meant to be based on conditions of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, Ministers dislike relinquishing their powers.  Naturally, they dislike the idea of setting up new legislation which, if it is to have any value, should in many respects remove the Minister from the immediate examination of many of the matters involved in this Bill because hardly anyone can deny that, if there is to be permanent price legislation, it should be performed by some kind of commission, some kind of body, which, while having to report to the Minister and leaving the Minister in many instances <Col N="219" /> special powers, will, nevertheless, take away from the Minister a good many of the powers which he enjoys to-day. In fact, this is a case where, as is so well known in political life, inertia breeds inertia.  Ministers and officers of State fear to make alterations. They are afraid that, if they promote any new price control legislation, the only result may be that they will be criticised by the public.  Because of that, they continue in a tradition that has gone on in this country since the war, trying to create more powers than they intend to exercise and than can, in fact, be secured through any legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>The whole of this price control discussion has bred in this country not only a contempt for Government but an entirely contradictory sense of dependence upon Government.  The public have learned to depend on the Government and at the same time to condemn it when it is unable to carry out acts which should be to its advantage. It is a dilemma from which we will have to escape.  It was referred to on a number of occasions by the American experts, who came here and prepared the Ibex Report, that this country has never made up its mind since the war whether it wishes to be an entirely socialist economy or a private enterprise economy.  The Minister, in not introducing new legislation and grasping this nettle firmly, is simply going to promote the loose thought, loose thinking and loose action, which have characterised the whole of our discussions on price levels since the war.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of general elections in this country in which, on this side of the House, we were faced with appeals to the lowest sentiments of our people.  Elections have been reduced to the level of trying to persuade people to vote for the man who will bring down the price of bread and bring down the price of stout.  The whole of the controversy in regard to productivity and increasing investment, has been side-tracked by this dispute. We have had an utterly false idea spread among the community as to the extent to which the Government can <Col N="220" /> control prices in peace time.  The conception of profits, for example, is considered by a very large group of the community in an entirely false light. Profits that are high are automatically bad; profits that are high automatically are an act of hostility against the consumer; whereas in fact, as we well know, some of the cheapest products in this country are sold by companies whose profits are enormous.  The whole conception of profits is something which includes the capacity to reinvest money in new machinery, new capital investment.  We never yet had an opportunity of considering it because of this prolonged dispute, in which the Party on this side of the House is being accused continuously of being responsible for the rise in price levels which has taken place in this and every other country of northern Europe at the same rate since 1948.</P>
    <P>Equally, the public mind is being deterred from the more fundamental problem of increased output per worker and output per unit of capital investment. The war brought a flow of new inventions to the world of which we have not yet taken sufficient advantage. Changes have taken place since the war in our relations with our nearest neighbour, Great Britain. There is envisaged a full employment economy with an ever-increasing rise in wages: a section of the workers enjoying a far higher share of the country's national wealth.  We have been placed in the position that many of our standards have perforce to be related to those of Great Britain and automatic increases in wages take place here, although in fact the productivity of the country has not increased sufficiently to meet them.  All of those changes have taken place but again the public mind is being deterred by this sordid dispute from considering them and from making legislation which would have the effect of assisting the whole community to take part in a great productivity drive.</P>
    <P>Emigration since 1947 has become so considerable as to be an automatic control on the economic activity of this country.  If prices rise people can leave, leaving smaller incomes for each family.  The rate of emigration has <Col N="221" /> become the most serious economic factor at present operating in connection with our whole economic activity.</P>
    <P>Going back to the history of this legislation, in 1947 there was a sharp rise of 10 per cent. in the cost of living. At that time we were accused by the Opposition of not making use of the very powers which are now recommended by the Minister for continuation in the Bill.  When the Opposition got into power at that time, they were not able to find any profiteers; they were not able to prosecute any profiteers; they were not able to reduce the cost to the community, taking it large and wide.  The proof was evident that the legislation then in operation could not prevent increases in prices that were occurring because there was the small inflation that takes place at the end of a war when money flows into circulation more quickly than goods.  Fianna Fáil at that time produced a Bill.  It was condemned by some Deputies in the Opposition as being defective and by others as grossly interfering with the activities of private companies.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, which has so praised and has accepted the Restrictive Practices Bill, at that time were criticising us for introducing a Bill in which the powers were even less than they were in the recent enactment which has now been accepted by all sides of the House.  The Labour Party at no time has shown itself satisfied with the present price control arrangements. Deputy Larkin on a number of occasions said he was not satisfied with the price control machinery, that it should be scrapped and that it had not got the confidence of the public. Deputy Larkin, on a number of occasions, demanded a rigid and immediate revision of tariff levels and suggested that excessive profits were being made under the tariff umbrella.  On a number of occasions he also said that the public had lost confidence in the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body is in a most unfortunate position.  It has been constantly examining the prices of commodities and sanctioning rises and it has become known to the public as a body which is a kind of subsidiary <Col N="222" /> sanctioning body for increasing prices, a kind of cushion between the Minister and the public.  While I think the members of the board are honest and hard working in their activities, no one believes that that body can effectively control prices when they rise as a result of increases in wages or increases in the cost of the raw materials or increases in the cost of commodities produced by our farmers or the farmers of other countries.  Every effort made by the present Government to try and pretend they were carring out their promises to reduce the cost of living has eventually proved ineffective.</P>
    <P>There is no need to go into the whole question of the action taken in connection with tea prices.  We know the result has been that the public are now paying whatever sum is required for the bank interest on the money borrowed to keep the price of tea down. The only reason why the price of tea did keep down was that reserve stocks purchased directly from India were available to the community for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>We can well understand why the Minister hesitates to introduce price control legislation because, of recent months, since the steady rise in the cost of living, it is quite evident that Ministers of the present Government are not agreed in regard to the price situation and show open disagreement. Their speeches in public reveal the deep cleft between the Fine Gael group of Ministers and the Labour group of Ministers.  The Labour Party promised the sun, the moon and the stars in the last election in the direction of lower prices, lower food costs, reduced taxation, and so forth.  There is no need at this stage to repeat in detail all that they promised in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>Wages have risen.  There have been two rounds of wage increases of recent months and the Labour Ministers go around the country and state specifically that they have redeemed their promises through the increases of wages that have been effected and that the workers need not complain, that so long as wages have gone up to meet the cost of living, so long as they may have gone up in certain instances more than is required to meet the increase <Col N="223" /> in the cost of living, the promises made by the Ministers of the Labour Party in the Coalition Government have been fully redeemed and all is well.  But the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach move through the country and, when addressing chambers of commerce or groups of businessmen, or on the more important occasions, warn the public that the increases of salaries and wages are largely illusory, the only effect of which will be a further increase in costs of production, a further increase in the cost of Government and a further increase in prices.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note that the Taoiseach actually used the word &ldquo;illusory&rdquo;, and said that salary and wage increases are largely illusory in so far as they can ultimately affect the cost of living and the position of the consumer.  So you have, one week after the Civil Service pension award, the Minister for Finance warning the public that all these increases in earnings, all these increases in salaries and wages, unless they are accompanied by increased production, are entirely ineffective and, at the same time, you have Labour Ministers going around the country, trying to account to trade unions for their failure to redeem their promises by claiming that all is well now that wages have gone up.</P>
    <P>In fact, there is no leadership demonstrated in this present crisis through which we are passing.  Some Ministers say there is a problem and not a crisis.  Other Ministers say that there is a problem, not a crisis, but the worst has yet to come.  They all refer to mounting difficulties and none of them can genuinely agree about what action should be taken and none of them can devise or promote any fundamental schemes for increasing productivity rapidly, which is the only real solution to our troubles.</P>
    <P>No prolonged and detailed conferences have taken place between the Government, the employers' federations and the trade unions over this problem of wages.  The problem of wage increases is complicated.  For certain classes of the community, wage <Col N="224" /> increases are inevitable, if the cost of living rises.  For other groups of workers, there have been anomalies in connection with the comparative wage rates now and in 1939.  A general examination of wage and profit levels, conducted on either a socialist or a conservative basis&mdash;we do not mind which it may be&mdash;in which the growth of productivity must have some relationship to the total earnings of the community, whether employers or workers, has never been undertaken by the present Government, in spite of the growing inflation that is taking place.</P>
    <P>The Government has made statements about the need for more savings. We have had a savings committee appointed.  We have seen no dramatic action taken by the Government, either through the interest rates on small savings in the Post Office, or Savings Certificates, or by any joint form of co-ordinatioen between employers, workers and the savings administration, to encourage more savings, to siphon off at least some of the increased earnings in savings, to enable the capital construction programme to go on.  We have merely heard very quiet pleas for greater savings.</P>
    <P>There has not even been established by the present Government an agreement on what the meaning of productivity is and even compared with Great Britain, where we read only of disputes between employers and trade unions of a dramatic kind, where there are sensational developments, the development of a steady concept of increased productivity of goods sold at lower cost to the public, enabling the public to buy more goods and so employ more people&mdash;the whole of the concept that has brought about the prosperity of Holland, Denmark, Great Britain and America&mdash;has never been fully accepted as a live thing in this country.  It has been merely accepted in a passive way and resisted by many groups.  Many trade unions and many groups of employers, equally, fearing that there would be no definite acceptance by both interests concerned, failed to pay attention to the need for increasing productivity.</P>
    <P>The whole of that discussion needs more publicity in this country.  We <Col N="225" /> have not yet accepted the very thing which has brought prosperity to other countries.  Workers are afraid of redundancy.  Employers feel that the level of taxation is too high to justify their making efforts at greater productivity, and so we have an increase in production in both industry and agriculture which is utterly inadequate to enable us to maintain the standard of living which we have in the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>History has shown that, although there are sometimes temporary redundancies in employment, in the long run, the principle of greater productivity pays, so long as the worker shares in the increased profits made. The trade union movement is sufficiently well organised to ensure that, if there are increased profits as a result of greater productivity, the workers will get their due share and the workers in turn, who enjoy greater wages as a result of higher productivity, can purchase more articles and so swell the total volume of employment. As I have said, we have never had any great concerted effort made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Part of the difficulties faced by the Government at the present time has been solved by our selling out our savings in order to maintain the consumption of goods and maintain our standard of living, selling out our savings in Great Britain, not for productive purposes, but for the purpose of maintaining a standard of living which we cannot afford, because production is not sufficiently high.  The Government claim that they are not responsible for the inflationary situation that has occurred.  Of course, we have to accept that much of the inflationary situation has taken place in Great Britain and in the sterling area at large but every day that passes without action being taken makes the Government more and more responsible for the loss of savings which should be used for productive purposes and which have been wasted and which will not be available for productive purposes in the future.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the economic experts that something like £500,000,000 is necessary for the complete <Col N="226" /> rehabilitation of the agricultural industry&mdash;an enormous sum requiring tremendous saving, tremendous effort and tremendous technical advances&mdash; and we have already spent £100,000,000 of savings in 1951 and 1954 largely for non-productive purposes.  We have had the position that the percentage of saving in this country as a percentage of the national resources has steadily decreased since 1953.</P>
    <P>In that year it was about 15 per cent. and I believe in 1955 the savings were only 10 per cent. of our resources and yet there is very little protest about it. In reality, it is as serious as though there were a major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country, but because of the futile controversy over the cost of living and the immediate price of this article and that article, there has been no chance for the public to appreciate the gravity of a reduction in savings developing in a country without one-tenth of the resources of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of saving is the foundation of our wealth.  The only way we can increase our productivity and invest new money is through our savings abroad and at home and when both start diminishing, that is not a problem&mdash;it is a crisis.  It is a crisis because it is a habit into which one can get and even though we could continue for two or three years on the same basis as last year, the longer the habit persists the more difficult the cure and the less the savings left for new capital investment.  There are two kinds of society in Europe to-day, the static society and the dynamic society and we have become so accustomed to easy and sentimental talk about our economy that we are almost alone among the northern European nations in not facing the realities of our position. I suppose Deputy Seán MacBride and Clann na Poblachta have more responsibility than anyone else for introducing the idea into this country at the end of the war that by some special Divine guidance we could increase production without special effort and sacrifice on the part of the community, without the arduous learning of new methods, without sacrifice or difficulty. That is neither a socialist nor conservative concept but simply the concept <Col N="227" /> resulting from the sentimental attitude in our national life which we have had as a result of the accusation made against this Party of having been responsible for increasing the cost of living.  An attempt was made to get everybody to believe that an increase in productivity would be easy for them so long as they voted for a particular Government.</P>
    <P>We may all have different views about investments.  Neither the conservatives nor the socialists disagreed on the fundamental facts of new investment.</P>
    <P>Ever since the war, both here and in every other country, in Norway, neutral Sweden and Denmark&mdash;which was relatively undevastated&mdash;whatever disagreements these parties had, they were united in one thing, that there was no easy course by which a nation could increase its production, and that it would require to rely upon the efforts of its own citizens, their sacrifices and the forgoing of pleasures if they were to achieve greater prosperity later on.  You will find very little comment of that kind in the speeches made by members of the different Government Parties in either by-elections or general election campaigns.  You will find that almost alone in northern Europe we have been accustomed to this foolish talk, a silly appeal to the people, telling them that so long as a particular Party was elected everything would be easy and that no great effort would be needed to enjoy a high standard of living and increased productivity.</P>
    <P>Again we have very considerable disagreement about this question of the balance of payments.  We have the Minister for Justice parading around Kerry telling the people that he is more interested in prosperity than bank balances.  No one quite knows what that means but I take it he wants to persuade the people of Kerry that bank balances abroad are held by rich bankers and have no concern with the poor people of Kerry.  Again this is gross deception practised on the people which has no reality.  Any bank balances we hold abroad are held on behalf of the Irish people, both rich and poor.  They are the balances which, in <Col N="228" /> the main, are essential for the import of commodities to maintain our standard of living.  That kind of talk is a typical example of what I mean; it is just slush talk with no significance in it.</P>
    <P>We then have the Taoiseach and when he speaks at an important banquet or on an important occasion he makes it absolutely clear that increases in wages and salaries have immediate results in increased imports, so making the balance of payments position all the more serious and so diverting savings we have abroad from the productive purposes to which they should be applied.  We will never get the Minister for Justice going around the country saying that all increases in wages and salaries merely have the effect of increasing imports and making the problem to be faced by the Government worse instead of better. You have a complete diversity of views in regard to this serious problem.</P>
    <P>We had recently in the course of the Kerry by-election the Minister for Defence saying that the country's total investments, private and public, abroad were in the region of £500,000,000.  He said we had lost under £50,000,000 in 1955 and then he gave some figures that bore no relation to the present economic position merely citing the increase in the value of cattle.  He gave a few other figures and he said what did it matter if we lost under £50,000,000 out of a total invested saving of £500,000,000 abroad. He was in disagreement with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, who quite clearly indicated that they regard the balance of payments position as serious.  They regard it as serious because, of course, they know the position.  The Minister for Defence only gives one side of the picture; he referred to the assets abroad and he did not refer to our liabilities which amount to&mdash;the last figure which was given, I think, was in 1950 when I think they were £250,000,000.  No figure has been calculated since.  But neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance has contradicted Deputy de Valera when in the course of a recent speech he said that the total gap between our assets abroad and our liabilities abroad was in the neighbourhood <Col N="229" /> of £100,000,000 and that we, therefore, could not afford to lose from £30,000,000 to £40,000,000 every single year.  Deputy de Valera's statement has not been contradicted.  In fact, that balance is very difficult to strike and it would not make very much difference if it was £100,000,000 or £150,000,000 or even £200,000,000 because once a diminution of our savings continues at that rate the policy to overcome that leakage and restore the position becomes progressively more difficult to implement.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to suppose that we are different from any other country, and when a leakage of that kind starts the longer it goes on the more difficult it is to repair.  Therefore, it is essential not to exaggerate and not to say we are on the edge of anything like financial collapse or loss in the value of our sterling, but what we do need is to ensure that the problem of stagnancy in production, stagnancy in the number of workers in the field and in the factory, stagnancy that has occurred for many years of our history and which is still with us and has not been solved is faced courageously.  We are solving our present problems by massive emigration and by a reduction in our savings, neither of which can be regarded as good policy nor as any good omen for the future.</P>
    <P>Some Ministers referred to the fact that we are facing the difficulties of the British people.  The British people have immense raw material resources and a great tradition of trade abroad with numerous countries.  Their difficulties are not the same as ours.  In a great many industries last year in Great Britain, the increase that took place in wages was more than met by increases in productivity.  Exports continued rising.  They had not the same position as here where imports had been rising and exports falling.  To some extent, because we have greater savings abroad, our position is not so immediately difficult as that of Great Britain.  Our resources are smaller but the thriftless habit can continue because we have the savings to spend.</P>
    <P>It has been said by some cynics that this country will never progress to the level of Denmark or Holland in its <Col N="230" /> agricultural production because those huge savings we have abroad will always act as a cushion in time of emergency but sooner or later we will have to face the issue if we want to end emigration, increase production, increase our standard of living and continue to afford our present standard of living.  At the moment we are rather like the head of a household who would come back with £5 and say to his wife: &ldquo;This is not £5 but £7 10s.  Spend the lot.&rdquo;  That is the economic condition of this country at the moment.  Quite obviously, we cannot continue indefinitely like that.  We faced an adverse balance of payments of £100 million in 1951 and 1954 taking the two years together.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to think what we could have done with that money; it is extraordinary to think of the millions of pounds that could have been devoted in the shape of subsidies for fertilisers.  We could have completely reorganised the entire pig and bacon curing industry of this country.  We could have given far greater undeveloped area grants for new industries. We could have engaged in a productivity drive in which the cost in relation to that total sum of £100,000,000 would seem negligible. We could even have afforded to give price support guarantees to farmers for agricultural products.  We could have employed a great part of that sum as a capital sum for that purpose so that whatever difficulties faced the farmer one would not be an uncertain price level over a period of years.</P>
    <P>I am aware that certain types of cattle prices are guaranteed by agreement with the British Government which prevents prices falling below a certain level.  It would appear that in many countries the farmers have enjoyed greater price support guarantees than we have enjoyed.  I mention that by way of illustrating how this £100,000,000 of savings which have been dissipated could have been used for productive purpose and with the object of increasing our productivity and enabling us to sell our greater productivity abroad in a satisfactory way.</P>
    <P>When I first started to speak I mentioned the fact that the time was long <Col N="231" /> overdue for new legislation to control prices.  In our view, when the Minister considers legislation, as he should do, he should try to consider the positive aspect of price control rather than the purely negative aspect of restraining increases in prices.  His legislation should have some relation to the 1947 Bill which was before the House when we left office and which now needs revision and complete re-shaping in the light of present circumstances.  That Bill had for its object measures designed to increase efficiency and either prevent prices going up, as much as they would otherwise have gone up in the time of inflation, or actually decrease prices when the economic conditions made that possible.</P>
    <P>For that purpose it would seem essential in the course of this debate to point out the difficulty that we face in regard to all these matters and give some idea of how legislation should come forth which would have the effect of stimulating the conception of productivity in the minds of the people and getting away from the purely negative aspect of price control.  Everyone admits that there is under-investment of capital in this country.  Everyone admits that our exports have not increased sufficiently to meet our needs.</P>
    <P>There are some startling facts which I think the public have not appreciated. In connection with industry, the total amount of savings available for productive investment has, during quite a number of years since the war, been slightly less than in 1938 in real terms, allowing for the change in the value of money.  We have this peculiar concept of profit unrelated to the amount of profit that can be re-invested in new industries.  There are many companies which, in fact, have profits that are less in real terms than they were in 1938.</P>
    <P>The amount of capital and cash available for industrial expansion in a considerable number of companies to-day is less than it was in real terms in 1938 because of the enormous growth in the replacement cost of machinery.  The amount of capital spent by the industrial world since the war is but a fraction of what is being spent in countries <Col N="232" /> where the profit incentive is present and where, along with very great increases in workers' wages and in the conditions of the workers, there has been encouragement to invest savings in new enterprises.</P>
    <P>There is the question of plant depreciation allowance which has been up to now more in Great Britain than in this country where there is no tradition of exports of great magnitude abroad, no tradition of massive industrial investment, no inherited wealth of any great kind to use for investment purposes.  The whole incidence of taxation, in fact, in so far as industry is concerned, needs examination rapidly in order to encourage investment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of the tariffed industries, many of them have done very well.  The prices at which a number of them sell goods are highly satisfactory.  Some of them are still in the initial stage and can hardly be considered as mature industries.  Others have been in operation a considerable time, but there is no country where tariffs exist where there are not the inevitable adverse circumstances associated with protection.  A tariff umbrella frequently covers the weakest member of a group and is, in fact, no longer necessary for the strongest member of a particular group.</P>
    <P>While there have been a number of works studies and efficiency investigations in this country since the war and a number of firms have adopted, in conjunction with their trade unions, plans for increasing industrial productivity based on the advice of outside consultants, taking it by and large, that process has not developed in the main in the great body of Irish industrialists. Many of the trade unions have shown the same attitude as in Great Britain where they have been satisfied so long as they could achieve security of the workers, so long as they could protect the interest of the redundant workers and so long as they could share in the interest from increased productivity.  A great deal more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The cost of consultancy is a very heavy one.  A good industrial consultant may cost as much as £120 a week, <Col N="233" /> which is far beyond the capacity of the smaller units to pay.  In Great Britain, industrialists combine and share the collective cost of the consultant. Whatever legislation is devised to control prices, it should include the formation of some commission or body which will examine the efficiency of industry in the most sympathetic way. We feel that this body should employ firms of consultants and other experts in the fields of engineering and industry and that, before a formal inquiry commences in regard to the efficiency of an industry, it should be possible for the industry itself to apply to the commission in order that it might have the benefit of its advice.</P>
    <P>The Minister might even consider the making available of some grant-in-aid to defray the cost of the consultant in certain cases, or the commission might make use of its powers to arrange for collective payments of the cost of such consultants.  This efficiency legislation should be based on the idea that as far as possible there should be voluntary co-operation between the commission and the industrial group involved. Quite obviously, the commission would eventually need powers to insist on an investigation and to make use of all the powers envisaged in the 1947 Industrial Efficiency Bill.</P>
    <P>The point is that we would like to see greater collaboration and greater use of industrial organisations.  We want to see greater collaboration between workers and employers in these industries.  In the 1947 Bill, there were proposals whereby workers and employers could collaborate in an effort to achieve greater industrial productivity. There has been much criticism of that by many employers' organisations, because in Great Britain it so happened that such people as shop stewards, who played a great part in such productive councils, had frequently been of Communist opinion and caused disruption rather than agreement between workers and employers.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that in this country, where industries are new and where you have not the background of the appalling 19th century attitude towards <Col N="234" /> labour, we could not engage in greater co-operation between workers and employers at the council level to promote the efficiency of industry, without having fractious disputes.  I believe, in any event, that legislation should be passed to ensure and to encourage this development.  I think that such a commission should have power to co-ordinate with Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta and to recommend export outlets.  I think it would be possible for such a commission to see that certain industries would spend a certain proportion of accumulated profits on export market explorations. At the same time, it must be recognised that there must be a retention of power to control prices, retail and wholesale, under certain circumstances. The Minister by now should have a very realistic viewpoint on this matter, though he may not, in the light of the utter failure of the Coalition Government to give the public a realistic idea of how far prices can be controlled under certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think the envisaged commission should co-operate with the Institute of Management.  The Institute of Management could afford useful information to the commission and there could be co-operation between it and the group of industries being examined in any particular tariff field.  Quite apart from promoting new price control legislation, I think the Minister will have to examine more speedily the whole incidence of taxation for the encouragement of new industries.  The only encouragement given to date was under the recent Mining Act passed to assist a certain type of mineral exploration.  There is a considerable case for applying that principle to other export industries.</P>
    <P>If the Minister imagines that the exports of certain classes of goods to South American countries is fraught with less risk than mining non-bedded minerals, he is making a mistake, and, although the O.E.E.C. prohibits us from any long-term modification in taxation in regard to new exports, it does not forbid temporary concessions. The Minister will have to examine the position under the Undeveloped Areas Act to see whether the powers and the <Col N="235" /> money available are sufficient.  He will have to examine the amount of money made available to Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, to see whether or not more joint action is needed between groups of individuals and that body.  He could see if it were not possible to have joint groups formed out of the suggested commission, Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, and outside bodies for the exploitation of export markets.</P>
    <P>It is quite impossible to outline in detail the kind of legislation we would like, because the Minister has more information on these matters than is available to us.  It is impossible for us on this side of the House to examine the whole of the price structure in this country.  The Minister can do that and can bring before this House a Bill which will relate to modern conditions and to the inflationary situation through which we are passing.  Nobody could foresee in 1947 that we would face the kind of stagnancy that has been the picture since that year. Despite increases in production, demands for a higher standard of living by the public are not met by increased production.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware in connection with industrial development that we now face this inflationary situation accompanied by an adverse position in regard to our balance of payments. Industries which depend solely on the home market where the labour content is very small may not have any effect on the balance of payments at all. There may be more workers, but the workers expend half of their wages on imported commodities, and somebody has to pay for the imports brought in by the workers.  Particularly in the case of new industries where the labour content may be small, if one takes payments abroad for materials, royalties and patents and one relates the fact that half the wages and salaries paid to these workers are spent on imports, the ability of those industries to reduce our import commitment may be negligible.  We presume that the Minister's own comments on the need for greater exports are related to that fact, which all of us have to face now, which has become of far more importance since the growth of the full employment <Col N="236" /> world of Great Britain and its accompanying effects here.</P>
    <P>I do not wish at this stage to detail the whole history of price levels in this country since 1948.  There will be other speakers on this side who will remind the Government of the promises they made and the fact that in failing to introduce permanent legislation they are simply not facing up to reality.  As I have said, the public is being deluded for too long about this promised reduction in the cost of living, and told that no matter what happens abroad the Government should control the cost of living.  For too long has the cost of living become the mere plaything of Coalition Party politics, and it is time we got away from that to face the realities of the situation.  With that in view, as I have said, we can only condemn the Minister for his failure to introduce legislation and for the excuse he has made that in the present circumstances there might be harmful consequences from the introduction of legislation.  As he is well aware, there is an enormous need for legislation and assistance of every kind to increase production, to increase efficiency, to lower costs and to expand exports from all of which workers will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I pay tribute to Deputy Childers on his excellent Tory speech?  Never have I heard the Tory case made as well as it has been made by Deputy Childers.  I have taken note of a few things he forgot to include. One of these was the complete omission under Fianna Fáil of steps to stop inflation by the method of a standstill on workers' wages.  Would not one have thought that that was an important contribution by the Fianna Fáil Government to a method of equilibrium when there was no danger? Was it not a serious omission of the Tánaiste and the inter-Party Government that they did not copy Fianna Fáil when the first tendency to inflation came, to say: &ldquo;The cost of living is going up, there is a danger.  There is one way of stopping it, a very effective way.  All wage demands must be stopped, and we will stop them.&rdquo;  The inter-Party Government did not do that.  Rather they promised that they would not do that, and proudly <Col N="237" /> announced that if the cost of living rises, the workers will be permitted to seek to get, without Government interference, compensation for the increased cost of living by wage increases.</P>
      <P>I notice that he also forgot to dwell at any great length on the 1952 Budget.  Maybe a number of the people in the country have forgotten what happened in 1952, when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance, but a little gentle reminding from some of the Labour Deputies could bring back to the public some of the facts of that black day when they calmly announced that they were going to increase the price of tea, bread, butter and sugar, and that they would give a trifling compensation to the old age pensioners and other groups to compensate them for what was being done. That is an old ground, but it is a ground from which Fianna Fáil cannot slip away.</P>
      <P>I also noticed that, in his talk, Deputy Childers paid left-handed tribute to our Minister on the work he had done in connection with mining, but while he says that to-day, I remember, a week or two ago, we even had to vote against his Party to get that Bill established, so he would have the best of both worlds&mdash;just like that. He cannot say he agrees with it now, when, a fortnight ago, he went into the lobby to stop its coming into being.  It is not so easy to fool the people, especially the Labour voters, in this country.</P>

I also noticed an interesting point in the Tory Deputy's speech when he tried to stress that our Minister ought not to tolerate any type of industries that had a good labour content, but paid very little dividends in balancing <Col N="238" /> the difference between imports and exports; in other words, in balancing the gap&mdash;never mind the labour content or how many Irishmen and Irishwomen are employed here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, the interpretation by Labour people is that where Irish men and women are employed in this country, if the dividend is small, the Minister must not encourage that.  He must discourage it, and if he gets more through another factor that does not have any labour content at all, but which decreases the gap, irrespective of the labour content, that is the line he must take.

      <P>I just want to stress that Fianna Fáil believe&mdash;and the ordinary people can see that&mdash;that the workers are the smallest factor.  Thank God, we have a Government and a Minister in charge of industry and commerce that will not accept Deputy Childers's outlook on what should be done in this country.  I am prepared, as a Labour Deputy, to accept the Tánaiste as an excellent judge of what is good for the working people of this country.  I am quite confident, irrespective of what abuse or innuendoes are cast by the other side, to state that he has the <Col N="239" /> complete confidence of the Labour group.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, no one has worked as hard as he has since he took upon himself the responsibility of office.  Let me take this opportunity of paying a personal tribute and a tribute from my Party to the terrific achievement of his only last Saturday, when he gave his personal and private time to stop a disastrous strike that would have involved the whole country.  I am aware that newspapers have paid their tribute; I am aware that employers have paid their tribute.  However, let me say on behalf of a group of workers from the South of Ireland, whose livelihood would depend on what happened with the C.I.E. strike, that we appreciate that none but the Tánaiste would have stepped in at the time he did and that we are thankful for the very good work he has carried out.  It only shows what reliance is placed upon his word by the workers of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste, in opening the debate, spoke in connection with the Prices Advisory Body.  I am quite satisfied that, as he has said, they serve a good purpose and that if they do not do what they should do, the Labour movement or the trade union movement are the people who should have least objection.  We have representatives of the trade union and of workers' school of thought on the Prices Advisory Body.  If he, as Minister, gets a recommendation, he is in duty bound at least to consider that recommendation. Let it be said to the Tánaiste's credit that already he has resisted recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the Prices Advisory Body &mdash;and I have said this not only this year but last year and the year before, and even the year before that&mdash;have a very wrong conception of their duty to the public.  I think their view is that they are only there to investigate applications for increases in prices.  In my view, their function should be bigger than that.  I think their function should be to advise the Minister on the right price that should be paid, whether it is up or whether it is down, and they should not depend on applications <Col N="240" /> by employers, retailers or wholesalers, or anybody else as to what should be the price.  They should investigate all the circumstances, examine all the factors and initiate inquiries themselves, independent of any applications either by consumers or by manufacturers, and they should recommend to the Tánaiste their views on the position for his consideration.</P>
    <P>I know that most of the time is spent in endeavouring to sift out evidence as to whether or not certain applications by manufacturers for an increase are justified or not.  I have already paid tribute to the Minister for the fact that, on one particular occasion within the past few weeks, he, representing the Government, refused to accept a recommendation and ordered further and fuller inquiries.  We in the Labour group believe he was right.  I feel the Government believe he was right and that the country as a whole believes he was right.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Childers speak for an hour or an hour and a quarter this evening.  He slipped over the questions of production and wages and made a case as if workers were not even interested in the question of production or the question of living.  We in the trade union movement have a saying that the employer makes his dividends out of the factory, but that we who work in it make our living out of it.  If the factory closes down, it is quite possible that the manufacturer will have a reduced income, but for a worker it means that he has no living for himself, his wife or his family and emigration that Deputy Childers played around with so tortuously and so glibly will be a stark reality for himself and the majority of his fellow-workers.</P>
    <P>I advocate as I have advocated to the Tánaiste, that the Government should put at the disposal of the trade unions and of the consumers organised in the various organisations that exist &mdash;be they housewives' leagues or prices restriction committees of any sort&mdash; able and competent officials of his Department, briefed to represent him, to marshal together the facts they have available and to put these facts <Col N="241" /> before the Prices Advisory Body.  What is the position?  The manufacturers, with their money, with their chartered accountants, with all the resources of their industry behind them, will brief high legal counsel to go before three or four judges in the Prices Advisory Body and put before them all the important factors that prove, or seem to prove, that they are entitled to a price increase.  Each individual trade union organisation, each individual organised or semi-organised group of consumers, or each individual consumer with an objection is invited to come forward to prove that these submissions are wrong, without having a right to investigate the affairs or the books of the company making the application. How, in the name of goodness, would it be possible for the Prices Advisory Body to get all the factors that would give them the full knowledge on which they could base a proper judgment?</P>
    <P>It is true that the Prices Advisory Body, acting in their own right, have power and have exercised the power to demand further and fuller information. However, just as in the bread inquiry, the employers or manufacturers&mdash;call them what you will&mdash;can simply say: &ldquo;We have no further information to give.&rdquo;  I would suggest to the Tánaiste that there is need for some type of permanent legislation. In that, I am in agreement with Deputy Childers, but from a different point of view.  I would say there is need for some type of permanent legislation that will give to the existing Government, irrespective of who may be in power, the right to query, and query fully, all the factors before price increases are passed on to the consumers, as they have been passed on in the past.</P>

      <P>That is quite untrue, and the Minister knows it.  We gave him whole sections of this Bill, the most important sections, without any debate whatever merely because we knew, of course, that the Minister and the Government could not keep a House and we did not want to reduce the proceedings of the Dáil to a farce by calling for a House, as, indeed, we might do now, because, after all, it is the Minister who is responsible for the Bill and if the Minister does not do the Opposition the justice of admitting that we are trying to discuss this Bill and what is involved in it in a reasonable way, we will show him some obstruction.  We could at the present moment, by reason of the failure of the Minister's Whips to keep a House, just call an end to the whole proceedings for the time being.  I merely want to point out there is no obstruction.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee on the amendment.  Interruptions are out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record, first of all, a protest against the unmannerly suggestion of the Minister for Agriculture.  I was speaking on this amendment on the 23rd February when the debate adjourned.  I moved the Adjournment and I think it is quite in order for me now briefly to recapitulate the introductory arguments I was then making.  That, Sir, was as far as I had gone when the Minister had the audacity to suggest that either myself or my colleagues were enduring the labour and tedium of this debate merely to obstruct the business of the House.  That is not our objective at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that this is a most important Bill.  The Committee, which the Minister himself set up, has pointed out that the greyhound industry can be productive of many millions a year, something which the Minister for Finance will not sneeze at, having regard to the precarious state of our balance of payments account.  This <Col N="244" /> Bill, as we know, proposes to give very wide powers to the greyhound industry board, but it also proposes to give very considerable powers to the body which has been condemned by the Committee which the Minister himself set up.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into that aspect of the matter on this amendment, but I want to assure the Minister that it has not been lost sight of and that it will become, I hope, the general knowledge of all the members of this House and all those outside it as to why it is we are opposed in principle to agreeing to every proposal which the Minister has embodied in this Bill. We think, as a correspondent who has written to me from Great Britain thinks, that this Bill is merely an attempt to put a new label on an old body and that what, in fact, is being done in the Bill is to perpetuate the body which was subject to such severe criticism on the part of the Minister's own Committee.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking last, I was on the point that it was quite reasonable to expect the club to contribute towards the finances of the Greyhound Advisory Body having regard to the functions of the board and having regard also to the privileges and the legal authority which this Bill seeks to confer upon the club in respect of a great many important matters in relation to which the club has been, in my opinion at any rate, flagrantly lax and, indeed, guilty of a grave dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>I was pointing out on that occasion, and I have not any later figures than those which are available in this official document that according to Table VI on page 49 of the Report of the Advisory Committee, the gross income enjoyed by the club for the year ending 30th June, 1948, amounted to £24,420.  The gross expenditure for that 12 months amounted to £16,548 and there was a surplus, before deduction of income-tax, of £7,872.  For the following year, the halcyon year of the Coalition, the total income of the club amounted to £20,600 and the gross income&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Deputy MacEntee read out these exact figures on the last occasion on which <Col N="245" /> he spoke.  He has given us the date himself, 23rd February.  He read out these figures and we have them in the Official Report.  What is the point of repeating now exactly what he said then?  I do not mind Deputy MacEntee making the same point all over again, but reading out the exact figures he read out previously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Deputy MacEntee doubted the reliability of the Parliamentary Secretary's memory in submitting that he had quoted all those figures <i>in extenso</i> to you before.  I would refer you to column 950, Vol. 154, No. 6, of the Official Debates of 23rd February in which Deputy MacEntee is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...I am quoting from Table VI on page 49 of the Report&mdash;for the year ended 30th June, 1948, the gross income of the club was returned as £24,420.  Its gross expenditure in that year was £16,548 and it had a surplus, before deduction of income-tax, of no less than £7,872.  I grant you, for some reason or other, the picture changed in 1949 because, for the year ending 30th June in that year, the gross income amounted to only £20,000.  It had fallen by £4,420, but the gross expenditure had jumped to £20,879 and there was a deficit in that year of £279.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I interrupted, and the report continued as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> Mr. MacEntee: Yes.  Of course, another reason may have been&mdash;we had better advert to it before half-past ten&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Would the Deputy mind saying what income-tax was paid in that year?</P>
    <P>Mr. MacEntee: £4,294.  They paid income-tax to that extent in that year but they paid it to the Coalition Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the variant is &ldquo;in the halycon years of the Coalition Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Perhaps that is one of the blessings which befell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was dealing, when I was speaking on the 23rd February, with the question of the income enjoyed by the club and the expenditure which that income had to defray. I was endeavouring to refresh the minds of the Deputies about that this evening when I was interrupted, but I would like to proceed from that. I am not going to touch upon this question of income and expenditure, but I am going to touch upon the earning assets of the club.  According to the report, on the 30th June, 1950, the assets, including debtors, cash on hands, investment in Government loans amounted to £8,558, and then they had an asset in Powerstown Park, Limited, that was returned as being worth £1&mdash; a very substantial writing down of an asset.  I am not accepting that figure and, for the purpose of this amendment and the debate, I am going to use the figure which the committee itself placed on that asset.  You will note that this club, which Deputy Finlay&mdash; perhaps I will be allowed to quote Deputy Finlay's speech, because it was Deputy Finlay who really put this matter in order.  Deputy Finlay said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I must confess that I cannot possibly see the point of this amendment. The only thing that would give any point to it at all is if it were an attempt to tax the greyhound racetrack run by the Irish Coursing Club when no other greyhound track can be taxed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Finlay went on to say afterwards that he did not think the club could bear any contribution towards the expenses of the board.  Deputy Finlay's speech, which was all directed to that particular point, will be found reported in columns 940, 941 and 942&mdash; three columns altogether&mdash;and not once was he interrupted.</P>

      <P>To show how the club puts on an appearance of poverty towards those interested in greyhound racing and coursing, who might have thought that they had some stake in the assets of the club, I was referring to the fact that Powerstown Park appears in the balance sheet at £1.

      <P>I have it now and I am going to quote the reference&mdash; paragraph 113.  This is what the Minister's Committee had to say about Powerstown Park:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Powerstown Park, Limited, is a private company with a paid up capital of £10,000.  The company was formed in 1932 by the Irish Coursing Club, mainly to establish a permanent national coursing ground, and to that end, to purchase the property known as Powerstown Park Racecourse.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the £1 asset.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Previous to the formation of the company, the Irish Coursing Club had held coursing meetings on this property and had paid a rent therefor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It might not be strictly relevant, but I suppose those who authorised the investment of £10,000 in Powerstown Park were under the impression that, when they had purchased Powerstown Park, the Irish Coursing Club would be able to run its coursing meetings free of charge at Powerstown Park. That expectation, however, was not fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The company carries on the business of horse racing and other activities relating thereto.  The shareholders of the company, who are nominees of the Irish Coursing Club, executed in April, 1932, a Deed of Trust, under which they acknowledged that they held their shares in trust for the Irish Coursing Club and were prepared to act in all respects under the direction of the club, as expressed or contained in resolutions from time to time passed by the standing committee.  The senior joint secretary of the Irish Coursing Club acts as salaried manager of Powerstown Park, Limited, and in consideration of payment of an agreed annual sum, is entitled, while acting in this capacity, to reside in Powerstown House and to use the lands of Powerstown Demesne, comprising about 130 acres, <Col N="252" /> except at such times as portion of them is required for coursing or racing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I pointed out that the paid up capital of Powerstown Park Limited amounted to £10,000.  I have also pointed out that this valuable property stands in the balance sheet of the Coursing Club at £1.</P>
    <P>I go on to give what the Committee further gleaned about Powerstown Park:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have received no estimate of the value of the properties owned by this company, but we learned that a sum of £12,000 approximately was spent over a period of years on improvements to the race course, in other words on grounds in the same property as those referred to later in paragraph 121, in which the expenditure by the Irish Coursing Club itself, of upwards of £2,000 towards the improvement of portion of these grounds for coursing purposes, is mentioned.  As in the case of the Greyhound and Sporting Press Limited, and although Powerstown Park Limited appears to be a prosperous undertaking, no contribution whatever appears to have been made by it to the funds of the Irish Coursing Club.  Indeed the Irish Coursing Club actually pays £100 per annum for the right to hold coursing meetings on its own lands at Powerstown Park.  Profits made by Powerstown Park Limited have been utilised to increase the company's assets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This £22,000 company stands in the balance sheet of the Irish Coursing Club at £1.</P>
    <P>The Report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The formation of these two companies, both of which engage in commercial activities, and the investment by the Irish Coursing Club in such commercial enterprises of funds arising directly from the greyhound industry, appear to have been outside the terms of the constitution of the club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sir, some of the passages which I have read to the House would be relevant, not only to this debate, but to <Col N="253" /> another debate on this section but I am merely pointing out now in relation to the amendment before the House, which is to ask that the board be empowered to require the club to pay such sum towards the expenses of the board as the board may deem reasonable, that the club is a wealthy organisation and out of the profits of Powerstown Park Limited alone could make a very substantial contribution towards the expenses of the greyhound industry board and towards the development of the greyhound industry in this country.  That is what is involved in this amendment and, having regard to the facts which I have put before the House, one would think that it is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask that the club should be required to make this contribution.  What is indeed inexplicable, what the Minister cannot explain away, is why he should reject an amendment which is so perfectly reasonable as this one is.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult to keep track of all the tables but I should like to consider another asset in this balance sheet.  There is the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited.  I understand that that publication has been referred to earlier in this House and that some comments on it have been sent to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. So, perhaps, I am estopped from commenting in the way in which I think it would be perfectly justifiable to comment upon some of the articles which have recently appeared in that publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited.  It, too, is returned as being worth £1.  Let us see what the committee had to say about the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Apart from printing <i>The Coursing and Racing Calendar</i>&mdash;recently renamed <i>The Sporting Press</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sorry.  I wish to refer, first of all, to paragraph 109 of the report, in which the committee states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1924 the Irish Coursing Club decided to promote, jointly with the <Col N="254" /> secretary of the club, a publication to be known as <i>The Coursing Calendar</i> which was to become the official organ of the Irish Coursing Club.  By 1928, this paper was firmly established.  The club then decided by resolution&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark you&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The club then decided by resolution to take complete responsibility for the paper and for this purpose incorporated a company known as the Greyhound and Sporting Press Limited, of which the share capital of £5,000 was subscribed from the funds of the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>£5,000 written down to £1 in the balance sheet of the club.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the formation of the new company, the secretary of the club, in consideration of certain financial arrangements made with him, agreed to assign to it all his interest in <i>The Coursing Calendar.</i>  Although the resolution setting up the company directed that the property and assets thereof would be held by trustees of the Irish Coursing Club and by the directors of the company, no trust deed in these terms was executed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the House realises why it is necessary that there should be some sort of supervision and control over the assets and finances of the Irish Coursing Club, when it hears this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although the resolution setting up the company directed that the property and assets thereof would be held by trustees of the Irish Coursing Club and by the directors of the company, no trust deed in these terms was executed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, not executed, at least, prior to the date of the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 109, page 44.  The paragraph goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We feel satisfied that the directors and shareholders of the company do in fact hold the property and assets in trust for the club, but it would seem desirable that the position <Col N="255" /> should be regularised by the reorganised Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the body which will come into existence when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I go on and I shall have to repeat a couple of sentences because I inadvertently began my comment upon this aspect of the club's balance sheet by commencing with paragraph 110 on page 45 of the Report, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from printing <i>The Coursing and Racing Calendar</i>&mdash;recently renamed <i>The Sporting Press</i>&mdash;the company prints the Stud Book on behalf of the Irish Coursing Club and prints &lsquo;membership&rsquo; and other cards for coursing clubs.  The company undertakes printing work for a number of horse racing companies and other sporting organisations, and&mdash;presumably in order to employ its staff and machinery full time&mdash; engages also in a considerable amount of other commercial printing and paper trading, outside the greyhound industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope it will be remembered that one of the things which the House is proposing to do here is to establish on a legal basis this trading and printing organisation which competes with other printers and similar companies who have not behind them the funds and resources in support of the greyhound fraternity in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming back to the point that, according to this report, the company undertakes printing work for a number of horse racing companies and other sporting organisations and, presumably, in order to employ its staff and machinery fulltime, engages also in a considerable amount of other commercial printing and paper making outside the greyhound industry.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, appears to have been remarkably successful from the outset and the value of its assets including buildings and equipment is estimated by the Irish Coursing Club to be at present at least £60,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And the people who estimate the value of the <i>Greyhound and Sporting Press</i> at &ldquo;at least £60,000&rdquo; write it down in the balance sheet at a value of £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This estimate includes buildings which were erected in recent years at a cost of approximately £14,000 <Col N="257" /> and includes also plant and equipment said to have cost £18,000.  This heavy expenditure on the construction of new buildings and installation of equipment was stated by the Irish Coursing Club to have become imperative when the printing company was informed by the military authorities during the emergency period that it would have to vacate certain buildings held on lease by it in Clonmel and utilised in connection with the publication of the <i>Racing and Coursing Calendar</i> and also by the Irish Coursing Club in other directions.  We have ascertained that the proposal of the Department of Defence to resume possession of the buildings has not up to the present been proceeded with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to start discussing the question whether the reason given by the Irish Coursing Club for embarking on this expenditure of something like £14,000 was justified or not&mdash;that will arise later&mdash;but I just want to draw the attention of the House to the fact in passing that up to the date on which this report was being prepared, in fact up to the date on which it was signed, the Department of Defence has not resumed possession of the buildings.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The buildings in question continued to be held by the Irish Coursing Club and in any event it was not until some years subsequent to the date of the proposal referred to above that the new buildings were erected at a cost of £14,000 and equipment costing £18,000 installed therein.  On the whole&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony Barry and his colleagues said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;we have some doubts as to whether in the circumstances mentioned the company was justified in expending on the erection of new buildings and more particularly on the installation of new and elaborate printing machinery large sums which properly speaking belonged to the Irish Coursing Club and to the greyhound industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I repeat that?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the whole we have some <Col N="258" /> doubts as to whether in the circumstances mentioned the company was justified in expending on the erection of new buildings and more particularly on the installation of new and elaborate printing machinery large sums which properly speaking belonged to the Irish Coursing Club and to the greyhound industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There the committee itself has given the justification for this amendment. We had a property amassed to the value of £60,000 and the valuers were the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  Where did that £60,000 come from?  It came out of the greyhound industry and the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that is not going to happen in future, that this money which, according to the report, came out of the pockets of the greyhound owners, breeders and trainers of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having mentioned that these huge sums belonged to the greyhound industry, the report went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have no information as to whether the Greyhound and Sporting Press Limited, decided on this expenditure or whether  sanction of the standing committee for the expenditure was sought.  The company appears to hold liquid assets to the value of £13,000 approximately.&rdquo;</P>

The committee then went on to say this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Although these assets include Government securities, earning only from 3¾ per cent. to 4 per cent., no effort has been made to redeem 6 per cent. debentures to the value of £4,000, held personally by the senior joint secretary of the Irish Coursing Club who is also the manager of the <i>Coursing and Racing Calendar.</i> Here it might be noted that income and corporation profits tax to the amount of £24,800 was paid by the company since 1933.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister has succeeded in getting the relevant passage in the report&mdash;I thought he was interested&mdash; because I should like him to turn now to paragraph 111, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Despite these liquid assets and the fact that the assets and property of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, must be regarded as being held in trust for the Irish Coursing Club, it appears that this concern has never contributed any portion of its substantial profits to the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in discussing this amendment, seemed to make it appear that the club had no means of making a contribution. Deputy MacEntee is pointing out that, having built up this huge capital reserve which is now revenue producing, they never in the past contributed from that to the coursing industry. Therefore, this amendment is necessary and the argument is imperative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am proceeding to show is that if those who control the coursing club made a full disclosure of their accounts to their members, the net revenue of this club would be even substantially higher than that returned under Table 6, because here is what the committee itself has to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Despite these liquid assets and the fact that the assets and property of the Greyhound and Sporting Press Ltd., must be regarded as being held in trust by the Irish Coursing Club it appears that this concern has never contributed any portion of its substantial profits to the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In fact, those who got hold of the plant and buildings were not rendering to the Irish Coursing Club any divided upon the Irish Coursing Club investment. The paragraph goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" />&ldquo;...this concern has never contributed any portion of its substantial profits to the Irish Coursing Club.  Its profits have either been ploughed back through the construction of buildings, installation of plant etc., or invested elsewhere.  It was admitted on behalf of the company that its property and revenues belong to the Irish Coursing Club, but it was argued that surplus revenue was retained merely in order that it might later be readily available to the Irish Coursing Club should the latter's financial position decline or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and this is the point I am coming to&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;should the industry as a whole need help.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What we are proposing in this amendment is that these huge revenues of the Irish Coursing Club which have never been disclosed in a way in which those who would read the balance sheet of an organisation like the Irish Coursing Club would understand and appreciate, should now make some contribution towards the expenses of the Greyhound Industry Board.  That is what we are contending for in this amendment and I can see no justification whatever for the Minister or any person concerned honestly to ensure that all this confusion as between the property and assets of the Irish Coursing Club and those who control, manage and operate it should be cleared up, refusing to accept it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to impose on the House and, indeed, upon myself the physical fatigue of reading through the report, but I think it is essential it be on the records of this House and that the arguments for this amendment which were made so solemnly, so convincingly and effectively by Deputy Barry and his colleagues should be available to direct and guide us in the decision which we will ultimately have to take on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are accepting his advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have already expressed doubt in regard to the action of the Greyhound <Col N="263" /> and Sporting Press, Limited, in expending a sum of approximately £32,000 in the erection of buildings and installation of plant, in other words utilising in this manner reserves which must have previously accumulated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry's comment on that was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot therefore accept as sufficient the explanation as to why the company did not contribute to the funds of the Irish Coursing Club as a whole during a period when coursing might have received greater financial assistance by way of reducing fees and increasing prize money at coursing meetings and the employing of additional supervisory staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those who read the transcript of the evidence given by certain witnesses before the Advisory Committee will learn that one of the most general complaints&mdash;and indeed it is referred to here in the Report of the Advisory Committee&mdash;was that the Irish Coursing Club did not employ a sufficient supervisory staff of the quality and character which was essential if the sport of greyhound racing was to be kept clear of abuse.  The Report goes on to say in paragraph 112:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We understand that the company prints the Stud Book at a profit to itself, charging considerable sums to the Irish Coursing Club for the service.  The income derived by the Irish Coursing Club from the sale of the Stud Book of affiliated coursing clubs, etc., covered only a fraction of the cost of printing, so that the book in consequence is published at a consistent and serious loss to the club.  We see no valid reason why, in view of the sound financial position of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, and the fact that it was set up with funds provided by the Irish Coursing Club, it could not at least have undertaken the printing of the Stud Book free of charge, or at a nominal charge, to the parent body.  We are indeed of opinion that every affiliated <Col N="264" /> coursing club would be reasonably entitled to a copy of the Stud Book, free of charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a help to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We also feel that the company could readily have made other concessions to coursing clubs generally.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another asset of the Irish Coursing Club which stands in the balance sheet at £1 is Clounanna.  In paragraph 116 the Irish Cup meeting is described as the outstanding event in coursing activities in Ireland and is held at Clounanna.  The paragraph goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At this centre, the Irish Coursing Club expended approximately £11,500 in equipping the grounds, thereby providing good stands and other much-needed public amenities on what are generally regarded as the outstanding coursing grounds in this country.  The Irish Coursing Club organised this meeting for a number of years, but in recent times responsibility for the function has devolved on the County Limerick Coursing Club, but on condition that the Irish Coursing Club may at any time resume responsibility.  In recent years the meeting, as organised by the County Limerick Coursing Club, has been very successful.  Profits acoruing to the County Limerick Club from the holding of the meeting may be disposed of only with the approval of the Irish Coursing Club.  Although the Irish Coursing Club incurred the necessary expenditure on buildings, stands, etc., and continues to be responsible for their upkeep, the land on which they are erected is merely held on an expiring lease.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, this asset is written down as £1 on the balance sheet although £11,500 was expended there by the Irish Coursing Club.  I think when all the facts which I have put before the House are taken into consideration it will be agreed that, as I have said before and as I am saying again in order to make my point clear, it is only reasonable that this wealthy <Col N="265" /> organisation, the Irish Coursing Club, should be obliged to contribute towards the expenses of the board such a sum as the board themselves may, after full consideration of the position, deem to be reasonable.  The only reason why the principle of that amendment might be rejected by the Minister is that he did not think the board which he proposed to set up would act in a reasonable way.  I do not think there would be any justification for such an attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself has in fact compelled the majority of the House to accept his proposal that out of the six members other than the chairman whom he is to appoint, four must be members of what I think will be called the standing committee of the club. Here we have the position that the board will have upon it a majority of persons who are members of the standing committee of the club.  Is it to be assumed that these four people will act in an unreasonable way towards the club?  I think it is not conceivable that such a situation would arise and I simply cannot understand why the Minister should be adamant in regard to this amendment&mdash;why he should have indicated that he was not prepared to discuss it.  I do not know why the Minister has become so unyielding in this matter.  It is possible perhaps that when he drafted this Bill he had not read or studied the report of the advisory committee and that when he looked at our amendment he was not accordingly familiar with the facts which moved us to put it down.</P>
    <P>I am now putting it to him that in his responsible position he should accept the amendment and give those who are interested in the greyhound industry the assurance that the profits, the moneys derived by the club from greyhound racing, coursing and breeding&mdash;because they will derive a revenue from that indirectly&mdash;will inure to the use and benefit of those who maintain the whole organisation.</P>

      <P>I just want to say this. I think it is necessary for the record. I believe that Deputy MacEntee in what he says this evening is actuated by personal hatred and malice against individuals whom he conceives to have <Col N="266" /> done him political injury in his own constituency.  I believe this is the sole explanation of the disedifying diatribe to which we have been listening, and I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am telling the House what actuated Deputy MacEntee in the diatribe to which we have listened. Now I want to bring the House to the only relevant paragraph in this report which he has taken care not to quote. When all the matters referred to in this report had been excogitated by those who drafted it they came to paragraph 154, page 63, where they proceeded to make their recommendations. They said in the course of that paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards the source from which the funds to finance the board might be provided... a few witnesses believed, however, that a levy on the funds of the Irish Coursing Club would yield sufficient revenue for the purpose.  As regards this proposal we are satisfied that the reconstituted Irish Coursing Club should apply its funds solely in connection with breeding and coursing, and we do not envisage the board&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's sanctimonious tone will not disguise the fact that the Minister has disregarded every other recommendation of this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;obtaining revenue from the club, except possibly in the circumstances already referred to in paragraph 146.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If you turn to paragraph 146 you will find this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That all fees in connection with coursing and breeding as defined by the Irish Coursing Club and <Col N="267" /> approved by the control board, be paid to the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;any member of the Irish Coursing Club or of the executive committee to have the right of appeal to the control board in regard to the utilisation or distribution of the revenues of the club.  The control board to be entitled to demand out of Irish Coursing Club funds recoupment of any expenditure incurred by it in respect of coursing or breeding, or, alternatively, the payment of an annual levy to meet possible expenditure arising out of action necessarily taken by the board to deal with abuses in connection with breeding or coursing.  Equally, however, we foresee that circumstances may arise in which the board might at its discretion decide to make a grant towards the funds of the Irish Coursing Club.  Fees paid by applicants seeking licences to be remitted direct to the control board.  All fees arising in connection with greyhound racing, e.g., licensing fees, proceeds of levies, etc., would come under the control of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to intervene in this debate further, because I have made it clear what my views are, and they are not to be changed by the nauseating performance begotten of Deputy MacEntee's resentment of his personal political discredit.  It is right that the House should know the source of his vindictive spleen throughout the discussion on this whole measure in the House, and know that he has no concern with the welfare of this industry, and that he has spent his time pouring filth, vituperation, misrepresentation and scandal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this personal abuse in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and reflections on the living and the dead.  It is important that the people should know that it is not with the merits that he is concerned. The desire is to prosecute a personal vendetta.  But neither his threats nor his vituperation are calculated to make the slightest impression upon my mind or on the mind of any <Col N="268" /> other member of this House who understands their source.</P>

      <P>When the Minister comes to read the report of this debate I hope that he will be able to put his finger upon one single argument in refutation of the case I have made for this amendment.  It is an old saying: &ldquo;When you have no case, blackguard your opponent&rdquo;, and we know, of course, what an adept the Minister is when it comes to indulging in personalities. It ill becomes the Minister to asperse my character in that way. Whatever any person in my constituency has ever done against me politically, I have never been guilty of a vendetta.  There is no trace of Abyssinian blood in my veins, nor have I associated in any way with those who might in Irish history have flogged the unfortunate Croppies of '98.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but, Sir, the Minister proposes to continue on this line of personal attack and personal abuse.  I have not said anything except to address myself to the fact that the governing body of the Irish Coursing Club in its administration of the funds has been severely criticised and condemned by the committee which the Minister set up.  I have said, and I have repeated it time and again, that the moneys which ought to have been used for the development of the greyhound industry in this country have been utilised for other purposes. I am not going to endeavour to defend in any way, or refute or rebut, anything the Minister says.  There are people associated with the Irish Coursing Club who have been friends of mine &mdash;great friends of mine politically, people with whom I have been associated during the Black and Tan times. I do not think they have ever found me wrong.  I have never found them wrong.  But there is, undoubtedly, a situation here which in the public interest should be cleaned up.  I am endeavouring to ensure that it will be cleaned up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's only rejoinder to the arguments I have advanced has been <Col N="269" /> to try to heap contumely and abuse upon me.  Very well, I can take all the ordure he throws, and I can wipe it off my face and my hands will be clean, which is, perhaps, more than can be said about some of the Minister's associates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what we have been listening to from Deputy MacEntee can only be described as a stupendous performance.  It was a display of spurious indignation.  I am going to demonstrate now why it is spurious, and that he has no interest whatever in the greyhound industry or what it is or what it is going to be in the future.  The hair-raising disclosures and abuses to which he has already referred several times since this Bill was brought in&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They are disclosures in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony Barry and his colleagues compiled that report and handed it to the Government, of which Deputy MacEntee was Minister, four and a half years ago, and for two and a half years Deputy MacEntee, with power to put an end to this &ldquo;appalling state of affairs&rdquo;, did nothing whatever about it.  In his comment all along, he has done nothing except to indulge in mudslinging of a type which I find revolting.  I do not want to go any further on that line, because I think that all of us who have an interest in this thing know exactly what has happened, and know that Deputy MacEntee is trying to settle some private grievance of his own and using this occasion for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I am tired of all this.  I did not intend to speak again.  I do not want to go into the details.  The main fact about these Irish Coursing Club assets is that they are there.  They were created by a body of men who came together as sportsmen to create their own sport and, on the way, they created this magnificent asset which is now being handed over to the entirely new industry that is going to be controlled by this new board plus the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I interrupted Deputy MacEntee during the course of his speech and, <Col N="270" /> as I did not want to intervene for any length of time at that point, I now want to make clear what I meant.  The main assets were developed, not from funds obtained from Irish breeders, not from funds obtained from Irish coursing events.  Actually, they were obtained from English importers of Irish dogs who sent subscriptions to this country to effect the transfer of the dogs to the English stud.  I happen to know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was extremely wrong and improper of Deputy MacEntee to quote from the transcript of evidence given before that commission. It was so reported, and said here, that the people were asked to believe that these bits of evidence he read out were accepted by the commission as being the truth.  The contrary was the fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well to try to deal with the matter in the rather offhand way in which Deputy Barry has dealt with it.  He has repeated the slander, the vile slander, of the Minister for Agriculture.  I have no spleen against any person in this matter.  I want to say that&mdash;but not to defend myself against any accusation that the Minister for Agriculture might make.  The Minister for Agriculture has made accusations before in this House and, when he was asked to justify them before those who could cross-examine him, he ran away. Deputy Barry is not in that position but Deputy Barry has taken the Minister's word.  I have no quarrel or enmity with any person associated with the Irish Coursing Club.  I just want to say that for the record&mdash;not to endeavour to carry conviction to the mind of the Minister for Agriculture but in the hope that, at any rate, an honest man like Deputy Barry will give me that credit.  If I had a vendetta against anybody I certainly would show it in another way.  I am arguing this case on its merits.</P>

      <P>Yes, they are here in this report.  I should not be surprised if the Bill were already well advanced when the Minister took over. The only thing about it is that the Bill would probably have followed more closely the lines of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee and the Minister has departed from that report in a most extraordinary way. However, there are other Deputies in the House who, no doubt, would like to address themselves to this amendment and I shall give them an opportunity to do so.</P>

It now appears, I am sorry to say, that the Greyhound Industry Bill of 1955 is turning into a political issue of Fine Gael versus Fianna Fáil &mdash;and, mark you, not by our choosing.

If there is not a free vote of the House, then there is no question but that this Greyhound Industry Bill is being definitely turned into a political issue.</P>
      <P>Let us go back again, like the wise thrush, and repeat: I said before that anyone can get up here, and &ldquo;slag&rdquo; and criticise, but it is a good man who will say what should be done.  The Minister quoted me.  He quoted me wrongly, of course, but I do not mind that since he quoted me to the best of his ability, and I do not disagree with his paraphrase.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was suggesting that, even at this late stage, in the middle of this most important Bill, the Minister&mdash;he is <i>in absentia</i>, but it can be conveyed to him by his deputy, the <Col N="275" /> Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;should let this go, as they used to say in the old days, to a round-table conference, remembering that we, on this side of the House, support his view that the Bill should be politically non-acrimonious. As his Excellency, Seán T. O'Kelly, once said: &ldquo;Does it not cause one furiously to think?&rdquo;  Does it not cause one furiously to think if the Greyhound Industry Bill is turned into a political issue?</P>
      <P>To get back to the terms of my amendment, I think no fair-minded Deputy could quarrel with the very reasonable wording of the amendment. My friend, Deputy Finlay, has defeated by his logic the Minister's arguments that the amendment is unconstitutional. I am still holding out in the hope that we will have a free vote on this issue.  Indeed, I hope that there will be a free vote on every section, so that if Deputy P.J. Burke and Deputy Briscoe disagree with me, or I disagree with them, we will be at liberty to go into different division lobbies.  I have asked the Minister for a free vote on several occasions.  Like St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, there has been no reply.</P>
      <P>Repetition is odious and I have no intention of going over the old ground, recapitulating &ldquo;old, unhappy, far-off things and battles long ago.&rdquo;  The arguments have been advanced in a far abler manner than I could ever hope to achieve by both Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Briscoe.  Let us get down to business in relation to this Bill for the good of the industry. My very good friend, Deputy Carew from Limerick, is in the House.  He will agree with me when I say that the present standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club is composed of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Mr. Jim Frost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Giles is up there in the back bench; he is a man who does a lot of &ldquo;slagging&rdquo; about democracy and the rights of the small man.  I tell Deputy Giles now that this is a democratic Bill and we on this side of the House, even at this late stage, in the middle of the Bill, are prepared to go to a round table conference, argue the pros and cons and come back here then.</P>

      <P>I had intended to speak on this amendment much earlier in the debate and to put forward some of the arguments advanced by Deputy MacEntee, not for the same reason, but to point out that this amendment, or alternatively, some other amendment on similar lines, might be brought in by the Minister on the Report Stage to ensure that if, at any time, it was necessary for the board to require or get moneys from the Irish Coursing Club the board would have the power to do so.  I like the amendment: the very first sentence reads: &ldquo;The board may require the club.&rdquo;  It is not mandatory. It merely gives power to the board to get money from the Irish Coursing Club.  I intended to go through the report, as Deputy MacEntee has done, in support of my submission that the assets are there, most of them are easily realisable and should be devoted to the purposes for which, I believe, they were intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> Like Deputy O'Malley, I have been completely revolted by the turn this discussion has taken.  Like him, I feel a Bill like this should be completely above Party politics and I say to both sides of this House that the exhibitions we have seen to-night and all during the debate have been appalling.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to consider at this late stage setting up a Committee of the House to go into the Bill.  Otherwise, this state of affairs will get worse because each successive stage gets dirtier and dirtier and no progress is being made.  It is quite obvious the Minister has no intention of changing the Bill as it stands or accepting amendments that are put down.</P>

      <P>There were many amendments put down, some of which have been withdrawn because of assurances given by the Minister but, in my opinion, some very important amendments to this Bill are being defeated, important amendments which should be tied up in that Bill so that no succeeding Government or even this one, can ever be placed in a position of being powerless to rectify abuses that may still occur when the new industry is organised.  I do not think anyone in this House could accuse me of having any malicious reasons for putting this viewpoint.  I am as anxious as the Minister is that a good job be done and I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity for one moment.  However, if he is as sincere as he would have us believe, if he is going to ensure that the small dog man, the trainer and all the other sections which he says are going to be catered for, will be catered for, he will, even at this late stage, in connection with this amendment and all other amendments, stop this discussion <Col N="278" /> and set up a Committee of the House to deal with the Bill.</P>

      <P>We are all anxious that the greyhound industry should be improved and that any money that can be spared to improve it should go back into the industry.  We are anxious to see that the ordinary small man will have an opportunity of participating in the industry and that he will have some encouragement at least by getting some payment for the work he is going to put into breeding greyhounds. In this way the legislation now before the House will have a similar effect in improving the greyhound industry as the Racing Bill had in 1945 in another sphere.  As I have said before we must divest ourselves of outside affiliations and approach the questions we discuss here in an objective way.  All the money possible will have to go back into the industry for its development.  I would not say that all the money of the Irish Coursing Club should be taken away, but if the Irish Coursing Club are able to make considerable profits and if their assets are extensive, they should be in the position to help the industry and to help the board so that the board in turn will be able to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see the interests of all sections catered for.  As regards the man who starts to breed greyhounds and the man who races them, the stakes should be considerably increased to make it worth his while to do the work involved.  If we do not approach the <Col N="279" /> question from the national point of view and be fair to every section we cannot hope to achieve anything worth while.  The industry has a long way to go to attain what we believe it should attain.  While the Irish Coursing Club during their day have made great strides, we hope greater strides will be made as a result of this Bill and that any money that can be spared to improve the industry will be put into it.</P>

      <P>I did not mean to intervene in this discussion but as a countryman I could not but intervene having heard some of the remarks from the far side of the House.  Having listened for five minutes to what was said on this matter, my line is that those who live by commerce should be bound by commerce and those who do not, should not.  Therefore, the farmer's son or the country dweller who has a dog and does not keep it in the hope that the dog will win a prize of £1,000 or win a race at Shelbourne Park&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it has every connection.  I say that commercialisation as portrayed by the racing of the dog after the artificial hare, and so on, has a very definite relationship to the amendment and that the statements I have made are relevant to the proposal which this amendment enshrines, namely, the levy of a contribution on the Irish Coursing Club.  May I continue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the type of young man, or perhaps old man, who lives very often in the poorer districts of the country like Limerick, the constituency of Deputy O'Malley, keeps his dog to go to the local coursing meeting and should not, as a result of this levy which will be imposed on the Irish Coursing Club by the passing of this amendment, have to pay an <Col N="280" /> extra entrance charge.  It is notable that, with the exception of Deputy Burke, the men who have thought otherwise on the far side of the House are men who are more likely to be involved in the commercial activities of the dog track than in the coursing of greyhounds in the field.  I think this is relevant on the amendment.  I know a farmer in County Louth who kept a greyhound and the value of that greyhound was never more than £25.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it has a great deal to do with it.  If we are considering a levy on the Irish Coursing Club, is not the amount a dog is worth a relevant consideration?  Does the amount of commerce that is carried on in the activities of the Irish Coursing Club have its effect?  As I see it, this definitely tends towards a commercialisation of an open-field sport. A contribution from the Irish Coursing Club will tend to make coursing more expensive for the ordinary individual in this country and for that reason I would find myself definitely against it.</P>

If we are to take that to its logical conclusion, we would be in this position that we would not want any Bill at all here and we would not want any Irish Coursing Club or anything else.  We would just rear dogs and bring them out to chase a hare.  I would go down to County Louth, bring out a few dogs and chase hares in the fields&mdash;we would not want any Irish Coursing Club.</P>

I must totally disagree with Deputy Donegan on this point.  The only thing we are <Col N="281" /> anxious to do in this amendment is to ensure that all the money we can get shall go back into the industry.  That is all we are asking, and, in asking that, we are helping the Irish Coursing Club because they are going to benefit by the industry being improved.  They are going to benefit because what they are going to lose on the swings, they are going to gain on the roundabouts. I hold it is reasonable to ask any body which is the parent body of the industry, such as the Irish Coursing Club, to help the board in any way they can.  I am not going to say any more about it.</P>

The arguments made in favour of the amendment would be much stronger if the people on the opposite benches could explain one thing&mdash;I believe it might almost convince me if they could explain it&mdash;how it is, if those terrible abuses, which are contained in the report, are to be taken as a fact, that, although the report was submitted on the 18th January, 1952, nothing was done about it until now?

      <P>I would draw Deputy Barry's specific attention to paragraph 146:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That all fees in connection with coursing and breeding, as defined by the Irish Coursing Club and approved by the control board, be paid to the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;any member of the Irish Coursing Club or of the Executive Committee to have the right of appeal to the control board in regard to the ultilisation or distribution of the revenues of the club.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is something which has not happened up to the present, but which we think may be regularised.  If this board ever comes into being, it will prevent additional or surplus revenue being utilised in the manner in which it was utilised in the past, extraneous altogether to coursing, and ensure that it will be brought back in the manner which Deputy Burke suggests and as the report suggests.  They might be able to give better prizes or reduce fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The control board to be entitled to demand out of the Irish Coursing Club funds recoupment of any expenditure incurred by it in respect of coursing or breeding, or, alternatively, <Col N="283" /> the payment of an annual levy to meet possible expenditure arising out of action necessarily taken by the board to deal with abuses in connection with breeding or coursing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We agree with this recommendation, as we agree with most of the others. This amendment is only a compromise as between not adopting the recommendation or adopting it.  It is a compromise; it does not go that far.  I do not know whether his colleague has informed the Minister of the suggestion made by Deputy O'Malley.  He is, as he says himself, a young member of this House, and he is rather horrified that the debate on this Bill has developed into what we might call a personal slanging political match across the House, not started by this side and not continued by this side.  It was all very well for the Minister to attack Deputy MacEntee when he came in here this evening; but the Minister should not forget that, earlier on in the discussion of this amendment, he construed my efforts as meaning something entirely different from what I had in mind, and I think he knows that.  Deputy O'Malley's suggestion is: this Bill is becoming very controversial now, and if the Minister persists in hammering through by a Coalition majority a Bill of this nature by rejecting this amendment, he is going to have ultimately a Bill which will not be satisfactory and which, as we said at the outset, will some day have to be amended, if and when there is a change as between that side and this side of the House.</P>

      <P>If the only justification for the non-acceptance of any amendment suggested from this side for the purpose of improving the situation is to be the original sin of not having introduced it earlier, why bring in the Bill at all?  Why not let the Minister make a regulation and say: &ldquo;I take over the whole greyhound industry and I will make regulations as from tomorrow.&rdquo; It might be better that way, because we could raise it occasionally in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> I do not know whether the Minister has heard what the suggestion was. Deputy O'Malley's suggestion was that we should agree to send this Bill to a committee of all Parties of the House and remove it from this open arena and the type of acrimony that we are having, that the committee should seek the advice of every person possible and, if necessary, receive representatives from the various interests and hear them on the matter.  Perhaps they may not agree with some of our suggestions which we believe are good; perhaps they will not agree with the Bill as drafted, which the Minister may believe is good.  Will the Minister not do that?  Will he put the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept the amendment and thereby adopt the general principles of recommendations made to him by the advisory committee?  Several pages of the report have been read to-night and probably many more will be read and, by the time the discussion on this amendment concludes, possibly the whole report will be on the records.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that there is justification for the amendment in the information disclosed to the House in the report.  The report shows the creation and the build-up of funds and their utilisation.  I am afraid the Deputy from Louth who spoke was not quite clear as to what the amendment is about.  The amendment is to do exactly what he wants, from the point of view of removing from the poorer greyhound owners as much tax as possible in the form of fees.  He must not forget, when he refers to the amendment as setting up a commercial side to the greyhound industry, that that is really the purpose of the Bill.  The whole idea is, ultimately, to build up a large-scale export of very valuable dogs, which will add to the national economy.  This amendment is essential to accomplish that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The club already has substantial capital and is assured of very substantial <Col N="285" /> income.  The number of greyhound breeders, owners and of those who race dogs will increase as a result of the increase in the income from fees of this club.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to doubt my sanity.  The Minister is suggesting that I said things I did not say at all.  If he is right, I must be fit for examination in another place.  It could also be the other way around. Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll indicated&mdash;not for the reasons adduced here in support of the amendment&mdash;that she felt the Minister should accept the amendment. I take it Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll is speaking as an individual member of the Labour Party.  I am not suggesting that she is speaking for the Labour Party.  Deputy James Tully, I think, is inclined to say that, had the Bill been introduced earlier, he would have agreed with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have been here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but if it had been introduced earlier, he would have been in agreement with this type of amendment. Deputy Barry argues against it now, although he is a signatory to the document which urges its adoption. Where is the consistency?  Where does consistency begin and where does it end?</P>
      <P>When the Minister says, unjustly and unfairly, that this amendment has been given birth in the minds of some of us over here&mdash;we are all in accord, so when he accuses one, he accuses all&mdash; because of our hatred of some person or persons, does he not realise that there are numbers of greyhound owners, greyhound breeders and persons who run greyhounds on racetracks who are also in our minds, from the point of view of protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said last night that there should be equal taxation for all.  For what reason and on what basis is this fourth corner of the four corners that make up the interests concerned in this Bill excluded from taxation, while the other <Col N="287" /> three corners are forced to pay all? Will the Minister answer that?  What is the reason?  They are the people who are getting the majority of representation in the running of the affairs of the board, although they are people who, according to the report, were not considered competent to run the affairs of the Irish Coursing Club. We are here with our eyes wide open being dragooned into handing over majority control of the board to representatives of the Irish Coursing Club.  Yet this report said; &ldquo;If you set up a board, not one of these gentlemen should be on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we have the Irish Coursing Club still with all its assets, all its income, and with all the potentialities for future increases in revenue and they are not to be asked to make any contribution whatsoever.  They are to be excluded, and on top of that, the other interests are to provide all the money by levy and otherwise.  What argument has the Minister against paragraph 146, page 60, of his own report?  Is he taking the line that under no circumstances will he attempt to justify his opposition to this amendment? I want to tell him that it is not necessary to accuse people of having particular reasons for saying something or doing something but it does seem strange to me that there is no valid argument from beginning to end in the whole course of this Bill for refusing this amendment.  It is one of the most vital matters in connection with it. While there may be some argument against the exact wording of this amendment, the sense of it appealed to Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll.  Why does the Minister not agree if he wants to end the discussion to say: &ldquo;All right, I will do this&mdash;I will enter an amendment for Report Stage, if not like this, something similar, to meet to some extent the objections to the section without this amendment?&rdquo;  Will the Minister accept that?  Or does he think that the suggestion from Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll comes by reason of some undisclosed hatred for somebody?</P>
    <P>Do not forget there are more concerned in the greyhound industry than just the gentlemen of the Irish Coursing Club.  There are the members of <Col N="288" /> the Irish Coursing Club in the ordinary clubs, and the Bill tends to secure an increase in owners, an increase in the number of clubs all over the country and increased operations and activities. Yet we are not going to make any defence for those people against charges which will be heavier if this Bill goes through without this amendment.  Will the Minister just sit there and take all this mental punishment&mdash;I assume he regards listening to us rehashing and discussing this as mental punishment? Will he not say: &ldquo;There seems to be a reasonable amount of persuasion and I will do one of the things suggested either by Deputy O'Malley or by Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll?&rdquo;  Or are we to be faced with the prospect of seeing people forced into the Division Lobby to vote against something they themselves favour?  Will the Minister at this stage agree to any of these suggestions?</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan talked a lot about the position if this amendment were to be accepted and said it would commercialise&mdash;I think that is the word he used&mdash;the greyhound business, but is not the whole thing for the purpose of commerce?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on that portion. He said he was concerned only with the man who had a dog at his heels, who went out for a day's hunting, and he said he was not concerned with any other aspect of it.  But surely the whole Bill, if he reads it through&mdash; takes a much more comprehensive view of it than that.  In introducing the Bill, the Minister indicated its main purpose.  The country had suffered considerably by lack of control, by falsification of dogs in shipments abroad&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to argue as best I can that this amendment is necessary for the simple reason that the board will have to deal with the <Col N="289" /> abolition of all the malpractices which are mentioned in this report.  In doing that, it will have to appoint officials, and make certain charges.  Up to the present, without this amendment the only income available came from three sources.  I say there is a valuable fourth source which would make the board more independent and possibly enable it to enter into much greater activities much more speedily than if the source of income from the Irish Coursing Club is denied to them.  That is why I am pressing this amendment.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not yet see that there is any sense in this at all or must we take it that when he gets up&mdash;if he gets up&mdash;it will only be on a basis of personal abuse, instead of relating his remarks to the discussion on the amendment?  I think when we come to read the debate, while some of us have wandered accidentally&mdash;with all respect to the Chair&mdash;others have made no attempt to keep to the amendment.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment as it is drafted.  Failing that, is he prepared, not having accepted the other two suggestions, to say that he will give it further consideration and that the amendment can be reintroduced on the Report Stage?</P>
      <P>We are being put in an impossible position by the Minister, if he will not say on an amendment of this nature that he is prepared to think it over so that we can discuss it again on report. If he did that, we could get along to the next series of amendments, some of which do not appear to be very controversial. This, however, is one of the most important and most essential amendments to the whole Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but there are one or two things which, perhaps, have still to be said on this.  It is obvious from the speeches which have been made by Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll and Deputy Tully that the arguments here are carrying some measure of conviction. It is unfortunate that we have not been able to convince them completely. I think Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll is convinced that this amendment has merits and she has, in fact, I think, appealed to the Minister&mdash;I think he was absent when she was making her speech&mdash;to say he will accept it in principle <Col N="290" /> and will bring in an amendment on Report Stage to give effect to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully seemed to be in the position that he had a great deal of sympathy with the amendment.  I do not see how any unbiassed person, if he pondered over the passages from the report which it was my duty to put to the House, could feel otherwise.  There is no justification in ordinary reason for rejecting it.  Indeed, the only reason why Deputy Tully could not see his way to speak in a more forthright manner in support of the amendment was that the Bill had not been introduced sooner.  After all, we have been out of office for quite a long while.</P>

Let me tell the Deputy that, unfortunately for my personal fortunes, my family were much too closely associated with greyhounds before the Deputy was born and learned a little bit about them.  But whether I was born in the city or in the country, I am entitled, as a member of this House and as representing the people of my constituency, in which there is, by the way, a greyhound racing track, to participate in this Bill and discharge my obligations as a Deputy and give to the House the benefit of any experience or knowledge of the facts I may have in relation to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> It seemed to me rather unfortunate that Deputy Donegan devoted only very little time to the consideration of the measure.  He said that one of the reasons he objected to the amendment was that he did not want to see greyhound coursing commercialised.  I may not be using the Deputy's exact words but he did give me the impression that the reason he was not prepared to vote for this amendment was because it would lead to the commercialisation of greyhound coursing.</P>

      <P>The Minister was babbling like a brook or a baby and it makes it exceedingly difficult for any person to participate in a discussion when this sort of thing goes on all the time.  I was addressing myself to the arguments used by Deputy Donegan and I think I am entitled to treat these arguments with some seriousness. He has already said that he objected to the commercialisation of coursing. What is the basis for this amendment except this report?  It has been pointed out that the moneys derived from greyhound racing, breeding and coursing, and the general operation of the <Col N="293" /> activities of the club have been used to build up a printing business, to spend £14,000 on buildings, £18,000 on plant, £11,000 on procuring liquid assets and £11,500 on Clounanna.  This is the commercialisation of coursing which our amendment is designed to prevent. We want to see these moneys, when they flow into the coffers of the club, used for the purpose of developing the sport and the greyhound breeding industry in the same way as the horsebreeding industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the few perfunctory remarks he made on this amendment, referred to paragraph 146 of the report of the advisory committee.  I assume I will be in order if I remind the House of what paragraph 146 of that report does, in fact, say.  It discusses fees and goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The control board to be entitled to demand out of Irish Coursing Club funds recoupment of any expenditure incurred by it in respect of coursing or breeding, or, alternatively, the payment of an annual levy to meet possible expenditure arising out of action necessarily taken by the board to deal with abuses in connection with breeding or coursing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the paragraph goes on to say, and I think it is of relevance here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Equally, however, we foresee that circumstances may arise in which the board might at its discretion decide to make a grant towards the funds of the Irish Coursing Club. Fees paid by applicants seeking licences to be remitted direct to the control board.  All fees arising in connection with greyhound racing, e.g. licensing fees, proceeds of levies, etc., would come under the control of the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are two points there.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the seventh time he has quoted that paragraph to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unparliamentary of me to say that is a lie.  I will just say this is the first time I have <Col N="294" /> referred to paragraph 146 and the record of the proceedings of the House will bear that out.  The Minister has said that I have quoted it seven or eight times.  That was said in order to put me off my stride, but it will not succeed.</P>
      <P>The report says that the control board should be entitled to demand recoupment from Irish Coursing Club funds, and let me say that our attitude towards this Bill is based on the recommendations of that advisory committee. The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the report of the committee, in relation to this matter of allowing the control board to demand out of Irish Coursing Club funds recoupment of any expenditure incurred by the board in respect of coursing or breeding, or, alternatively, the payment of an annual levy to meet possible expenditure arising out of action necessarily taken by the board to deal with abuses in connection with breeding or coursing, will be implemented.</P>
      <P>I am sorry, but I am tired and am subject to a certain degree of irritation because of the Minister's remarks.  My purpose at the moment is to point out that the advisory committee recommended that the board would be empowered to look for a levy from the club and that such a levy would be such an amount as the board would consider reasonable, taking everything into consideration.  That is all we are asking here in this amendment.  All the amendment seeks is that the Minister might accept the two recommendations contained in paragraph 146 of the report, that, foreseeing that circumstances might arise in which the board might, at its discretion, decide to make a grant towards the funds of the Irish Coursing Club, power would be given to the board to do that.  These are reasonable proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being quite frank about it and being accused of having some personal motive in this, I will say that I am concerned by the fact that the Minister has turned down the recommendations of the advisory committee <i>in toto</i>, because, after all, one of the things the committee did foresee was that the board might have to make <Col N="295" /> some demand when exceptional expenditure might arise out of action taken by them to deal with abuses in connection with breeding or coursing.  It would almost appear that the Minister was reluctant to allow the board full facilities for discharging that responsibility. I do not think there is anything more I can add on this amendment, except to suggest once more that it carries a certain degree of conviction. It also seems to have secured a certain amount of agreement from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>Despite anything that may have occurred earlier in the evening I would press the Minister&mdash;of course, any pressure from me is unlikely to be effective&mdash;to give consideration to this proposal.  I would suggest that, if he is not prepared to accept this amendment, he should introduce an alternative proposal on Report Stage, under which circumstances we would withdraw this amendment and allow the debate on the section to proceed.  If he is not prepared to go so far, perhaps he might consider between now and the resumption of the debate the suggestions which have been made by Deputy O'Malley that the Bill might be treated as non-controversial and referred to a Special Committee, where these things could be thrashed out around a table and where there could not be the suggestion that Deputies trying to discharge their public responsibilities are actuated by unseemly and unworthy personal motives.</P>
    <P>I myself would be very anxious to serve on such a committee, together with other members of the House, and I think I could say the same for Deputies Briscoe, Walsh, O'Malley and the other Deputies who have spoken on this amendment.  We certainly did not want the position to arise where the things that have been said in this debate in the House would be blazoned publicly abroad.  We like to discuss these things in committee around a table and to come to a reasonable agreement about the controversial parts of the Bill.  I hope something I have said may induce the Minister to change his attitude and to approach the Bill in the spirit <Col N="296" /> in which we had intended it would be approached.</P>

      <P>May I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this amendment and, in reconsidering it, say to the House, in view of the consistent arguments he has heard in its favour: &ldquo;I have decided to meet the wishes of the Dáil in this matter.&rdquo;  The Minister was very gracious to me in the case of two other amendments, and I say to him now that, in view of all the arguments to which he has listened, and in view of his greater enlightenment, he should decide to accept the spirit of the amendment.  We are here only to do one job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are trying to be as fair and reasonable as we can. We are trying to consider this matter completely on its merits.  If he argued completely on the merits of this amendment, not alone would the Minister make his position clear but he would clarify a lot of the ambiguous statements that have been made in this House and outside it.  In clarifying a lot of the ambiguous statements that have been made from time to time about responsibilities and about the responsible body we are speaking of in this debate, not alone would the Minister contribute something to the industry but he would vindicate the Irish Coursing Club.  The one thing that could be done would be to say that if the Irish Coursing Club are in the position of making considerable profits what better way is there of improving the industry with these profits, or what better use could any other board make of both the Irish Coursing Club profits and the board's profits, than that they should go back into the industry. That is all we are asking for.  It is a reasonable request.  I do not see anything wrong with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be misquoted.  I have no axe to grind on this measure.  Looking on the merits of the amendment as it stands, judging it from every aspect, we are merely trying to improve the industry.  We have a long way to go. I should like to see the greyhound industry built up so that it will be <Col N="297" /> worth something to the nation and to the individual.  We have not many wealthy philanthropists in this country who will just run greyhounds for the sake of the sport.  We all did a bit of that in our young days but, if you are rearing greyhounds, you expect some return.  Very few people keep a racehorse without expecting something from feeding and rearing and training it.  The same thing applies to the greyhound.</P>
    <P>We now have a wonderful opportunity of doing something worth while to improve the industry for the benefit of the individual and of the nation. The only way in which that can be done is by putting money back into the industry.  The Minister has often said to me in this House on debates on agriculture that certain profits should be put back into the land to try to increase its fertility.  The same can be said here about the greyhound industry. We could speak for days and days on this matter but I appeal to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Being another believer in parliamentary democracy, I appeal to the Minister's good sense of judgment to consider this very fair amendment.  For the life of me, I cannot see where this amendment will injure or take any honours or power from the Irish Coursing Club.  If I thought for a moment it would injure a body with which I have been associated for a long time I would not appeal here to the Minister to put this matter right.  However, I am fully convinced that it is in the national interest to do so, otherwise we should never have put down this amendment.  We have gone into all these things completely devoid of any personal bitterness towards any section or individual, good, bad or indifferent. We had to consider everybody concerned with the greyhound industry.  I have argued here for other aspects of the industry and will continue to do so according as the debate proceeds.  If we fail to recognise the individual rights and the individual responsibilities of each section of the greyhound industry then we are not doing our job properly.  I am as deeply concerned about the man who has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have passed an Act here to help many an industry and many an individual, from Social Welfare Acts to other Acts.  We have tried to help the farmers, the industrialists and various others.  I do not see why we cannot approach this problem as the Dáil should approach it, namely, by trying to put more money back into the industry.  I do not see why we should not try to eliminate the suspicions that have been cast from time to time on the Irish Coursing Club.

      <P>May I say that I am trying to get over the contentious points that have been raised in this Bill, according to the Minister?  The only way I can see of getting over them is by supporting the other Deputies who have suggested from time to time here to-night that we should have a select committee of the House to go into the Bill, a committee at which we would be free from interruptions and free to express our own personal opinions, in an effort to find out what is the best we can do and at which we could ask ourselves whether what we are doing is in the best interests of the industry.  Are we fair to the Irish Coursing Club?  Are we fair to the Irish greyhound breeders?  Are we fair to the racetrack owners?  Are we fair to the bookies?  I have listened to the debate since it started.  I must say it is very hard on any Minister listening to a discussion like this in committee.  If we were sitting in a select committee around a table, I am sure we would eliminate many of the misunderstandings that have arisen here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> There is another aspect of this matter.  It was alleged on one or other side of the House to-night that we are making a Party issue out of this.  There are as many people on this side of the House associated with the Irish Coursing Club and its governing body as there are on the other side.  The Irish Coursing Club is not by any means the bailiwick of any political Party, one way or the other, and those who try to make it so should not do so.  Our only concern here is to be fair to everybody, and the only way I can see that will ensure our being fair to everybody is if the Minister, if he cannot consider the amendment proposed or accept the amendment, will at least accept my suggestion to have a select committee of the House.  We have had select committees on various other Bills from time to time.</P>

      <P>I am merely trying to relate my remarks to this amendment and help the Minister in every way I can.  In trying to help the Minister to do the best for the industry, I am merely making all the suggestions I can so that he may bring in a Bill in relation to which future Ministers for Agriculture and future Deputies, when we have passed on, will be able to say that the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy James Dillon, introduced a very fine Bill when he was in office.
