      <P>The engagement and dismissal of staff are administrative functions and as such are matters for the Board of C.I.E. to determine in accordance with the operational requirements of the undertaking.

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in the light of the position disclosed by the accounts of C.I.E. that the population <Col N="1577" /> of Dublin has been, in effect, subsidising transport for the benefit of the provincial population, he will convey representations to the board concerning the urgent need for cheaper fares for workers and school children living in the Ballyfermot, Crumlin and Finglas areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board of C.I.E. are charged with a statutory duty to balance their budget and they are also empowered to fix such charges as the board think fit for the services provided. In these circumstances any representations the Deputy may wish to make on the matter mentioned should be made direct to the board.</P>
      <P>I may say, however, that when the question of cheaper fares for workers was raised some time ago I was informed by the board that the question had been considered by them on a number of occasions over the past few years but that serious practical difficulties rendered such a scheme inoperable. School children are, of course, entitled to reduced fares on all the board's Dublin City services.  I understand also that in the cases of Ballyfermot and Finglas, where there is insufficient school accommodation, the greater part of the cost of transport for bringing the children to city schools is met by the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to add by way of statement to that issued by me on behalf of the Government to the Pensioned Teachers' Association and other bodies on 17th May, 1955.  That statement was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government have given very careful consideration to the representations made in regard to the granting of further payments in respect of lump sum to teachers who retired prior to 1st January, 1950. The principle has not been conceded and cannot be conceded that revisions in superannuation conditions introduced for serving teachers should be applicable to those who had already retired.  In these circumstances the Government are satisfied that the provision in the National Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1953, for the payment of an <i>ex-gratia</i> lump sum to teachers who had retired before 1st January, 1950, must be regarded as the maximum concession which they are prepared to make.  It is regretted, accordingly, that any request for a further extension of the lump sum payment cannot be favourably considered.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In addition to making provision for an ex-employee, the lands were used to enlarge 11 local smallholdings and to provide an exchange for another smallholder in the locality whose surrendered lands will, of course, be used for the relief of congestion.

      <P>No application was received from the Limerick Corporation for a loan of £49,000 from the Local Loans Fund.  The city manager was, however, advised in reply to inquiries regarding a loan for boundary extension compensation that an application would be considered for sanction to a loan from the corporation's treasurer or other source, repayable over a period of ten years.  My Department was informed subsequently by the city manager that an insurance company had offered a loan of £49,000 for a ten, 20 or 25-year period.  An application for sanction to a 25-year loan was received at the same time.  In reply it was stated that ten years was considered to be the appropriate period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> The reason for the ten-year period was related to the fact that the maximum amount of compensation permitted by the relevant Order was ten times the average annual amount of the increase in burden caused as a result of the boundary extension.  At the request of the city council I have reviewed my decision and have sanctioned a 25-years' loan period.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 to 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> By circular letter of 9th June local authorities were notified that new advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts should be confined to persons who could not reasonably be expected to finance the provision of their houses otherwise.  As I indicated in the course of the debate on the Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1956, the application of this condition in particular cases is a matter for the housing authority.  Local authorities must apply the condition whether or not they make schemes for guarantees in relation to advances by building societies.  The making of such schemes will, however, commend itself to local authorities in order that all possible facilities which the local authority can provide will be available in their area to persons willing to provide their own houses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the latter part of Question No. 30, the borrowing of money by a local authority requires my sanction, while the issue of money from the Local Loans Fund requires the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>With regard to Question No. 31, I have no information as to the funds available to building societies for the making of advances under guarantee schemes, but I would refer the Deputy to my recent announcements to the effect that the principal building societies had agreed to operate under such schemes.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree with the expression of his colleague the Minister for Justice recently, when he stated there was plenty of money available for houses except for &ldquo;civil servants and other rich people of £2,000 a year income&rdquo;? Would that figure be the figure the Minister has in mind when he contemplates a certain category availing of building society loans?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said there is ample money available for people of modest means who wish to procure loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts from the Local Loans Fund.  I am responsible for the administration of advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and not the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> That a sum not exceeding £116,480 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's office.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I propose to avail of the opportunity this Estimate offers to speak on a matter of the gravest national importance.  I intend in so doing to be as simple and as blunt as possible, so that everyone in the community will know and appreciate all the facts of the present economic situation.  Many people still believe that the situation, although serious, will right itself of its own accord.  This idea must be put aside once and for all. A vague uneasiness about the way things are going, and wishful thinking that all will soon be well, must be replaced in the public mind by a real awareness of how serious matters are and a determination on the part of each individual to do his share to remedy them.  It is only by realising and by facing the difficulties squarely that we shall be able to overcome them.</P>
    <P>In March last the Government, after careful analysis of the economic situation, imposed a special levy on a range of less essential consumer goods and also restrictions on hire purchase transactions.  These measures were supplemented in the Budget by higher taxes on less essential forms of expenditure, particularly on imports, and by certain incentives to production and saving.  An attractive new issue of Savings Certificates was put on sale on 1st May.  Both in March and in the Budget and on various occasions since, it was made quite clear that further action would have to be taken if an adequate improvement did not take place.  Stress was laid on how much that improvement depended on individual decisions to produce more and to defer unnecessary consumption now so as to increase savings.  A marked increase in saving has not so far occurred, nor has there been any significant increase in output.  I am <Col N="1592" /> sure all the Deputies in the House and thinking people throughout the country realise the seriousness of our present difficulties and look to a responsible Government to set a headline in dealing with the situation.  The Government have, therefore, decided at once to reinforce and supplement the measures already taken, despite any temporary political embarrassment this may cause.</P>
    <P>Before announcing the measures which the situation demands, I think it well to state in simple terms the dangers and weaknesses in our economy.  Most of our troubles arise from the fact that our production does not support the purchasing power yielded by our money incomes.  We are, moreover, spending so much of these incomes to satisfy our immediate wants and desires that all too little is being set aside for the productive investment on which our future standards depend.  Because our home output of goods and services is not high enough, a large volume of goods is being imported to satisfy our inflated purchasing power and, since we are not earning enough to pay for these imports, we are eating into our capital to do so.  We have even added to the excessive purchasing power of our incomes by borrowing from the banks and drawing down our past savings. The result is that these past savings are vanishing and that sufficient current savings are not being made to finance all the capital works needed to develop the economy.  Although the level of capital investment is below that of more developed countries, resources which represent the forced saving of two world wars have been largely wasted instead of being used exclusively and carefully to increase our productive capacity and so provide a firm basis for higher living standards.</P>
    <P>We must face the unpalatable truth that, without a radical change in the situation, we cannot enjoy much longer the artificial standards to which we have become accustomed, since the external reserves to which we owe these standards are steadily running out. Unless our present purchasing power is upheld by an immediate increase in <Col N="1593" /> production, we must accept a temporary reduction in that purchasing power now or suffer a wholesale and drastic reduction in imports in a very short time, with dire effects on industry, trade and employment.</P>
    <P>Our pattern of trade for many years has been that we import far more goods than we export, hoping to make up the difference by what are termed invisible receipts such as the expenditure of tourists in Ireland, emigrants' remittances and similar items.  Lately the excess cost of what we import over what we get for our exports has become so great that the invisible trade items cannot bridge the gap. Last year, for example, we spent £204,000,000 on imports but received only £110,000,000 for exports so that the visible trade gap was £94,000,000. Invisible receipts amounted only to £58,000,000 and we, therefore, failed to pay our way by £36,000,000.  No household, or business concern, could continue for long to pay out more money than is coming in.  What is true of a household or business is true also of a country.  We must, therefore, see that more comes in and that less goes out&mdash; that is, we must have more production and less expenditure on imports, if we are to maintain national solvency.</P>
    <P>The overspending on imports has continued with but little abatement in recent months and no worthwhile net improvement in the trade balance has yet been realised.  While the measures taken earlier this year have had some result, the change for the better is disappointing. Taking the first six months of 1956 together, imports were £5.7 million less than last year but this was accompanied by a decline in exports of £4.5 million.  The surplus of imports over exports in the period was, therefore, only £1.2 million less than in 1955.  This rate of improvement is obviously much too slow seeing that last year the import of goods and services in excess of our earnings abroad resulted in the loss of no less than £36,000,000 of our external capital.  I say loss because the external capital was used not for development here but purely for consumption purposes.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the fall in imports so far this year has arisen mainly from the <Col N="1594" /> running down of stocks of certain staple commodities such as wheat and maize, imports of which were exceptionally high last year because of the bad harvest weather in 1954.  Imports of consumer goods and of the materials for the manufacture of consumer goods have shown little reduction and, in view of the failure of exports to revive, are still being maintained at a level higher than we can afford.  Imports of commodities subject to the special import levy imposed in March were £3,000,000 in the two months April and May of this year as compared with £3.7 million in the corresponding months of 1955.  Apart from imports of motor cars and components which declined by £450,000, the effect of the levy in both months was slight.</P>
    <P>The Government have been particularly concerned to note that, so far as total imports are concerned, the falling trend of recent months was reversed in June when imports were actually £450,000 higher than in June of last year.  It might have been expected that the impact of the levy would have been fully effective by June. We are still importing, however, at an annual rate of up to £90,000,000 in excess of our exports.</P>
    <P>The fall of £4.5 million in exports in the first half of 1956 as compared with the first half of 1955 was mainly in cattle and other agricultural exports, principally pigmeat, dressed beef and butter.  As a result of increased domestic costs we find it impossible to sell abroad some of our agricultural products.  Cattle exports have shown signs of recovery recently and accounted for most of the increase of £1.7 million in total exports in June as compared with June, 1955.  Even on favourable assumptions about cattle exports in the remainder of the year, it would be clearly unwise to expect a sufficient increase in exports as a whole to reduce the trade deficit this year; the most we can hope for at the moment is that total exports will reach last year's level.  Our export prospects, even in the long run, are closely related to the level of agricultural production and it is to live stock and other agricultural exports that we must <Col N="1595" /> look for any significant expansion over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Another handicap to the restoration of a balance between foreign receipts and payments is the falling trend in the prices obtained for exports as against the rising trend in the prices paid for imports.  Even in a country in which merchandise imports and exports were in balance at the outset, this trend would mean that more exports would have to be sold, or less goods bought from abroad, if the balance were to be maintained.  In our case, imports are so much in excess of exports that the effect of any worsening of the price relationship is virtually doubled, as is, therefore, the effort necessary to offset it.</P>
    <P>That means that even if the volume of imports remained static, every time their cost increased by 1/- in the £, to prevent the balance from disimproving we would have to receive 2/- in the £ more for exports or increase the volume of exports by an equivalent amount.  That has not happened and indeed the changed relationship between import and export prices between 1949 and 1955 added, by itself, some £25,000,000 to the trade deficit in the latter year.  If we cannot offset, by increased exports, the effect on our balance of payments of an adverse turn in the terms of trade we have no option but to accept the necessary reduction in what we can afford.</P>
    <P>The need for an early and substantial reduction in our import excess is emphasised by the possibility of a drop in our earnings this year from invisible items.  Emigrants' remittances, for example, may fall below last year's level as a result of recent developments in the motor and other industries in Britain.</P>
    <P>These are hard facts, unpalatable facts, cruel facts perhaps, but they are, nevertheless, facts from which there is no escape.  The only conclusion to be drawn is that imports and other forms of external spending must be reduced immediately.  To secure this result, the Government have decided on the following measures:&mdash;</P>
    <P>First, an increase to 60 per cent. <Col N="1596" /> (full) and 40 per cent. (preferential) in the rates of special import levy on the items which were subject to 37½ per cent. (full) and 25 per cent. (preferential) under the March Order.  The specific rates of levy on canned fruit have been increased pro rata and commercial vehicles, except buses, have been made liable to the 15 per cent. levy on motor vehicles.  The March rates on motor vehicles, newsprint, newspapers and periodicals are being left unchanged.</P>
    <P>Second, a further range of imports has been subjected to levy at the rates of the original levy, namely, 37½ per cent. (full) and 25 per cent. (preferential). Broadly speaking, the goods now being charged are in character those which can less readily be dispensed with than those selected for the first levy and it is, therefore, appropriate that they should bear the lower rates.</P>
    <P>These intensifications and extensions of the levy have been effected by an Order under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act which comes into force at once.  Copies of the Order are being tabled and will be made available to Deputies.  Of our total imports in 1955, the new list of goods affected represented about £14,000,000, while the March list represented about £22,000,000 making a total of £36,000,000.  The effects anticipated from the changes now being made in the levy are a further decrease in imports of the order of £5,000,000 in a full year and an additional revenue yield, again in a full year, of some £3,000,000. I want to stress that the proceeds of these levies will, as before, be paid into the Capital Fund and, therefore, will not be used for ordinary budgetary purposes.  These estimates should be reduced by one-third, i.e., to, say, £3,500,000 and £2,000,000, respectively, to allow for the fact that almost one-third of the financial year has passed.</P>
    <P>The third measure is a reduction of 25 per cent., which will come into force at once, in the basic allowance for holiday travel abroad.  It is essential not only that expenditure on imports of goods should be reduced but also that all avoidable spending abroad should be curtailed.  This is the maximum <Col N="1597" /> reduction we can enforce under our O.E.E.C. commitments.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the 5 per cent. rate of levy on newsprint has been left unchanged.  In 1953 imports were 450,000 cwt. valued at £1.2 million; in 1955 630,000 cwt. valued at £1.8 million.  In the first five months of 1956 we spent on these imports £50,000 more than in the same period last year.  This is a sphere in which we can have physical control without danger of the emergence of black-marketing activities and I am, therefore, in touch with the representative organisations of the printing and publishing interests with a view to limiting our imports to what we spent on newsprint in 1953.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of the general campaign to reduce imports, I have already asked Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies to have all purchasing programmes reviewed with the object of reducing or deferring, as far as practicable, any purchases involving imports.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to all firms and undertakings who purchase stocks of goods from abroad to review their plans similarly and effect as big a reduction as possible.</P>
    <P>Apart, however, from direct expenditure on imports, all public expenditure must now be reviewed.  In my Budget speech I announced that the net borrowing requirement on foot of the capital programmes of the State, local authorities, the E.S.B. and C.I.E. would amount to about £37,000,000 as compared with £41,000,000 last year. I defined most carefully the conditions and assumptions on which this forecast was based.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided personal savings recover to the 1954 level we can carry through a programme of national development of this magnitude without any undue strain on our resources and with great benefit to our economic and social welfare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This proviso was and remains of fundamental importance because a failure of savings to revive could not but necessitate the suspension and curtailment of development plans. Even in March last I said I was basing my estimate of the possible level of <Col N="1598" /> public capital outlay this year on the assumption that the public would increase their savings to a significant degree, and then I went on:&mdash;&ldquo;For if this assumption were not made very drastic reductions would have to be made in public outlay&rdquo;.  I regret that, as I said in this House last week, there is as yet no evidence of a sufficiently marked increase in savings.  On the contrary, there is evidence that the consumption is continuing at a higher rate than we can afford and that even past savings&mdash;such as those represented by bank deposits&mdash;are being drawn upon to support this excessive expenditure on consumer goods.  The Government, have, therefore, no alternative but to review the programme of public expenditure settled prior to the Budget and, in the circumstances which still prevail, to reassess how far it can be financed out of available resources.</P>
    <P>In the budgetary programme the overall capital requirements of the State and other public bodies in 1956-57 were estimated at a gross figure of £43,500,000.  Towards this gross figure, there was expected to be available from capital repayments accruing to the Exchequer and the Local Loans Fund, from the proceeds of the special import levy imposed in March and from the Road Fund the sum of £6,500,000. This meant, as I have said earlier, a net borrowing requirement for the present financial year of £37,000,000.</P>
    <P>Towards that amount there is a reasonable expectation that small savings and the investment income of the Post Office Savings Bank and other funds will contribute £7,000,000.  Last year these sources yielded £5,750,000. The new issue of savings certificates has given an impetus to small savings in this form and, even though the improvement has been partly at the expense of the Post Office Savings Bank, a net total of £7,000,000 from small savings and investment income seems attainable.</P>
    <P>The problem remains of raising £30,000,000.  The position in regard to savings and the state of the gilt-edge market make it unfortunately only too clear that the borrowing of £30,000,000 in a non-inflationary way is not possible <Col N="1599" /> this year.  Last year's experience confirms that there is no hope of success for a series of public issues for C.I.E., the E.S.B., Dublin and Cork Corporations and the State itself.  I have come to the conclusion that, at most, only one major public issue, and that a direct Government loan, should be made in the present financial year. It is too early to settle the precise timing but I think it well at his stage to repeat that it will be the only major loan launched for public capital purposes in this financial year.  There will, in other words, be no public issue this year for the E.S.B., C.I.E. or Dublin Corporation.  The State will, so far as it is able to do so, come to the aid of these bodies, to supplement such funds as they can raise independently so as to provide the capital they necessarily require.  The extent, however, to which it can assist must, of course, depend on the extent of the capital resources which the public make available to the State.</P>
    <P>It is not usual to indicate in advance the amount or terms of national loans. I can, however, promise that the terms will be attractive to small and large investors alike.  It is the Government's desire to raise as much money as possible by voluntary subscriptions from the public; the terms of issue will, therefore, be such as will offer an incentive to public subscriptions and in this way encourage the revival of savings which is so necessary for economic stability and progress.</P>
    <P>The usual amount of a national loan is £20,000,000.  A loan of this amount should be successful, seeing that it will be the only major public loan in the present financial year, that, as I have said, its terms will be attractive, and that the special import levies will operate to discourage excessive consumption. Even in the difficult conditions of last year, public subscriptions to the various loans floated by the State and public bodies exceeded this amount.  It is not, therefore, I hope, unduly optimistic to expect that £20,000,000 will be subscribed. The patriotic good sense of our people, at whose desire and for whose benefit capital development is <Col N="1600" /> being undertaken, can, I believe, be relied upon to make the issue a success.</P>
    <P>The normal arrangements for the flotation of a national loan mean that Government funds and the commercial banks, as underwriters, have to be prepared to supply any deficiency in public subscriptions.  For Government funds&mdash;and, indeed, also for the banks in present circumstances&mdash;the fulfilment of underwriting commitments would involve further sales of sterling securities.  Neither the Minister for Finance nor the banks could regard this as a welcome prospect.  It would reduce the already limited reserves held by departmental funds, leaving them less able to support the State capital programme in the future, but what is even more serious, it might necessitate in the case of the banks a contraction of credit facilities in other directions in order to safeguard their liquidity.  It is not, I think, appreciated that, as a direct consequence of the balance of payments deficit, the commercial banks have lost nearly £50,000,000, or two-fifths, of their net external assets since January, 1955.  It is essential, therefore, that any further sales of sterling securities, whether by departmental funds or by the banking system, in order to finance public capital outlay, should be avoided or at least kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>May I say, in passing, that a good deal of misconception seems to exist about the country's holdings of external assets?  Many people, in talking about them, do not take care to emphasise that most of these holdings belong to private individuals and institutions and are no more available for public capital purposes or for covering balance of payments deficits than houses or other private property.</P>
    <P>Raising by loan £20,000,000 from the public would still leave us £10,000,000 short of covering the net borrowing requirement of the State and other public bodies this year.  In this latter sector, some easement may be secured through external borrowing but external borrowing is expensive and entails special risks.  For these and other reasons it can be undertaken only to a strictly limited degree.  There is no escaping the conclusion that the <Col N="1601" /> net borrowing requirement for public capital purposes as fixed at Budget time must now be reduced.</P>
    <P>The necessary extent of that reduction is being lessened by the imposition of the new and increased levies on imports.  The proceeds will be used exclusively for capital purposes and it is expected that the receipt in the present financial year will be roughly £2,000,000.  Allowing for some limited external borrowing and for the finance provided directly for Dublin Corporation and other bodies by Irish insurance companies, there still remains a gap of £5,000,000 which must be closed if, as a Government, we are to discharge our responsibility to maintain a sound and healthy economy.</P>
    <P>This gap could be closed either by an immediate increase in taxation or by a reduction in expenditure or by a combination of both.  To raise the amount necessary would require very heavy impositions which, coming so soon after the increases in taxation provided in the Budget, could be defended only if there was no alternative. The Government recognise that their primary obligation is to close the gap by economies in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that exhortations to private individuals to forgo expenditure, however desirable, in order to save must fail to carry conviction unless supported by the clearest evidence that public expenditure is being restricted to essentials and that the Government are not using their taxing powers to maintain services which are to any degree non-essential or postponable to less difficult times. Savings cannot, of course, be made without depriving some individuals or institutions of money or services which they had hoped to get or deferring the receipt by particular individuals or classes of new services of a beneficial or desirable nature.  Equally, however, these moneys and these services cannot be made available at the present time except by imposing heavier charges on the community at large and this the Government will not do.  They have decided, therefore, that at least £5,000,000 will be saved in Government <Col N="1602" /> expenditure this year.  Plans to give effect to this decision are being framed and the particular reductions will be decided upon and made effective by the Government without delay.</P>
    <P>Certain proposals to effect this saving are, in fact, already under consideration and I should stress they cover the whole field of current as well as capital expenditure by the Government and those bodies to which I have already referred.  Savings in current expenditure which must be in addition to the £3,000,000 for which I made allowance in the Budget will ease the problem of financing the capital programme because the revenue already provided for such expenditure will then be freed to meet capital needs.</P>
    <P>By this cut in public expenditure, by the imposition of the new and increased duties on imports, by very limited external borrowing, and by a national loan it is hoped to carry forward this year, to the utmost limit of our available resources, a public capital programme of a predominantly productive character which will not merely yield employment now but will secure permanent future increases in our living standards.</P>
    <P>I have used the phrase &ldquo;available resources&rdquo; quite deliberately because in these times the deliberate creation of new credit could have nothing but harmful effects.  Either it would drive up internal prices or, and more probably, it would accentuate even further our balance of payments problem by creating a new demand for imports. No Government concerned to preserve a sound economy and secure lasting improvements in the community's living standards could deliberately pump new money into circulation to add to the inflationary forces which are already too active in the economy.  On the contrary, the Government must make sure that such external capital resources as are still available will be used solely for the permanent strengthening of our economy and not to satisfy an excess demand for consumer imports generated by the creation of new money.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised this point because the belief is entertained in some quarters that the solution of our present difficulties is to be found in financial <Col N="1603" /> expedients either by way of credit creation or in other forms, including even a change in the value of our currency.  These are no real solutions. I have already explained what would be the effect on the economy of credit creation and it is clear that devaluation of the currency would inevitably lead to a progressive deterioration in our conditions relative to other countries. Leaving aside the effect on confidence in our currency, such a step would have a serious reaction on the cost of living since imports enter so largely into domestic consumption. Wheat, tea and other basic needs would be affected equally with the least essential imports.  I want to state clearly and categorically that the Government not merely have no intention of devaluing our currency but are determined to take whatever measures are required, however unpleasant, to safeguard and maintain the value of the Irish pound.</P>
    <P>The real need at the present time is for a substantial increase in the volume and efficiency of our national production. This cannot await the fulfilment of any long-term plan nor can it be realised by any magic formula; it must be achieved in the immediate future through the effort and enterprise of individuals if we are to surmount our difficulties.  They can be surmounted if we all increase our output by one-tenth. What is needed, therefore, is that everyone should concentrate on achieving this immediate target.  A rise of 10 per cent. in national production is well within our capacity in view of the advances recently made in other European countries.  I am, of course, referring to an increase in real output, not to an increase in the monetary value of production resulting from higher prices.  The benefit obtained from mere price increases by any particular section of producers can only be at the expense of other sections of the community or of the competitiveness of our exports.</P>
    <P>While we are attempting to get over our present difficulties stability of money incomes is essential.  The measures which I have announced must reduce the purchasing power of <Col N="1604" /> incomes by raising the cost of certain imports.  They will be rendered ineffective if there is any effort to compensate for this reduction in purchasing power by pressing for higher monetary incomes.  In the present serious situation we must all accept a temporary lowering of our standards as a condition of building them on a surer foundation.  Another round of increases in money incomes on top of those gained last year would be certain to price many of our products completely out of foreign markets.  It would be certain also to aggravate our balance of payments difficulties and to necessitate a contraction in our plans for national development.</P>
    <P>I remarked earlier that there has been no sufficiently marked improvement in the savings trend in recent months.  While there has been some increase in small savings, deposits with the commercial banks have continued to fall.  Next to our lack of resilience in production, this failure of savings to revive is our greatest anxiety.  The development of our economy by productive capital works cannot proceed without a large and steady volume of current savings.  The savings of our own people are the only means that will enable us fully to develop our national resources and to provide with that development more opportunities at home for employment and a sure foundation for a reasonable standard of living.  The Government are, therefore, consulting with the Savings Committee to see how the promotion of a national savings drive can be aided and accelerated in view of the urgent and vital importance of increased savings.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the measures intended to remedy a serious situation. These measures will be retained only as long as the situation requires.  I hope that a balance will soon be restored in our external payments and the conditions assured for steady progress in economic development.  In the last resort, however, a return to balanced conditions depends on the decisions and efforts of individuals. The Government for their part will discharge their responsibility to safeguard <Col N="1605" /> the national economy.  The situation, however, is one which may vary from week to week and from month to month.  I want to make is crystal clear that should any further action be required even while the Dáil is in recess the Government will not hesitate to take it.  What is at stake is our economic independence.  If we should lose this, the political independence we have achieved would be a mere facade. The Government are determined that both will be preserved at all costs.</P>

      <P>We have all listened very carefully to the statement of the Minister for Finance.  This is the third Budget statement he has made within this financial year, and the proposals contained in that statement are Budget proposals.  That being the case, I do not think we were unreasonable when we suggested to the Government that, now as on previous occasions, budgetary procedure should be adhered to and we, in the Opposition, should have an opportunity of considering these proposals in detail, as well as considering their general import.  Apparently, that does not suit the Government, and we have now to proceed at once to discuss this very serious statement and these very serious proposals of the Minister for Finance.  I think it is not in the best interests of the country, nor is it the best way of doing business, that that should be so.</P>

The position therefore is that, whilst we wished to have time to consider this and whilst we also thought that this was a third Budget proper to be considered in relation to Government policy as a whole, here it is being put in as if it were a little &ldquo;tilly&rdquo;, a little trifle, added on to the Estimate for the Department of Finance.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is not something to be thrown in and discussed with the other parts of the Estimate of the Department of Finance.

I accepted the Opposition's view that they might wish to wait until to-morrow to discuss it.  I accepted the Opposition's view that they might wish to have an opportunity of studying the proposals after there had been one Opposition speech, following on mine.  But I indicated that I thought, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach indicated, too, that the better way would be to introduce a Finance (Confirmation of Orders) Bill in the morning and that I would do so for the purpose of enabling the Opposition to deal with the matter now, leaving the general discussion of it over until then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a suggestion at about ten minutes past one to-day to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that we should take the Finance Estimates, with practically no debate; that we would then listen to the statement of the Minister for Finance, take the Estimate for C.I.E. &mdash;that to conclude at about 8.30 tonight&mdash;give the Taoiseach time to introduce his Estimate and then, we suggested, the Dáil might adjourn so that we could have a full debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate on general Government policy, with particular reference to the statement of the Minister for Finance.  The Parliamentary Secretary rang me up and, unless I am a fool altogether or did not hear him correctly, told me that the Government would not be satisfied with that.  He told me that the Taoiseach intended to refer&mdash;I suppose it is no harm to say it now&mdash;to emigration. I said I did not care what the Taoiseach referred to; our attitude would be that on the Taoiseach's Estimate, as in other years, we intended to deal with Government policy, with special reference to whatever the Minister for Finance would say to-day.  If that is agreed to now, <Col N="1608" /> after some misunderstanding, that is another matter.</P>

I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will bear me out in that.  He rang me at my house and said that that was not acceptable to the Government.  I referred him then to our office and, when I came back at about a quarter to three, I asked in the office if there had been any further word from the Taoiseach's office and I was told that there was not.

What was at issue was more or less the mechanics of it.  The last message I had from the Opposition was that we would resume discussion on this matter following the Opposition Whip's luncheon.

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not personally involved and I am giving the facts only as I was told them.  The position then is that we have this third Budget. Further taxes are about to be imposed and we got the rather astonishing proposal, in fact almost the threat, that if there was need for a further change, and further proposals of this character, they would be made while the Dáil was in Recess.  I say that the Government, in duty, is bound to bring back the Dáil, Recess or no Recess, to deal with matters of such importance. It is not right for the Government to deal with this important matter while the Dáil is in Recess.  We have a democratic system here, a representative democracy, and the Government is not all-powerful.  The Government is subject, from day to day, to control by the Dáil and we ought to insist that that position will be maintained.  I would say that it was a failure to act with good faith towards the Dáil, if the Government <Col N="1610" /> intended to deal with matters of this importance during the Recess.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the proposals, the statement was a very serious statement and the thought that passed through my mind was: how much better off this country would be if the gentlemen who make statements like it had made them when the danger was in the offing.  This is something which has continued in one form or another, or has threatened, since 1947. We are asked to criticise these proposals. Criticism is not likely to come very much from this side of the House for the simple reason that we have always been alive to the danger of inflation. We have always been alive to the danger of the frittering away of our external assets.  We have not regarded them as inexhaustible sources of supply.  We never thought it was wrong to tell the people, when they were consuming all that was being produced and even more, that we were living beyond our means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people who are making these statements to-day had any decency, they would put white sheets on themselves and go around the country to the places where they deceived the people, where they demoralised the people by preaching doctrines which were without real foundation.  The criticisms ought to come, if they are to come, from these very wise young economists, these people of vision, who were to be available for the Government to try to make two and two make five.  We have not got them to-day but the Government itself is not even united to-day.  We have some members of the Government going round, while the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are trying to warn the people and trying to get them to save and trying to get them to make up their minds&mdash;and they can be got to make up their minds, if they are properly led&mdash;to do the things which are necessary, if all that has been done in the past is not to be frittered away and lost, saying: &ldquo;Do not mind these people; there is nothing to be anxious about.  There is no really fundamentally serious situation at all.  There is just a little problem; there is no crisis.&rdquo;  We have three Ministers in <Col N="1611" /> the Government who on different occasions have either suggested, or told the people directly, when there was question of getting money, that this money was immediately available and no trouble about it.  Why does not the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance, get these people by the ears and tell them that they are not to go on in that way if they are going to be members of the Government, which is a serious task, if we are to get the country to face reality?  The people can be got to face reality and they will face it, if, on the one hand, there are not left the dregs of the demoralisation from which they cannot recover, and on the other, an attempt made by a Parliamentary Opposition to try to make political capital out of a fundamentally dangerous national situation.</P>
    <P>We are not attempting to do that; we would be ashamed to do that; but we believe that the present Government is not a fit Government to handle the situation.  We believe nobody will have confidence in a driver whose left hand is clutching the brake and whose right foot is stamping on the accelerator.  That is the position obtaining as we see it, when we look at some of the measures being taken by the Government.  There is no unity of purpose in the Government; there is a pulling in different directions. This is made evident even in this crisis by the conduct of some of the Ministers. I thought one thing had been learned by this Government, that is, that it is better to keep silent than to have different members going round talking with different voices, as took place under the first Coalition.</P>
    <P>Criticisms of these proposals, and of these measures, are not going to come from our side of the House.  We are waiting now to hear the people who used to talk about the unemployment that would be caused, and unemployment, as the Minister has admitted, will be caused and there is not the slightest doubt about it.  It will be caused by the fact that you have restriction of credit and restriction of imports which are necessary for development.</P>
    <P>You will have unemployment because <Col N="1612" /> less houses will be built and you will have in a number of respects things which were desirable being curtailed by the action proposed to be taken.  Where are these gentlemen now who used to talk to us about the fact that, by diminishing purchasing power, we were lowering the standard of living of the people, who used to tell us of the unemployment, and besides that, the emigration?  I was told that the Taoiseach would make his principal topic emigration.  Does he not know, as everybody knows, that restrictions of this sort are bound to result, as they have already resulted in the building industry, in unemployment and consequently in increased emigration?</P>
    <P>We will not have these people coming along now to make these statements. They went down the country where they could not be answered&mdash;they will not come in here&mdash;where they want to keep votes, and to get votes as they did before.  I know that some of them have not got as much brass as the people who can turn round and change their attitude without any trouble. Perhaps that can be said for them anyhow, that they are trying to continue in the line in which they were taught to believe.</P>
    <P>The dangers of a situation of this sort were to be seen back in 1947.  We had then, by Supplementary Budget, to try to face that situation.  We tried to face it by lowering the cost of living and so on by introducing subsidies.  We knew, of course, that subsidies, in a sense, would work in a contrary direction and produce inflation, but the most important thing at the time was to try to prevent an increase in the cost of living which would lead to demands for increased wages.  We introduced the subsidies to try to make things easy for the working section of our community.</P>
    <P>What was the way in which we were met?  We were told, when we put a tax on tobacco and so on, that we were in fact taxing essentials and that bread, butter, tea, sugar, and so on, were no less essential than the poor man's pint and the poor man's pipe of tobacco.  The people who were then talking about subsidies and the necessity <Col N="1613" /> for them when we introduced them to meet that particular situation in 1947&mdash;a situation which did not finally continue because of changes in world circumstances&mdash;are beginning again now.  At that time there was a likelihood that, when all the productive powers of the nations would be turned from war activities into peaceful directions, you would have a situation very different and everybody was getting new machinery and new goods to be out first in the race.  That likelihood of temporary inflation did not develop because of various world happenings.  A semi-war situation continued.  In 1947 there was in the balance of payments, roughly, a £30,000,000 deficit.  In the next year there was a £20,000,000 deficit.  Then it was £10,000,000; then it went up to £30,000,000 and then over £60,000,000.  Therefore, in a few years, we had incurred altogether a deficit of some £150,000,000 in our balance of payments which had to be met&mdash;and had to be met by a reduction of our net external assets.  We had a very serious situation to face in 1952 and we faced it successfully.  It is true that, to those who considered the Party advantage which they could derive from that situation, we gave a wonderful opportunity to go to the country and tell the people of our &ldquo;hair shirt policy&rdquo;.  Now we have austerity. I pointed out then that an austerity campaign is generally recognisable by a few features.  One is the imposition of taxation to an extent greater than is necessary to meet current expenditure so as to mop up purchasing power and to use the money for capital purposes. That is what is being done now. We did not have to do that.  We were able to get over the situation without doing that.  Here we have austerity with that particular feature well marked.</P>
    <P>We also pointed out that a feature of austerity would be a cutting-down of our capital programme.  It used to be very fashionable to talk of desirable projects being &ldquo;sacrificed to the sacred cow of sterling.&rdquo;  That used to be a favourite phrase at one time.  We never did, in fact, sacrifice any capital project that we thought was desirable in the national interest: we did not <Col N="1614" /> have to sacrifice it to the cow of sterling.  We were able to get the money in order to do it.  This is the first time since we set up the Dáil in 1919 that we have been met face to face with difficulties in raising the capital, in finding the capital necessary for projects that we thought would be desirable in the national interest.  It is facing you now because you cannot get capital.  These external resources are found to be very far from inexhaustible. We have a credit squeeze now which in its character is bound to have the consequences of preventing development and preventing production and preventing even some of the exports that might balance imports.</P>
    <P>The Government has to face the situation as we did: it has to face the situation that exists.  However much some of us detest this type of Government and the campaign by which they got into office and the demoralisation which the campaign has effected amongst our people, nevertheless, as the national interest is at stake, there is no other thing for us to do but to try to help the people to realise that the hardships have to be faced and that, as a nation, we have to tighten our belts and face up to the situation as we would face up to any national emergency.  I have great belief in our people.  They have faced emergencies before.  I am against external loans. I would rather go short of the things that would be got by an external loan than have an external loan.  The policy of self-reliance is the one policy that will enable our nation to continue to exist.  Back in 1917, we had to face the people who were telling us what we would lose by not being incorporated in the British Empire.  I remember well that we had to tell people down in Kilkenny: &ldquo;We have a choice.  It may be that we have the choice of the humble cottage instead of as lackeys partaking of the sops in the big man's house.&rdquo;  We are prepared to face what is necessary in order to have our independence in the cottage, if the cottage is necessary for that.  I do not believe it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I believe that, with our people definitely warned of the dangers and told what is to be done, our people will do it.  I believe we shall do it by <Col N="1615" /> relying on ourselves and not by putting ourselves in pawn to any foreign people or any foreign power.  Let us face up to the situation and be worthy of the past that has been transmitted to us. Let us not go begging in order to face this situation.  It is well within our powers.  Our means, fortunately, are not completely exhausted.  There are still enough external resources left&mdash;if we do not put an undue demand upon them&mdash;in order to meet an occasional demand which might be necessary.  Let us conserve these and see that they are conserved.  If we do that, we have no need whatever to be frightened about the situation.  Our people have only to be spoken to frankly by people they believe in&mdash;not by people who told them one thing yesterday and another thing the day before.  That is why I think it more than ever a responsibility on us, here in opposition, to tell the people of the situation and to give them the lead.  We feel it is necessary for people in whom the people believe to give this lead and to explain that this is a situation which, as a nation, we have to face up to and ask them to face up to it&mdash;and face up to it they will.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £120,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for payment of increases in certain pensions, etc., in respect of public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Estimate is to seek the approval of the Dáil for increases in the pensions of certain retired members of the public service and to permit the increases to be paid in advance of legislation.  Deputies will recall that in my recent Budget statement <Col N="1624" /> I outlined the increases intended and I mentioned that legislation to give effect to them was being prepared. Last week I introduced the Pensions (Increase) Bill but, as it would not be possible to have the Bill enacted in the present session, I would propose, on the authority of this Estimate, to pay the increases as they fall due, that is, with effect from 1st August next.  I intend to have the text of the Bill circulated during the recess.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the superannuation of State servants generally is determined by length of service and salary at retirement.  The cardinal principle is that an agreement has been made initially with the pensionable officer that when he retires his pension will be a due proportion of his retiring pay.  Nothing in this agreement implies any contractual obligation on the employer to increase the pension by reason of anything that may happen after a pension has been calculated and awarded in accordance with the agreement.  This principle was, however, modified exceptionally on two previous occasions&mdash;in 1947 and again in 1949, when certain pensions increases were granted to alleviate hardship caused to pensioners of long standing by steep rises in the cost of living.  Because of further advances in the interval for which serving employees of the State as well as other sections of the community were compensated, the Government decided at Budget time that a measure of relief should be afforded to public pensioners. This measure, weighted in favour of the lowest pensions and estimated to cost the State £180,000 in a full year, is the most that can be spared for the purpose in this time of stringency.</P>
    <P>The proposed increases will be payable with effect from 1st August, 1956, to certain retired civil servants and national and vocational school teachers; to retired and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and to certain former members of the Garda Síochána, as well as to the widows of such members.  The Estimate covers also certain ex-members of the Defence Forces in receipt of retired pay or pension, as well as certain recipients of wound or <Col N="1625" /> disability pensions or dependents' allowances under the Army Pensions Acts and the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts.  Finally, there is a sum representing the State's contribution towards corresponding increases in the pensions of certain former employees of local authorities.  In using the qualification &ldquo;certain&rdquo; I mean that the pensions to be increased will be those only of persons in the categories I have mentioned who retired before the operative date of the general pay increase of 1952, which for most classes was 1st November of that year.</P>
    <P>The following are the increases proposed: where the pension does not exceed £100 a year, 15 per cent.; if it exceeds £100 but not £125, an increase of £15; between £125 and £150 a year, 12 per cent.; between £150 and £200 a year, £18; over £200 but less than £300, 9 per cent.; and over £300 and less than £450, £27.  If the pension is over £450 a year, I propose to increase it now by 6 per cent., without imposing any ceiling.  A pension already increased under the Superannuation Act, 1947 or the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950 will be raised by the percentage or addition appropriate to the total amount already payable. There will be an overriding limit on the increases, so that no pensioner who retired before 1st November, 1952 will be given such an increase as would afford him a larger pension than a colleague's of equivalent service and salary who retired on or after 1st November, 1952, on a pension which reflected the pay increase of 1952.</P>
    <P>I should add that pensioned secondary teachers will receive the same treatment as pensioned national teachers.  The cost will be chargeable to the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Fund, subject to the necessary amendment of their pensions scheme.  I also propose to extend the benefit of the increases to recipients of widows' and children's allowances under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts and to the beneficiary under the Clerk of Seanad Éireann (Compensation) Act, 1939.  The latter pension has not been increased since it was originally granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> When this Estimate has been passed, revision of the pensions affected will be proceeded with as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>D'fhéadfainn é sin a thabhairt.  Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, tá údarás reachtúil san Acht Airí agus Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956, chun Roinn Rialtais faoi leith do bhunú don Ghaeltacht.  Leis an Meastachán atá á leagadh faoi bhráid na Dála anois agam, soláthrófar an t-airgead is gá chun an Roinn sin do chur ar a bonnaí.

Tá fiosrúchán á dhéanamh againn agus tá léirscáil á déanamh amach againn chomh maith agus is féidir.  Tá sé dá bhreathnú ag an bhfoireann atá ag an Roinn agus déanfad mo dhícheall chun an tOrdú a dhéanamh taobh istigh den mhí sin.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000,000 be granted to <Col N="1628" /> defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1952, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933); for certain Protective Equipment for Ships; for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide C.I.E. with funds to enable them to meet their capital requirements up to November next.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that provision was made in the Transport Act, 1955, to increase the long-term borrowing powers of C.I.E. to enable them to finance for the next few years capital expenditure on the dieselisation and reorganisation programme approved by the former Government in July, 1953, at an estimated cost of over £10,500,000. Delivery of substantial orders for diesel locomotives and other equipment placed under the programme is now being made and it is necessary that C.I.E. should have the necessary capital moneys available to meet contractual commitments.  Conditions in recent months have not been propitious for a stock issue, nor is the summer period the best time for a capital flotation.  In these circumstances, it is proposed that C.I.E. should postpone the stock issue until such time as the conditions are more favourable.  On present prospects, it would seem that a stock issue is unlikely during the current financial year.  Such an issue could obviously not take place while transport policy was under review.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to provide for an advance of £1,000,000 for C.I.E. under this Supplementary Estimate. This sum, together with anticipated revenue earnings during the summer period, will be sufficient to finance such payments as must be met on foot of the capital programme and necessary renewals and replacements over the next four months or so.  The advance <Col N="1629" /> will be repayable eventually out of the proceeds of a stock issue.  This Supplementary Estimate is, therefore, an interim measure to ensure that there will be no breakdown in the public transport system through the inability of C.I.E. to meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>In my reply to the debate on the Estimates in June, I referred to the deterioration in working results experienced by C.I.E. for the year ended 31st March, 1956.  With their high employment content and heavy fuel charges, railways are particularly vulnerable to increasing costs.  C.I.E. are under a statutory obligation to balance their budget.  There is, however, a point beyond which transport charges cannot go without incurring a loss of traffic, largely negativing the results of increased charges.  It looks as if this point may have been reached. As the House knows, there has been a phenomenal expansion of privately-owned road transport in recent years. This increased competition, taken in conjunction with the increases in the costs of railway operation, has all contributed towards the unfortunate reversal in the progress of C.I.E. towards solvency.  It has been suggested to me that some large concerns are at present considering the economics of providing their own transport.  Such a development would be unfortunate just at a time when new dieselisation equipment is being delivered and when the whole transport position is about to be examined by the committee to which I will refer later.  I would urge these undertakings to stay their hand, for the time being.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my reply to the debate on the Estimates that I had received a detailed memorandum from the chairman of C.I.E. on the present position of the undertaking.  I said that it was a grim report.  It is particularly grim in its conclusion that due to the expansion of privately-owned transport, there is little or no possibility of putting the railways on a self-supporting basis and that only Government action can prevent a collapse of public transport.</P>
    <P>Some may not accept this conclusion and may still be of the view that, with <Col N="1630" /> reorganisation and modernisation, C.I.E. can be put on a paying footing. This was the attitude of the previous Government and, until recent developments, of the present Government as well.  When the proposals for dieselisation and modernisation were drawn up by C.I.E. in 1953, it was estimated that the undertaking would be in a position to pay its way on completion of the programme.  These estimates were prepared on the basis that improved services, following dieselisation and modernisation, would have enabled C.I.E. to retain their existing volume of traffic and possibly to increase it.</P>
    <P>These estimates were based on the hope that a reasonable degree of stability in costs had been reached and that further increases in charges would not be necessary while the undertaking was being rehabilitated.  I understand that dieselisation, in so far as it has been implemented, has fully realised the economies which were originally claimed for it.  It yet remains to be seen to what extent C.I.E. are now likely to fall short of paying their way in the new circumstances.  If the conclusion that the C.I.E. transport undertaking cannot pay its way on the present basis is accepted, the Government are faced with one or other of three broad courses.  None of these courses would be palatable to the community at large, or to the particular interests they more immediately represent.  The three courses open, as I see them, are:&mdash; (i) the substantial pruning of the rail system; (ii) the subsidisation of railways by the Exchequer on a permanent basis; and (iii) the introduction of restrictions on private transport.</P>
    <P>None of these courses could be lightly embarked upon by any Government. Issues of importance to the public interest are involved.  The problem is not one for a hasty decision and I am not prepared to commit myself to any future transport policy without the fullest exploration of the problem first.  As the House is aware, I have already set up a committee to carry out a rapid appraisal of the position with the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To inquire into and review the <Col N="1631" /> developments in internal transport in recent years as they affect public transport undertakings; to consider what measures are necessary, in the light of those developments, to ensure the provision of the transport requirements of the country on a basis which will best serve the public interests; and to report thereon to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on or before 1st November, 1956.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As soon as the investigation is completed and the report available, I can assure Deputies that the Government will lose no time in considering whether any changes are necessary in transport policy.  Deputies will be afforded ample opportunity of considering the position. I may say that we have been extremely fortunate in securing men of outstanding ability, and all prominent in their specialised fields, who are prepared to give of their valuable time in carrying out the investigation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the report of this investigation must be awaited before considering any fundamental change in the dieselisation and reorganisation programme at present in course of implementation.  Meanwhile, there are unavoidable commitments to be met and the continuance of essential services must be assured.  It is in these circumstances that I ask the House to approve of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in regard to the C.I.E. financial position have been hopping from one foot to the other.  When we in Fianna Fáil were in office, we estimated that C.I.E. would require a certain capital sum and a certain annual subsidy for a number of years, in order to put them on a paying basis.  One of the expedients of this Government a year or two ago, in their efforts to present a favourable Budget to the people and to avoid the unpopularity of raising taxation, was to cut out the subsidy to C.I.E. and make them a repayable advance.  The Minister said in this House, as reported at column 538, Volume 149, of the Dáil Debates of the 23rd March, 1955:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" />&ldquo;The Estimate for Transport and Marine Services shows a reduction of £384,770 as compared with the year 1954-55.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Estimate, as Deputies know, had been prepared by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The reduction is due principally to a reduction in the provision for C.I.E.  The board of C.I.E. estimate that as a result of the change to diesel traction and the general reorganisation programme C.I.E. will within a few years be in a position to meet from their resources revenue charges other than interest on transport stock.  The prospects for complete solvency within a few further years appear to be good. Accordingly, the Government does not think it necessary that C.I.E. should continue to receive subsidy from the Exchequer to meet operating losses.  The relatively small sums likely to be needed to cover losses within the next few years should be found by short-term borrowing.  These borrowings will be guaranteed as necessary by the Minister for Finance under the Transport Act, 1950.  Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Estimate this year for the payment of subsidy to meet operation losses. The provision that was made in the Vote for 1954-55 for this item will not be utilised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The excuse the Minister gave on that date for cutting out the subsidy in that year has been found to be a very thin excuse indeed.  If the Government had faced up to their responsibilities then, the situation in regard to C.I.E. might have been much better and we would be nearer the time when the Dáil would not be asked for a subsidy to meet operation losses.  In order to get out of an immediate difficulty, the Government cut out the subsidy which would have to be raised by taxation just as they cut out the subsidy for rural electrification and a lot of other matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister dealt with the C.I.E. situation very briefly indeed in his Estimate.  If a situation like this <Col N="1633" /> were looming, the Minister should have known about it less than two months ago and have given the Dáil and the people of the country some indication as to its magnitude and he should have told how the Government were going to deal with it.</P>
    <P>On 20th June, just a month or so ago, the Minister, as reported in Volume 158, column 784, had this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Public transport concerns are particularly vulnerable to increasing costs.  Recent increases in wages and in the price of coal and other materials have resulted in a disimprovement of the financial position of C.I.E.  It has not been possible to recover these increased costs in full from the increase of 10 per cent. in rates and fares imposed during the year.  Moreover, increased charges invariably result in marginal loss of traffic.  The net loss of C.I.E., including interest on transport stock, for the year ended 31st March, 1955, was £866,535.  It now seems likely that the loss for the year ended 31st March last will be of the order of twice that figure.  C.I.E. are proceeding with their dieselisation and reorganisation plans and it is to be hoped that the present set back in the revenue position will prove to be a temporary swing only.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister in that speech indicated that the increased costs of wages and fuel were the cause of the difficulties of C.I.E.  Surely these costs had increased before the Budget was presented to the House by the Minister for Finance.  Yet, two months ago, the Minister for Finance gave us no indication that his Budget was phoney to the extent of £1,000,000 that would have to be provided for C.I.E. this year. There was not a word about this £1,000,000.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce complained in the speech I have read out about increases in wages&mdash;that the increase in C.I.E. running costs was largely due to increased wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is a statement the Minister has been making around the country rather frequently within the past couple of months.  He has been saying that one of the causes of our difficulties, which we are to debate tomorrow, is the increase in wages. Increases in wages were demanded by C.I.E. workers and others, simply because the Government did not live up to the promises they made a couple of years ago that they would decrease the cost of living and increase the real value of wages.  The Government were boasting, two years ago, that they would encourage the workers to compensate themselves for any increase in the cost of living.  Now the workers see that that offer has turned to gall and wormwood and that more money means just more trouble in the immediate future if national production and consumption are not in balance.  The Government are slightly changing their tune in regard to this matter, although they were boasting and encouraging people to look for these increases just a couple of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are now complaining about the results of increases in wages on the balance sheet of C.I.E. and other organisations, including the Government's balance sheets.  A transport committee has been set up to find out, in two months, about transport. That is just another way for the Minister to pass the buck, to avoid dealing with this situation and to avoid unpopularity by getting a few people to bear responsibility for the matter. This transport committee which the Minister is boasting about is to report on 1st November, a couple of months from now.  No committee could possibly learn in a couple of months as much as is now known about C.I.E. by the Government Departments and as is known by a number of other people throughout the country.  In my opinion, this setting up of the transport committee <Col N="1635" /> is an avoidance of the duty imposed upon the Minister of examining closely the transport position and of making proposals to the Dáil, on his own authority and responsibility, for an improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not advert to the fact that this Supplementary Estimate completely upsets the Budget introduced a couple of months ago by the Minister for Finance.  Surely to goodness, the Government, in a serious situation of this magnitude, should have been able to see at least two months before their noses.  I am afraid that we have all learned to expect very little from the Government in the line of reasonable foresight.  However, this is going a bit too far, even for the Coalition Government.  The Minister for Finance, in his statement to-day, made no advertence to the fact that he had underestimated expenses for the coming year to the tune of £1,000,000 for C.I.E.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be able to give some indication, when he is replying, as to what proportion of the £1,000,000 which is sought now is required for capital purposes and what proportion is being provided to meet the current deficits in the running of C.I.E. for the year. In capital purposes, I include naturally the dieselisation programme as forming part of the capital development of the company.  It would be unwise at this stage to enter into any serious discussion as to the future of the transport system, inasmuch as we will have, by November, presumably, the report of the committee the Minister has set up.  Unlike Deputy Aiken, I am glad that the Minister is taking the advice of a committee of the type he has set up, as a committee of that kind is more likely to take a broader view of the problem and its recommendations and likely to carry more weight than if it were merely a governmental decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three other matters I should like to mention, more for the purpose of bringing <Col N="1636" /> them to the notice of the committee which has been set up than for the purpose of getting any action taken on them immediately.  As the Minister is aware, I have during the year complained on a number of occasions as to the very vast quantity of imports which were being made by C.I.E.  I complained mainly on the basis that it did appear that a substantial proportion of the imports included finished goods which could have been either manufactured wholly or finished here. I know that C.I.E. said that that was not the case, but I do not know what the Minister's attitude is in regard to it.  I am satisfied that in some cases at least finished goods were imported which could have been finished here.</P>
      <P>However, I am mentioning it now from another point of view.  I have a feeling, from a number of things I heard, that on occasions C.I.E. have&mdash; like, I suppose, most big concerns&mdash; ordered very substantial quantities of material that was not absolutely essential.  I understand that part of the programme of renovation of C.I.E. includes some 3,000 new wagons.  Do we really need 3,000 new wagons?  If we do need them, is it necessary to import 3,000 new wagons?  Could not some of those lost wagons on the various sidings of C.I.E. have been renovated and put into use again?  I am not an expert, but I should have thought that a railway wagon included many components whose life was practically unending&mdash;wheels, axles, and a lot of heavy material.  I understand that the practice is to sell those as scrap rather than to re-utilise them. I mention that so that this matter may be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the work which the new committee is undertaking, I wonder would the Minister ask the committee to take into account also the position of the canals.  The canals have, to a large extent, been brushed aside, if I may say so, by C.I.E. since it took over.  I notice that in some instances the canal agents in different provincial centres have been instructed by the company not to canvass for traffic for the canal.  Water transport remains one of the cheapest forms, and it would be well if the committee could take <Col N="1637" /> into account the position of the canals in making a review of the whole transport position.</P>
    <P>From the broader point of view, I have felt, and felt at the time, too, that we paid insufficient attention to the proposals contained in the Milne Report, particularly the proposals for joining road, permanent way and canal authority and placing the permanent way, the canals and the roads on one footing.  I should like to suggest that copies of the Milne Report and these proposals should be furnished to the committee and that it might with advantage have a look at the proposals. After all, the Milne Commission was set up, I think, in 1948 or 1949, largely to deal with many of the problems with which this committee will have to deal. It would be useful, possibly, if this committee had a look at this report and was in a position to express its views as to its broad outlines.</P>
    <P>I just want to make these few remarks more for the sake of drawing the attention of the committee to them than to make a definite contribution on transport policy at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have ground for complaint that an Estimate of this magnitude is introduced a day before the Dáil proposes to adjourn, since no previous notice had been given.  As recently as the discussion on the Industry and Commerce Vote, no indication was given by the Minister that such a large sum of money would be needed.</P>
      <P>Apparently, Deputy MacBride has more confidence in a committee or commission being set up to deal with this problem than with the Government and the Minister who, I am sure, is closely in touch with the matter.  It would be extraordinary if the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not thoroughly <i>au fait</i> with all the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it is 30 years since we had legislation dealing with the railways in this House.  I remember Deputy McGilligan, now Attorney-General, telling us as Minister for Industry and Commerce some time in the 1930's how the situation of the railways had deteriorated even as far back as then, <Col N="1638" /> before they had such a formidable competitor as the road transport vehicles that we now have in such huge numbers on our roads.  The present Government, when they were in office earlier, set up the Milne Commission, which made recommendations regarding our public transport system, from the point of view of trying to save the railways and preserve the employment they gave.</P>
    <P>They made a recommendation that there should be a fundamental reconsideration of the problem of our highways, and of the burdens that the railway companies have to carry in maintaining the permanent way and maintaining heavy staffs, as compared with the facilities which the public authorities give to motor transport in the provision of modern roads and heavy capital expenditure year after year.  That, I think, was the main recommendation of the commission. There were other substantial adjustments recommended in order to secure better administration, more economy and more efficiency.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether the Minister is satisfied that the board has carried out all these suggestions.  He has stated that he has had a memorandum which he described as being of a grim character and, judging by the references in the Press to the condition of C.I.E. and the fact that the chairman or some other member of the board mentioned that a figure of, I think, £50,000,000 had been invested in motor transport in this small State, the outlook, as he indicated, was very pessimistic.  He suggested that it was lacking in any prospect of getting the railways back to the period of comparative prosperity they had before we had this tremendous increase in motor transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that there are three alternatives&mdash;I do not know whether the present Supplementary Estimate may be taken as coming under the head of one of them&mdash;that would not commend themselves to the public.  If we have to wait for the public to express itself on this or on any other serious situation affecting a body like C.I.E., which is of such importance to our economy, it is really <Col N="1639" /> passing the buck.  It is simply evading the responsibility that the Minister and the Government should have.  The House has a right to know what steps have been taken to try to secure better results in the running of the concern, what steps have been taken to improve the management, to try to reduce operating costs, and what measures have been taken to try to secure traffic. One would have preferred if, during the winter period when arrangements are being made for the summer season and for the tourist traffic, all arrangements would be made and that the financial provisions for the following season should be clearly envisaged.</P>
    <P>Those who have had experience of travelling in the diesel trains have expressed great satisfaction with their comfort, celerity and convenience.  The only pity is that from prominent persons, as for example, members of this House, C.I.E. does not get the support that it should get.  According to a report in the English Press, a gentleman had the temerity, when going to report on the strike in England, to travel in a Volkswagen to the Standard Works.  He was very lucky to have escaped.  That is as incongruous as the action of those who are interested in C.I.E., who remember the national spirit shown by railwaymen in the past when they downed tools and refused to carry British soldiers and their arms in the Black and Tan days, and the excellent national spirit they displayed always. We know that railwaymen had been always among the lowest paid workers. Probably that was due to the circumstance that, in the first instance, railways were not as suitable for this country, which had no large centres of population, no large industries or heavy traffic, as they were for even smaller but highly industrialised and more intensively populated countries, as, for instance, Belgium.</P>
    <P>With the development of motor transport, I am afraid that, unless very serious efforts are made by the board to recapture traffic, in areas like those west of the Shannon, commercial vehicles will get, not merely the major <Col N="1640" /> portion of the business, but the whole of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance warned us in his Budget statement that we would not know until September what the position would be regarding the G.N.R.  That will be the end of the financial year.  With regard to the £1,000,000 which the Minister is now seeking to cover deficiencies in the present year, we would all like to know what proportion of that is to go towards capital equipment, what is the actual position regarding the capital equipment programme, to what extent has it been possible to carry into operation the programme to which the Minister referred in this House and which was initiated by his predecessor. Is it through by 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. or how does it stand, and what proportion of this £1,000,000 can be fairly described as going to meet the commitments on the dieselisation programme and what proportion towards trying to cover losses, until, as we hope, better times may come for C.I.E.?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>C.I.E. are now providing a first-class service.  All passengers admire the extraordinary advances that have been made in the past five or six years.  Foreigners, particularly, whom I meet on the trains, compliment and congratulate us on the kind of railways we run.  It is a matter of great regret that, with that obvious improvement to all of us, the financial situation is still unhappy and is becoming even more gloomy.  I think it will require compulsion to put traffic on to the railway and the Minister will have to face that eventually.  In that kind of traffic, I would include T.D.s. I have said ten times in this House, and I repeat, that T.D.s should be compelled to travel by the national railway service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission which the Minister has set up has been extremely well chosen.  He has drawn on very unusual sections.  They are people who are very large goods users of the railways, who are vitally interested in the maintenance of the railways and in getting good value from the railways, and who will bring a fresher mind to the <Col N="1641" /> problem than would be the case if the Minister had set up a completely technical kind of commission.  I do hope that the commission will report quickly and that they will be efficient, but the Minister must tell this commission that we have to keep this railway, that we have to get more traffic off the roads and on to the railway and must get more goods and more people and, I repeat, more T.D.s.  They do not count so much, but it is very bad example if Deputies do not use this service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister's statement and from reports elsewhere that the Minister has set up a commission to inquire into the set-up of C.I.E.  In my opinion, that is long overdue.  The only feature of it that makes me rather doubtful about the whole business is that in recent years we have had a habit of dealing with thorny problems by setting up commissions and, very often, when the report of a commission is published, it is filed and the dust of years is allowed to accumulate on it. Very often, the setting up of a commission gives an opportunity to any Government to shelve a particularly delicate problem.  I only hope that when the Minister set up this commission, there was no such ulterior motive in his or the Government's mind.</P>
      <P>There is very little I wish to say at this stage on the whole problem of C.I.E.  We could go on talking about it here for the next three or four hours. I agree with Deputy Barry that the service given to passengers at the moment in the diesel trains is comfortable, luxurious, speedy and punctual. I have nothing to say against C.I.E. in that regard, but that is only one aspect of their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the manner in which C.I.E. conduct road freight and road traffic requires investigation.  If the Minister can give this commission any direction, he should direct them to have a look at the set-up in C.I.E. headquarters.  If you want to get at any particular trouble, you must go to the root of the matter; and I believe the first place that should be made the subject of closest investigation is the <Col N="1642" /> headquarters, including the present board, of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>A few minutes ago, Deputy Derrig, in a rather jocose manner, pointed out he was surprised to see a trade unionist in Britain this week, in the course of the motor strike, driving around&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a trade unionist&mdash; a B.B.C. reporter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a Volkswagen at a time of crisis like this, taking note of what was happening.  It is quite possible that a number of people closely associated with the strike in Britain&mdash;people such as the workers in factories&mdash;are also the owners of motor cars and that they drive up to take part in the strike in their own cars.</P>
      <P>I want to say this to the Minister: C.I.E. are looking for £1,000,000 here, and this House to-day listened to a long list of restrictions imposed on commodities in general, in view of the very serious crisis facing the country. The members of the House have to tighten their belts; other members of the community have to tighten their belts; but the head men in C.I.E. do not have to tighten their belts.  Only very recently a new Mercedes car, at a cost of £2,000, was given to the chairman of C.I.E. as a replacement for his previous car.  That is only one example of what is taking place.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I would like this commission to have a look at the work these higher officials are supposed to be doing, and to have a look at the number of officials who, in order to cushion themselves and to justify their own existence, have set up more positions.  From inquiries I made, I discovered that recently, as a result of an outsider being appointed as traffic manager, a number of new appointments was made within a short space of time.  I should like the Minister to have this commission inquire into whether it is absolutely essential to have all these high officials directing the activities of C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To help this traffic manager, we now have an assistant operating superintendent. Along with him, we have a commercial superintendent and we have <Col N="1643" /> an assistant commercial superintendent; we have an omnibus manager and we have an assistant omnibus manager; we have a road freight manager and we have an assistant road freight manager.  We have an assistant indoor road freight manager and an assistant outdoor road freight manager. While that has been going on, one of the key men at the top in one of those groups has spent the greater part of his time for the past two or three years sitting on interview boards checking on the qualifications of youngsters coming up from the country to sit for examinations, and in many cases these appointments have already been promised to friends, relations or other people already in the employment of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to get the commission to inquire into this.  It is too bad if the axe does not apply equally to those people in the cushioned protected jobs, especially when a number of the workers in C.I.E. are to be laid off.  If the Minister tells us that C.I.E. have reduced the number of their employees, where do we find the reductions to have taken place?  Is it at the headquarters?  At is down the country&mdash;it is the men at the end of the line.  They are the people being let off while the people in the cushioned jobs are the last to go. It will take a very strong Minister or a very expert commission to make the necessary recommendations&mdash;recommendations that this House can back up&mdash;to see that these people are removed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out here&mdash; I only partly heard him&mdash;that there was a danger of some big concerns going into road transport.  They are not going into it; they are already in it.  We have one of the biggest semi-State companies at present in direct competition with C.I.E.  I am referring to the sugar company&mdash;a company run by one who, in his own mind, is the future saviour of this country.  If the Minister requires evidence of that, he has only to go to Arigna in the West of Ireland.  The sugar company are taking their coal from Arigna up to the Tuam factory.  They have been doing that for the past couple of years. The coal was originally taken by the narrow gauge railway, first of all, and <Col N="1644" /> from there to Tuam.  The sugar company decided that they would put eight-ton or nine-ton lorries on the road, with big trailers attached, and take the coal direct from Arigna themselves. Is that not a nice example for one State company to be setting for another?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible to the House for both companies, but it looks to me as if his right hand does not know what his left hand is doing, because here we have two State companies in direct competition with each other.</P>
    <P>A bigger difficulty I see is the outrageous cost of the upkeep of roads. We have these very heavy vehicles&mdash; between trailer and all up to 16 or 18 tons&mdash;passing over secondary and third-class roads, for the upkeep of which the local authorities are responsible.  To repair these roads means more money from the rates and more money from the Department of Local Government.  I will reserve much of my material in connection with C.I.E. until we hear the report of this commission, but as I see it at present, C.I.E. is a monument to inefficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must start on the basis that the railways are an essential national transport service and must be preserved at all costs. From the very outset, I contended in this House that the bus services and the C.I.E. lorries should be supplementary rather than competitive services. I still hold the same view.  Many of these services are running on parallel routes to the trains.  The whole transport system of the country should be a single unit with each part fitting into place.  Had that been done, we should not now have half the redundancy there appears to be in our transport services.  Had that been done, redundant employees could have been transferred from the railway service to comparable employment in the road services. Again, there was no real necessity in most cases to have separate offices for these employees.  Existing railway buildings could have been used.  The fact is that people were priced out of the railways by rising costs.  I remember in my young days loads of merchandise arriving at the <Col N="1645" /> local stations.  The gates closed at half-past six and those who were not lucky enough to have their merchandise accepted that day had to take it back again to their own premises and join the queue again the following day. That could have been avoided by employing more staff or paying a little overtime to existing staff; but that was not done.</P>
      <P>What did these disappointed potential railway users do?  They decided to provide their own transport service. They decided to put their own lorries on the road.  I am reminded in this connection of what Deputy Barry said a moment ago about Deputies and motor cars.  When I represented a city constituency, I did not use a motor car. A Deputy representing a rural constituency must give service to his constituents. It was for that purpose they elected him.  He has no other means of transport in order to reach scattered areas other than his motor car.  Remember, he must meet his constituents and discuss their problems with them.  He may have to do that at an hour when their business is over and their day's work is done.  If he has a car, he can use it to suit his own convenience and the convenience of his constituents.</P>
      <P>Here in the City of Dublin, if a Deputy has to call to Coláiste Caoimhin in connection with the affairs of an Old I.R.A. man and has to depend on buses to get him there, he will be all day going out and coming back again.  If he has his own car, he can call at the Department of Local Government on the way to seek information about roads, houses, or grants of one kind or another.  He can go on then and do any other work he has to do with other Departments.  He can visit the Forestry Branch of the Department of Lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reorganisation of our transport service is crying out for immediate attention.  The problem is a big one.  It will not be easy to turn people from the system to which they have become accustomed.  That will not be done in a month or two months, a year or two years.  In my young days, the ordinary working man could take his family to the seaside for an evening at a reasonable cost.  Now the same outing will cost him the greater part of his week's wages.  It will cost him that to take his family from Cork to Youghal, or elsewhere. The railways are killing the system by ever-increasing costs.  They are driving the people into cheaper and more convenient ways of travelling.  Heavy charges are now falling on the taxpayers because of the inefficiency and the lack of foresight of the railways over the years.  The railways failed to appreciate the trend of events and to make provision to meet that trend; all they did was to increase charges to try to recover losses on their own inefficient service.  They failed to see that, because people were leaving them, there must be something wrong. They failed to appreciate that they were losing merchandise.</P>
      <P>The question now is what will we do to improve matters and give the people the services they require? Why has all this costly equipment been bought?  Perhaps, as Deputy McQuillan said, it is futile to be discussing these matters at this juncture. Let us wait for the report of those who are examining it and see what suggestions they have to make.  The railways are so vital from the point of view of the employment provided that we should co-operate to the fullest extent to ensure that there is a proper system of operation and a proper policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride has said that it appears to him that there are carriages and wagons lying idle on railway sidings which could be put into good condition.  We have excellent, skilled men here who do a good job when they are asked to do it.  It would be infinitely better to recondition this <Col N="1647" /> stock than to import new stock. C.I.E., which cannot balance its own finances and which is upsetting the national economy from that point of view, should not indulge in huge importations of rolling stock when existing stock could be reconditioned, with benefit to the balance of payments and the unemployment situations.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of excursions during the summer months. The ordinary man who cannot afford a car is anxious to get on the railways, or the buses, with his family, but it is beyond his means to do so.  Just for one afternoon trip, he will have to pay practically a whole week's wages, if he has a substantial family to take with him.  That was not the position.  As far as the railway excursions were concerned, the idea was to attract the people and provide the services they needed.  They should have more frequent services, perhaps with smaller vehicles.  They could perhaps have diesel trains of the size suited to the business available rather than run large, heavy trains, half empty. Whether the train is empty or full, it is going to run on schedule and the cost is mounting up all the time.  They must remodel the whole system in great measure if they are to do what they ought to do to meet the needs of the travelling public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister deserves the sympathy of this House because of the initial fact that the C.I.E. problem is one of the Fianna Fáil death duties which he had to undertake when he took office as Minister. He is to be complimented on the manner in which he has discharged the very onerous task of trying to keep this concern in operation.  Deputy McQuillan mentioned that some semi-State or State bodies were in the process of changing over from the use of C.I.E. transport to their own transport. The commission which has been set up might very well give some thought to the situation which exists, and has existed, whereby our semi-State and State bodies are being protected by statute in their activities, so far as the running of these concerns <Col N="1648" /> has operated over the last number of years.</P>
      <P>It has been advanced, and will be advanced, that in organisations such as C.I.E., there must be boards which are autonomous and which can operate in such a fashion as will bring them as near as possible to economic self-sufficiency. There has been a tendency to push that theory a little too far.  In C.I.E. it has become evident that certain sections of the transport system are paying and paying very well&mdash;principally the bus services in the City and County of Dublin.  The losses occur on the railways throughout the country and very largely it could be said that the losses are due to the fact that branch lines have to be maintained to service rural areas and towns for the transport of goods to facilitate merchants and farmers.  But we have a very anomalous and unfair position due, not to any fault of the Minister but to the fact that the board has been pursuing the policy, as, by statute, it is entitled to do, that the workers and housewives in this city have been paying increased fares and have been, in effect, subsidising the people living in the provinces who are far better able to pay transport charges than they are.  Builders' labourers, labourers of all kinds and tradesmen, living, for instance, in Ballyfermot, on £6 or £7 a week, have to pay a transport bill of £1 or more, as well as very high rents, in order to go to work and in order that their womenfolk may go into the shopping centres and their children to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the country we are making every effort to make it easy for the people who have benefited most by the progressive agricultural policy of this country, both during the last couple of years and in the first period of inter-Party Government.  The people who benefited most were the farmers and merchants in the small market towns to whom prosperity overflowed from the agricultural community.  It is wrong that we should be providing not a cheap service, but a cheaper service than there would necessarily be, if this subsidy from the city were not available. I am quite sure that the Minister will place this point, and all the other points which will be raised, <Col N="1649" /> before the Commission which has been appointed&mdash;that no law of equity can be cited to support the case that the people who were hardest hit in so far as prices are concerned in this city and county and who are paying higher bus fares, should be asked to subsidise the rural and provincial areas.  If profit is being made, as it is, that profit should be so utilised as to reduce bus fares, and particularly the fares of the workers who have to travel long distances, from new housing schemes in places like Finglas and Crumlin and other areas.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Estimate does show that we are heading for a very difficult situation and one which is completely unenviable for the Minister. Like Deputy MacCarthy, I deprecate the remarks of Deputy Barry in regard to the T.D.s.  I think it is silly to suggest that T.D.s, by using the railways, could make any impression on the situation.  I do not think we have arrived at the position in this country where the example of T.D.s can be said to be taken by very large numbers of people.  I think, with Deputy MacCarthy, that any T.D. who goes about doing his business properly, whether he represents a city or county constituency, must be mobile in order to get where he wants quickly and, very often, to get out of where he is quickly.  The contribution in regard to T.D.s is one which will not find very much support.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate what the Minister says in regard to its being premature to expect major changes in the transport policy, until such time as the commission has reported. I think it is quite correct to say that the constitution of that commission lends hope of its being efficient, speedy and reliable.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider, very strongly, the problem of transport in the City of Dublin as an entirely separate problem from the rest of the C.I.E. problems.  Normally speaking, when people are discussing these problems, they classify them under three headings&mdash;the railways, road freight and road passenger services.  I very strongly appeal to the Minister, when <Col N="1650" /> he is considering this as a general problem, to add a fourth, that is, one single item which has to be dealt with, and I think probably has to be changed, transport in Dublin City itself.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Rooney who, on the Minister's Estimate, recently suggested that some thought should be given to the possibility of seatless buses.  I do not know what technical or other objections to that there may be or what advantages there may be. To the layman, the ordinary advantages are obvious.  All sorts of ideas occur to one in regard to the situation: chartered buses from a transport authority by factories, school buses, and so on.  However, what is to be done must be done by treating this, not as part of a large organisation, not as a reorganisation applicable to the country as well as to the city and not as a reorganisation applicable to other large towns or cities but as a special problem which arises in Dublin City and which must be treated separately for the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>There must be considerable attraction in the idea that if to any extent the economies which arise from having all our transport in one body, as we have now, can be offset, any real drastic reorganisation of our transport machinery should involve the setting-up of a separate transport authority for Dublin City.  There are obvious advantages and temptations in the idea of setting up a municipal transport authority in Dublin.  Outside this country, we have examples of places where the financial problems of a large city have to a very great extent been solved by setting up a municipal transport authority.  That may be quite unsound, having regard to the size of Dublin and the desirability of centralisation of our transport services in one transport authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are approaching the stage when the cost, frequency and routing of ordinary buses in Dublin City is a major social problem.  A large number of the difficulties now arising with regard to the location and planning of housing and also with regard to the planning and building of schools in Dublin springs from transport problems. While not suggesting that this <Col N="1651" /> is the stage at which we could discuss in any detail possible future changes in C.I.E. or transport in this country, I appeal to the Minister very specially to get his commission to report&mdash;and to consider their report&mdash;on the basis that transport within the City of Dublin by ordinary buses or otherwise is a completely separate problem which must be separately thought of, separately dealt with and separately cured from any other transport problem in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day the Minister has come to the Dáil with another sad story from C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The same sad story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a strange fact that we have had to listen many times to another failure on the part of C.I.E. It was hoped that, given charge of their own affairs, they would make a success on this occasion of the management of their transport service.  I am very much in favour of the views expressed by Deputy Finlay in relation to the possibility of having the traffic of Dublin City and County treated on a separate basis, to let the remainder of the country face up to its losses and to let us pay the losses in respect of the area where losses are sustained, instead of hiding the losses by asking travellers in Dublin City and County to subscribe more than is necessary in order to provide the service within the areas where those other passengers are carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of having the possibility examined of bus services operating to rail heads, instead of having the bus running perhaps from Dublin to Cork alongside the railway line from Dublin to Cork&mdash;instead of that situation, to have only the one method of transport from one place to another.  I know there will be arguments in favour of the points in rural areas which the buses can reach and which cannot be reached by the railways, but, there again, I suggest they should be in operation to the rail head, in the form of a station, instead of the situation where people in a town can choose between travelling by bus or train and <Col N="1652" /> each of them going to the same destination.</P>
    <P>I know there are technical objections and possibly also there is the experience of other countries in relation to the use of seatless buses.  At rush hours, there is a large volume of city traffic to be catered for within a limited time.  It refers particularly to people going to business in the mornings, trying to return at lunch hour and then back to the office again, and going home in the evening from their business.  These are the rush periods which we must cater for by providing what could be regarded as a reasonably efficient and prompt service for the people desiring to avail of our public transport.  With long queues of people waiting for a bus to take them to the outer districts of the city, many of the more active people are compelled to stand in long queues or stand in bad weather waiting their turn for a fairly substantial time in order to secure the necessary transport to bring them to their homes from their place of work.  I feel we should try to cater for that very large volume of traffic that becomes available within a short time at the rush periods.  I feel that if C.I.E. could cater for those people, they would encourage a very much larger number of people to avail of the public transport system.</P>
    <P>Many people are compelled to use bicycles because they cannot depend on the bus services to bring them in time in the morning from the end of a queue to their work or to bring them home and back again to their work at the lunch period and home again in the evening after business hours.  I feel the problem in relation to Dublin City and County which requires to be investigated is different from that in relation to other parts of the country. The very heavy losses being sustained in respect of the provincial services are a different problem and may have to be treated in a different way.</P>
    <P>In addition to the losses being sustained, so far as passenger traffic is concerned, we must also face up to the fact that very heavy losses are being sustained by C.I.E. in the sphere of general haulage.  If we examine why C.I.E. are losing heavily in the matter <Col N="1653" /> of merchandise transport and general haulage, it is obvious that C.I.E. are in a different position from the general haulage contractor or private haulier, because, as it stands at the moment, if C.I.E. are requested to transport from Dublin to Cork the smallest item we can imagine that would be carried in the ordinary way and delivered to its place of destination, we can see that only C.I.E. would take, over that long distance from the place of origin to the place of destination, these trivial articles at what is certainly a remarkably low price.</P>
    <P>C.I.E., by carrying all these trivial articles over long distances from the place of origin to the place of destination at these very reasonable charges, are, in fact, in the long run imposing a heavy burden on the taxpayer and on the general public.  They certainly provide the service for the individual who desires to have the small article brought from one place to another, but is it fair to the general public and is it the kind of service which the general public demand?  Would they be prepared, for instance, to shoulder the inconvenience involved in having that article delivered to the nearest railway station as it used to be?</P>
    <P>Nowadays, when an article is consigned from one place to another, it is usually brought to its destination possibly by a road lorry from a railway station perhaps six or eight miles away.  The person sending the article pays for the cost of the transport and possibly the man getting the article at the other end pays for it.  In any case, it gets from door to door and it very often arrives there with a heavy loss. The delivery of several of these trivial articles involves lorries working overtime, staff working overtime and being paid double time, extra time and for night work.  Several different kinds of extra charges are incurred by the necessity imposed on C.I.E. of getting the article from one place to another.</P>
    <P>Although C.I.E. is providing a very good service in regard to the delivery of that class of article for the public in general, we will have to discontinue the operation of such uneconomic services.  There is a large volume of heavy and bulky traffic which can be <Col N="1654" /> handled economically by C.I.E., but I think that people interested in the delivery of the smaller articles should not be allowed to impose to such a great extent heavy losses on the merchandise haulage provided by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I feel they would appreciate that and would not be unreasonable if it were pointed out that it was uneconomical to carry an article from door to door instead of to a certain centre where it could be collected.  In the past, those articles were collected at a centre, usually at the nearest railway station, and the person to whom an article was consigned usually got a telegram or a postcard telling him that the article concerned was due to arrive at such and such a railway station at such and such a time and could be collected.  If we could cut out a lot of that kind of road haulage, losses could be cut down considerably.</P>
    <P>In any case, there is a feeling, too, amongst the people who are obliged to avail of C.I.E. lorries in the form of general haulage that they do not get the good service they can get from the private individual who has his lorry and services available for hire.  Not alone is he prepared to take the goods safely from one place to another, but he is also prepared to take a certain measure of responsibility for the safe arrival of such articles and the condition of the articles when they arrive.</P>
    <P>There are frequent examples of firms hiring a private lorry and hiring a C.I.E. lorry to travel a distance of perhaps 100 or 150 miles.  They have shown frequently that the private haulier has done a better job than the C.I.E. lorry.  The C.I.E. lorry has taken longer to get the live stock, or whatever the commodity may be, to its destination.  It arrived in a poor condition compared with the live stock or other commodity carried in a lorry owned by a private haulage contractor.</P>
    <P>Personal interest in carrying the goods in the private lorry is a great advantage to the persons who are interested in the safe transport of those goods.  It is difficult to suggest any remedies, but it is true that people get a cheaper and better service from the private lorry than from the C.I.E. <Col N="1655" /> lorry.  The personal element enters into the matter to a greater extent and the individual finds it more economic to get large quantities of goods transported by private lorry than by public transport.</P>
    <P>I will not say that in many cases the C.I.E. charges are excessive.  They are not.  Very frequently, it is found that the charges imposed by C.I.E. for the transport of certain classes of goods are very reasonable.  It is usually the time involved that the people depending upon the safe delivery of the goods are more concerned with.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that occurred to me.  It seems to me that the organisation of the city bus service could be improved.  Any of us who take the trouble to watch buses passing along our streets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As the Minister himself has said, this is just one more occasion when the taxpayers are being asked in the Dáil to help on C.I.E. in the manner in which we have helped them on in the past to meet losses and are still finding it difficult to understand why, in all these years, they have not yet found a system and devised a method whereby they could provide efficient and economic services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just returned from Kingsbridge with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Deputy Carew, from an interview with the Chairman of C.I.E.  I do not want to refer to anything which took place at that meeting, which was purely in regard to the redundancy which has taken place in Limerick.  However, I think the Minister, in his speech here to-day, made some very extraordinary statements.  In the first place, in the first paragraph, he said the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate was to provide C.I.E. with funds to enable them to meet their capital requirements up to November next.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it or not, but this £1,000,000 will not enable C.I.E. to meet their capital requirements until next November.  The position is, as the Minister is well aware, that there are dismissals taking place in Inchicore, in Limerick and in other places.  If the money is there for the capital requirements of C.I.E., I respectfully submit that there is no need for these sackings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take one small instance, the wagon-building programme of C.I.E. That is a capital requirement and the money comes out of capital moneys.  I admit that a very small portion of it <Col N="1657" /> may be obtained from revenue but, taken on the whole, the wagon-building programme of C.I.E. is a capital expenditure and a capital requirement. If the Minister states here to-day in the House that C.I.E. are being provided with sufficient funds up to next November, what is the reason for the dismissals of these workers in Inchicore, wagon builders and the labourers attending on those wagon builders?</P>
    <P>In reply to a question to-day, the Minister informed me that he understood that the Board of C.I.E. in recent weeks had been obliged, on grounds of redundancy, to dispense with the services of 28 of their temporary employees at Limerick.  I do not know who gave the Minister that information, but certainly it was not on the grounds of redundancy: it was on the grounds of lack of finance and lack of finance only.  There would not be one dismissal in Inchicore and there would not be one man sacked in Limerick, last week or the week before, or next week, if the company had sufficient moneys on hands.  They have to cut their capital programme.  Therefore, it is wrong and misleading, I respectfully submit, for the Minister to state that he has given them enough funds, that this £1,000,000 will enable them to meet their capital requirements up to November next.</P>
    <P>The Minister went further than that and said that the engagement and dismissal of staff were administrative functions and as such were matters for the Board of C.I.E.  He said: &ldquo;Subject to this and without prejudice to the discretion which must finally remain with the board, I have made known to the board my desire that in so far as may be practicable, any reductions in staff that may be necessary from time to time should be effected from normal wastage.&rdquo;  They are not doing that; they are not carrying out the Minister's wish.  They are unable to carry out the Minister's wish, and I have no doubt that he is sincere in the representations he has made to the board.  They are unable to carry out his wishes, due to the fact that they have no money.</P>
    <P>In his reply to me to-day, the <Col N="1658" /> Minister stated that they had dismissed 28 of their temporary employees.  I wonder if the Minister is aware that next Friday the dismissals in Limerick cover permanent employees; and that permanent employees are being sacked from Inchicore next Friday, employees who have given long and faithful service to C.I.E.  They are being let go now; they are being refunded&mdash;I do not know if the Minister is aware of it &mdash;the money they have paid into the pensions fund.  Does that look as if this is a temporary measure?  Does it look as if they will be taken back in a few months' time?</P>
    <P>I admit that there might be some justification for the release of temporary men.  The men were very fair about it themselves.  They understood the position.  It has happened on a previous occasion that some temporary employees were let go and then taken back at another period of the year. However, here now in Inchicore and Limerick for the first time, we have the permanent staff being let go, being handed back the money that down through the years they have paid into the pension fund.  It would be a different thing if the Board of C.I.E. said: &ldquo;Well, we may have to let you go for three or four months, but leave the money there in the pension fund until then and we will review the position.&rdquo;  But this is a break and not alone that, not alone is it the intention evidently of the board reluctantly to dismiss these permanent and temporary employees and not alone have they handed them back their pension money, but they have given them passes, in the case of those men who are going to England.  I wonder is the Minister aware of that?</P>

Perhaps some other Deputies would be better occupied if they fought for their own constituencies as we did. The Minister, pointing out in his speech that the summer was not propitious for going to the country for a public issue of stock, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In these circumstances it is proposed that C.I.E. should postpone the stock issue until such time as the conditions are more favourable.  On present prospects, it would seem that a stock issue is unlikely during the current financial year.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not necessary.  I shall make another effort to explain to <Col N="1661" /> the Deputy, although I do not hope to succeed.  If in November next C.I.E. want £1,000,000 again and if they can borrow that £1,000,000, as they are entitled to do, without going for a public issue, it will not be necessary to give them the second £1,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very simple logic but surely the Minister will give me credit for a little intelligence.  If C.I.E. do not come to the public or to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the money, from what source would they obtain it?  Is it from a building society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my last effort to try to penetrate the Deputy's intellectual stubbornness in this matter.  A bank might offer to give it to them. An insurance company or a private banker might offer to give it to them or there might be some special circumstances such as a change in the money market.  Any of these contingencies are possible and there is no need to give C.I.E. twice what they want between now and November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A consummation devoutly to be wished.  There are some other matters to which I would draw the Minister's attention.  It is about time the Minister put his foot down in relation to semi-State bodies.  It is all very well to criticise C.I.E.  They may have their faults but they are not getting a fair crack of the whip from some of the semi-State bodies.  Take Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann who contemplate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not relevant on this Estimate?  The Minister made certain remarks here about private transport and if the Minister is entitled to refer to private transport and very large concerns using their own road haulage, as he does on page 2 of his speech, surely I am entitled to refer to private transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the ruling that the Deputy's reference to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is not relevant.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has certain responsibilities and only certain responsibilities; other responsibilities which are not his may not be placed on him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the commission which the Minister has set up, it is the greatest joke we have heard for a long time.  The terms of reference of the commission are:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To inquire into and review the developments in internal transport in recent years as they affect public transport undertakings; to consider what measures are necessary in the light of those developments to ensure the provision of the transport requirements of the country on a basis which will best serve the public interests; and to report thereon to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on or before the 1st November, 1956.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech to-day paid a tribute to the members forming this commission.  We must not forget that Deputy Morrissey, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, set up a commission on the 1st July, 1948, under the chairmanship of Sir James Milne.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Morrissey wants to cross swords with me on <Col N="1663" /> technicalities, I would remind him that on the 1st July, 1948, Deputy Morrissey, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, requested Sir James Milne to carry out, let us say, an investigation with the following terms of reference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not understand the difference between that and a commission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of Deputy Morrissey's investigation undertaken by Sir James Milne was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To examine and review the position of rail, road and canal transport and to report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce thereon and on the steps it is necessary or desirable to take to secure:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the greatest measure of coordination of rail, road and canal transport;</P>
      <P>(b)  the restoration of the financial position of the public transport companies; and</P>
      <P>(c)  the most efficient and economical transport system.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is there not a little duplication between the terms of reference of this body which is now being set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, and that of the investigation carried out by Sir James Milne?  Sir James Milne's report is a very comprehensive one.  He took evidence from some 40 to 50 concerns in the State directly connected with public transport, and is it not a fact that the men chosen by Sir James Milne were six experts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men appointed by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce are, I admit, very able men in their respective professions and businesses. However, they are not experts on transport.  The men assisting Sir James <Col N="1664" /> Milne included the past president of the Institute of Transport, the general accountant of the London and NorthEastern Railways, the former general manager of the British Cartage Company, the chief engineer of the northern region, the chief mechanical engineer of the southern region and assistant chief accountant of the western region.  These men presented to Deputy Morrissey, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the 6th December, 1948, a report on their findings. Of course, they wasted their sweetness on the desert air, definitely on Deputy Morrissey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Believing that to be so, will the Deputy tell me why Deputy Lemass appointed a completely non-expert committee in 1938?  No doubt he did not have at that time the benefit of consultation with the Deputy.  Perhaps the Deputy would explain that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. I was referring to the failure of Deputy Morrissey, who is going to have his tea now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy undertake to keep going until I get back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  I shall be finished in a few moments.  As I was saying, Deputy Morrissey got this report from Sir James Milne at a cost of a considerable amount of money.  I would not be in order in referring in detail to the recommendations in that report but I do say that the Minister, in his speech here to-day, referred to the policy of dieselisation of C.I.E. That is, as President Eisenhower said the other day, a Johnny-come-lately, <Col N="1665" /> another conversion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>It is admitted now by the Minister that the dieselisation policy recommended by Deputy Morrissey's expert commission is saving C.I.E. £1,000,000 a year. Did it ever occur to the Minister that, if he stopped criticising Deputy Lemass as Minister and refreshed his memory on one little point, he would find out that the previous Coalition Government would not have any truck, good, bad or indifferent, with the recommendation in favour of dieselisation? In the financial year 1953-54, the losses of C.I.E. were £1,021,000.  They got the losses down in the following financial year to £866,535.  At that time, even though they then had to bear increases in wages amounting to £183,000, their receipts went up by £133,000 from the railways.  Their profit in that year on the hotels went up by £8,000 to £26,000, and the profits in the road passenger service increased by £97,000.</P>
      <P>All this showed that C.I.E. were on the right lines.  When the Minister comes along to-day and refers to three courses which may be open to this House when this committee issues its report, he states that each of these three courses would be unpalatable. One thing is definite and that is that this country will have to face up to the situation and put a stop to this talking by certain vested interests that we should scrap the railways.  The people of the country should be told that no Government have any intention of scrapping the railways.  The people should be told that over 20,000 people are being employed by C.I.E., whose annual wages bill is approximately £9,000,000.  The suggestion that our railways should come to an end is fantastic.</P>
      <P>I was not allowed, of course, to develop my point that there is duplication in the services of C.I.E.  The Minister referred to the company's borrowings.  To-date, they have borrowed over £2,500,000, on which they have to pay £90,000 annually in interest.  During the year ended March 31st, 1955, the Minister's Department communicated with the C.I.E. Board in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" />&ldquo;No payments from State funds will be made towards operating losses or revenue charges of the board. Such provision as may be necessary will be made, however, for advances to meet interest payment on transport stock.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Department's letter stated that provision to meet the board's losses would have to be made by temporary borrowings until such time as operating losses could be eliminated by more economical working.  Thus, we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the one hand making visits&mdash;possibly, as I said on a previous occasion, very commendable visits&mdash;to the United States&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Not by C.I.E. surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by Pan American Airways and coming back by T.W.A. We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce seeking new industries for this country that would give employment and yet, on the other hand, we are now faced with the position that it is not 17 workers last week, 11 workers this week and 20 workers next week we will be worrying about in Limerick. Unless the Government step in now there will be wholesale sackings throughout the system of the company.</P>
      <P>As I say, the Minister has misled and is misleading the public.  I hope that when he is replying he will correct the misleading statement that all is well with C.I.E. until November.  The point is that C.I.E. have not sufficient money at the present time to continue their operations, not to mind improving on their capital policy.  They have not sufficient money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not repeat himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly when it is a repetition of falsehood.  That is more objectionable still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement of the Minister is worthy only of contempt. However, when the Minister says I am repeating a falsehood I should like to point out that in the opening paragraph of his statement to-day the <Col N="1667" /> Minister said: &ldquo;The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide C.I.E. with funds to enable them to meet their capital requirements up to November next.&rdquo;  That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said that several times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  Those were the points I wanted to bring to the attention of the Minister.  The last matter is the question of asking the Minister to use his good offices with C.I.E. in the matter of obtaining other or analogous work for the permanent employees, at least, who have been dismissed. It is no function of the Minister, I agree, but if the Minister could do anything to see that those people who have been with C.I.E. for many years would be employed by some other State bodies, he would help the position somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just say a few words on this matter?  Deputy O'Malley apparently is concerned that there are to be wholesale dismissals because money is not being provided. I will come to deal with that, and to remind the Deputy of the time when he should have been much more concerned than he is now, and had much more reason to be concerned but apparently was not.  The trouble about this matter is that Deputies, including those on my own side of the House here, talk about C.I.E. being in financial difficulties, as if C.I.E. was the only railway company in the world in financial difficulties.  As a matter of fact it would be much easier to find any railway that is not in financial difficulties than otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point is that Deputies assume, and some of them assert, that this is the first time that they were in financial difficulties.  C.I.E. or its predecessor, the Great Southern and Western Railway, has been in difficulties going back practically to the end of the 1914-18 war and certainly to the birth of this State.  Let us get that clear.  This is not the first committee or the first effort to deal with it.  When private enterprise failed lamentably to <Col N="1668" /> operate successfully the railway service in this country Deputy Lemass, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, prior to and immediately after the war made no less than three efforts to cure the ailments of national transport, and he did not succeed.  The State&mdash;Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;only stepped in when there was a failure to provide a satisfactory economic service by private enterprise.  Deputy Lemass tried it a second time, and tried marrying the Dublin United Tramways Company with the Great Southern and Western Railway to see if that fusion of blood and profit would help to keep it alive.</P>
    <P>Might I remind the Deputy that despite all the efforts made by Deputy Lemass and the marriage to the bride with the heavy dowry, the Dublin United Tramways Company, the position was such that when the inter-Party Government took over in 1948, the whole 20,000 were in danger?  There was not enough cash in the till to pay the following week's wages, much less carry out any capital works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The same as to-night here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same. That is either a statement utterly irresponsible or, worse still, maliciously made.  I challenge the Deputy again for the source of his information.  Does the Deputy now assert that the position is, or will be when the Minister does something for it that he is proposing to do, that the wages will not be in the till?  Is that the Deputy's assertion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy what I read in the public Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with the Deputy is that he reads the <i>Irish Press</i> and apparently nothing else.  That is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy stick to something, and, when somebody tries to pin him down, not start wriggling.  The Deputy does read the <Col N="1669" /><i>Irish Press.</i>  The Deputy talked about the dieselisation programme, and repeated what the <i>Irish Press</i> goes on repeating, notwithstanding what are in the public records of this House, that the inter-Party Government killed dieselisation as introduced by Fianna Fáil and then subsequently found after Sir James Milne's report that dieselisation was the cure.  Does the Deputy know what the Fianna Fáil dieselisation programme was?  Does he know anything about it?  Does the Deputy know how many diesel locomotives they bought, and is the Deputy aware of the size of them, the cost of each individual one of them, or does he know by whom they were bought?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the Minister scrapped the chassis factory in Inchicore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to that a minute ago.  I will come to that all right.  He talks about the chassis factory and starts wriggling when he is pinned down.  He is not going to be allowed to change step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming back. The Deputy talks a lot about the dieselisation programme of Fianna Fáil, and I am going to pin him down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>O.K.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give him the benefit of this, that he is merely repeating what he has read in his ignorance of what it really was.  I do not mean ignorant in any offensive sense.  Let me tell the Deputy, because the <i>Irish Press</i> will not tell him, that they bought five diesel locomotives at a cost of, I think, £85,000 each in the U.S.A. and they did not have even the benefit of the advice of a chief mechanical engineer.  They were about as useful to them as a 28-ton lorry would be to a man who wanted a perambulator, because when they finally arrived in this country it was found that they could not be operated and maintained in this country.  They then tried to see if they could sell them to any other country in the <Col N="1670" /> world even at a substantial loss.  At one time the Indians were nearly falling for them, but somebody tipped them off in time and they were not caught, and all the efforts made to dispose of them even at bargain prices proved unsuccessful.  There was only one sucker born at that moment of dieselisation, and we provided it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can now inquire from his apparently good source of information, if one is to judge by some of the things he said to-night.  Much and all as he tried to keep it there, he let the cat out of the bag.  He can find out what their ultimate fate was, and if not from anybody else, I will undertake to tell him myself.  There is as much relation between the present dieselisation programme and what was called the dieselisation programme started by Fianna Fáil as there is between chalk and cheese&mdash;no comparison whatever, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this country cannot and ought not to sacrifice the railway system.  I do not think we could do without it, but the people of this country will have to make up their own minds.  If they want to have a railway system maintained and to have employment maintained, then they have either to use it or to pay for it. They must either pay for it in freight and in fares or pay for it through subsidies or some other way.  If they do not want it and do not want to pay for it, they will have to drop it.  I am not so sure, mind you, that if we were foolish enough to let the railway system go, the substitute that would have to be provided would not be infinitely more costly, and frankly, from the ordinary citizen's point of view, give a worse service than we have to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no relationship whatever between circumstances to-day and the circumstances of 1947, 1948, 1950 or 1954.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that the number of commercial vehicles on the roads of this country has increased, not by thousands, but by tens of thousands.  The Deputy knows that the statement and the rumours that were spread around by vested interests that C.I.E. had a <Col N="1671" /> monopoly of road transport are not true and were never true.  The Deputy probably knows that C.I.E. owns and operates only one out of 40 of the commercial vehicles on the roads to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They have only 700 lorries.  There are 45,000 in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That was the sort of propaganda that was used. I know that I am using words now that may be misunderstood and distorted and that can be used against me, politically and otherwise, but, remember, it is absolutely true that it is made possible for the owners of these tens of thousands of commercial vehicles to operate them economically because they can refuse to take the uneconomic loads or the uneconomic portions of a load and foist them on to C.I.E. and C.I.E., by statute, must accept them.  It is all right for Deputy Rooney to say that, if Mary Murphy in Dublin wants to send her mother in Tralee a good secondhand bed that she buys in Dublin, C.I.E. should not carry that because it is not an economic proposition, that it is not fair to the taxpayer that they should do so.  C.I.E., particularly as a national system, has to be concerned with giving service to the citizens and they cannot, like those who are in competition with them, confine themselves and guide their whole policy and administration entirely in relation to profit. Deputies ought to face up to that.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there is a railway system in the world to-day that is being operated at a profit or that is being operated without a loss and even where some of them may show a profit on their balance sheets it is due, if not to outright subsidies, in many cases, just like the Atlantic airlines, to concealed subsidies in the form of Government contracts.</P>

      <P>Not a bit and I will be prepared at any time that it is in order to go into that with the Deputy because the difference is that I know all about it and the Deputy knows nothing about it.  What is worse is <Col N="1672" /> that, in so far as there is anything at all in the Deputy's head about it, it is something that is wrong, misinformed. I can understand the Deputy because I was even younger than he is when I sat over there at one time and I was not nearly as well educated as the Deputy is and, notwithstanding that I had not the Deputy's training and education and was much younger than he is now, I thought I knew even more than the Deputy thinks he knows. When I look back on it now I am appalled and the Deputy will, I hope, when he is older and more mature, look back in the way in which I occasionally look back.  The Deputy ought to get this into his head: the people on this side of the House are not fools.  The people on this side of the House are just as concerned as he is about the maintenance of the transport system.  The Deputy is worried about the present financial position of C.I.E.</P>

I can tell the Deputy that one of the main reasons, not all the reasons, but one of the main reasons why the financial position of C.I.E. is so critical at the moment is that the Deputy's colleagues, when they were in Government, in 1953, insisted on their paying back to them £1,000,000 that they had not to pay.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am, Sir, and, if so, I apologise.  The Deputy talked about wagon building.  Some of my colleagues here spoke about wagon repairs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy thinks he is going to get me away from this question of the wagons and the carriages, he is not.  There was not one single railway carriage built from 1937 to 1948.  This is not the first time I said it.  It is on record.  Has the Deputy any conception of the average age of the locomotives, wagons and coaches that <Col N="1675" /> were handed over to C.I.E. in 1948 and 1950, when the board was set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  As Deputy Lemass said, they dated back to the time of Queen Victoria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And in the 19 years he was Minister&mdash;and he had infinitely greater power and more docile power sitting behind him&mdash;he did not remove Victoria's crown from one of them. There have been more wagons built and repaired, and more coaches constructed, since 1948 than there were from the start of the 1914-18 war up to 1948.  The Deputy can check on that and he will find that it is right.</P>
      <P>It is a misfortune that, on a serious matter like this, we have to have exchanges like this across the House.  It is a serious national matter.  There is no difference between what we believe should be done, but we are not going to do it unless we face up to the reality.  The reality is quite simple.  If the people of this country wish to retain the existing network of railways and if they want efficient services, then they have got to pay for them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked about the 20,000 employees.  C.I.E. does employ 20,000. It is the biggest employer in the whole of Ireland.  When he talks about the difficulties facing the present Minister and the difficulties facing his predecessor, has the Deputy any conception of the enormous additional burden which is being placed on C.I.E. by the tremendous number of increases in the cost of coal?  Has the Deputy any conception, or is he aware, that the wages bill of £9,000,000 which he talks about was 50 per cent. less in 1948 before Deputy Lemass left office?  It was £6,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Deputy or does any man who has a grain of common sense&mdash;and no one need be an accountant or a financier to understand this&mdash;think that, with overheads increasing so enormously&mdash;wages, materials of all descriptions for coaches and everything else, the cost of coal&mdash;here let me digress.  Coal is one of the biggest single items.  I should like the Minister to give the cost of coal to C.I.E. <Col N="1676" /> to-day compared with the cost of coal to C.I.E. within the last five, six or seven years.  In the case of C.I.E. or any other business&mdash;whether you are operating a huckster's shop or Guinness's Brewery&mdash;you cannot double or treble your overheads, at the same time, have your trade dwindling and still keep your head over water.  It just cannot be done.  What will have to be applied and what is being applied, whether we like it or not, is the hard law of economics.</P>
    <P>If the people are prepared to say they want the railways, they should be made to realise the position if C.I.E. is to continue.  I think they do realise it.  They must realise the position if the railways are to be maintained, wages paid, proper rolling stock provided and made available when required. If there is a fair in Limerick to-morrow C.I.E. must have trains available for it.  If that fair for some reason or other is changed from to-morrow to to-morrow week, C.I.E. must alter schedules but still must provide the wagons.  Whether it is Bantry, Limerick, Cork or Tipperary, the same thing applies and the services must be available.</P>
    <P>People tell me that you could replace the railways of this country and have all the freight, all the passengers, all the live stock, all the raw materials, or finished products and everything else carried more successfully, more efficiently and more economically by road.  I just do not believe it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no duplication of the services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite easy to say that, and the Deputy is not saying anything original.  That has been said over and over again.  It was said to me; it was said to Deputy Lemass; and it was said to the Minister.  Again, may I suggest to the Deputy that those who are charged with the responsibility of running C.I.E. are not fools?  When I hear talk about the services here in Dublin, I am reminded that there are people in this country who are living six, eight, ten or 20 miles from the nearest railway station. Do not forget that.  It is one of our troubles here&mdash;a sparse and scattered <Col N="1677" /> population.  From what I can learn and hear and from the little I saw in the few cities it was my privilege to see abroad, whatever about the cost of the services, the efficiency of the bus services in Dublin can compare with the best in any city I know of.</P>
      <P>Does anybody think that you must not have some feeder for the railway? Apparently, Deputy Rooney saw something wrong in a parcel being sent from here to some remote part of the country by railway and then taken from that nearest station and delivered to the person's door.  I see nothing wrong in that.  The only thing I see wrong in it is that, if it were economic to take it from here to the person's door, it would be taken by somebody other than C.I.E.  The only reason it is taken by C.I.E. is that the other people do not want it, since it is not an economic proposition.  The citizen living six miles from the nearest railway station is entitled to the same national service, the same facilities and the same amenities as the person living in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The bus services are available here. In some of the more remote parts of the country, and in parts of the country subject to bad weather to a greater extent than other parts, people have to walk three, four or five miles to Mass and the children have to walk anything from two to five miles to school.  No bus services are available to them. Those unfortunate children are often we to the skin before they arrive at the school and they have to sit there for the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get some sense of proportion and let us realise what we are trying to do.  We either want a railway service or we do not.  You cannot operate a railway service and pay for materials, services and wages with chaff.  The men and women who work on the railways and the people&mdash;whether they are Irish, British or German&mdash;who supply the goods that are required&mdash;whether they are the parts or the finished materials&mdash;will only accept payment in cash.  We are the people who have to provide the cash.  If we do not provide it in one form, we must provide it in another.  I think all of us realise that, but we are not inclined to say it or <Col N="1678" /> face up to it.  If we face up to it, we will get a more realistic approach and, perhaps, more realistic speeches on the matter, both inside and outside this House, with possibly a better understanding of the position.  For pity's sake, do not let us keep on talking about this as if the C.I.E. problem arose only in the lifetime of this Government, or even in the long lifetime of the Fianna Fáil Government. This has its roots much earlier in time than that.  There were several commissions in the past.  There were commissions inquiring into C.I.E. and its predecessor before Deputy O'Malley was born.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am sorry, having listened to Deputy O'Malley, a man of more than average intelligence, that he is not a member of that inquiry because certainly, even if the committee did not produce any fruit, it would inculcate in Deputy O'Malley an infinitely better understanding of the national transport problem than he has at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that a committee of inquiry has recently been set up by me, with terms of reference which I quoted in the course of my introductory speech to-day, it would be undesirable for me to express views of a positive character at this stage, lest my doing so might be interpreted as giving a line to the committee. I prefer to let the committee ascertain the facts for themselves.  I prefer to let the committee bring their own intelligence to bear on the problems presented, so that they may give to the Government and the House an objective picture of the transport problems and their suggestions for remedying them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of matters have been raised in the course of this debate which it is desirable to answer.  I propose to do so as briefly as possible. Some of the Opposition Deputies, including Deputy Derrig and Deputy Aiken, completely misunderstood the purpose of this Estimate, although I clearly explained it in my opening <Col N="1679" /> speech.  C.I.E. have an unexhausted borrowing capacity and, if it were convenient for them to get money on the stock market to-morrow, they could float a loan for £1,000,000, £2,000,000, £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, as they required; and, when that was subscribed, they could use it for capital development purposes, as they are entitled to do under legislation passed by this House.  But for a variety of reasons, reasons of which every intelligent Deputy is aware, and which were explained and emphasised by the Minister for Finance to-day, it is not considered judicious to go to the stock market at the moment, unless, of course, one is prepared to pay a very high price in interest charges, with consequences which would manifest themselves, in particular, when such a loan has to be carried over a long period of years.</P>
    <P>It was felt better, therefore, that C.I.E. should not be allowed to go to the stock market at the moment and that, instead, the Government would find £1,000,000 to keep C.I.E. going in the matter of meeting their contractual commitments until November next. In November, if C.I.E. want more money to meet their contractual obligations, C.I.E. will have to get more money.  If, in November, somebody will lend them money&mdash;an insurance company, a bank, or banking house, or anybody else&mdash;C.I.E. is at liberty to take that money if they can get it on more advantageous terms than they can get it from the Government.</P>
    <P>All we are doing by this Estimate is giving C.I.E. £1,000,000, £1,000,000 they would get in the ordinary way if they were able to go to the stock market. The intention is that C.I.E. will repay that £1,000,000: when, is a matter of conjecture at this stage.  If C.I.E. do not go to the stock market in the present financial year, and presumably they will not or cannot, then they will repay whenever they go to the stock market and raise the money required.  This is not a case of throwing £1,000,000 into C.I.E. to stuff a hole. This is advancing C.I.E. £1,000,000 on a repayable basis, that £1,000,000 to come back again when C.I.E. raise money as a result of their next stock issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> Deputy Aiken and Deputy Derrig complained that they did not know anything about this Estimate and did not know it was likely to come along. This is a perfectly ordinary transaction so far as the £1,000,000 is concerned. It is being advanced because it is better to give it to C.I.E. from the Government rather than have them go to the stock market at a time when it is disadvantageous to go.  There is no crisis.  This advance will be repaid when C.I.E. collect publicly as a result of the flotation of a loan.</P>
    <P>References were made by Deputy Aiken to the appointment of this committee of inquiry.  He thought the Government should know what the problems affecting C.I.E. are and should itself instantaneously apply a remedy. I do not know that the remedy anybody might suggest would commend itself to everybody here or commend itself to the country as a whole.  Indeed, any attempt to apply a remedy ultimately may well beget a considerable amount of opposition by those sections of our people intimately affected by whatever remedies may be proposed.</P>
    <P>I set up this committee of inquiry because I wanted five capable people, with qualifications, to survey the transport problem and to give us what was, in their view, a sensible appraisal of the situation, together with a sound remedy for the problems posed to them for solution.  Nobody will question the outstanding qualifications of those who constitute the committee.  They were selected by me on their proved ability to undertake such an inquiry.  I hope that I shall get from them an impartial report unencumbered by any relationship they may have with any political Party.  I still believe that we will get a report of that quality from the committee.</P>
    <P>This was not intended to be a committee to long-finger the problem.  The very fact that although this is a holiday month normally, that next month is the chief holiday month and that September is to some extent, too, a holiday month, I still fixed 1st November as the date on which they should present their report to me is evidence that, far from long-fingering the <Col N="1681" /> matter, I am most anxious we should get the report with the utmost expedition. It indicates clearly that the Government regard the matter as one of such serious dimensions that it is essential that such a survey should be undertaken, the defects established and the remedy suggested within the shortest possible time.  It is for that reason that a committee of that quality and that calibre and with that time date was established.</P>
    <P>Was there any justification for establishing it?  That may be a question in the minds of some Deputies.  It may be a question in the minds of people outside.  In my view, it was necessary that it should be established because, reporting to me on the position of C.I.E., in a memorandum I received from the chairman of the company last month, it was stated that, notwithstanding improved rail services, passenger and goods traffic with C.I.E. continues to decrease; that many industrial firms are now using their own transport and that one very large undertaking&mdash;I think probably the chief customer of C.I.E. in one respect&mdash;had refused to pay the increased charge of 10 per cent. imposed by C.I.E. and that another very large user had said they proposed to establish their own road freight service.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. naturally became alarmed at a situation of that kind, concerned as it was by this fact, that the number of private cars on the road had increased from about 50,000 in 1945 to 140,000 to-day. Likewise, private lorries had increased from about 10,000 in 1945 to 45,000 to-day.  In these circumstances, C.I.E. raised some questions.  They posed these questions: &ldquo;Is a public transport system to be maintained both for passengers and goods?  Are railways to form part of that system or can they be abandoned?  If railways are to be retained will the steps which are necessary to make them self-supporting be taken, or will the State pay the necessary subsidy?  Finally, they asked: &ldquo;If railways must remain and must pay their way, what steps will be taken to restore sufficient traffic to the railways?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are all questions which, in one way or another, in one degree or another, impact heavily on the public <Col N="1682" /> interest and on the economic life of the nation.  I have no doubt that some shallow-minded people would answer these five or six questions in as many seconds and thereby demonstrate the majesty of their daftness.  I do not think there is any mind in this House which could find remedies, and certainly should not attempt to find them, until they have discovered all the facts from all the people likely to be affected by the manner in which we operate our transport system.  It was because these questions are raised and because they are important that I decided to set up this committee for the purpose of enabling it to get the evidence, to find the difficulties, and to crystallise them and to make suggestions for remedies.  That is the explanation of the committee, and I think every well-intentioned citizen who realises the difficulties will be satisfied that it was the best way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>The question of redundancy has been raised here, chiefly by Deputy O'Malley.  The Deputy has such an attractive way of flitting around the subject and never getting to the kernel of it, and apparently inoculating himself against the possibility that he would ever understand it, that it is really difficult to argue with him.  Does he know that the Fianna Fáil dieselisation programme, designed in 1953, was designed on the basis that it would produce redundancy?  The deliberate intention was to produce redundancy. It was recognised frankly, and the files of the Department of Industry and Commerce show it, that dieselisation would produce redundancy because it would operate more cheaply.  There would not be the same driving staffs, or cleaning staffs, or firemen and maintenance staffs, and the Fianna Fáil dieselisation policy was designed to produce redundancy&mdash;</P>

On a point of order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when Deputy Lemass was Minister for Industry and Commerce and that criticism was levelled at him, he answered it by giving an undertaking, which he got from the chairman of the board, that if a fireman lost his job through the changeover, <Col N="1683" /> he would be given alternative employ ment.</P>

      <P>I had to come to this House with a Bill which provided that anyone who was rendered redundant would get compensation.  Up to then, there was no compensation and I know of no other company in this country, or elsewhere, that has provided compensation for workers who may be dismissed as a result of a dieselisation programme.  I provided for them in this legislation and they would have got no compensation if the position had not been dealt with in that way by me.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not be so self-rebuking in this matter.  There <Col N="1684" /> is provision in the Act also whereby if a man is moved down, from one job to another, to his disadvantage, he will get compensation in respect of the difference in his pay.  Over and above all that, I said to the directors of C.I.E., and to the railway unions, that I was anxious that the question of redundancy should be dealt with on the basis that they were not dealing with pieces on a draught board, were not dealing with hands or heads, but were dealing with human beings and the aim ought to be to deal with the problem in a humane way, so as to ensure that everything possible was done to insulate these people against dismissal as a result of dieselisation.  It was recognised&mdash;the railway unions recognised it, too&mdash;that temporary workers were in a different position from permanent workers.  I emphasised, every time I saw the directors of C.I.E., the necessity for dealing with this matter in a sympathetic and understanding way and I still believe they should do that.  It is my desire they should do it and they are under no illusion in that respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley, and I think Deputy Aiken, referred to the accounts of C.I.E.  In the financial year 1954-55, C.I.E.'s losses had been got down to £866,000.  The losses for the subsequent year are not yet known, but I shall be very much surprised if the loss for 1955-56 is less than £1,600,000, so the position has disimproved by approximately £800,000 in one year.  Deputy O'Malley said that wage increases cost £183,000.  They cost £530,000.  Coal increases cost £180,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year covered by the balance sheet to March, 1956.  There have been some increases since then. These two items run to £710,000, so that it is easy to understand why C.I.E.'s financial position worsened so seriously between 1955 and 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total capital expenditure on diesel locomotives up to March, 1956, was approximately £3,317,000.  A sum of £2,291,000 is provided in the C.I.E. 1956-57 budget for dieselisation.  A sum of £735,000 will fall due in 1957-58, while a balance of £50,000 will be expended <Col N="1685" /> in 1958-59 and 1959-60.  Looking at the situation to-day, the total cost of dieselisation will be of the order of £6,400,000 as compared with the original C.I.E. estimate of £5,300,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that dieselisation only as distinct from stock renewal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A total of £1,559,000 has been expended by C.I.E. on the construction of carriages and wagons under the reorganisation programme up to March, 1956.  A total of 34 carriages and 1,115 wagons was completed on the 31st March, 1956.  In addition to building diesel cars and carriages and wagons, C.I.E. carried out each year capital additions not included in their normal capital programme and expenditure under that auxiliary head has been estimated by C.I.E. to amount to £250,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>To finance their capital development programme up to the end of 1959-60, as at present planned, they estimate that a further £7.69 million will be required on the capital account.  In addition, it is estimated by C.I.E. that approximately £3,000,000 will be required on revenue account to finance the excess of renewals and replacements over revenue earnings.  In other words, the total C.I.E. requirements up to 1959-60 may therefore be said to be: their capital expenditure would be £7.69 million; renewals and replacements £3.05 million, and stock interest £4.18 million, making a total as near as does not matter to £15,000,000.</P>
      <P>I think it can be seen from this that C.I.E., as Deputy Morrissey rightly said, has put a good deal of work into bringing C.I.E. from the dilapidated position in which it was under private enterprise to the transport organisation which it is to-day.  However, having said that, one has nevertheless to remember that the fact that so much money has been spent on C.I.E., and that that capital has to be serviced by earning sufficient to reward the invested capital&mdash;that very fact alone&mdash; has been responsible for causing some of the problems which C.I.E. has to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>C.I.E.'s general position is that it <Col N="1686" /> makes a profit on the Dublin bus service. If you can look at the problem from Dublin only, I can see that Dublin Deputies could make a case for a Dublin transport service.  I think provincial areas could make a case to have a provincial bus transport service as well.  I think even road freight more than holds its own even though there are only about 1,000 C.I.E. lorries on the road as against 45,000 private lorries.  However, even on the road, I think C.I.E. services make a profit.  But all these profits from the road freight service, the provincial bus service and the Dublin bus service are all pooled together to try and buttress the railway and, having been put together to buttress the railway, they not only do not do it, but fail to the extent of a loss which will be shown this year to be, I believe, in the vicinity of £1.6 million.  The heavy loss is on the railways.  The last Government and this Government have been pursuing a policy of modernising the railway&mdash;re-equipping the railway by dieselising the system&mdash;with a view to getting passenger traffic back and freight traffic back.</P>
    <P>If you look at the figures you will find private motor cars jumping at the rate of 10,000 a year.  When people buy motor cars they travel mainly in the cars they have bought.  Every new car which comes on the road&mdash;and these are not replacement cars; I am talking now about the increase in the number of cars on the road&mdash;is an indication that C.I.E. are continuing to lose passenger traffic.</P>
    <P>So far as lorries are concerned, 45,000 lorries are on the road now compared with 10,000 in 1945.  These lorries are on the road with freight. Some of them are on the road morning, noon and night, carrying traffic all over the country.  The policy of the last Government and of this Government certainly up to the present&mdash;until we can be justified, if there be justification, in revising it&mdash;has been to try to maintain the railways as the backbone of our transport system. While we are trying to maintain the railways and while bus passengers are only paying a fair contribution towards the maintenance of the railways, the position in all its nakedness is that <Col N="1687" /> those who have freight to transport prefer to transport it in private lorries instead of giving it to the railways. The result is that the railways are losing traffic&mdash;freight traffic and passenger traffic&mdash;progressively each year.  Recently they have been alarmed at the losses.  The threat of two very large undertakings in the country to provide their own freight services has induced C.I.E. to take the view that we should now have a look at this whole problem again in the light of the developments since the 1950 Transport Act went through this House.</P>
    <P>Only a fool would try to keep a rigid mind in changing circumstances.  I see nothing wrong or in any way injurious to the self-respect of this House that we should set up a committee of inquiry to examine the problem, once we are satisfied that changes have taken place which ought to be examined.  That is what we have done. You must remember that C.I.E. operates under considerable difficulties. It is a common carrier.  It has to have the same rates for the same classes or goods or analogous classes of goods.  It cannot go bargaining with a person.  It has a fixed charge and adheres to it. It cannot say that it does not like that traffic and that it wants more for it or that it wants this traffic and will do it for less.  Charges are fixed and have to remain and there can be no flexibility about these charges.</P>
    <P>C.I.E., as Deputy Morrissey rightly says, is a public transport undertaking and if Mrs. A. wants to send an old perambulator to Mrs. B. in the most notherly point of Donegal or the most southerly point of Kerry, the transport company have to take it there and even though there may be no freight for any place within 50 miles of the address to which the perambulator is consigned that is what C.I.E. has got to do because it is a public transport undertaking. If you allow a situation to develop in which everybody picks his own traffic, then there will be nobody ultimately to carry Mrs. A.'s perambulator to Mrs. B. at some inaccessible part of the country.</P>
    <P>It may be well that in our circumstances <Col N="1688" /> and in our difficulties we cannot afford these transport refinements. It may be better to say that Mrs. A. has got to stop this method of subsidising Mrs. B. with perambulators; that that traffic has got to end and that it is better to nip that traffic and prevent it being continued because of the burdens which it places on C.I.E. but the burdens are there and C.I.E. will tell you what they have got to do in that respect.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. complained to me some time that a certain firm in this country sends out a fleet of lorries to the West of Ireland and that it delivers these commodities in the larger towns in the West of Ireland.  When it arrives at a railway station it has got about 12 bundles of the commodity left for places at all points of the compass radiating from this station.  One of the drivers of the lorries goes in, empties out the dozen bundles and says: &ldquo;Would you mind delivering these 12 bundles for me?&rdquo;  because the company in question realises that it would take them ten times more to deliver these 12 bundles of this commodity than C.I.E. would charge them. C.I.E. have to charge on the basis that there is a fixed charge for carrying that commodity over a fixed distance. C.I.E. has got to do that while it sees this company with its fleet of lorries going right through the well populated towns and delivering in abundance the creamier portion of that traffic.  That is a difficulty under which C.I.E. operates and it is a difficulty which should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I think I dealt in the main with all the general points raised except to say this on one point.  I have been most anxious that C.I.E. should get to a level of efficiency with the utmost expedition. I have made it clear on many occasions and by speeches on other subjects last year that I think C.I.E. ought to endeavour to get to economic equilibrium with no deficit as soon as it could; that I prefer them to get that way by efficiency and that I did not want them to displace staff in order to get into that position.  So anxious was I about it that I pressed C.I.E. to put in industrial consultants at Kingsbridge in the hope that they might find <Col N="1689" /> quicker, better and more efficient ways of doing things than had been discovered in the past.  I think the consultants now operate at Kingsbridge, from there out and at the workshops as well.  Whatever report we get from the committee of inquiry may help us some distance along the road to deal with the problem of transport and enable us to deal with the worst and most irritable aspects of the problem as we find them to-day.</P>
    <P>Having seen Bills going through this House on transport questions for nearly 30 years, I would not be prepared in the light of that experience to give a certificate that even what we can now do or propose to do will give us the results.  Every Minister for Industry and Commerce appointed in this State has found transport a headache from the 1924 Act up to the 1950 Act.  Ministers came to the Dáil confessing the difficulties which they experienced in the field of transport.  Many Ministers came saying they believed that now at last they had got the solution of the problem and that they hoped that this would be a satisfactory basis.  How unwise these prophecies are can be shown by this statement which was made by Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he introduced the Transport Bill on the 9th May, 1944:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must create the organisation now and give the organisation the power and the finances.  We must make it clear to the people who will be in charge of it that no further changes are contemplated and that the responsibility will be theirs.  If we put them in that position and make it known they will have the goodwill of the Dáil, I am certain that they can create a transport organisation which will make a vital contribution to the further economic development of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the 1944 prophecy.  How far short it fell of realisation Deputy O'Malley told us this evening, although the forecast was made by his colleague, Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>Concluding on the same occasion&mdash; this to me seemed unbridled optimism <Col N="1690" /> under the circumstances at the time&mdash; Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I contemplate that we can build up here a transport organisation which, having regard to the peculiar geographical formation of our country and the rather unusual distribution of population and industry, will be as efficient as any other country has and I believe we can make that transport organisation work without further subsidy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will see in connection with these words spoken in 1944, how far we are still from realising the rosy objective which the then Minister for Industry and Commerce thought was reasonably in sight.  Our country is sparsely populated and the railway system was probably designed more for the benefit of an occupation power than for the convenience of the people. Because of that fact, large sections of our country can never be efficiently, effectively and conveniently serviced by railways only.  We have, therefore, to think of a railway system carrying our heavy traffic and a bus system carrying traffic into those areas which are not conveniently served by the railways. But running these two systems, riding these two horses, may not be a very easy thing so far as the people of the country are concerned.</P>
    <P>What this transport committee has to do now is to survey these difficulties in the light of experience and the hopes which have proved in some respects to be falsified by the effluxion of time and to tell us the best way in which the problem can be met.  I do not want to see transport made a political issue in this House.  I think it is bad for transport, and if we are going to deal with it on political lines, we are never going to deal with it in a manner that offers some possibilities of ultimate satisfaction.  So far as I am personally concerned, I would be willing to throw the whole question of transport into the Dáil for consideration by a non-Party group to give us the best possible transport system, having regard to our requirements and at the same time devise ways and means, whereby if transport is to be maintained in a particular way, there will <Col N="1691" /> be unity among all Parties in deciding in what way the transport undertaking is to be kept afloat.</P>
    <P>If you are to keep railways, you can keep them probably by cutting back on road transport.  If you do not cut back on road transport, the railways will go down.  If you are satisfied not to cut back on road transport, but want to have the railways maintained, someone has to pay a substantial subsidy for that purpose.  Is it to be the road transport vehicles, which damage the railways, which should pay or pay in part; or is it the whole community which should pay, even that portion in Dublin and throughout the country who already pay heavily to maintain the railway service?  These are all problems which have to be solved. They are problems which we have to meet and if we try to think as little politically as possible when approaching these problems, we might find a quicker solution and perhaps a more enduring solution in the course of time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The current economic position has been debated on a number of occasions this year, notably in the debates on the Vote on Account, on the Budget and Finance Bill, and will be further <Col N="1692" /> reviewed in the debate on the statement made by the Minister for Finance to-day.  The recently published statistical survey and the Minister's statement contain all the facts and figures required for an understanding of the present economic position.  I do not propose, therefore, to dwell at any length on the background to the economic difficulties with which we are confronted.  The broad outline is clear.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a number of formidable problems&mdash;large-scale and persistent emigration, substantial unemployment and a serious deficit in the balance of payments.  Any one of these problems would be formidable by itself; taken together, they are both a warning and a challenge to the country.  Few other countries indeed are faced with such a trinity of problems; if they face deficits in the balance of payments, this is often the result of full employment, or where, exceptionally, this is not the case, it is rarely found that high unemployment and large-scale emigration go hand in hand; where they do, the balance of payments may not be in serious deficit. It is the somewhat unique combination of the problems in this country which constitutes our difficulty.</P>
    <P>In acknowledging our difficulties, however, we must steer clear of two dangers&mdash;the danger, on the one hand, that we may overstate the problem and cause panic and despair at home and a lack of confidence abroad; and, on the other hand, the danger that we may understate the problem and create apathy and indifference at home and, abroad, the impression that we fail to appreciate the seriousness of the position or else refuse to take the necessary corrective measures.  We have, therefore, taken a balanced view.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, emigration which constitutes our greatest challenge.  Of all the statistical material that has been placed before us in recent months, none has struck the minds of public representatives and the whole people with so sharp an impact as that contained in the Preliminary Report of the Census of Population which was taken in April of this year.  The statistics of population contained in <Col N="1693" /> that report are provisional and subject to amendment; but there is no reason to anticipate that the final figures will differ materially from them, and there is no doubt that the picture which they present&mdash;a gravely disturbing picture&mdash; is an accurate representation of the facts.</P>
    <P>The population enumerated in April last, 2,894,822, is the lowest ever recorded for the Twenty-Six Counties. After a period of stability extending certainly over 25 years, if not indeed over 40 years&mdash;with, in fact, a slight increase in the inter-censal period 1946 to 1951&mdash;we are now faced with a substantial decline.  The reduction amounts in all to 65,771, and it has occurred in every province.  It is true that the decrease in Leinster is negligible, but in the previous three censuses increases were recorded in that province.</P>
    <P>The natural increase in the population of the Twenty-Six Counties in the five-year period was 134,623, and, adding this figure to the net decline of 65,771, we find that net emigration in the five years 1951 to 1956 amounted to no less than 200,000 persons, or an average of 40,000 a year&mdash;a figure very much greater than in any previous period since the beginning of this century.</P>
    <P>This disturbing increase in the annual rate of net emigration must be looked at in the light of the facts that, comparing 1955 with 1951, in real terms &mdash;that is, allowing for changes in the value of money&mdash;national income has increased by one-twelfth&mdash;earnings in both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors showing increases&mdash; while the capital expenditure financed from the Exchequer has, over the five years, amounted to a total of £160,000,000 and conditions in respect of housing, social welfare and health services have substantially improved.</P>
    <P>What inferences are to be drawn from those facts?  What should be our attitude towards the picture which they present, and what policies should we pursue to deal with the situation with which we are confronted?  These are questions for the Government, indeed, but not for the Government, alone.  They are of vital concern to us <Col N="1694" /> all, to this House, to every political Party, to the people as a whole and to every family and individual in the country.</P>
    <P>We have had reports&mdash;a majority report, with a number of reservations and addenda, and two minority reports &mdash;from a representative commission established in 1948 to examine emigration and other population problems.  It has been stated that those reports contained a &ldquo;blue print&rdquo; for action to solve the emigration problem, and it has been suggested that there has been some failure or neglect on the part of the Government to adopt remedies that are ready to hand, that are to be found merely by perusal of the commission's findings and recommendations.</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that the reports of the Commission on Emigration and Other Population Problems are documents of the very greatest value.  They examine, with meticulous care and with a wealth of statistical detail, the economic and social background, the nature and history of our demographic problems, the various factors that enter into those problems and the considerations that should guide us in our approach to their solution.  But I do not think that the commission as a whole, or any member of it, would endorse the suggestion that their reports contain a &ldquo;blue print&rdquo; or that they offer any cut-and-dried solutions.  They were not designed and do not purport to do anything of the kind.  They contain, indeed, a number of suggestions and recommendations on matters of varying degrees of importance, but they do not offer a programme of specific action by the public authorities that would promise an early and substantial reduction in emigration or the beginning of a rising trend in population.  The recommendations and suggestions have been examined by all the Departments of State and are at present being given careful consideration by the Government in the light of the departmental observations.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible for me, within the limits of this speech, to attempt to summarise the views and findings of the commission.  Indeed, that body was itself debarred by the <Col N="1695" /> evident difficulties, from making any such attempt.  The majority report states (paragraph 481):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the course of our inquiries over a wide field we have had to consider so many complex matters that it would be unsatisfactory and inadequate to attempt to set our conclusions in summary form and thereby weaken their significance by divorcing them from their text.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are, however, a few passages in the majority report to which I would like to make particular reference, because I feel that they are specially helpful to an appreciation of the broad character of the problem of emigration.  In paragraph 290, the report points out that &ldquo;While the fundamental cause of emigration is economic, in most cases the decision to emigrate cannot be ascribed to any single motive but to the interplay of a number of motives,&rdquo; and adds that &ldquo;The causes put before us in evidence were very many&mdash;principally economic, but also social, political, cultural and psychological.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The general conclusion reached in the chapter dealing with economic development is one which, I feel, should be quoted in full.  It is contained in paragraph 423 and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With maximum development of agriculture, with industry providing as much as possible of the requirements of the home market and with energetic development of export trade in industrial products, additional employment should result, without which the amelioration of our main demographic weaknesses and economic problems will not be possible.  Such development is essentially a long-term policy.  Immediate results cannot be expected, as is evident in the case of afforestation and fisheries.  A quicker response may be obtained from agriculture but social tradition and habit may delay the full results.  Since the policy is long-term it follows that it should be framed so that emphasis is placed on those objectives which can be most easily attained.  The case for <Col N="1696" /> giving a high place in the order of priorities to agriculture rests on the fact that, by encouraging agriculture, use is made of physical attributes which give the country a natural advantage in competition with other countries; exports to pay for additional imports required for industrial and other development are increased; under-employment and unemployment on the land are reduced, and the income of the agricultural community is raised, thereby providing a larger home market for industrial products, greater possibility of extending commercial and ancillary services and additional savings for investment.  It should be pointed out, however, that there is a tendency in developed countries for the agriculturally-occupied population to decline in numbers.  Agricultural development, therefore, is unlikely to bring about a substantial increase in the size of the agricultural community. Hence it is mainly expansion in industry and services which will provide the additional employment without a reduction in living standards.  The volume of this employment will depend on the extent to which greater agricultural prosperity can provide a wider market for industrial products at home, on the ability of industry to meet home-market demand and on the possibility of developing exports.  Development, agricultural and industrial, and the rising standard of living which the population seeks, call for a programme of large-scale and long-term investment which far exceeds the present volume of domestic savings. The commission believes that, within the capacity of the country and its population, there is scope for such an expansion in production as would make a major contribution to solving our demographic and economic problems.  In the final analysis, however, the solution of these problems depends on the tenacity of the community's resolution to solve them and on the amount of effort it is willing to put forth in this endeavour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a passage dealing with the role of the Government in population policy <Col N="1697" /> (paragraph 470) the majority report has this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not recommend, in present circumstances, direct Government action in the demographic field, such as the banning or limitation of emigration, the imposition of a tax on bachelors or the provision of marriage loans and grants. Almost all the influences which determine population growth are matters which properly depend upon personal decisions, and with regard to them, the rôle of the Government should be to encourage and, where necessary, to initiate economic and social activities which produce conditions favourable to increased population, leaving people free to take their decisions in the light of these conditions.  But, however potent the influence which social and economic factors may have on population trends, the personal reaction of the individual to these forces must be allowed for as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant passage in the entire report is that contained in paragraph 480, where it is pointed out that &ldquo;economic development does not depend on capital alone&rdquo; but &ldquo;depends also on hard work, skill, thrift, and the willingness to take risks&rdquo; and that &ldquo;there can be no significant progress in development unless people accept the effort and sacrifice involved in more and better work and in increased savings on a scale for which there is no precedent in this country&rdquo;.  The paragraph goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In short, it is not financial measures but the will and determination of the people which will decide the extent to which development of national resources will take place so as to remedy the country's demographic weaknesses.  To achieve the ends which we have set out, there must be a revolution in the attitude of the individual.  Development is a necessary prerequisite for the solution of our population problems, but in our view it is not enough.  Fundamentally, the question is not one of economics but of self-reliance.  In other countries faced with more <Col N="1698" /> critical situations than ours, there have been outstanding achievements in reconstruction and development. The bringing about of similar achievements in this country is the problem facing the Irish people.  To solve it, the mind and spirit of the people must change so that they possess the necessary degree of resolution not only to develop the economy fully but also to accept readily the sacrifices and hard work which this would involve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If, in my references and quotations, I have confined myself to the text of the majority report, it is not because of any lack of appreciation on my part, or on the part of my colleagues in the Government, of the value of the various addenda and reservations to that report or of the minority reports. It does not appear, indeed, that any member of the commission would find himself at variance with the views of the majority report on the points to which I have drawn particular attention.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the commission have so repeatedly emphasised the importance, in dealing with the problem of emigration, of the attitude taken by the community towards that problem. Time and again the commission have drawn attention to the personal, as distinct from the social and economic, factors which influence the decision to emigrate and have emphasised the effort, sacrifice, resolution and determination required of the community if our demographic and economic problems are to be solved.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that we must consider the opinions expressed by the commission that the fundamental cause of emigration is economic, that the rôle of the Government should be to encourage and, where necessary, to initiate economic and social activities which produce conditions favourable to increased population and that economic development is essentially a matter of long-term policy, from which immediate results cannot be expected. Such a long-term policy has been pursued by successive Governments and has been, is being and will continue to be pursued, with the utmost vigour, by the present Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> There have, from time to time, been differences of emphasis and, on certain occasions, there has, in my opinion, been action based on an incorrect appreciation of the circumstances and the needs of the situation, but broadly, there has been continuity in the efforts to develop the national resources, to raise the general level of production, to create diversified opportunities of employment at home and to improve progressively the living conditions of the people.  Those efforts have not yet been as fruitful in their results as we all desire, but they have met with a substantial degree of success, particularly in the development of manufacturing industry and in the general improvement of the living conditions of the people as a whole.  They are being continued with unremitting energy, of which a notable example is the patient work of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, in promoting the establishment here of an oil refinery, with the successful result that was recently announced.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, the vital source and fundamental basis of whatever prosperity we have so far achieved or are, in future, likely to enjoy, much has been done by Government action to create conditions and opportunities favourable to improvement and expansion.  A great deal of progress has been made in restoring the fertility of the soil, land reclamation has proceeded and is proceeding on a scale which, relatively to this country's size and resources, may, not inaptly, be termed vast, improved veterinary services are reducing mortality and the incidence of disease in animals, an expanding advisory service is affording ready access, on the part of the farmers, to the best information and counsel on modern, efficient agricultural methods, large schemes of arterial drainage are in progress, the prices of important basic products are assured, and valuable benefits of various kinds are provided out of the public purse to lighten the burdens of the farmer and to encourage him to increase his output.  It is to agriculture, primarily, we must look for that essential prerequisite of economic progress in our circumstances, an <Col N="1700" /> expanding volume of production of goods that are marketable abroad in quality and at prices competitive with similar goods offered by the producers of other countries.</P>
    <P>As I say, much has been achieved. The Government have played and are playing the rôle which, in the view of the Commission on Emigration and Other Population Problems, is their proper one, that is, &ldquo;to encourage and, where necessary, to initiate economic and social activities which produce conditions favourable to increased population.&rdquo;  Not only has large-scale emigration continued, however, but its volume has shown a substantial growth.</P>
    <P>If we accept the commission's view that &ldquo;the fundamental cause of emigration is economic,&rdquo; we must also remember that standards of economic welfare are relative, not absolute.  The young men and women who are leaving Ireland to seek a living abroad are not, as a body, fleeing from intolerable economic conditions at home: they are seeking what they have come to believe are better economic conditions abroad.  And a fact to be faced and reckoned with is that the average standard of material welfare&mdash;in the things that enter into the computation of national income figures&mdash;is nearly twice as high in Britain as it is in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We cannot hope to overtake the British standard in that respect, because we do not possess, on anything resembling a comparable scale, the natural resources, the accumulated physical capital or the industrial structure&mdash;the product of many generations of work under favourable conditions&mdash;that exist in Britain.  We are endeavouring&mdash;and we have already made substantial progress as a result of our endeavours&mdash;to promote conditions in which every man, woman and child in this country will have the opportunity of living in decent comfort. But if any informed man promises to lead our people to an average standard of access to material goods equal to the average standard in Britain, he is making a promise which he must know to be false.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> There are, however, other values. Many of those who emigrate have, before emigrating, enjoyed the wholesome conditions of a life that is nowhere far removed from the happy peace of natural surroundings.  We have here certain spiritual and cultural traditions which have become our own and in which we may justly take pride. We have the fellowship of family and friends and neighbours&mdash;the warmth and kindliness of home.  There is much truth in the statement made, with emphasis, in paragraph 453 of the commission's report, that &ldquo;the paramount consideration must be the philosophy of life, the system of ultimate ethical principles and values which the people of this country hold&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Young men and women should not lightly shake the dust of their homeland from their feet.  The plea of economic necessity is, in many cases, one that cannot be sustained.  Only too frequently do we hear of men and women leaving good jobs in this country for apparently better ones in England.  They should weigh the attraction of higher monetary rewards in other lands against comforts and happiness&mdash;real and substantial, if not measurable in money&mdash;that are theirs to enjoy at home.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that we see Ireland as a backwater, a haven of old-world quiet ways.  We are in this highly-competitive world of to-day which is dominated by striking technical advances, by the emergence of new industrial countries and the reappearance of old ones.  These and other developments will call for our utmost endeavour; I do not exaggerate when I say that our very existence may well depend on how we face the problems which they present.</P>
    <P>It would be misleading to refer to emigration without mentioning one aspect which is perhaps not always taken into consideration.  It is to emigration that we owe the spiritual empire which is our pride and strength, which has raised our status from that of a small island on the Atlantic seaboard to that of a mother country claiming allegiance from very many millions of her sons in all parts of the earth and which, on the material <Col N="1702" /> plane, has given us an influence which we could not hope to achieve otherwise.</P>
    <P>But, if not all emigration is bad, the waters of the well-spring must not be allowed to dwindle.  It must be the aim of all of us to ensure that never again will an Irish census reveal a declining population.</P>
    <P>In our present difficulties we are entitled to draw solace from our achievements of the past.  Responsibility for the government of our own affairs now goes back some 35 years, and it is worth asking the question how well have we discharged ourselves in the task.  During that period government has been shared between the Parties represented in this House.  For the first ten years of the State, the Party to which I belong provided the Government, over a period of nearly 20 years the present Opposition Party governed, and for over five years the country has had government of the present cooperative character, inter-Party or Coalition, or whatever you care to call it.  Whatever there is of good or ill in modern Ireland is therefore the responsibility of us all.</P>
    <P>It is, unfortunately, a fact, which we must face, that in some circles it has become a practice to use the term Party politician in a depreciatory, if not in an abusive sense.  The term is most frequently used in this sense by those who, with grave lack of responsibility, make judgments on matters on which they are insufficiently informed and of which they have no practical experience.  Those attacks on the Party politician derive from the absence of a long tradition of self-government and an appreciation of its practices, from the aftermath of national revolution and civil war, from the corrosive effects of criticism by groups who disliked and despised Ireland's achievement of self-government, and from an insufficient appreciation of how the Party system works.  I wish to-night, in this House, to say something in defence of the profession of politics and in defence of this House, too, which, with such a striking lack of patriotism, those critics impugn.</P>
    <P>We are here perfectly well aware that, in all Parties in this House, there are men who have rendered signal service to this country, to which they <Col N="1703" /> have devoted their lives.  I hope that it is not part of the claim of any Party that it has the monopoly of patriotism. I think I will have the support of all Parties in saying that the criticism of each other&mdash;in which we mutually engage on the issues which arise&mdash;does not involve the suggestion of anything dishonourable or unworthy of our opponents.</P>
    <P>It is part of the business of democratic government that we hit hard and emphasise the arguments for and against particular policies so that, by having the alternatives placed clearly before them, the people may be enabled to exercise their choice of replacing one group by its opponents. The system has worked so well with us that though we started amid civil war we have now reached the happy state in which we are all united in defence of one Constitution, that in 35 years such stability has emerged that there have been only three Prime Ministers, and this during some of the most critical decades of the world's history.</P>
    <P>We have groups of Parties all now experienced in government, guaranteeing conditions of critical discussion and the maintenance of freedom, groups from which alternative Governments can be selected by the people. Those who complain that there is insufficient disagreement amongst the Parties seem to suggest that the State was healthier when disagreement was such that it could only be expressed in violence, and to imply that a society is the healthier the deeper the divisions which divide it.</P>
    <P>When I was first elected to this House I was proud to be the elected representative of my country, proud to serve in the National Parliament which was the goal and inspiration of earlier generations.  I know that my pride was, and is, shared by every other Deputy.  We must be vigilant, however, lest careless and misinformed criticism injures the prestige and lowers the esteem of the democratic institutions which we have fought for and which we have worked so successfully.</P>
    <P>We face the future, therefore, fortified by the possession of these democratic <Col N="1704" /> institutions and by the knowledge of our achievements in the past. To those who see nothing but the black side, who minimise past achievements and maximise present problems, I would repeat&mdash;because I think that in present circumstances it bears repetition&mdash;what I said during the debate on the Budget on the 17th May, 1956.  In Volume 157, No. 5, column 657 of the Dáil Debates, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think we should forget what has been achieved.  I am not going to enter into any discussion as to whether it was this Government, the last inter-Party Government or any Fianna Fáil Government that achieved it.  The country is entitled to be proud of the achievements which have been made and not to be discouraged by the difficulties which face it now and by the fact that we cannot get everywhere at once.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then proceeded to quote from the Pope's Easter Message, in which he expressed his disapproval:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...of those who see what is still lacking, what has not yet been fully achieved, and readily lend an ear to the whisperings of those sowing discontent. They close their eyes to much already accomplished in the enrichment of the social and economic order, which they, too, profit by, advantages frequently obtained through exhausting labour to overcome unsurmountable obstacles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The record of the past is impressive, not least when assessed against a background of civil disturbances, economic difficulties, a world war and its aftermath. It is a record to which all Irish Governments have contributed and in which all Irish Governments can take pride.</P>
    <P>In the last 35 years we have trebled our industrial production and have increased industrial employment by over 100,000.  We have increased manifold the production of electricity and of machine-won turf, have planted over 200,000 acres of forest, and have established and extended mercantile and air fleets.  We have transformed the face of the Irish countryside by imaginative schemes, boldly executed &mdash;including rural electrification, arterial <Col N="1705" /> drainage, land rehabilitation, elimination of bovine T.B., farm buildings' scheme, etc.  We have built or reconstructed over 275,000 houses, 2,500 primary schools and 150 hospitals.  We have introduced Social Welfare legislation to provide for the widow, the orphan, the blind, and the family and have made available general and specialist medical services to wide sections of the community.</P>
    <P>These considerable results do not exhaust all the achievements of the past.  If they have not succeeded in solving our difficulties, we are, I submit, entitled to face the future, not indeed with complacency, but with confidence based on these achievements. It is with justifiable confidence therefore, that we face the trinity of problems to which I have already referred &mdash;a serious Balance of Payments deficit, far too much unemployment and continuing large-scale emigration.</P>
    <P>We must continue to develop, to the best of our ability, the resources which we possess and to emulate other peoples in work and thrift, in the expansion of economic activity and in the raising of the standard of material well-being.  The Government will continue to promote and put into effect their long-term policy of developing the national resources, raising the general level of production, creating diversified opportunities of employment at home and improving progressively the living conditions of the people which, when we have overcome our present difficulties, will make possible the easement, if not the solution, of our problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I rise to follow the Taoiseach almost as a man disarmed. I have listened to an eloquent defence of Parliament, Sir, but Parliament is to be justified not merely by words but by policies.  We can all endorse what the Taoiseach has said as to the responsibilities of those of us who enter into public life. The system of Government which has served our people well, as it has served other peoples elsewhere equally well, is based upon the principle that there <Col N="1706" /> must be in the deliberative assembly of the nation ample scope for criticism.</P>
      <P>I say, Sir, that I speak as a man disarmed because, as a rule, the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate is regarded as the principal opportunity when the general policy of the Government will come under review.  It is generally availed of by the Taoiseach to give an exposition of the unified and comprehensive policy of the Government in relation to all those matters which everywhere are regarded as being the particular concern of those who control and direct the affairs of the State.  What, therefore, I am bound to ask, was the purpose of the dissertation to which we have just listened, except, I have to say, perhaps to prove that this Government has no policy?  The Deputy is not here to speak for himself but perhaps I may take the opportunity of speaking for Deputy James Larkin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in relation to the several matters to which the Taoiseach referred, may I use these words that Deputy James Larkin used on a previous occasion in this House&mdash; Volume 130, column 329 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It seems to me that if we are to have a realistic and practical approach to the economic situation which confronts this country one primary essential is that the Government itself should, in the first instance, make up its mind as to what situation is, in fact, facing the country and in what direction it is likely to develop.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has devoted himself in the greater portion of his speech to a brief summary of various considerations relating to the problem of emigration which appeared in the Report of the Commission on Emigration. Again to what purpose?  The Commission on Emigration was, as the Taoiseach has told us, set up by the then Minister for Social Welfare and Tánaiste in April, 1948.  The report of that commission was presented to the Government on the 11th March, 1954, just two months before the <Col N="1707" /> General Election.  With all this concern about emigration&mdash;and I am not for a moment suggesting that the Taoiseach is not as seriously concerned with it as we are on this side and as every thinking person in the country is&mdash;with all this concern, however, for this evil of emigration, that report has not even been printed by the Government and is not available to the public except in the least legible form&mdash;not printed.</P>

      <P>We have been told by the Taoiseach to-night that the problem is not one for the Government only.  Let us say at once that we accept that point of view but it is the Government who have the responsibility for formulating a policy in regard to emigration and it is a rather striking thing that, having had the report analysed in his office and these rather striking exculpatory statements extracted from it, the Taoiseach comes along here and fails to disclose to the country what is in fact the policy of the Government in relation to this question of emigration.  When the Taoiseach, however, was in opposition, he was not so ready to accept any share of responsibility for the evil.  Far from it.  In those days, when the commission was sitting, emigration was solely a problem for the Government; the Government of the day was responsible for the emigration; the Government of the day must initiate a policy to deal with emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy Dillon, as he then was, coming into this House and&mdash;I well remember him&mdash;weeping tears at the sights which he had witnessed in Ballaghaderreen and in other centres in the West of Ireland, scenes which he <Col N="1709" /> said reminded him of the famine days. Well, Deputy Dillon as he was then, Minister for Agriculture as he is now, has been in office for a considerable time and neither he nor the Taoiseach nor any other member of the Coalition Government has been able to formulate a policy to deal with this problem of emigration.  In fact, the statement of the Taoiseach this evening reminded me of nothing so much as a ceremonial washing of hands when he said it was not a problem for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a problem for the Government.  After all, what are these 12 just men doing in face of the responsibility which rests upon the other 2,900,000?  No one, least of all we on this side of the House, will deny the gravity of the emigration problem.  It is, in fact, so serious that, in my opinion, it should not be utilised merely as a sort of Parliamentary stratagem to divert attention from the main cause of the evils from which the country is suffering.</P>
      <P>The main cause of our present plight is the ineptitude of the present administration, this Coalition Government who, while the nation is bleeding to death, fritter away time endeavouring to reconcile the irreconcilable Party views of the conflicting elements that compose it, this Government which, in face of the grave situation which the Minister for Finance exposed to the Dáil this afternoon, while fully aware of the accelerating drain upon our youth, upon our young men and girls, occupy two whole days of the time of this House in trying to force a measure through which certainly was not of sufficient importance to justify the complete failure of the Minister for Agriculture to give any consideration whatsoever to the views of the Opposition in relation to a matter where indeed there should have been legislation by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration is, undoubtedly, from the point of view of this country, a grave social evil.  So, too, is the financial position in which we find ourselves, <Col N="1710" /> but there is something which lies at the root of all this, and that is the fact that we have not a united Government &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the fact that we have not a Government who accept the principle of the Constitution that every member of that Government bears collective responsibility for what the Government do in his name and that the Government bear collective responsibility for the actions of every member in regard to the administration of his office.  That doctrine has been disregarded.</P>
      <P>Again, may I revert to a speech which was made by Deputy Larkin in this House some two or three years ago, when he referred to the great depression of 1931?  He went on to refer to a fundamental principle of Government and said, in relation to the Government, that we are entitled to expect from them, as a body, collective responsibility.  That doctrine, as we know, was thrown over by the first Coalition when the Taoiseach said that every Minister in his Government was virtually a law unto himself&mdash;a dictator in his own Department.  But Deputy Larkin went on to explain why that situation existed under the first Coalition as, we believe, it exists in the second Coalition when, in relation to Fianna Fáil, he used these very striking words: &ldquo;They have an advantage in so far as they are a single Party Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Take the statement which the Taoiseach made this evening &mdash;this grave and serious statement about emigration.  He deplored it, as we all deplore it, as one of the gravest social evils that could affect our country. What was the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, if I am right in so describing him?  As I have said before, there has been such proliferation of the minor parliamentary offices under this Government that when you refer to a Parliamentary Secretary you do not know what precisely is his correct title.  The Taoiseach here in the House to-night has described to us the evils that flow from emigration, the difficulties that attend it and what it may mean for the people of this country.  He painted a very dark picture indeed and took, in relation to it, a responsible and grave attitude, as befitted the gravity of the problem.  But that was not the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary, who sits behind him, in relation to emigration.  No, he saw that it had its advantages, particularly when a Government were in difficulties in relation to unemployment.  The Parliamentary Secretary was able to get up, rub his hands and say: &ldquo;Well at least emigration is a safety valve.&rdquo;</P>

There is a motion down on the Order Paper to refer this Estimate back.  The Taoiseach may think himself an old parliamentary hand.  He asked himself: &ldquo;What am I going to do when the Opposition get up and start to criticise my leadership of the country in these circumstances?  What am I going to say when I am asked if I accept the constitutional doctrine of collective responsibility?  What am I going to say?  What am I going to say when I am told that my Minister for Local Government has gone around the country telling the people there are millions to be had for the asking for housing and for the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;What am I going to do when I have my Minister for Justice going down the country and making similar statements in flat contradiction of what is being said by the Minister for Finance?  What am I going to do when the Minister for Defence tells the country that all these financial problems with which we are dealing are merely a matter of book-keeping and that the problem will be sorted out in the end?&rdquo;  He said to himself: &ldquo;I know what I will do.  I will come in and I will read a nice dissertation about the evils of emigration and, incidentally, I will take the opportunity of saying to the Opposition, &lsquo;This is as much your pigeon as it is mine&rsquo; and I will put firmly and squarely on the Opposition responsibility for the fact that the Government <Col N="1715" /> have no policy for dealing with emigration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They have, in fact, given no thought to the problem over the last six or eight years.  The Government are more concerned with trying to remain in office for another few days or another few months.  I do not begrudge them their office.  I do not begrudge them the fact that they are in power.  It involves, I am sure, at this present juncture a great deal of worry and a great deal of difficulty for the Taoiseach, particularly from the point of view of keeping his team together. When I say I do not begrudge them, I do not begrudge them the fact that they are in office.  I do bemoan, for the sake of the country, the fact that they are in office and that the Taoiseach comes before this Dáil and, instead of giving a general and comprehensive exposition of the united policy of the Government in regard to the several aspects of our financial and political situation, he comes in here with a few choice extracts culled from the Report of the Commission on Emigration, which he thinks will exculpate the Government for the position in which the country finds itself and endeavours to sidetrack the real issues.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly the problem of emigration is a grave and serious one; it should have been discussed in this House on a separate and special occasion on which the Government might have put before us a statement of the measures they intended to take to deal with the problem.  We could then have dealt with it according to the ordinary ordinances of Parliament without its being necessary for us to challenge a division or to engage in the sort of critical debate which must take place upon the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Taoiseach has not chosen the proper way of putting this problem before the House.  Instead of putting down a motion asking the House to agree to certain measures being taken or asking the House if necessary, to set up a special committee to consider the Report of the Commission on Emigration and to recommend measures to the House which might be <Col N="1716" /> accepted by us all without any grave difference of opinion manifesting itself, the Taoiseach has chosen to approach the matter in another way. He has taken an occasion which has always been regarded as an occasion when the full policy of the Government is open to review and to criticism and when inevitably, and almost invariably, that policy has been the subject of a division in this House, to introduce this matter.</P>
    <P>We cannot for a moment divide on the Taoiseach's Estimate as he has presented it to us in regard to emigration. But we can, and we may possibly, divide the House upon the fact that the Taoiseach has made that statement without putting before the House any statement of the measures he proposes to take to deal with the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak in this debate with a certain amount of bewilderment. Everybody agrees that the economic situation is extremely serious.  The Taoiseach quite properly decided to make emigration the centre-point of his address to the House.  I was glad when I learned earlier to-day that he was to do so.  I came here and I listened attentively to the Taoiseach's speech, believing that the general statement of the problems relating to emigration was merely a prelude to what was to be a concrete declaration of policy on the part of the Government, as to the steps it would take to deal with the undoubted serious crisis which has arisen.  There was no such indication.  I next listened with attention to Deputy MacEntee who, presumably, had been chosen by the Opposition, make his contribution to the debate on behalf of the Opposition. He agreed, of course, that it was a serious problem.  Then he proceeded to indulge in venomously malicious suggestions against different members of the Government, but again I failed to find one trace or one vestige of a constructive suggestion in regard to a policy, or in regard to the serious problems which face the nation.  I think I will not be the only person in the country who will be surprised at this negative attitude in a debate of this importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> The Taoiseach, and to a certain extent, Deputy McEntee, both joined hands in a defence of Party politics and in a eulogy of the achievements of successive Governments of the past 35 years.  I wonder is that justified? What are the problems which we are discussing here to-day?  We have now, after 35 years of self Government, a lower population than we ever had before; we have an annual emigration rate of some 40,000 people a year, and a grave economic crisis.  These are not matters about which we can afford to be complacent and they are not matters about which we can boast.  Unlike the Taoiseach, and unlike Deputy McEntee, I think that, to a large extent, the problems confronting us to-day are the result of the past 35 years of Party politics and the result of a lack of intelligent planning for the reconstruction and development of our economy.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the position of this nation.  There is no physical no climatic and no demographic condition to prevent our country being as prosperous as any other country, if its economic development had been properly guided and planned.  Our soil is more fertile than the soil of most other countries in Europe; our climate is more temperate than the climate of most other countries in Europe.  We have an abundant and fertile population. Yet we only support a population of 110 souls to the square mile as compared with 714 to the square mile in Belgium and the Netherlands; 600 to the square mile in Britain; over 257 to the square mile in the Six Counties and 245 in Denmark.</P>
    <P>It may be said, of course, that countries like Belgium and Holland do not provide a fair basis for comparison, being highly industrialised.  That may be said, but surely we should be able to support at least the same population as the Six Counties?  Can anyone in this House indicate any reason, any physical reason, as to why we should be unable to support one of the lowest populations in Europe, having regard to the fact that all the natural factors should enable us to support a very <Col N="1718" /> high population?  The only reason I know of is our own failure to organise our economy, to organise our production in such a way as to enable us to support this low population.  There are no physical or natural factors which can prevent this country from being as prosperous as any other country in Europe, provided we organise ourselves and our economy so as to enable us to be a valuable economic unit.</P>
    <P>The disparity in our population in relation to our land area is equalled, if not surpassed, when we come to make comparisons with other countries in the field of production.  We produce less than other countries of a comparable size; our rate of investment is low with comparable economies; the rate of increase in our national income is low; the rate of capital formation is low.  I do not believe those conditions are due to any natural reasons or are due to an act of God.  I believe they are due to our own failure to organise our economy on a sound footing.  I believe we cannot remedy that position, unless we are prepared to face up to the failures over the past 35 years in the field of economic reconstruction and development.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Taoiseach when he says there is no cause for panic and that we should have self-confidence. I do not believe there is any cause for panic, provided we are prepared to jerk ourselves out of the inertia in which we have been basking. However, there is cause for panic if we are just going to let the situation drift as it has been drifting in the past.  I am not saying this in criticism of this Government more than the Fianna Fáil Government, but, by and large, our economic development has been uneven, fitful and lacking in a consecutive policy and approach.  In some respects, it was over-cautious; in others, under some political wind or another, it took unwise steps.</P>
    <P>The economic situation which faces the country is serious, but it is not a new one.  Practically every one of the problems which the Government faces to-day has existed since the State was set up.  True, they were masked from time to time by world war or by abnormal economic conditions.  However, since the State was set up, we <Col N="1719" /> have suffered and placidly accepted an abnormally high rate of unemployment and an abnormally high rate of emigration. Not only did we accept it, but we remained largely silent about it until recent years.  There is nothing new in that problem, but that does not make it any less a problem and a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Our trade has never balanced, except in wartime.  The deficits in our trade have been masked by drawings on sterling assets and invisibles, but a balance of payments position which is dependent upon invisibles can never be a healthy one.  Before our economy can be a healthy economy, we must be in a position to balance it straight, as distinct from securing a balance of payments by means of invisibles. Everybody knows&mdash;I think it is an admitted fact by all economists&mdash;that a balance of payments position which is dependent upon the income from foreign investments or emigrants' remittances, or even tourists, is not in the long run a sound one.  As far as possible, we should aim at securing a balance in our trade.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should realise that the problems which confront us to-day are not new problems.  They form part of an endemic economic defect in our economy which has existed since the State was set up.  The truth of the matter is that these defects in our economy are of such long standing that they have become practically structural defects.  Yet, in the face of that situation, is it not extraordinary that up to now there has been no concerted long-term plan to deal with it?</P>
    <P>While many useful things have been done&mdash;and the Taoiseach enumerated many of them&mdash;by successive Governments, we have mainly drifted on the basis of a day-to-day policy.  I am not trying to take away credit or to blame one Party more than another for it but what we have done has mainly been to try to keep up with the times.  We obviously had to increase social welfare benefits; we obviously had to build hospitals; we obviously had to improve our health services.  Social conditions and social standards in the world do not remain static.  They keep moving <Col N="1720" /> on and improving.  We just tried to keep pace to the best of our ability behind them, but, as far as undertaking the economic reconstruction of our country as it should have been undertaken is concerned, I think we have failed so far.  That task yet remains to be undertaken and it can be undertaken only on the basis of intelligent long-term planning.</P>
    <P>In the present situation, two separate approaches must be envisaged &mdash;the immediate or short-term approach to deal with the present situation and the long-term approach. The two approaches, particularly at the present moment, are equally important and are interrelated because measures to deal with immediate difficulties may often prove detrimental in the long run and may themselves create additional problems.  I am not certain to what extent that has not even happened in the light of the recent difficulties.  However, possibly it would be wiser if I left that over until to-morrow when we will discuss the proposals of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Apart from all our own sharp internal political differences, I believe that one of the principal causes for our lack of development since the State was set up has been the pursuit of a faulty and out-dated finance and investment policy.  I know that neither the Taoiseach nor the Opposition will agree with me.  I think we have given to our whole economy the wrong outlook and the wrong emphasis by making our economy dependent on and to a large extent subservient to the investment of large sums of our money abroad.</P>
    <P>It has become practically an obsession in the minds of successive Governments and of the advisers of Governments.  I wonder have the Taoiseach and Deputy de Valera ever asked themselves whether Germany had any sterling assets after the last war.  Germany to-day is one of the wealthiest countries in Europe.  Let me say straight away that the dissipation of our sterling assets on non-productive expenditure would be unwise, but in so far as this country is starved of capital investment for productive <Col N="1721" /> purposes, I do not think we should hesitate for one second to utilise our sterling assets to the full.</P>
    <P>One of the main defects in our economy has been the lack of investment, both in agriculture and in industry, and that starvation from which our economy suffers is largely the result of the mania we have had of wanting to maintain huge foreign investments and of allowing ourselves to become dependent upon them, instead of making a serious attempt to balance our trade.  However, I know I am not likely to secure agreement from the other Parties on these issues.  I would, however, implore them never to hesitate to utilise foreign investments if capital is required here for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>I think the policy pursued earlier this year, whereby the bank rate was increased and the policy pursued by the banks, with or without the approval of the Government, of imposing a credit squeeze has contributed to some of the difficulties we will suffer increasingly during the rest of the year.  Higher interest rates and the credit squeeze were bound to depress both production and employment and they have done so.  We have now mounting unemployment figures and I fear that, unless immediate measures are taken, and taken quickly, we will have unemployment figures comparable with those we had in 1953.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to bear that in mind and to realise that, if that situation develops, they will then be facing the position of having to waste public moneys in order to provide employment.  It would be much better to take steps now to prevent that position arising than to have to pour such money down the drain in order to provide relief schemes in the months of December, January and February, not to speak of the amount of political unpopularity that would draw on a Government faced with a high unemployment situation at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Higher interest rates were also bound to be reflected in higher prices and higher public administration costs, and this has happened, too.  Accordingly, <Col N="1722" /> I think it is fair to say that the credit squeeze and the dearer money policy have, in themselves, now resulted in increased unemployment and higher prices.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger in considering economic matters here that, no matter how much we try to avoid it, we are influenced by the economic line of thought which prevails in Britain. Economic articles, economic journals and economic books written in English are naturally more widely read here and have a greater influence than they would have in Germany, Denmark or some other country.  Therefore, we are inclined to be influenced by the economic thinking which prevails in Britain.  I think it is essential to bear in mind that the problems from which Britain's economy suffer are completely different from the problems of our economy.  Suffering from underemployment, from underdevelopment, as we do, the pursuit of a deflationary policy can only worsen our position and it can only intensify the problems from which we suffer.</P>
    <P>The immediate policies which may suit the British economy are usually suicidal in our own case.  Britain suffers from over-full employment.  It is the policy of the British Government to depress both employment and investment, to restrict the rate of investment. The very opposite is the requirement of our economy.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to urge on the Government and on the House the acceptance of what is now a pretty well accepted economic rule. The matter has been the subject of a good deal of discussion in the course of the last year or two.  It is this.  I think it is very important to bear it in mind in the light of our situation here. The credit restriction policy, whether it be by way of increased interest rates or by way of direct credit restriction, will primarily hit investments rather than consumption.  When you apply a credit freeze policy, it is now the established fact, well recognised by any reputable modern economist, that the effect of the credit restriction policy will affect investments rather than consumption. Therefore, if your aim is to promote investments or to allow investment <Col N="1723" /> to continue, as is essential in the case of an underdeveloped country, you should never apply a deflationary credit policy, as it will affect and hit your rate of interest much more than it will affect the rate of consumption.</P>
    <P>These are not merely my views: they are views which have been adopted by the O.E.E.C., by the Economic Commission of the Council of Europe, and which have been discussed inside out over the last couple of years.  I think these are factors which should be borne in mind.  We must be careful, in any of the remedial measures which we may take&mdash;remedial measures which may be intended to curtail the rate of consumption&mdash;that we do not instead hit investments.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I may say in passing, but in fact it might be wiser to leave it until to-morrow for discussion on the Estimates of the Minister for Finance.  It is this: I think we are placing far too much reliance on the possibilities of private savings.  Savings, as they were known in the pre-war days, are no longer achievable.  To a large extent the advent of the welfare State, here as elsewhere, has removed one of the incentives for saving.  That is one of the factors that applies now pretty universally; the other factor arises out of the fact that the Government usually syphons off by way of taxation what would have been saved by the people otherwise.  In other words, the Government indulges in a policy of compulsory savings on its own.  Therefore, it would be unwise for the Government to expect any large-scale private savings.</P>
    <P>By all means, savings should be encouraged, by all means savings are desirable but, in a situation of rising prices, in a situation of increasing taxation, I think the Government is not likely to succeed in getting substantial private savings from the community. By all means, savings campaigns should be encouraged and should be promoted.  As a matter of fact, while we have often talked about a savings campaign in this House&mdash;on all sides&mdash; we really have done very little about it. We set up the committee, but there has been very little sign of activity so <Col N="1724" /> far as the committee is concerned and very little imagination or steps taken to promote the savings campaign in the sense that I had hoped it might be promoted.</P>
    <P>It is essential that&mdash;forgetting about the past, forgetting about the errors or the eulogies we may have to make about the past&mdash;we should realise that modern world conditions and scientific advances not only permit but require long-term economic planning.</P>
    <P>While we have no experience here of long-term economic planning, this is how in fact so much has been achieved, so much progress has been made, in Western Europe since the war.  I do not think we can afford to continue to allow the survival of this nation&mdash;for it is now approaching a question of survival&mdash;to be subject to the rather haphazard and often ill-informed policies which have guided us in the past.  Concerted action, on the basis of intelligent planning, on the basis of initiative and self-confidence, is absolutely essential. Naturally, long-term planning involves a consecutive pursuit of the plans decided upon.</P>
    <P>It would, therefore, be much more satisfactory if such long-term planning could be approached on the basis of united action by the different Parties. Otherwise, there is a danger that if the Government or the Opposition put forward a plan, it will gradually become the plaything of Party politics. Its progress will be hindered or deflected by the various political winds that may blow.  No matter what eulogy we may ourselves make in this House about Opposition Parties, I seldom have known them to resist making capital out of any difficulty in which they found the Government, and I thought Deputy MacEntee gave us an illustration of that to-night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy gave some good examples himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to make capital out of the present situation. The present situation is one which has existed for a long time and I am merely trying to bring about an appreciation in the minds of Deputies <Col N="1725" /> that a radically new approach will have to be made.  The only type of approach that, in my view, can be made is one based upon a concerted long-term plan with fixed annual targets, with a measure of agreement on the part of the different Parties in this House that that plan will not be made use of for Party political purposes, with a measure of agreement among the different Parties that successive Governments will continue to implement the plan, that that plan will not become a football in the political market place with politicians on both sides of the House outbidding each other as to its target or the promises they make in regard to it.  I know that when I put forward this idea before, the suggestion was made by the Opposition Press, I think, that this was an attempt to set up a dictatorship. Of course that is sheer nonsense.  The mere fact that Parties in a Parliament agree on the pursuit of a long-term economic programme in no way affects their independence in the criticism of the administration of the programme.</P>
      <P>I would have more confidence in a plan if it were an agreed one because I would feel that the hope of getting it implemented would be much greater and that you could generate more national enthusiasm for it.  Earlier to-day, Deputy de Valera referred to the stamina of the Irish people in an emergency and the Taoiseach referred to the steadfast determination of the Irish people to maintain their independence. I agree entirely and I believe that our people would be prepared to make the sacrifices necessary, to make the sacrifices which the long-term economic reconstruction of the country would involve, provided they got the united leadership that was necessary.  I am satisfied that the Irish people would be prepared to make tremendous sacrifices if they saw before them a goal and a policy towards that goal.  That is what we must provide and I believe we can provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we even try to get agreement on the ultimate objectives of such a plan? Have we ever thought of the economic tasks that face us?  Have we assessed clearly in our minds what we <Col N="1726" /> mean when we say we want to end unemployment and emigration?  Do we realise what it means?  Do we realise what it means on the basis of say a ten-year plan?  It means the provision of at least 350,000 new jobs.  I am quite prepared to accept&mdash;and I think the Taoiseach is quite correct when he states this&mdash;that emigration is not entirely economic.  I think a percentage of emigration is due to social factors.  My own assessment of the position is that out of a 40,000 annual emigration, such as we have at the moment, 25,000 of it is economic and 15,000 is social.  I know there is room for a difference of views on that, but I feel it is roughly in those proportions. On the basis of a net economic emigration of 25,000 a year, allowing for the existing unemployment and allowing for some future disemployment resulting from improved technology, we must envisage the creation of 350,000 jobs in the course of ten years, if we are serious in talking about dealing with emigration or unemployment.</P>
    <P>Have either the Government or the Opposition faced up to that problem? Has any assessment been made of the annual or global rate of investment required in agriculture, in industry, in minerals, in fisheries and in land development generally, in order to produce a given increase in production? I do not think we have ever faced up to the way in which recognised economic planning is done in other countries.  We have just been going along from day to day, drifting along without realising that, particularly since the war, under the impact of American and Canadian economists, economic planning has now become practically a science, and that you can now assess pretty accurately, subject to the influence of all kinds of external factors, the annual rate of investment required to achieve given results.</P>
    <P>If we are determined to get agreement on the formulation of an economic plan, what would it entail? It will involve, in the first instance, an objective assessment of the targets which we plan to achieve at the end of a ten year period in each different sector of our economy, the targets which we aim to achieve in the industrial <Col N="1727" /> and in the agricultural sectors of our economy; it would involve determining the ultimate target which was required in exports and in employment. Once these four or five main targets were agreed upon, it then becomes largely a technical task for economists to assess the requirements of the programme as a whole and of the programme in each of its early phases under a number of different heads.</P>
    <P>These economists would have to determine the global and the annual rate of investment, the gain in each different sector of the economy, the number of technicians and the type of man-power required to meet the requirements of the programme.  We would have to assess the expansion of exports required to balance our present economy, but also to provide for the increased consumption which would result from increased employment and greater economic activity here.  And, of course&mdash;if I might digress for a moment&mdash;another thing to which we would have to face up is that the more people in employment here, the worse would our adverse balance of trade be likely to be, the more we stem emigration, the worse will our balance of trade be, unless we simultaneously increase production to compensate for increased consumption.</P>
    <P>It is axiomatic that every additional man in employment means more consumption. A large proportion of the amount of that extra consumption would consist of articles imported, such as tobacco and tea.  Likewise, every increase in the standard of living naturally affects your balance of payments position.  If you gave an increase of 5/- to every man in the country to-morrow morning, it would be a reasonable assessment to say that 2/6 of that would be spent on some goods that had been imported, whether it be in the shape of an additional packet of cigarettes, or an ounce of plug tobacco, or some cheap stockings.  Half of the additional amounts earned would mean additional imports, so that the problem is of much greater scope, is much wider than is generally recognised.</P>
    <P>The more we succeed in providing <Col N="1728" /> employment, the more problems we have to face as far as our external payments are concerned.  I mention that merely as an aside, because I think that is very often lost sight of.  Another thing that we can accept, although I think the Taoiseach did not touch on it to-night, is that we should expect no increase in agricultural employment. We can and should expect a very high increase in agricultural production, but that increase will not, I am afraid, ever result in any increase in agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>The trends in other countries with similar conditions as ours have shown that, if anything, with higher developments and a high rate of agricultural production, employment is tending to decrease as a result of technological advances and improved methods, so that, by and large, the improvement which we are to provide, if we are serious in our desire to deal with emigration, and with unemployment, will have to be largely in the industrial sector of our economy or in its ancillary services.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to suggest that the formulation of a plan of this kind would be an easy matter.  I think there would be extremely little disagreement between the different Parties as to the ultimate targets of this 10-year plan.  I do not think there is room for any disagreement as to the targets; I think the facts of our situation are so painfully obvious that there could not be any room for disagreement of a serious kind.  The trouble will be, when and if agreement is reached at political level, as to how the details of such a plan will be worked out.  I do not think we have the personnel here to do it.  Our economists would not appear to have been thinking on those lines.  I think they have been out of touch with modern economic developments.  However, I have no doubt it would be possible to secure the assistance of such bodies as the O.E.E.C or the Economic Commission for Europe or from the U.N. agencies who have highly trained staffs of experts with experience of this type of work, and who would give some assistance, if not in the formulation of a programme of this kind, at least in advising from <Col N="1729" /> their experience as to the possibility of the targets aimed at, the ratio of investment and man-power, and so on, which would have to be provided.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have talked at such length to-night on this question, but I did feel and do feel somewhat dismayed by the fact that from neither side of the House have we had any concrete proposals to deal with the situation.  To a certain extent, I am glad of it from this point of view, on one condition, that some attempt will be made now to formulate a concrete policy, not by one side of the House as against the other side of the House, but jointly.  If the Minister for Agriculture had put forward a detailed concrete agricultural policy, I am quite certain that it would have been attacked by the other side of the House.  <i>Vice versa,</i> I would feel reasonably certain that if Deputy MacEntee, for instance, put forward a detailed financial policy, it would probably be savaged by the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>Could we get away from that and could we get down to the logics of the situation which faces the country? Could we approach the problems more realistically than we have approached them in the past?  Let us not be afraid to face the extent of the problem.  It is an extremely large problem, much larger than I think most members of the House or most members of the public appreciate.  The public are bewildered at the present moment.  They know that there is some kind of a crisis; they think it is a kind of passing crisis.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is merely a continuation of a crisis which has existed since the State was set up.</P>
    <P>That is the approach that should be adopted by the Government and by the Opposition.  I should like to say in passing that I welcome what would appear to be a change of attitude on the part of the Opposition in the course of recent weeks on this issue.  I thought they had adopted a more constructive attitude than before.  If agreement could be got on the long-term plan and if we could then all push together behind it, harness the enthusiasm of the people, get them to work a little <Col N="1730" /> bit harder than they have worked hitherto, get them to be prepared to make the sacrifices that such a long-term plan would involve, I think we would get a response.  Otherwise, we will continue to drift from crisis to crisis, in the end probably hoping for another world war so that we may again start building up sterling assets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach indicated and as was agreed by Deputy MacEntee, it is the function of the Opposition to be critical and, I hope, constructive, in their approach to the discussion of national problems.  The responsibility for policy for the time being rests on the shoulders of the Government.  It is in that background that we have to consider our problems. I am not a believer in Deputy MacBride's theories that all Parties should participate in the Government and, presumably, that there should be no Opposition.  I am one of those who prefer two Parties, as there have been in the best examples of democracies, one Party in opposition and one Party in Government.  Deputy MacBride believes in the régime of splinter Parties.  We will not be here, but the future will show whether Ireland will benefit more from one or the other of these two alternative systems.</P>
      <P>With regard to the organisation of our economy, Deputy MacBride, when the Marshall Aid agreements were being made, set up certain targets. Has he already forgotten what they were?  We remember the 25,000 acres in regard to afforestation, about which the advice of the technical experts in forestry was never sought.</P>
