    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have considered the full economic and financial consequences that are likely to result from the Middle East situation and the protracted blockage of the Suez Canal, and if he is in a position to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic, financial and other conseqnences to this country of the recent developments in the international situation and of the blockage of the Suez Canal have been, and are, engaging the active attention of the Government.</P>
      <P>While I do not, at the present stage, propose to make any detailed or general statement on the matter, I can assure the Deputy that specific action will continue to be taken, and announced from time to time, according as the needs of the situation may demand&mdash;as has already been done by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the case of petrol and oils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I welcome the opportunity presented by the Deputy's question of sounding a note of warning to our people that the consequences to us of recent international developments may prove to be more real and more serious than seems to be generally realised. As examples of the sort of problems and difficulties that will face us, I might mention the inevitability of an increase in the price of certain imported commodities, due to rising freight-rates and the shortage of shipping that will be created by the Suez situation; the reduction in oil and petrol supplies <Col N="1170" /> and the increased dollar-cost of such of our supplies as we may be unable to obtain from what have hitherto been our normal sources of supply; the pressure on the availability and prices of other fuels, resulting from the shortage of oil; the adverse impact on the Exchequer of the reduction in oil supplies; and the other financial and fiscal problems that will be created by the inter-play of the various factors in the situation.  All the problems and difficulties arising from these recent international developments&mdash;which, I need hardly remind Deputies, are not of our making&mdash;are receiving the unremitting attention of the Government, and I am confident that the Government can rely on the whole-hearted co-operation of the entire community in bearing their share of the burden that will be involved in surmounting these problems and in solving these difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been drawn to reports that oil and petrol supplies to Western Europe will be reduced by 20 per cent. as a result of the Middle East situation and, if so, whether he has considered the desirability of introducing rationing of oil and petrol at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the deterioration in the supply position I regret to have to say that it is now inevitable that formal measures of rationing must be introduced for motor fuels and certain other petroleum products. The earliest practicable date by which the formal rationing arrangements can be made effective is the 1st January, 1957.  I will make an announcement shortly as to the nature of the rationing arrangements.  In the meantime, certain measures to restrict consumption will have to be adopted and these will be announced in the immediate future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate whether the total reduction in the petrol supplies will be in the neighbourhood of 20 per cent., that is, the overall reduction in the national supplies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not think it proper that I should be asked to furnish information in the Dáil regarding the business affairs of a private commercial concern.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that this firm is now employing its staff on full time, on a Government Order.  That is a complete answer to the Deputy's allegation that the firm were on short time because of cutting down, under Government Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular branch of the clothing trade, seasonal lay-offs are usual and, that being the pattern of employment in this particular section of the clothing trade from time immemorial,  here have been more people employed in this firm during the past two years than when the Deputy's Government were in office.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter involves very careful consideration so far as the agricultural community is concerned. It concerns not merely the Department of Industry and Commerce but the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance.  Detailed consideration of this project has been proceeding for some time and a technical examination of all the area involved has also been undertaken.  A decision has not yet been arrived at so far as the question of establishing a nitrogenous fertiliser industry is concerned.

      <P>In accordance with Section 5 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the Fair Trade Commission published notice of their intention to make Fair Trading Rules for carpets and rugs and all interested parties were given an opportunity to make written representations in relation to the proposed rules.  The commission did not take formal evidence from witnesses.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is doubtless aware, I have no direct statutory responsibility in regard to Fair Trading Rules as the power to make these rules is vested by law in the Fair Trade Commission.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The lay-off is due to the jact that Bord na Móna cannot now find a market with the E. S. B. for the turf for which they believed a market would be available.  That market is not available because the E. S. B. have said that they are over-planted and that they do not need at this stage the turf which Bord na Móna hoped to sell them earlier than they can now sell it, having regard to the E.  S.  B.  overplanting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that Herd na Móna work on this principle. They take on people at the beginning of the turf cutting season, about February or early March.  They build up to a peak period and then they go over to winter strength.  This year Bord na Móna, employed 6,900 persons at the peak period as against 6,300 last year, 6,100 the year before and 9,500 the year before that.  Tapering off takes place in the winter period and that is inevitable unless some other work can be found.  The Deputy knows from his own experience that turf cutting in the winter is not an economically rewarding occupation.</P>

      <P>I have been assured by the board that the lay-off is seasonal and that they are retaining in employment the maximum number of men for whom they can find economic employment.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that not less than six distilleries, including three pot-still whiskey distilleries, will engage in distilling this year.  On present indications, there should be no signficant change in the volume of production this year as compared with last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire from the Minister where he got the information that there are six distilleries in operation?  Secondly, is he aware that only two distilleries will go into operation this year to distil; that the remainder of the distilleries are mailing for the Scotch brewers and distillers and that one distillery is <Col N="1185" /> malting for another concern within the State?  In view of that situation, would the Minister not agree that it is essential at this stage to ensure that our export programme will not decrease in six or seven years' time as a result of the lack of distilleries in this coming year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the Deputy's attention to the fact that while I referred to distilleries in my answer, I discriminated between distilleries which are pot-still whiskey distilleries and other distilleries which are not pot still.

Is the Minister satisfied that the distilling programme which is being undertaken this year by each of the distilleries within the State is on the same scale as last year?  In other words, is the Minister satisfied that distillation will be completed within the State and that it is not merely a question of malting or roasting taking place here for subsequent export out of the State?</P>

      <P>My information is compiled on particulars which are furnished by the distilling companies.

    </Speaker>

I told him what the present position was. On the following day he asked another question and he got the answer straightaway.  It was not my function to give him that answer but, in the fireside chat that the Deputy initiated on the following day, he got quite an enormous amount of information from me.  On the 30th he got a complete answer to the question he asked.  As far as any implication or suggestion in the Deputy's question now is concerned&mdash;a question put a fortnight after he got the information in reply to a specific question that he introduced in a fireside chat on Deputy Blaney's question&mdash;I do not understand what the implication or suggestion is.  The Deputy has taken a fortnight to ask the question.  I know that he got a straight answer to the question he asked on the 30th.  To the supplementary question he asked on the following day, the 31st, he got a straight answer also.</P>

I then gave the Deputy information as to why the reinvitation of tenders was being postponed.  It was postponed because of financial circumstances.  But the school would probably have been built by this had the person who tendered and who had been accepted gone ahead and did the work.  That person withdrew.  When I am asked what the present position is, I tell the Deputy what the present position is.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable sum of money has already been spent by the Land Commission in an effort to provide a water supply for this estate but the results were not satisfactory. The advisability of spending additional money on the project will however be carefully examined, but it appears doubtful whether a suitable water supply is obtainable at all in this particular district.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that 18 months ago the Department stated that when machinery of a suitable kind was available further work would be carried out in this locality in connection with the investigation of water supplies?  Would the Minister say why 18 months have been allowed to elapse without having that work done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission has sunk a borehole several hundred feet deep.  The water found was not pure, and it is very doubtful if any further boring will provide a suitable water supply in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but the Minister is perfectly well aware that this work was carried out ten years ago, and in view of the fact that, no later than 18 months ago, I was given in writing an assurance that boring equipment would be in the area carrying out further boring tests, would the Minister state whether those tests will be carried out in the near future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he has received any complaint indicating that there was a bias against the use of the Irish language in recent court proceedings <Col N="1197" /> in Cork and, if so, whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a complaint the burden of which is that the process in the case in question was invalid because of the alleged misspelling of the defendant's name.  The court held otherwise and, if the defendant was aggrieved by this decision, it was open to him to appeal against it, which he has not done.  As the Deputy knows, the dispensation of justice in particular cases is a matter for the courts and not for me, but I would not like it to be thought that either of the justices who dealt with this matter has any bias against the Irish language since I believe the contrary to be the case.</P>
      <P>I might add that the complaint also implies a criticism of the plaintiff and the solicitors acting for the plaintiff but the Deputy will appreciate that this is a matter for which I have no official responsibility at all.  If proceedings were taken in the case in question because of the defendant's insistence that he be addressed in the Irish form of his name, I believe that all fair minded people will deprecate such conduct.  The Deputy will understand that it is difficult to ascertain whether such was the case in this instance and even if it were there are no powers at my disposal to interfere in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the defendant in this case incurred unnecessary costs because he refused to accept demands for payments except in his Irish name? Surely this House and the Minister's Department should uphold the right of every citizen to use only the Irish language, if he wishes to do so, and no penalties should attach to any citizen for exercising this right?  Is he also aware that the land agents in this case refused to address this citizen by his proper name in the Irish language although the deed in question was executed by the defendant in the Irish language?  I think this is an impertinence which the Minister should comment on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy, I have no power <Col N="1198" /> to inform solicitors in a particular case whether the Irish or English language should be acceptable.  The facts are that the two justices concerned are well-known supporters of the language revival and I regret that any insinuations should be made that they were biassed against the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' <Col N="1199" /> Society Ltd., and the Beef Canners' Advisory Association recently wrote to me suggesting that if it were proposed to export horse flesh they would have no objection provided that certain conditions were fulfilled.  In 1952, the trade organisation, which was then known as the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Committee, adopted a resolution supporting the prohibition on exports of horse flesh.  The attention of the society has been drawn to this resolution and they have been asked whether they now favour the granting of facilities for the export of horse flesh.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I indicated in connection with questions by the Deputy on 25th October that this matter is kept under constant and careful review.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is now in a position to make a further statement with regard to the loss of letters posted to a County Limerick address, and the reasons why other letters were opened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's previous question on this matter related to three incidents affecting the correspondence of the person concerned, namely (1) the non-receipt of letters addressed to him in London which had been posted in July, 1956, in a County Limerick letter-box, (2) the non-receipt of six letters posted in December, 1955, to his home address in County Limerick and (3) the opening at the G.P.O. Limerick of letters posted in London in May, 1956, to his wife at their County Limerick address.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first incident, the position, as I have already explained to the Deputy, is that inquiries made by my Department and the British Post Office have not disclosed the circumstances in which the items failed delivery.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other two incidents, I have made further inquiry on the basis of information since supplied by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still no trace in my Department of any complaint regarding the six items posted in December, 1955, <Col N="1205" /> and it would appear that the complainant raised this matter for the first time in a letter sent by him to the Deputy.  I have that letter but the information given in it is not sufficiently detailed for inquiry purposes.  My Department would need to have particulars of who sent the six letters, dates and places of posting and nature of contents.  Those are particulars normally required for missing letter inquiries.  If those particulars are supplied I shall have such inquiry made as is practicable at this late stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the third aspect, the letters in question were suspected of containing contraband and were forwarded to the Customs centre at Limerick in accordance with the provisions of Section 18 of the Post Office Act, 1908.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago it was brought to my notice that one local authority had offset the recent increases in Social Insurance benefits by reducing the amount of Home Assistance <Col N="1207" /> Allowances.  I immediately informed all Public Assistance authorities of my strong objection to this action.  I am glad to say that there has been no general reduction in the payment of home assistance because of the increased benefits.  In the particular case I mentioned where the local authority had made reductions, the former rates of Home Assistance have since been restored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that a number of local authorities have, since the date of his instruction, reduced the amount which was being paid in home assistance to those people by an amount equivalent to the increases they received in social welfare benefits, and would he again remind those local authorities that, even if it is within the law, it is a mean act on their part?</P>

      <P>The Minister has no function as far as making an Order is concerned.  I am advised I am precluded from making an Order prohibiting the local authorities from taking into account the increases in social welfare benefits for the purpose of home assistance payments.  The local authorities are well aware of my views.  I think it was a mean and despicable act on the part of local authorities to have done that.  The only way I could deal with the matter would be by introducing legislation.  I do not think it is necessary to do that, in view of the fact that practically all the local authorities behaved pretty well and did not reduce home assistance.  I think there were only one or two who made these deductions.</P>

      <P>We have all been shocked to hear of the sudden death of Deputy Thomas Derrig.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Deputy took an active part in the War of Independence.  He was jailed in Britain shortly after the <Col N="1214" /> Rising of 1916 and served a further period of imprisonment in Belfast during 1918.  He was interned in the Curragh early in 1921 and was kept a prisoner there until after the Truce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig was elected to the Second Dáil in 1921 for the constituency of North and West Mayo and represented that constituency until 1923.  He was again returned to the Dáil in 1927, for the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, which he represented continuously up to the time of his death.  He served in ministerial capacity, either as Minister for Education or as Minister for Lands, from 1932 to 1948 and again from 1951 to 1954.  The late Deputy, who spent his boyhood in the West of Ireland, developed early a love of the Irish language, which reflected itself in his policy as Minister for Education and in his efforts to encourage the revival of the language.  He was an eloquent and earnest speaker and made many useful contributions to debates in this House on educational, agricultural and general topics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derring was always kind, courteous and helpful, and his unexpected passing will be keenly felt by members of all Parties.  His constituents, in particular, will miss a representative who actively concerned himself with their interests during his many years in public life.</P>

    <P>The whole purpose of this Bill is to save the face of the Government.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to enable the Government to refuse to implement the provisions contained in the Health Acts which are on the Statute Book of this State and to enable them by such refusal to deprive the people who bear the heaviest share of the expenses which are incurred under the Health Acts of the rights to receive proper medical treatment when their circumstances so require.  This is the Bill which is supposed to give effect to the principle of insurance in relation to medical services.  This is the Bill which is supposed to appeal to the white collar worker.  This is the Bill which is supposed to provide for the needs of the farmer whose valuation happens to be £51 instead of £50.</P>

      <P>I am coming to the question whether, in respect of a Bill which proposes to set up an expensive body to do what the Minister and his advisers should do, the House is justified in spending £25,000, even in advancing £25,000, because this Bill&mdash;let us be quite frank about it&mdash;is merely another one of those face-saving subterfuges which the Government avails of whenever it is driven to extremes, whenever it finds itself in extremity of need, when it must find an excuse for failing to fulfil the promises which it gave to the people.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to set up an expensive board of directors with all the paraphernalia of an insurance company&mdash;actuaries, secretaries, typists, clerical officers, and so on, to do for the Government and the Minister what the Minister for Health and the Department of Health ought to be able to do for themselves.  There are two actuaries, one in the Department of Health and one, I believe, is Secretary to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I am not over-conscientious but I am conscientious, and I am also very conscious of the fact that the Chair must be respected.  I was coming to say that because there is no alternative to this Bill, that if we do not accept the implications of the Second Reading and provide the money, if it is not agreed that the Minister for Finance out of his generosity will lend £25,000 to a number of men who are going to be appointed as directors of this company, to pay the salaries of their officials, nothing will be done for the class to whom I have referred.  In these circumstances, we do not seem to have any option except to agree to the <Col N="1226" /> Money Resolution unless we are prepared to do what apparently the Minister would be prepared to do, that is to say, let these people who require to take out insurance against ill-health, die, in their need, because otherwise this Government will not provide for them.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy MacEntee, I find it very hard to know to whom exactly is he speaking and why exactly he is speaking. All the Members in this House know Deputy MacEntee's form.  He is the political Peter Pan of Irish politics and he will break a lance at anything, but he generally tilts at windmills. However, I am a little bit concerned that people reading the account of Deputy MacEntee's outburst here might perhaps think that he was taken seriously even by his own Party, and for fear that people might think that, I propose to correct the impression that he might have created.  In case Deputy MacEntee does not know, his own Party are delighted with this Bill and have welcomed it in this House.  I have here the report of the Second Reading.  I notice that Deputy Dr. Hillery at column 715, Volume 160 of the Official Debates of 7th November, 1956, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I welcome this Bill and the establishment of a board for voluntary health insurance.  I sincerely hope that the work of that board will be successful, for two reasons. The scheme is calculated to give coverage against illness to that part of our population which at present is not very well, or much better able, to meet these accident...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan, another Fianna Fáil Deputy, a member of Deputy MacEntee's Party, says at column 721 of the same Volume:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Like all other Deputies who have spoken in this debate, I welcome the idea enshrined in the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and Deputy Flanagan went on to give his reasons.  I do not know where Deputy MacEntee was when the Second Reading discussion was going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know to whom he has been talking since, but I propose to put a <Col N="1227" /> few questions to Deputy MacEntee now because he is obviously a very worried man.  If this Bill were not introduced, would Deputy MacEntee like to tell us what should be done? Does he believe in State medicine the same as his running partner in SouthEast Dublin believes in it?  Is he as great a Socialist as his stablemate in that constituency?</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee thought fit to make some suggestions here to the effect that I, as Minister responsible in the Government of which I am a member, have no concern for those who need health services, for those who may be sick, for those who may require hospitalisation. I do not think it is extravagant for me to claim that in the last two and a half years I have done far more than Deputy MacEntee or any of his colleagues in providing effective health services.  I was left a mess by Deputy MacEntee and his colleagues, who were obviously only concerned with the political aspect of health.  I have had the job of clearing up the mess. I think I have successfully done so.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee suggested that this Bill was designed as an alibi for not providing services under the 1953 Health Act.  Apparently Deputy MacEntee does not realise that it is due to the work of this Government, and to my Department in particular, that the services under the Health Act of 1953 are fully in operation and they have been provided in a way in which they would never have been provided by Deputy MacEntee and his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for those who are not covered by the Health Act of 1953 and even for those who are covered by that Act but who prefer to pay their own way.  Deputy MacEntee regards that as something reprehensible.  I do not.  I applaud anyone who is prepared to stand on his own feet, meet his own costs and pay his own way.  I do not think that is anything of which to be ashamed. Apparently Deputy MacEntee thinks that is something he can twist in order <Col N="1229" /> to gain some political kudos for himself in his own constituency.  He can work as hard as he likes on that, but I think most people, particularly the ratepayers in Deputy MacEntee's constituency, have some worries with regard to the present cost of health services.  Yet, Deputy MacEntee suggests here that we are not providing enough.  Does he want us to go further and increase the liability still further on the ratepayers and taxpayers in the provision of more and more expensive health services?  Or does he merely think that what is done in England should be done here simply because it is done in England?</P>
    <P>I commend this quotation from Deputy Seán Flanagan, a member of Deputy MacEntee's own Party, to Deputy MacEntee's attention.  Speaking on this Bill, to which this Money Resolution is directed, Deputy Seán Flanagan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As far as I am concerned, I not merely welcome the Bill but the principle enshrined in it, and I regret it has not been extended and that the idea has not been used before this in regard to the health service and indeed, to some extent, in regard to social welfare.  At least, at long last, we are putting through a scheme designed to benefit the people without going to the taxpayer's pocket.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now there is a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In the name of Heaven, is it possible for that Party to make up its mind on anything?  They do not know what their policy is in relation to this, or anything else, and they come in here wasting the time of this House, talking with diverse tongues and expressing different opinions.  I would suggest to Deputy MacEntee that he should not intervene in debates here until he at least knows what his own Party thinks of the matter under discussion and particularly not until he has read the Bill upon which he seeks to talk.</P>

      <P>Under this Money Resolution we are asked to advance £25,000 to the company and we are also asked to provide another £25,000 for the expenses of the Minister in administering this scheme.  What is this money intended for?  Can the Minister tell us that? What will be the salaries paid to the Chairman, Managing Director and other members of the Board of this Voluntary Insurance Company?  Will this company engage the services of an actuary?  Everybody knows that among the professions, that of an actuary is one of the highest paid. Everybody knows that an actuary in any substantial insurance company will have a salary running into four figures certainly, and in some cases, into five.  Surely we are entitled to know from the Minister what this money is intended for and how this sum of £25,000 has been arrived at?</P>

Does the Minister know?  Is it merely a sort of compromise between appearing to do a great deal, on the one hand, for the unfortunate middle class who have to provide for themselves and to whom this Bill is thrown as a sort of sop and, at the same time, saying to the people: &ldquo;It is not going to cost you very much&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Let us see who, in the opinion of Deputy MacEntee, are the people who will get these well-paid jobs.  They are the members of the National Farmers' Association, the members of Macra na Feirme and the members of Muintir na Tíre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cite these bodies because Deputy MacEntee has a habit in these days of describing these people in company with whatever citizens will be charged with the administration of this scheme as being &ldquo;well-paid pals&rdquo; of the members of this Government.  This is a repetition of allegations made on another occasion which he is again introducing here in reference to the people who will administer the voluntary health insurance scheme.  On the one hand, we have had criticism from him on the basis that there is not sufficient money being voted and on the other hand we have been criticised by him because he thinks there should be more money there because of the work involved.</P>
      <P>If he had taken the trouble to read the Bill in the first place, he would find that the provision is negligible in relation to the benefits which will accrue to those sections of the community that were left out of the provisions of the Health Act that his Party introduced.  It is time that such incentives were provided for the community as Deputy Seán Flanagan and others said during the Second Stage. It is time that the people were given a chance to look after themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is objecting to this Government providing incentives to any section of the community. The difficulty is that, instead of providing incentives, the Government are giving what one might call disincentives. The Government are keeping the people from earning money; they are keeping the people from maintaining <Col N="1236" /> themselves by honest labour.  It is just a mockery for the Parliamentary Secretary to talk about incentives in connection with this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the setting up of a board; there is nothing in it referring to the National Farmers' Association, to the Beet Growers' Association, to Macra na Feirme or to any other body associated with agriculture or industry.  All it proposes is to provide £25,000 in order that the board may be in a position to spend that amount of money.  On what?  On providing and carrying out a scheme of voluntary health insurance.</P>
      <P>Why should not the Department of Health, with all the expert advice at its disposal in relation to insurance, in relation to medical matters, in relation to administration matters, make the scheme to which Section 4 of the Bill refers?  Could the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister answer that? The reason, of course, why the Department of Health could not make the scheme is set out in Section 5.  Section 5 provides that the board consist of a chairman and a managing director and such number of other members as the Minister may, from time to time, determine.</P>

      <P>It is going to make a scheme of voluntary health insurance. I am suggesting to the House that that is work which the Minister should do in his own Department. They have in the Department more knowledge; they have sources of information available to them in the Central Statistics Office and from their own statistical returns.  All this knowledge is fortified and backed up by the experience the Department of Health have gained over the past five or six years.  I am putting this question simply to the House and to the country: why is it that the Department of Health have not made the scheme themselves?  Why has the Minister not come to the Dáil with a Bill, if you like, to set up a voluntary health insurance body to administer a particular and definite scheme?</P>
      <P>Is not the main reason why this £25,000 is required because the Minister has not done that?  That again is a case of passing the buck, as the Americans say.  Some other body will have the duty imposed upon them&mdash;for a consideration, of course&mdash;and they will have to carry the responsibility of eventually saying to the country: &ldquo;We are not able to put before you a scheme of voluntary health insurance which would be generally accepted&rdquo;. Is that not the position?</P>

Is that not the whole reason the Bill is brought in in its present form; is that not why we are asked to advance this £25,000? If we do advance the money&mdash;as we will because we have got to show up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the sham, what chance is there of having it repaid? Has the House considered that?  There is not anything more certain, in my view, judging by the experiences of other voluntary insurance schemes, than that the board will come along and say they cannot repay the money. They will say: &ldquo;We just have not got the spondulicks&rdquo;.  Therefore, what is now before the House in the guise of a loan will ultimately turn out to be a grant, and the Minister will say to the House and to his constituents: &ldquo;We promised that, if you put us in power, we would produce a health scheme based upon the principle of voluntary insurance just as we told you, before you elected us in 1954, that we would reduce prices and create employment. We are terribly sorry but we set up this board and lent them £25,000 and they now say they greatly regret they are not able to repay the amount&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will come along and he will have a great big basin in front of him.  There will be a little attendant with a towel and the Minister will wash his hands in public and, like Pilate, he will say: &ldquo;I am sorry, Gentlemen.  I set up this board.  I hand-picked this board as the Minister for Agriculture did in relation to the Greyhound Industry Committee.  We are terribly sorry.  They advised us this thing cannot be done and therefore we must ask you to release us from our promises.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The entire weight of his argument at that stage, something under an hour ago, was that the money was insufficient, that it was an insult to the people to ask Dáil Eireann to give only £25,000 for a Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme. A few minutes ago Deputy MacEntee appeared to be making the case that there is something that has to be watched for in this Bill because we might not get the £25,000 back.  I would like to ask Deputy MacEntee just what is his line on that.  What is the whole idea of discussing this Money Resolution in the manner in which it has been approached by him?  Deputy Bartley, Deputy Seán Flanagan, Deputy Dr. Hillery, Deputy Dr. Ryan, and others made worthwhile contributions to the discussion on the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill during the Second Reading.  I would just like to remind Deputy MacEntee.</P>
      <P>I am quoting from Volume 106 of the Dáil Debates, column 700, from Deputy Bartley, who said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We all agree with the Minister's opinion that some subvention is necessary in the early stages, and the Minister is taking steps to provide that it will be possible for him to give the board two sums, each of £25,000, if necessary.  I do not think anybody will quarrel very much with that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley apparently did not know anything about Deputy MacEntee.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think anybody will quarrel very much with that provided the board is one which knows its business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will get another opportunity of saying <Col N="1240" />&ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;, if he will just hold back the solemn thought for a few minutes. Deputy Bartley said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think anybody will quarrel very much with that provided the board is one which knows its business particularly in view of the high ideal which the scheme enshrines.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will Deputy MacEntee say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; again?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are not discussing this question from this side of the House on the ground of principle.  We feel anything that it is necessary to do for the health of the public should be done quickly by whatever means are most practicable.  I think that was the attitude we adopted in relation to other legislation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has already quoted from Deputy Seán Flanagan's speech and I again commend that quotation to Deputy MacEntee.  The leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, in relation to the discussion on this measure, was Deputy Dr. Ryan.  Deputy Dr. Ryan had this to say, and again I would ask Deputy MacEntee to pay some attention to it. At column 670 of the same volume from which I have already quoted, Deputy Dr. Ryan, having referred to reading the report of the Advisory Body said he thought it strange that, without giving much by way of reason, they had recommended a scheme, and he went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, in my dealings with the Irish Medical Association when I was Minister for Health and when they were pushing a voluntary health scheme at that time instead of the Health Bill, I offered to introduce the necessary legislation to enable them to carry on the health scheme side by side with the Health Bill when the Health Bill would go through the Oireachtas. That is why I am not opposing the Bill, but I have always had doubts as to whether it could be successful. I am only voicing my doubts now and warning the Minister not to go too far in the way of commitments and finances until we see whether this can be made successful or not.&rdquo;</P>

No member of his own Party has supported the attitude he has taken up.  I want to finish by again calling Deputy MacEntee's attention to the words of a member of his own Party when this Bill was being read for the second time.  They are the words of Deputy Dr. Hillery at column 166 of the Volume from which I quoted previously.  Concluding his Second Reading contribution to the discussion, Deputy Dr. Hillery said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We all wish this scheme well, but the Minister will have to take some steps to give it a continuous life.  This is a very interesting experiment.  It is a very essential step in our health services.  In its principles, it is very suited to the needs of our people who have to meet unexpected contingencies of sickness, accidents and ill-health. The Minister must do his best to make it a success and that success will depend on its continued financing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In view of the remarks I have quoted and in view of the manner in which this Bill was received on all sides of the Dáil and by the public outside, I again want to express astonishment at Deputy MacEntee's approach to it here to-day.</P>

The sentiments expressed by me in the quotation he gave here were a repetition of what had been said by other speakers on this side, and followed by other speakers on this side, that, in so far as the Minister was trying to induce people to provide against their own ill-health, his effort had the full backing and co-operation of the people on this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the State is prepared to chance a total sum of £50,000, is it beyond the bounds of possibility that organisations which had been engaged on this type of insurance for a very long time could produce a scheme for the Minister and that, by removing the necessity for a board such as he now proposes, the Minister could in fact remove all the elements of State socialism with which he has surrounded this piece of legislation? The Minister has talked a great deal about State socialism and State medicine and he has produced a measure which gives the impression <Col N="1244" /> that to the Minister it is more important to see that the State will have the controlling voice.</P>

I should like to remind Deputy Bartley and the House that Deputy Seán Flanagan has said that he welcomes this Bill, that he will do everything he can personally to help and that any effort he can make inside this House or outside it to extend the principle, he will always make it because he believes that we would be making a better country for ourselves by so doing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion and I think the whole point of the discussion has been mistaken by the Government.  We expressed agreement in principle with this Bill.  Deputy MacEntee, speaking in my presence this afternoon, said several times that he also was in agreement with the Bill in principle.  He also said&mdash;and I think it was quite relevant to the Money Resolution, just as I think the other discussion was irrelevant to it&mdash;that he thinks that we should not pay out £25,000 or any other sum of money until such time as a concrete scheme has been prepared which will carry the principle into effect, so that we will be able then to judge whether the principle enshrined in the Bill and the principle that we should like to see put into operation have in fact been carried out in the scheme as prepared.  I think that is the point that Deputy Bartley made also.  I know it is relevant to this particular motion. Deputy MacEntee feels that we should not pay out £25,000 or any other sum of money.  Whether I agree or disagree with that point of view, or whether Deputy Bartley agrees with it or not, I submit is entirely irrelevant but it is a relevant point of view and one that Deputy MacEntee was entitled to make.  It is not relevant to read the speeches made by myself and other people on Second Reading, in which we expressed our solid agreement with the principle of the Bill.  I am not even going to express a view as to whether I agree or disagree with Deputy MacEntee.</P>

      <P>But I can say this much, that he made the point that we do not have to buy a pig in a poke and that we are entitled to see the kind of scheme that is being put forward by the Government in pursuance of the principle enshrined in the Bill.  It is a perfectly valid point and I do not have to agree or disagree with it, but I do have to say it is an intelligent one and seeing that this afternoon the Taoiseach started pouting because 16 Bills had gone through and the Opposition had not taken an intelligent interest in them, I would remind the House that whatever else Deputy MacEntee's point is, it is intelligent. Are we going to be accused of holding up the House because we make this point or are we going to be accused of making the business of the House collapse because we do not take an interest?  Let the Government side have it one way or the other.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>It does seem to me that the matter about which Deputy Flanagan has been speaking is of some interest, that is, whether the money should be advanced until the nature of the scheme and the type of scheme has been considered.  I think it must be quite manifest to anybody who has been at this debate which began about 4 o'clock that it was some time around 4.30 before Deputy MacEntee got around to reading the Bill.  I assume he has not read the report of the Advisory Council or the Second Reading debate.  Anybody who was here during the Second Reading debate or anyone who read the Advisory Council's report which was referred to extensively in the Second Reading debate should have very little doubt about what is the nature of the scheme as regards premium and benefits. In fact many of the details of the scheme as contained in the Advisory Council's report were canvassed here at some length and some of the Deputies opposite as well as the Deputies on this side actually expressed views on various aspects of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> The House is not therefore being asked in any way to buy a pig in a poke.  The House is not being asked to vote money for a scheme the nature and type of which is in any way hidden.  It is hidden from anyone who did not have the time to spare to attend either the Second Reading or to consider this report.  Anyone who had the time to spare, and fortunately many members of the Opposition had, knows the position in regard to the scheme.  The House is not being asked to vote money for something in regard to which it has not a good knowledge as to its nature and extent.</P>

      <P>Let the Minister control himself.  Let him offer it up for his political sins.  I could not come into this House and oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  Neither, having regard to the facility with which the Minister can misrepresent that position, could I come in here and point out what were the obvious defects in this Bill.  However, we are entitled on the Money Resolution, when we are being asked to vote money, to refer to the purposes for which that money is being voted, and I mentioned one of the purposes was to set up a board with directors and officers of all sorts to make a scheme which, let me repeat, ought to be made by the Minister and his advisers who cost the country quite a substantial sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> We are asked to advance money to a board over whom this House will have no control to do the work that the Minister ought to do for himself and for which the Minister ought to take responsibility and ought to stand over. One of the things behind this Bill and one of the objects of the Bill is to enable the Minister to evade responsibility for the fact that ultimately no scheme of voluntary health insurance that will be acceptable to the general body of the people who are supposed to avail of it, will be forthcoming.  In that connection I referred to Section 4.  I could not have referred to Section 4 if I had not studied that Bill before I came into the House.  Similarly I referred to Section 5 and to sub-section (1) and I was subjected to the same sort of irresponsible interruptions to which I have been subjected over the last five or ten minutes when I have been speaking.  I pointed out that the board which was going to be set up was to consist of five persons.</P>
    <P>I was going on, if I had been permitted without interruption, to refer to Section 6, which proposes to give the Minister power to fix the terms and conditions of appointment and the remuneration of the members of the board, all to come out of the £25,000. Then I was going to turn to Section 15 which is a very important section of the Bill, a section to defray the cost of which some part of the £25,000 will no doubt be devoted.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board may, with the approval of the Minister, make a scheme ... for the provision of pensions or gratuities, or pensions and gratuities, for and in respect of such officers or servants of the board as it may think fit, and any scheme so made shall be carried out by the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister, therefore, sets up his board of directors, and they have appointed all their friends and relations as officers of the board, and the board of directors proceeds to make a scheme and their efforts are found to be abortive and there is no real, tangible scheme forthcoming, <Col N="1252" /> nevertheless the persons whom the board has appointed will be well provided for because the Minister may approve of pensions and gratuities in respect of these officers of the board.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not done his job.  He has not carried out the preparatory work which should precede the introduction of a measure of this kind.  What the Minister is really annoyed at is that, on this Money Resolution, he is now being shown up.  Instead of being able to come to this House and say: &ldquo;Here are the purposes, (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) for which we propose to advance the £25,000 and here is the reason why we have set up a board to draw up a voluntary health insurance scheme&rdquo;&mdash; the Minister is responsible for his Department, and I have no doubt, if the Minister gave a direction to his Department, that a voluntary health <Col N="1253" /> insurance scheme would be forthcoming&mdash;the Minister comes in here and says: &ldquo;Here is the reason why I have not discharged my function as Minister for Health, here is the reason why I am not fulfilling the pledge I held out to the people in 1954 that, if they elected me, I would introduce a voluntary health insurance scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill does not introduce any such scheme.  No part of this £25,000 that we are asked to lend to this board is being devoted to the purpose of this scheme. That £25,000, let me repeat again, is being used in order to finance a certain number of individuals&mdash;not members of the public service and not people who are under the control of this House.  Indeed, I doubt if, under this Bill, they will be under the control even of the Minister.  That £25,000 is being used to finance a certain number of people to set out and implement an insurance scheme.</P>
      <P>We are not opposing the idea of voluntary health insurance.  Nothing that I said in my opening remarks and nothing that I am saying now can be interpreted as opposition towards the principle of voluntary health insurance or a voluntary health insurance scheme. What I am opposed to and what I am now exposing is the trick which the Minister is trying to play upon the people who supported him in 1954. There is no, let me repeat again, voluntary health insurance scheme being introduced by this Bill.  All this Bill proposes to do is to set up a body to make such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were in earnest, if the Minister had considered this scheme, he would now come along and say to this House, in introducing this Bill: &ldquo;Here are the benefits we propose to confer and here are the premiums that will have to be paid.&rdquo; There is no use in the Minister trying to get out of the dilemma in which he finds himself by referring to anything which was published outside this House.  So far as the House is concerned, it has nothing before it.  If any private body of advisers which the Minister set up made certain suggestions to him, they are not in debate on this Bill because the Minister did not, in introducing this Bill, submit a <Col N="1254" /> White Paper to the House setting out what his expectations were.  The Minister has carefully avoided endorsing any recommendations or suggestions made to him by anybody.  But he proposes to try to confuse the issue by referring to a document which was published elsewhere.  We are not discussing that document here.  We are discussing this Money Resolution in relation to proposals which the Minister has put before us.  While the Minister, as a lawyer, may be adept at confusing issues, he will not get away with that here.</P>
    <P>If he was really in earnest about this&mdash;let us be quite clear about it&mdash; he would not have brought in this Bill in this way.  He would have come to certain conclusions first regarding any document which had been submitted to him by any body of advisers he had set up.  He would have had a certain sense of responsibility.  He would have been able to tell us he had considered such and such proposals.  He would have been able to tell us that, in his view, these proposals were practicable, these proposals would be acceptable to the people.  But the Minister has not chosen to do that.  The Minister has not circulated to the members of this House any document which received publication elsewhere.  No Deputy has received from the Minister&mdash;certainly I have not received it&mdash; any report.</P>

I put this to the Minister now: the Minister has not even chosen to stand upon the recommendations which were made to him.  I have read these recommendations elsewhere. There is nothing in this Bill and no Schedule to this Bill showing the benefits which will be conferred.  There is nothing showing the premiums which will have to be paid.  There is no provision which says that, if the premiums <Col N="1255" /> are not sufficient to meet the cost of the benefits under this scheme, the State will come in and defray the difference.  There is nothing in this Bill which says that.  The Minister admits that, so he is not standing on the proposals.  What is he standing on? Is this another case of sending the fool further?  Let me repeat we are not opposed to the principle of voluntary health insurance.  We welcome it and we would like to see it put into operation but certainly so far as I am concerned even though I have not opposed the Second Reading of the Bill, I am not going to be a party to the trick which the Minister in relation to this particular Bill is trying to play, the trick of trying to send the fool further.</P>

      <P>That is why I am criticising the attitude of the Minister in relation to the Bill and in particular on this Money Resolution.  He has not yet given the House the basis upon which this sum of £25,000 has been arrived at.  We do not know whether it will be sufficient; we do not know how much of it will be spent on the remuneration of the chairman and managing director and other members of the board.  We do not know how much will be spent on the remuneration of the officers of the board and we do not know how much will be devoted to providing the officers of the board with pensions and gratuities.  We do not know this because the Minister had not the courtesy when he was bringing in the Money Resolution to the House to disclose what his own mind was in relation to these matters. That is why we have had this prolonged debate this evening.  The Taoiseach twitted us with having let 16 measures through, but there was not any one of them that offered any matter for discussions.  Most of them were of the most trivial kind that ever occupied the time of the House, but this is, from the monetary point of view and the point of view of the public, an important measure but the Minister flung the Money Resolution <Col N="1256" /> to the House as if he was asking us to vote him 25 pence instead of £25,000.</P>

    <P>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to explain precisely what it is intended to do under this section?  As I read sub-section (1) of Section 4 it states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board shall make and carry out a scheme of voluntary health insurance for defraying, to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify, the cost to persons paying subscriptions to the board in respect thereof, and to dependents of such persons, of such medical, surgical, hospital and other health services as the Minister may from time to time specify.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there are three principles&mdash;I was going to say, submerged&mdash;in this sub-section.  There is, first, the obligation which is laid upon the board of making a scheme.  In relation to the making of a scheme it would seem to me that certain principles should be laid down.  I think that is particularly desirable in view of the power which is conferred on the Minister in this sub-section to limit the activities of the board, because the board can only make a scheme of voluntary health insurance to such extent &ldquo;as the Minister may from time to time specify.&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister will get up and say this: &ldquo;You are misconstruing it; that is not how the section is to be construed at all.  The section provides first of all that the board shall make the scheme and the board can make a scheme as wide or as limited as it likes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But not only must the board make a scheme but it must also carry out a scheme and it is in relation to carrying <Col N="1257" /> out the scheme that the Minister's power to limit the operations of the board is designed to operate.  I think that before the House proceeds to discuss this Section 4 of the Bill the Minister might have had the courtesy to tell us what was intended by Section 4 and what precisely sub-section (1) does provide for.</P>
    <P>I would say&mdash;and I concede this at once&mdash;that it provides for the making of a scheme.  But what type of scheme? A scheme to be limited by the Minister by certain directives which the Minister will issue?  It would appear to provide for the carrying out of a scheme.  Again, to what extent?  What is to be the ambit of the board's operations? Are they to be limited by the circumference of a circle which the Minister will draw for the operations of the board?  And what type of persons is the board to provide the scheme for?  I submit these are real matters which arise immediately and directly from the manner in which this sub-section has been drafted, but we have not yet had a single word from the Minister by way of explanation.  I suppose he does not know himself yet. He has not an idea in his mind as to what specifications he will make to the board.  I would like to hear from the Minister on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the general welcome which this Party gave to the Bill on the Second Reading, there were certain very important qualifications stated by each speaker and Deputy M. J. O'Higgins who purported to quote me here a short time ago certainly did not quote me in relation to Section 4 to which I referred on the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a choice of appearing to accept the piece of mechanism presented to us by the Minister because of our desire to accept the principle of voluntary effort on the part of the public to insure against ill-health.  We thought that the principle of voluntary effort was important enough to accept the Bill as presented to us for the time being in the hope that it might be improved and amended on this stage. The other view might as reasonably have been taken that the piece of mechanism was so defective in itself <Col N="1258" /> that the principle could not possibly have any chance of being implemented under it.  We did not take that risk and we gave a very general welcome with certain reservations and each Deputy specified his reservations.</P>
    <P>I remember remarking in relation to Section 4 that the Bill seemed to be all board and no insurance and that we expected that the Minister would do something to improve it so that it would have a little larger element of insurance and less of bureaucracy about it.  I asked specifically if the Minister would not eliminate certain things.  This section contains one of the things to which I expressed objection. Deputy MacEntee has just been speaking about it.  It is the provision that benefits are payable only to such extent as the Minister from time to time specifies.</P>
    <P>I think anybody paying a premium for insurance against certain risks would expect that the people who provided him with the insurance and quoted him a premium would pay the precise extent of the risks covered and the amount of compensation or other benefits which the premium bought.  It does seem to us that the Minister is to be allowed to decide the extent to which this board can interfere and to what extent they can provide benefits for the premiums they charge.  I think that action on the part of the Minister destroys the insurance character of the measure.  It would, in my mind, create one of the gravest doubts as to whether this Bill was capable of giving effect to the ideal of voluntary effort against ill-health.  We asked the Minister to consider it with a view to offering an acceptable amendment but that apparently has not been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain one or two of the points raised by Deputy Bartley.  I do not propose in any way to deal with the speech of the Deputy who preceded him.  The purpose of Section 4 is hard to explain.  Its object is not to limit the benefits being provided by the scheme but rather to define how far the Board must go.  I hope I make myself clear.  The best way of putting it is this: under the Bill, the Minister for Health must be satisfied that there is offered to the public a minimum <Col N="1259" /> cover relating to hospital and nursing home expenses, surgical and medical fees, other allied fees, X-ray for patients, physiotherapy and a variety of matters of that kind.  That would represent the very minimum that the Minister would approve as a cover being offered in the policy.  The extent referred to in sub-section (1) has in mind, or rather intends, that the Board will be told: &ldquo;You must at least provide cover along those lines; you must go the full way and half way will not do.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what is aimed at in sub-section (1).  Sub-section (2) gives power to the Board to provide other policies of insurance and to give additional cover above the minimum.  For instance they may provide a maternity scheme not included under the minimum scheme.  The Board, subject to the Minister's consent, might decide to provide maternity and some other benefits not included in the minimum scheme.  Thus, sub-section (2) is aimed at empowering the Board to provide alternative policies for different additional benefits.  Sub-section (3) is merely an amending sub-section.  I hope that covers Deputy Bartley's comments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to sub-section (4), which refers to the principle that the board should not control any more revenue than is necessary for the payment of grants and benefits, during the course of the Second Reading two points of view were expressed regarding the way the scheme should be operated.  One was expressed by Deputy Doctor Hillery who, being a practising doctor, would have a considerable amount of experience in these matters.  His view was that the State should subsidise, for a period of three, four or five years, the benefits that would be paid and also that the initial amount provided for the board should be given by way of grant rather than by way of loan.  Some of us had a different point of view, but I should like to know from the Minister whether he has considered giving a grant in accordance with Deputy Doctor Hillery's wishes or whether he prefers to stick to the principle of providing <Col N="1260" /> loans only.  Deputy MacEntee expressed the view that if we give a loan now it will turn itself into a grant because the board will not be able to repay us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is quite clear.  I think it would be fatal to the success of this idea of providing voluntary health insurance, and to the philosophy that is contained in the scheme, if it were not, straight from the beginning, put standing on its own feet.  I have no intention whatever of providing grants or subventions.  The board will have the statutory obligations contained in sub-section (4).  They must run their business in such a way that they will be able to meet their liabilities and must repay such necessary sums as are advanced in the preliminary stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (4) sets out the allowance proper for reserves, depreciation and other like purposes. The Minister seems not to have reserved to himself any right to watch over the activities of the board in that connection.  There is a suggestion that the principle of the Bill&mdash;that the board would make no profit&mdash;could be got around.  The board could make provisions for reserves and other like purposes and might be able in that way to put aside money which they would be able to use in blowing up salaries of their officials rather than in giving the benefits to the people paying premiums.  I would prefer if the Minister had some right to examine the balance sheets of the board from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned a number of things which may form the basis of a minimum service offered in return for a premium, but surely that is going to bring the Civil Service flush into the scheme.  After all, the Minister will have to be advised in taking the power to specify <Col N="1261" /> what the board must provide as a minimum service.  The Department advisers will quite often have to come in on the scheme now.  Not alone have we a board but we have a board that the Minister does not trust to give good value for the premiums paid. If the Minister thinks it is necessary to take powers in the Act to specify a minimum service, it is obvious that he must have some reservation in his mind about the ability of this board to implement a genuine voluntary health insurance scheme.  Why does he bring the Civil Service into it in this way by specifying that you must have a certain minimum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for that is that under the Bill, and even apart from the Bill, the Minister for Health has deep responsibility with regard to the health problems of the people generally.  Up to this that responsibility was discharged by providing merely for the services enshrined in the Health Act of 1953, leaving uncatered for such citizens as did not qualify for services under existing legislation.  In order to discharge the responsibility which I conceive to be mine as the present Minister for Health, the Health Insurance Board must have imposed upon it a statutory obligation.  It must be bound by the statute we are passing here to discharge a particular function.  Were I to write into the legislation here such benefits as at the moment I would regard as being minimum, then the statutory obligation of the board would be tempered merely by what the Act says.  In 12 or 18 months' time it might transpire the benefits which at the moment appear to be the desirable minima might be insufficient.  Circumstances might change and it might be found that the cover should be greatly increased.  Then it would be necessary to come back into the Dáil amending the present legislation by providing for increased benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the more workmanlike way of doing it is to provide that the board must from time to time have on offer a scheme providing such benefits as may be specified by ministerial <Col N="1262" /> regulations that will ensure that from time to time the cover is kept up and kept in accord with rising expenses and rising costs.  For instance, just to illustrate the matter.  Deputy Bartley will recall that the schedule of benefits in the report of the Advisory Body on the voluntary health insurance scheme, which was published last June, which will be a model in so far as the regulations are concerned, provides for cover up to £7 per week in hospital with a maximum period of ten weeks. They suggested that as one of the benefits in the circumstances now obtaining.  It might well be in two or three years' time that it might be felt that £7 per week was completely inadequate and if it were felt to be inadequate then the regulations themselves would alter the obligation on the board to provide more than that particular cover.  In the way it is framed I feel it does allow the necessary flexibility in what, after all, is a new and experimental scheme about which one cannot have a very clear or definite view now. I think it is necessary, certainly in the initial years, that every possible scope should be given for manoeuvre and for changes in the benefits being offered and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer my question.  We have been attracted by the Minister's proposal to initiate a scheme whereby the public would be induced to provide against their own ill-health.  In previous legislation we were pilloried because of our imposing standards and practices on the public and on the medical profession which were not in vogue heretofore.  We thought a complete break was to be made from that philosophy by the Minister who was very vocal about it when we offered our co-operation here. I am asking him, if he is setting up a board and if this House is agreeable to pay a certain sum of money, why does he not trust that board to draw up a scheme and let that scheme operate as nearly as possible to commercial lines? Why must the Minister inject the Civil Service into it after the board is set up?</P>

When it was put by the Chair in the usual way the Minister did not get up to explain to the House what was provided, what would be the effect of provisions of Section 4 and in particular what would be the effect of sub-section (1) of Section 4.

      <P>Whether deliberately or inadvertently, the Minister has let some part of the cat out of the bag.  He referred to certain proposals which were published elsewhere&mdash;certain proposals of which the House so far has no official knowledge, suggestions which were made elsewhere and which would be taken as models for the regulations under which the Minister will presumably act.  I would like to know what is in the Minister's mind in regard to this.  We are entitled to know that before we proceed from Section 4.  I will sit down until I hear the Minister dealing with the points I raised in opening the debate on this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was discussing it on its merits.  I put three pertinent questions to the Minister and have not had an answer from him.  The section is somewhat peculiarly worded.  I am not a parliamentary draftsman but it seems to me ambiguous.  Sub-section (1)  of Section 4 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The board shall make and carry out a scheme of voluntary health insurance for defraying, to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify, the cost to persons paying subscriptions to the board in respect thereof, and to dependents of such persons, of such medical, surgical, hospital and other <Col N="1266" /> health services as the Minister may from time to time specify.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are three possible interpretations of that sentence.  One is that the board shall make a scheme to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify.  I asked the Minister, when he had failed to explain to the House what, in his view, the section meant, to say to me whether the board could only make a scheme to such extent as the Minister may specify. That is one interpretation of it. Another interpretation was that the board might make a scheme and then proceed to carry it out but only carry it out to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify.  The third possible interpretation is that the board should make and at the same time carry out a scheme, both operations to be done to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify.</P>

It is not easy, as I explained to the House earlier, to explain what is aimed at.  If I may put it this way&mdash; sub-section (1) is the sub-section under which the Minister for Health must assess what he believes to be the minimum requirements of those availing of health insurance.  For example, the regulations may provide that the Schedule of Benefits set out on page 13 of the Advisory Body's Report which was circulated to Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not a bit afraid of Deputy MacEntee.  I can assure him of that.  The purpose of sub-section (1) is to provide a minimum cover in accordance with regulations and the phrase &ldquo;to such extent&rdquo; represents the minimum cover.  In other words, the board must provide the extent of benefits set out in the regulations. They may not provide anything smaller than that.  They must go the whole distance along the road set out in the regulations.  In the Advisory Body's Report, under Schedule of Benefits, which is set out on page 13, the Deputy will see the type of cover envisaged.  It includes medical, surgical, hospital and other health services, expenses that might be incurred by a person as an inpatient in hospital and other allied expenses, but the full cover to the minimum laid down in the regulations must be provided by the board.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2)&mdash;and I think Deputy MacEntee had this also in mind&mdash;is the sub-section which empowers the board to provide additional benefits. Under sub-section (2) the board is entitled to say, &ldquo;We will provide a choice of policy&rdquo;&mdash;of course, at a higher premium and providing in the additional policies benefits more than is required by the regulations.  That is the purpose of sub-section (2) but, in order to ensure that the board's additional policies will not run the board into financial difficulties, there is still the requirement of ministerial consent, and that is the purpose of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put his finger on my difficulty in relation to this section when he said that it is not easy to explain what is aimed at. If it is not easy for the Minister to explain what is aimed at, how are dunderheads on this side of the House, like myself, to apprehend what the Minister is aiming at?  I must say that I have not got very much further, I have not gained very much light, from what the Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his remarks said &ldquo;The Minister must assess.&rdquo;&ldquo;Assess&rdquo; is a word which is applied to the evaluation of things, <Col N="1268" /> for instance, the amount of tax due, the value of an article, but I cannot see how the Minister can assess the benefits which must be provided except to the extent of saying that the Minister shall say that the benefits shall not, either <i>in toto</i> or separately, exceed a certain amount.  If by &ldquo;assess&rdquo; the Minister means that the Minister shall conceive the type of benefit, then we are at one. I can see the Minister has a function there.  I suppose he would have a function, too, under the other head, but it rather seems to me like putting the cart before the horse if the Minister were to assess a thing before forming any idea as to the nature of the benefits which the board should provide.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Minister went on to say that these things were to be assessed, I think, by regulation.  I have been looking through the Bill and, while I may be wrong, it seems to me that there is no power in the Bill, so far as I can read it, which empowers the Minister to make regulations.  It may be in fact that for the purposes of this Bill such power is not necessary but in my experience I should be surprised if the Minister would not require to be empowered by regulation to specify the matters to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is so advised I am not going to say that he has been wrongly advised, but it is certainly to me rather unexpected, because hitherto in relation to the drafting of most Bills where the Minister is empowered to call upon a body to do certain things, as a rule, the Minister does, by regulation, oblige the body concerned to do these certain things.  There is a provision embodied in the statute, as a rule, empowering a Minister to make regulations to that end.  I concede that there is nothing like this measure on the Statute Book, but if the general body of Oireachtas enactments are looked at it will be seen that usually there is a section in them empowering the Minister to make regulations requiring certain people <Col N="1269" /> or corporate bodies to do certain things.  I do not see such a regulation in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter I should like to raise on this section.  Sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board shall make and carry out a scheme of voluntary health insurance for defraying, to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify, the cost to persons paying subscriptions to the board in respect thereof, and to dependents of such persons, of such medical, surgical, hospital and other health services as the Minister may from time to time specify.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a matter upon which I should like some guidance.  First of all, I should like to know how the proportion to be defrayed is to be determined, whether the Minister has any views in his own mind as to how the proportion is to be determined and then again how the proportion is to be expressed, whether the defrayment will be <i>pro rata</i> to the amount of the contributions or to the cost of the service or whether the defrayment will be by the contribution of a specific sum.  These are matters upon which the House is entitled to have some information.</P>
      <P>As regards sub-section (4) there is a rather peculiar clause in this sub-section which has already been referred to by Deputy Bartley and Deputy Flanagan.  Sub-section (4) provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board shall so fix the subscriptions provided for by schemes under this section that taking one year with another the revenue of the board from subscriptions together with its other revenues (if any) shall be sufficient, but only sufficient (as nearly as may be), after the board has made such allowance as it thinks proper for reserves, depreciation and other like purposes, to meet the charges (including repayments of loans to the Minister) properly chargeable to revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered <Col N="1270" /> what that will involve.  After all sickness is not a thing that we experience or that visits the community in a sort of regular flow.  Some years the community will enjoy comparatively good health.  Therefore the contributions in respect of the good year, when the claims on the scheme will be proportionately lower, should be correspondingly less, but then, if we have an epidemic, as we had within the last year, or as we may perhaps have in future, and we have a bad year, will the contributions in respect of that bad year be considerably increased?  It would seem to me that very little consideration has been given to the financial implications of sub-section (4) and as to the effect it will have upon the success or otherwise of the scheme.</P>
    <P>What year will be taken with another?  It is a very unsound basis to go on.  I know that this section has been copied almost word for word&mdash; the Coalition are great imitators&mdash;out of the E.S.B. Act.  That is the sort of thing which appears there and even in this House in our own time in relation to public electricity supply where the consumer is probably caught once and for all, if rates and charges are sent up he must grin and bear it.  However, people will be able to adhere to and to secede from this scheme from year to year.  The contract is a yearly one. How does the Minister think the scheme will work on the basis of sub-section (4) of Section 4?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer here to a matter which will subsequently arise on an amendment standing in my name, namely, the power of suspension.  In Section 3 it is laid down fairly clearly as to who the suspending authority is in relation to a member of the Civil Service.  In sub-section (2) the appropriate authority can designate or indicate who shall be his suspending authority and do that by reference to a particular person or a particular class of civil servant.</P>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would indicate now in some greater detail exactly how and to what extent this power to suspend is delegated in the Civil Service.  As the section stands, it would appear that that power is very definitely delegated and confined either to senior members indicated by name or members of a particular group.  My information is that the practice is much looser than what is envisaged in this section and it is because of that that I have found it necessary to put down an amendment in relation to a later section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, possibly because the <Col N="1273" /> practice has grown up over a number of years, that in actual fact the power to suspend can and is exercised by a fairly large group of officers and that it largely depends on who is the senior member in a particular office or section as to whether or not the power to suspend is, in fact, exercised by a person of reasonable seniority or by one who is, shall I say, still on the lower rungs of the Civil Service ladder.  I understand that it is possible for such a relatively junior officer as a minor staff officer to exercise this power under certain circumstances. Possibly my information may not be complete in that regard, but so I have been informed.</P>
    <P>What I want to elicit from the Minister is what official has the power and I also want the ladder of delegation of authority in so far as this section is concerned.  For example, the power is delegated by the appropriate authority &mdash;in this case by the Minister&mdash;to the Secretary of the Department.  I take it for granted that, because the Secretary must of necessity be occupied with other duties or be absent from time to time, there will be other officers below who will also have the power to suspend. This power to suspend is, therefore, conferred in a descending line by the Minister down to a particular point or does it automatically follow that, as each senior officer is absent or not available, the power to suspend falls upon the officer immediately junior to him?  I understand that is the practice.</P>
    <P>I mention this because the power to suspend is a very important power.  It is being embodied in an Act of the Oireachtas here.  The intention quite clearly is to limit it.  It is recognised as an important power to confer on any particular officer.  It is also important from the point of view of members of the Civil Service because suspension can carry with it many serious consequential after-affects.  Not only that, but it can be a source of irritation.  It can, if improperly used, if you like, be a means of waging a personal vendetta and a manner of expressing personal dislikes and animosities which would not normally enter into this aspect of the matter.  As far as the <Col N="1274" /> whole Bill is concerned, the power to suspend has a number of aspects, and the one that immediately occurs is the case of an officer of the State, whatever may be his rank, who commits an offence or is guilty of dereliction of duty in respect of which his continued presence in the position he occupies is prejudicial either to the interests of the State or to the welfare of the public.  Quite clearly, his removal and suspension from that post is desirable as ordinary safeguarding action.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the aspect that having been suspended, and the matter having been investigated, suspension may involve punitive decisions so far as payment of salary is concerned, possibly even demotion or dismissal. Equally, I notice in a later section, that the person who exercises the power of suspension can restore the person suspended to his post but it lies with the Minister to decide whether or not his salary will be paid. But so far as that power of suspension can be exercised by persons who have not got a sense of responsibility, and more important still, an atmosphere of relative remoteness, of being away from the individual who may be involved, it may well happen that the power of suspension can be abused and can, in fact, be utilised as a medium for relatively minor punitive actions which take place from time to time and would not call for any great investigation.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one case where that actually happened, and a number of female employees of the State were each in turn suspended for one day because of their refusal to carry out certain duties.  I also understand it may well happen that because of the position they would be in, the senior person in a particular office of the Department may not have relatively high rank, and that by the process of delegation of authority&mdash;the practice of delegation if you like&mdash;the power to suspend can be exercised relatively low down in the chain of command.</P>
    <P>It is from the consideration of these matters that the section, as I say, is not clear because while it does indicate that the Minister will delegate, <Col N="1275" /> or give this power of suspension to a person who, as far as the section is concerned, is envisaged as being a responsible senior, it may well happen&mdash; and this is what I should like to have some light thrown on&mdash;and I believe it actually happens in practice in the Civil Service, that the power to suspend is in practice delegated not by written permission, not by direct authority, but merely by the fact of absence of a more senior officer. Finally, at what point does that power to suspend become no longer effective? Where can we be satisfied, from the point of view of the exercise of this power, there is a reasonable degree of experience, a reasonable status of seniority and above all, there is a sense of responsibility that can only be gained, in my experience, by the exercise of authority over a period?</P>
    <P>If the Minister could enlighten me on this now it would probably be helpful later on when we come to deal with specific amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Larkin must be considered, I would suggest, in two separate contexts. In the first place, we have the civil servant working in the headquarters of his Department.  Where the headquarters of the Department and all the workers are in the one building the problem is far simpler than in the case of Departments which have branches right through the State. In regard to headquarters operations, it is the universal practice that the head of the Department himself, the Secretary of the Department, would be consulted unless there was the most serious reason why he should not be available.  If he were not available, it would be his deputy who would be consulted on a particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it is not a question of employment at headquarters but employment throughout the country a different problem arises.  Perhaps one of the best examples I can give the Deputy is that of a postmaster.  Clearly, a postmaster must be in charge of his post office and of the staff operating it. Clearly, he must be in control of that office and of the staff to such a degree that the public interest is safeguarded. <Col N="1276" /> Similarly, there might be an officer working out the country in connection with a gang, shall we say.  It would be essential that there would be discipline in that gang, but I want to put this point clearly in relation to those two cases: first, that the power of suspension would be and should be, obviously, most sparingly used, and secondly&mdash;and this I think is the important point&mdash;in relation to the penalty to which the Deputy referred, the withdrawal of pay, in no case, no matter who is the suspending authority, can the pay be withheld until the decision of the appropriate authority, that is to say, speaking very broadly, the Minister in charge of a particular Department, is given.</P>
    <P>The penalty which would arise from suspension, the power of withholding salary is most jealously restricted and even though it may be necessary for an officer to suspend, nevertheless, such an officer has not got the power himself in any way to decide whether or not the pay should be withheld for the period during which the employee concerned was not, in the suspending officer's judgment, able to carry out his normal duties.  We are all agreed, I am sure, that the desirable thing to ensure is that the most senior officer available on the spot would be the person who would be consulted and take the decision in relation to what I might term headquarters employees. That would always be the head of a Department unless there was some unusual reason why he was not available, and then it would devolve only on whoever was acting on his behalf in his absence.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister recognises that power to suspend is a power that should not be exercised only after full deliberation and careful forethought.  I hope he will bear that in mind later, but I am still in the dark as to how the power to suspend is delegated down the chain of command.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refers to headquarters, where possibly the Secretary of the Department has that power, but there are occasions where the junior ranks of the Civil Service have to work where there will not be any senior officer present.  On many occasions it has happened that junior officers have <Col N="1277" /> to work without any senior officer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>No; headquarters. It is not unknown in circumstances like that for threats of suspension to be made fairly freely.  I am not querying at this point the power of suspension. If, for example, in a headquarters the secretary is not available to whom, then, is the power of suspension delegated&mdash;to whom below the rank of secretary or assistant secretary will it extend?  Where does it stop?</P>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that outside of headquarters there is a special problem and he mentioned the position of a postmaster.  I do not think anybody would query the suggestion that the power of suspension should not go beyond the postmaster, but in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the power to suspend can go much below that of the postmaster's job.  Again, on what authoritative basis does that happen?  In outside employment it is very rarely anybody except the manager or the employer himself would exercise such a power.  It certainly would be exercised generally in somewhat different circumstances to what is envisaged in the Bill and to what&mdash;which is more important still&mdash;is the present practice in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the Minister has laid such stress on the care that should be exercised with such a power of suspension, it is important that if this power is to be given to officers in the service it should first of all be clear as to how they get that power which the Minister is vesting in them and, secondly, there should be clarity as to the point at which it is no longer desirable this power of suspension should be vested.  The Minister merely went as far as indicating the position of a postmaster.  Like many other things, the practice has grown up whereby this power of suspension, if not always used, is flagrantly threatened by officers in much more junior positions than we have discussed here.  That is not desirable.  The position <Col N="1278" /> should be made clear that the authority flows from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>One of the things we are doing now is providing, in sub-section (2), that there must be specific nomination.  I think it is fair enough to say that up to this the position has been fluid.  This will make it more determinate.  There must be a specific nomination by the appropriate authority.  In a headquarters office I cannot visualise a situation arising in which there would be any reason to nominate, if everybody was together, anybody other than the establishment officer.  On the other hand, a large Department might have, say, one office in Kildare street and another in Stephen's Green but in the general run it would be the establishment officer who would consult the head of the Department.  I think it is fair for Deputy James Larkin to say that the position has been somewhat fluid up to this and I think the specific requirement in sub-section (2) that the appropriate authority, the Minister, will now have to make a formal nomination, will get over the fluidity that has been there up to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we could discuss the three together.  The purpose of the three amendments is to try and clarify the position in regard to the suspension of an officer.  We have already dealt with the question of the suspending authority.  From what the Minister has said it appears to me there now will be a considerable improvement in the practice that has prevailed, but even though the Minister is now going to take steps to ensure that there will be direct nomination of the official having the power to suspend, I think, because of the phrase used by the Minister about the importance of this power to suspend and the desirability of exercising it properly, that may not hold good.  As Section 3 now stands it appears that the power to suspend is envisaged, from the point of view of the Minister, as having two aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is that it is a very important step to take to suspend an officer because, even if the suspension is subsequently lifted, it cannot be pointed to as being a good conduct mark on the officer's career to have it recorded that at any time it was found necessary to <Col N="1280" /> suspend him even though, in subsequent investigations, any imputed misconduct was cleared up.  It is suggested now that we might limit this suspension in respect of confinement to matters of grave misconduct, not merely misconduct &mdash; serious irregularity rather than the bare word &ldquo;irregularity&rdquo;.  The conception of what misconduct means can vary from officer to officer exercising the authority to suspend, and if at any point an officer wishes to append his own conception of the degree of seriousness in respect of some act then automatically he is entitled to exercise this power of suspension if it has been delegated to him.</P>
    <P>As the section stands at the moment the only limiting qualification I can find is that the misconduct or irregularity shall warrant disciplinary action. My understanding of the suspension of any employee is that, not merely have they appeared to commit some offence or failed to carry out a duty, but that their continuation in their position in itself is prejudicial to the interests of the employment in which they are engaged or that it will have certain other serious consequential effects.  Therefore, the question of suspension arises more from the desirability of immediately removing them from the exercise of their office or duties than from the point of view of imposing discipline.</P>
    <P>If a person in the service is guilty of misconduct or irregularity the matter is duly noted by the senior officer, and it is to be taken for granted that there will be some form of inquiry after which, if it is found proved, some form of punitive decision will arise.  So far as paragraph (a) is concerned that does not arise because in the case of the suspending authority the only question he requires to answer before he exercises power is, firstly, whether there has been misconduct, secondly, whether there has been irregularity, and, thirdly, whether either of these particular faults are of such a character as to warrant disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that, having regard to the general concept of what is <Col N="1281" /> implied by the power to suspend, it would be desirable that that power to suspend, even when exercised by a duly authorised officer, should be confined, first of all, by the insertion of the word &ldquo;grave&rdquo;&mdash;only for grave misconduct or serious irregularity&mdash; but more important still that the overriding qualification should be that which I have set down in the third amendment, namely, that no interest of the Civil Service might be prejudiced by allowing the officer to remain on duty.  I respectfully suggest that that is the main and most important argument in the exercise of the power of suspension.  It is quite possible that an officer may be guilty of grave misconduct or serious irregularity and yet, because of the nature of that particular offence or because of where the officer was carrying out his duty, no question of prejudicing the interests of the Civil Service and the public would arise, and that the matter could be fully dealt with after investigation or inquiry by normal punitive measures, even those most serious in character.</P>
    <P>The important aspect I would stress is that, in granting the power of suspension, the overriding factor should be the present interests of the Civil Service and the public, and that unless it is quite clearly prejudiced by the conduct of the officer on duty, as far as the power of suspension is concerned, that power should not be exercised.  Secondly, it should be limited to the more grave and serious irregularities.  I agree, in the light of what the Minister says now, that some of the&mdash;I will not say abuses&mdash;peculiarities that have occurred in the past will not be repeated.  In so far as we are giving this power, I think it is desirable that we should have a full understanding of what that means. For that reason I have put down amendments to try and clearly establish that.  As the Minister says, it is a serious and grave matter to exercise this power.  I suggest that the main and overriding qualification is that the suspension of the officer is necessitated by the best interests of the service and not merely by the character or the aspect of the action of misconduct or irregularity he is alleged to have committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I would agree with Deputy Larkin that it would be a most regrettable thing if any officer with suspending authority should act arbitrarily or without due consideration. One would like to accept any possible safeguard against that but my difficulty in relation to Deputy Larkin's amendment is this.  I do not see how any suspending authority could possibly act if the misconduct or irregularity were to be qualified in the manner which Deputy Larkin suggests. It would mean that every suspending authority before he acted would feel that he must be in a position to show that conduct was grave misconduct, not merely to his own satisfaction but to the satisfaction of other people and similarly, that the irregularity must be a serious irregularity, not merely in his own judgment but to the full satisfaction of somebody else to whom the civil servant might appeal.</P>
      <P>If these qualifying adjectives were to be put in the Bill the appeal might lie to some tribunal other than that of the Minister despite the terms of Section 5 of the Bill.  The civil servant whose conduct would call for suspension or who had been suspended might be able to go to the courts and say: &ldquo;After all, the will and pleasure of the Government was limited by the fact that it could not suspend unless I was guilty of grave misconduct&rdquo; and the whole matter would have to be thrashed out in the courts.  I could not see how the public service could operate on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of it.  If a person is to be nominated as the suspending authority under Section 3, he must first of all be a senior officer in the service and must be a person who has shown beyond any manner of doubt that he is a person who will act objectively and with full consideration. It seems to me that if the Deputy's amendments were to be accepted we should in fact stultify the suspending authority in the discharge of his proper duty which is to ensure that any person who in his view has been guilty of misconduct warranting disciplinary action will be suspended or has been charged with misconduct or irregularity which warrants investigation. <Col N="1283" /> I could see that we would get into a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Suppose a person were suspected of having embezzled public moneys or were guilty of some financial irregularity in the handling of public moneys. Suppose it was a case of suspicion, but suspicion grave enough to make it prudent that the person who was under suspicion should be suspended so as to prevent his continuing to commit these irregularities, if in fact he had already done so.  It seems to me that with Deputy Larkin's amendment it would not be possible to deal with that question for the reason I have said, that it might open a way to an appeal from the Minister and the Government to the courts.  I cannot conceive public service in this State being carried on effectively and efficiently unless the authority of the Government in relation to the officers in the public service is supreme, and not limited in any way except for the fact that the Government is answerable to Dáil Éireann in the ultimate resort for any injustice that it or its officers might be guilty of in regard to any citizen, whether he is a public servant or not.</P>
    <P>For that reason, therefore, although I am sure that I should be in full concord with the Minister in being anxious to see that nothing was done arbitrarily and that nothing was done unjustly, it appears to me that the best safeguard against injustice or arbitrary treatment is the fact that, as the Minister has now provided for in the Bill, the suspending authority must be a responsible officer, duly nominated, who will be, no doubt, answerable to his superiors and ultimately to his Minister if he would suspend a civil servant who was not guilty of conduct warranting such a suspension.</P>

      <P>I thought I understood this.  I have heard the arguments and am now becoming rather vague.  I should have thought&mdash;and I should like the Minister to tell me if it is true&mdash; that the distinction in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 13 was that in (a) the misconduct or irregularity is governed by the phrase <Col N="1284" />&ldquo;warranting disciplinary action&rdquo; to begin with, and also that this is to cover cases where the suspending authority is himself aware of the misconduct or irregularity, whereas in paragraph (b) it is a question of a charge made to the suspending authority by someone else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I do not see that the addition of the word &ldquo;grave&rdquo; to &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; in paragraph (a) has any real effect at all because it is already governed by &ldquo;warranting disciplinary action,&rdquo; which surely in itself means &ldquo;grave&rdquo;.  There seems to me to be confusion as to the purpose of the two paragraphs.  It seems to me reasonably clear that one is internal and within the knowledge of the suspending authority and that the other is something reported and it is a matter of suspending while that charge is being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin in amendment No. 3 specifiees &ldquo;the interest of the Civil Service&rdquo;.  When he was speaking he used sometimes that phrase and sometimes the phrase &ldquo;the interest of the public&rdquo;.  We must consider this entirely from the public interest. The civil servants are there to serve the public interest and I would suggest, and I think Deputy Larkin will agree with me, that any consideration that we must give to this section is the public interest.  I do not think the Deputy meant any difference between the two phrases.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I am not quite clear why the Deputy put, in amendment No. 1, &ldquo;grave&rdquo; and, in amendment No. 2, &ldquo;serious&rdquo;, whether he intended there to be any difference between &ldquo;grave&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.  I personally think that the case might be argued just as well on the same word in both amendments. I propose to take it on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) deals with a case where the suspending authority is there and then in possession of the facts.  Paragraph (b) deals with the case where a charge has been made by some outside person and the suspending authority deems it <Col N="1285" /> necessary to investigate that charge before deciding whether the complaint is sufficiently justified to warrant suspension or not.</P>
    <P>Let me come back, however, to the first two amendments put forward by Deputy Larkin.  I come back again to the example I gave already, the postmaster. We all must accept that Christmas is a time of some convivial gatherings.  Supposing a man comes into a post office suffering to such an extent from the Christmas spirit that he is unable to carry out his duties, clearly he should not be kept there working while he is in that condition. If I accepted Deputy Larkin's amendments, I would be classifying that demeanour on, perhaps, Christmas Eve, however reprehensible it may be, as being grave misconduct or grave irregularity and, while all of us would wish that such should not happen, we must at the same time be human and remember that it can occasionally happen and it would mean, in effect, if we dealt with the matter as is suggested in the amendments by Deputy Larkin, that action of a very grave nature might have to be taken because of something that was not quite so grave as all that but which undoubtedly was such that the public interest would require that the officer concerned should not carry out his duties at that moment.  I do not know whether Deputy Larkin intended that his amendments should lead to that result or not but, in their phraseology and in the manner in which they are down, the situation would be such that I would then have to regard that man's action on Christmas Eve as having been grave misconduct.</P>
    <P>I must, of course, reject the suggestion that the decision on whether the conduct was such as required in the public interest that the person concerned should not remain on duty could go for interpretation in the courts. That would lead to a plethora of legislation that would be entirely undesirable and would completely stultify any proper administration.  Quite candidly, I do not think that Deputy Larkin meant that by his amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;although in fact it would arrive at that.  I am prepared to meet Deputy Larkin to this extent, if the House thinks that it would meet the case: I am quite prepared to agree that there should be a paragraph (a) of Section 13, sub-section (1); that it should cover grave misconduct or grave irregularity provided that I then have another new paragraph (b) which would give the suspending authority power to suspend if, in the opinion of the suspending authority, the public interest would be prejudiced by allowing the civil servant to remain on duty. I think it would be absolutely essential to have that provision if you had the other amendments.</P>
      <P>It would mean that the governing factor would be that the suspending authority, being a person in a responsible position, a person with experience, a person who should not act unreasonably would realise that, if he did act unreasonably, he would get into serious trouble with his Minister&mdash;and it must go to his Minister&mdash;if he acted on the power of suspension without due regard to its seriousness.  But you must provide that the case where a person could not be, in the public interest, kept on duty, must be judged by the person in charge, in the public interest, at that time and that his judgment must not be in any way fettered by the feeling that he might be brought to task in court for the exercise of his <i>bona fide</i> judgment.</P>
      <P>As long as the suspending officer has that power in his own judgment to decide in the public interest that it is undesirable for that officer to remain on duty&mdash;and I accept wholeheartedly that it must be the public interest that is the governing factor&mdash;bearing in mind that the suspending officer is a responsible officer, I would be prepared to accept either of the two words&mdash;I do not mind&mdash;but I think it should be the same word that is used in both cases.</P>

It seems to me we may be opening the door to a great deal of controversy if it does not go further.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the discussion on Section 3 and what the Minister said then, and in the light of the discussion on my amendment, I see no difficulty in accepting the viewpoint of the Minister.  First of all, it has to be borne in mind that amendments come seriatim and that you try to cover a position from a number of aspects.  The important amendment I think is neither No. 1 nor No. 2 but No. 3, in so far as the suspension is concerned.  I agree entirely that where the officer is in a bad condition or, if not under the influence of drink, in a bad temper, it is better in the public interest and in his own interest that he goes home.  In the ordinary private employment he is usually told to go home.  I wonder whether it might meet the position&mdash;it certainly would meet my view&mdash;if instead of putting in the words &ldquo;grave&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious&rdquo; we put in what the Minister suggests, namely, that if the suspending officer is satisfied that it was in the public interest the officer should be suspended.  That is what I want to get at because I do not regard suspension as a disciplinary measure.  The disciplinary measure comes after the suspension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do agree that in certain cases an individual officer may be relieved from duty either in his own interest or in the interests of the public.  The overriding factor is the public interest.  I <Col N="1288" /> am quite prepared to accept that the suspending officer will form that judgment himself and naturally he will take the full responsibility for it and if he in his wisdom and judgment decides that it is necessary to exercise the power of suspenion in the public interest I personally will be quite satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>I also was somewhat intrigued as to the difference between paragraphs (a) and (b) and I am not entirely satisfied that, just because we are dealing with two different aspects of the same problem, two different approaches are being laid down here.  The first question is where the suspending officer of his own knowledge has sufficient evidence to permit him to exercise and make his decision.  The second is where the charge is made to the suspending officer and the matter has to be investigated because he has not got personal knowledge.</P>
    <P>In the case of paragraph (b), while it refers to grave misconduct and grave irregularity, it still is tied up with the question of investigation. There can be quite clearly fairly grave irregularities which, although they would warrant investigation, might not require suspension, and from that point of view there is a strong case for trying to pursue the line we have been discussing, that where we are merely speaking of misconduct, irrespective of the degree of the irregularity, there would be the limiting proviso that the suspending authority should be satisfied himself that the suspension of the officer is required in the public interest.  That clearly draws the distinction between the two situations that might develop and it does clearly designate that what is involved here is not a disciplinary measure which in fact is being initiated by a single officer maybe in the heat of the moment or in some hasty judgment but rather safeguarding the overall interest of the public and the efficiency of the service.  Subsequently it will be possible to determine what is the degree of misconduct or irregularity and the punishment to be involved.  If that matter could be dealt with by the Minister I would certainly be quite willing to withdraw the amendment and leave it in his hands.</P>

      <P>I considered this matter before to-day and I would like the Deputy to be quite clear as to what I am prepared to do.  It would involve that I would add between clauses (a) and (b) a new clause (b). It would be another alternative, so to speak, if it appears to the suspending officer that the public interest might be prejudiced by allowing the civil servant on duty.  I am not quite clear from what Deputy Larkin has said whether, when he got that additional clause, he would be anxious that the word &ldquo;grave&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; would be added in paragraph (a).</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's suggestion is to put in a third clause directly relating the power of suspension to the question as to whether the best interests of the public would be prejudiced by allowing the person to remain on duty.  I would prefer to see that directly related to clause (a) because clause (a) as it stands has no limitation whatever except the word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;irregularity&rdquo; are there.  It may be minor or grave.  I agree that we must largely take it for granted that under the new arrangements following the enactment of this Bill the suspending authority will be a responsible officer, a matter about which I have had grave doubt in the past.  However, even a very responsible officer can be involved in personal relationships which prejudice his own judgment.  He may be guilty of hasty decisions and he may also be guilty of unfair decisions.  For instance, most of the time of this House is taken up questioning the degree of responsibility of Ministers, not to mind the ordinary senior officers of the Civil Service, and we have listened to a good deal of that in the last few hours. Deputy McQuillan has said in regard to the postmaster that maybe it is the postmaster who will be a little out of control at Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have got to bear in mind here is that we are not dealing with official positions only.  We are dealing with personal relations in an official service.  I submit it is not sufficient to give this power of suspension even to a senior and responsible officer, allowing <Col N="1290" /> him to exercise it purely on the basis that it can be done in relation to an act of misconduct, without any qualification as to the degree of seriousness or of irregularity.  We have to some extent accepted the view that the public interest is the overriding factor. I feel I would not be pressing the Minister unduly if I suggested that, instead of putting it in the third paragraph, the qualification referring to the public interest might be put in as an amendment to paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>The Minister is thinking largely along the lines I hoped he would when I put down the amendments.  It may at the moment be a bit difficult to think in terms of a definite draft amendment. If the Minister is willing to deal with this along the lines we have discussed here I will be quite prepared to leave the matter in his hands and wait to see what he will bring in on the Report Stage.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (5), page 12, line 29, before &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a recognised staff organisation acting on his behalf and of which he is a member&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the civil servant concerned shall be afforded the opportunity of making representations to the appropriate authority through the recognised staff organisation of which he is a member and which he desires to act on his behalf.  I appreciate I am possibly trying to break fairly new ground here. I understand that the Minister's viewpoint is that it is not permissible or acceptable to have recognised Civil Service organisations heard or permit them to make representations in matters of a purely disciplinary character.  Quite clearly we are dealing with discipline here.</P>
    <P>My purpose is to ensure that the officer who may be in jeopardy shall have the opportunity of securing the advice of the organisation of which he is a member and, more important still, be afforded the opportunity of having that organisation make representations on his behalf.  I regard that as one of the most important and valuable aspects of the right of organisations or associations, apart from collective representation and collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by the Government that civil servants are entitled to have staff organisations which are afforded the right of representation.  Those organisations engage in negotiation and discussion in relation to conditions of employment.  It is only when the individual finds that he requires a specialised service that difficulty arises.  So far as civil servants are concerned, while they are members of what are regarded in practice as trade unions, because they are employees of the State, not only are they not entitled to exercise the right to strike but, as a practical measure, it is almost impossible to think in terms of their being effectively able to use that weapon and their membership of staff organisations therefore is, in fact, merely the medium through which they make collective submissions to the Minister in respect of their remuneration and conditions of employment.  So far as the individual is concerned, he naturally gains if the staff organisation is successful.  But that organisation is not a direct personal link in so <Col N="1292" /> far as his personal employment and service is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have had experience in outside employment where the same situation arises.  I have discovered that, from the point of view of the member as an individual and not as part of a collective organisation, probably the most important service that can be rendered to him is that, when he requires what might be described as an independent source of advocacy before his employer, it is possible for the trade union to provide that for him.  That is not the position in the Civil Service.  Where a civil servant is the subject of disciplinary action and where that has reached the point that a final decision is about to be made&mdash;that decision may be anything from loss of pay to dismissal&mdash;he is afforded the opportunity of making representations but it is most important that with that right at that point he should have the advice of his staff organisation.  Secondly, the staff organisation, because of its experience and standing, should be permitted to make representations on his behalf.</P>
    <P>It does not state whether the civil servant will make the representations personally or in writing.  I take it the intention is that he will be afforded a personal opportunity of making representations. I am not concerned with that at the moment.  What I am concerned with is that he should be afforded this measure of assistance by his staff organisation and that the staff organisation, in turn, should be afforded the opportunity of making representations on behalf of the officer, if he so desires.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that in many employments, while there is no objection to the right of association in a trade union or organisation of employees and while there will be unlimited collective bargaining in regard to conditions of employment, there is objection to that type of organisation having anything to do with purely disciplinary matters.  I suggest that the most important service a staff organisation can render to an individual civil servant in a direct and personal way is the giving to him of assistance and guidance in relation to representation in respect of perhaps <Col N="1293" /> the most personal matter of all, namely, disciplinary action which may vitally affect his position.  I am somewhat at a loss to understand on what ground objection can be taken to this amendment, particularly since the Government accepted and accorded to civil servants the right to have staff organisations.  They have accorded them the right of audience and negotiation. They have accorded to them a quite elaborate and quite effective conciliation and arbitration machinery.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, in an over-all and general way, this State has affirmed its adoption of the Convention of the International Labour Office on this very question of the right to organise and to freedom of association. I would impress on the Minister from my experience in a type of employment similar to the Civil Service, where what we regard as the effective industrial weapon that can be exercised by organised bodies of employees and workers is not present and available, that the most essential aspect of that right of association, the right of collective representations, is, so far as the individual civil servant is concerned, the possibility that when he is placed in the position where there is danger to his employment, to his post or remuneration, that he can then at that point call in the assistance and advocacy of his organisation and have it there and then used as the medium through which he makes his representations.</P>
    <P>One other aspect which I would stress is this.  In the case, say, of an individual civil servant who, for any reason, finds himself in jeopardy in so far as his employment is concerned, being accorded this right of making representation to the appropriate authority, which of course, in most cases would be the Minister, it is at the final point, before any action is taken.  The whole matter has been the subject of inquiry by various officers in the Civil Service, most of whom will be experienced and will have a wide grip of the problems involved.  In a case of this type, where the matter is going to the Minister for the final action to be taken, if at that point the civil servant who may not have a very wide experience and may not have <Col N="1294" /> very great ability in making a submission of his representation, is to be afforded this right, it may be ineffective so far as the individual is concerned because he may lack the experience or he may fail to understand various aspects of the charge made against him.  Possibly, too, he has no appreciation of the public issues involved.  He may not have a knowledge of precedents, what happened in previous cases, and yet he is to be afforded this right by virtue of the authority of this House.  In many ways, we are giving him something that may be of great value, but if he exercises it in a wrong way it may do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>I think it is a most important aspect of the matter, that in the over-all fixation of the terms of employment of civil servants we accord official recognition to staff associations and the Minister and his leading officials meet them and so on.  I think we should complete our recognition by according to them in regard to representing individual civil servants the same collective recognition that we grant them as a body.  I would impress on the Minister that whatever difficulties he may feel may arise in regard to allowing staff organisations to make representations on this matter it is most important. To the extent that it will only be made under sub-section (5) and at a point before any action is taken, I think it will not in any way prejudice the effect of the present disciplinary machinery.  It will at least take us to the point where not only will justice be done but it will also appear to be done, by giving the opportunity for the making of reasonable and fair representations which the Minister himself feels a civil servant in such circumstances is entitled to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I think it would be undesirable to implement in legislation the suggestions that have been made by Deputy Larkin in his speech on the amendment. I do not think that references of that type are desirable additions to the legislation.  I think it is correct that the representations that the civil servant concerned is entitled to make should be made at the point at which, <Col N="1295" /> as the Deputy correctly stated, they are to be made under sub-section (5) of the Bill.  I accept, however, the point of view that in relation to the more serious penalty, where it is a question of a man keeping or losing his employment, in relation to dismissals, it might be desirable to have an opportunity given to a civil servant in that case of making representations through his staff organisation.</P>
      <P>I have already told the staff organisations that I propose to permit them &mdash;we will try it and see how it works and I hope and believe it will work well&mdash;to make representations in writing in relation to any case where they are requested to act by the civil servant concerned and where dismissal is involved.  The House is aware that Section 17 provides that there can be certain arrangements made by the Minister for Finance for the carrying out of the detailed implementation of regulations of the Civil Service.  I may say, as part of those arrangements, I propose to provide that an officer, when the point is reached that dismissal would be the penalty, would be notified under sub-section (5) that he has the right to offer any representations he may wish, and to add at the time when that notification is sent to him that he may if he so wishes get his staff organisation to make representations on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be desirable to write that into the statute.  As I say, I have already informed the Civil Service Associations that I am prepared to give them that opportunity as an extra-statutory procedure, and I mention that in the House so that when the practice arises it will be considered as part of the precedent for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, I am more concerned with the substance than the form, and whether the right of representation accorded to staff organisations is embodied in the amendment under sub-section (5) or whether this is done in the form indicated by the Minister matters little, because it will become part of the negotiation machinery between the Minister and the recognised staff associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> He has indicated what he is prepared to do in that regard but he has also indicated that he feels it should be effective only in the case of possible dismissals.  I am somewhat at a loss to understand why&mdash;I shall not say he concedes that point&mdash;but why he agrees that the right of representation by staff organisations on behalf of a civil servant should be accorded in the case of a dismissal and should not be accorded also in the two other cases that are dealt with under this section.</P>
    <P>A civil servant could be placed on a low rate of remuneration, he could be reduced to a low rank or there could be a combination of both.</P>
    <P>I agree that the physical act of dismissal is the final and complete break as between the individual and the service, but it may happen that a decision to reduce a civil servant to a lower grade and to combine that with a reduction in remuneration may be of such a nature that it would set an individual civil servant a problem in respect of which he may feel that he might just as well be dismissed.  He may decide to resign because the reduction in remuneration may be of such a serious character as very gravely to impair and undermine his whole status and personal prestige in the service.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat in the dark as to why, at least in regard to charges which would involve a fairly serious reduction of remuneration or grade, it is considered justifiable to impose the disciplinary action of dismissal. Of course a great deal depends on the Minister's officials.  Am I to understand that in regard to every action involving some punitive or disciplinary measures there is to be the right of representation and that that will not imperil or prejudice the disciplinary machinery?  It may give rise to a great deal of clogging and from that practical viewpoint it might be felt that the right of representation through the staffs' organisation should be limited in some degree.  I think the Minister will appreciate that there may be punitive measures other than dismissal imposed on the individual which can have almost as serious effects on the individual as dismissal.  They <Col N="1297" /> can quite clearly be measures which, if applied, would make the individual feel that possibly it would have been better if he had been dismissed, that would make him feel there was no alternative left to him but to resign.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted the principle of the amendment in so far as to indicate that it is not essential to have it embodied in legislation, but has suggested that the Minister and the staff organisation would be able to give effect to it.  Accordingly, I shall not press it further in view of the fact that it might be given an examination elsewhere. It might also be conceded to the individual civil servant in matters involving action short of dismissal.  It should be remembered, as I have said already, that an officer can be very seriously undermined in his prestige and position by certain punitive measures short of dismissal.  If the individual civil servant were given a fair and a just hearing and a final opportunity of making representations, I do think that, in so far as there are other serious disciplinary measures besides dismissal, the Minister might consider, apart from this Bill altogether, the possibility of opening this door a little wider.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  Where a Minister desires to confer established appointments on members of a grade or grades which are non-established grades, the Minister may request the commissioners to hold a competition to test the suitability of such persons for appointments to established positions and in such cases the Commissioners shall be empowered to hold the competition under sub-section (3) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to try and provide a medium whereby some relief can be granted in the existing situation where we have such a large number of unestablished State employees.  I am not quite clear about the figure but I understand that at the present moment the number of such officials is in the neighbourhood of 16,000 to 17,000.  I have a very limited <Col N="1299" /> interest from the point of view of my trade union, but I am aware the problem is a very wide one.  I appreciate that from the point of view of the State it would involve a considerable amount if steps were taken to place all of these civil servants in established positions because they would then be in a position that would entitle them to superannuation.  As I understand it, from time to time certain sections of unestablished civil servants may be regarded with favour by the Minister and he may feel that it would be desirable to try and establish them.  However, as the law stands at the moment, certain practical difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>Possibly I am not completely accurate in some of the views I may be expressing but I will be excused on the grounds that I am trying to interpret a somewhat complicated position.  In so far as appointments are concerned the procedure is that the Minister would request the commissioners to hold a competition for certain appointments. One of the difficulties that has been experienced in dealing with many of the unestablished civil servants is that it has not been possible to hold such competitions, particularly in regard to persons engaged in manual work.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the purpose of the amendment is to provide for the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a Minister desires to confer established appointments on members of a grade or grades which are non-established grades, the Minister may request the commissioners to hold a competition to test the suitability of such persons for appointments to established position and in such cases the commissioners shall be empowered to hold the competition under sub-section (3) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) sets down in some detail the type of competition which the commissioners may hold.  I gather that if the Minister desires to take the necessary steps to establish an existing non-established grade and if such a request is made, the only question that arises then is whether or not it is possible for the commissioners to <Col N="1300" /> comply with the requirements of the provisions of the Bill in respect of holding competitions.  I gather that in the commissioners' view in many instances, because the particular grade were only engaged in manual services, it was impossible to establish a form of competition, although in sub-section (3) we have a number of alternatives offered.  We have the ordinary written examination, an oral examination and an interview.  There is also a practical examination and there are other tests which the commissioners may consider to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>If it is a question that there is no desire on the part of a Minister to establish non-established grade then the problem I am dealing with naturally does not arise.  Until the conviction is born in the mind of the Minister and he secures the necessary authority, there is no opportunity of examining the machinery available to give effect to the Minister's desire.  A great play has been made about the impracticability of carrying out tests or competitions which would make it possible for the Minister, if he wished, to confer established status on many of the non-established grades.</P>
    <P>I think the main burden of my argument can be most effectively conveyed to the House by referring to the copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in which the Commissioners give official notification that they propose to hold confined competitive examinations for established situations as female stores assistants in the Stores Branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  First of all, the number of positions is not very great; only four are involved.  Secondly, the assistants in the Stores Branch are originally recruited from ordinary factory girls who are employed in the post office factory.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider how the Commissioners propose to comply with the existing provisions in regard to the holding of competitions it seems to me that the Commissioners are very fertile &mdash;I will not say in their method of getting through the obstacles set down &mdash;but in their method of complying with the requirements, because the competitive examinations which they propose to hold for these four established <Col N="1301" /> positions consist, first of all, of an oral examination and interview, and, secondly, of an optional test in Irish.  There is no indication as to what the oral examination and interview will consist of.  It may well consist of asking them their names and addresses.  Some little indication is given further down, however, because the Commissioners, apparently being concerned about the proper discharge of their duties, propose that the oral examination will consist of an oral test in English.  The test itself will consist of &ldquo;the reading and the meaning of words.&rdquo;  For that a maximum of 50 marks will be allowed.  There are certain other regulations some of which in fact, confine the examination to employees in this particular department of the post office who have had three years' continuous service, whose conduct has been satisfactory, etc.</P>
    <P>The whole point is that we are dealing with a proposal to establish what in fact is a very small number of female employees who have graduated from doing clearly manual factory work to the point where they are now stores assistants, and in order to do that and comply with the regulations, a competitive examination is to be held.  The competitive examination consists of reading and the meaning of words&mdash;probably there will be a number of other questions in the course of the interview&mdash;and an optional test in Irish, which is subject to a total of securing an additional 50 marks.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that the commissioners have not taken this matter quite seriously but it does seem to me that, if that is the way in which we have to apply the test of competitive examinations, there can be no argument at all against the acceptance of the amendment I have here and there can be no difficulty experienced subsequently on the part of the commissioners if they receive a request from the Minister to hold competitive examinations for any type of employment in the service.  Even if it is only for standing still at the door they should be able to exercise their ingenuity and comply with the Minister's wishes.</P>
    <P>On the general position I feel this is <Col N="1302" /> an important matter.  Since there is some provision for recruitment after long periods of service, in effect the principle of recognition of service by some monetary reward is accepted.  The only difficulty is that the provision is somewhat meagre and limited and does not meet the modern concept of the obligation of an employer to provide reasonable pension benefits for their employees who have given long service or who have to retire by virtue of age or illness.  To that extent, apart altogether from the practical problem involved in the present amendment, I would appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment, particularly if it is of help to him in easing the position so far as reducing the number of non-established servants is concerned or making it easier for the commissioners to give effect to the requests from the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the overall problem is a financial problem.  Nevertheless when we come across employees of the State in fairly humble positions who have given periods of 25, 30 or more years' service and we are not in a position to accord to them the same measure of recognition and security in the form of superannuation as has been possible to accord to established servants, I think it is a case that deserves sympathy, and if this amendment will contribute towards ending that practical difficulty I trust it will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, of course, the difficulties in regard to competitions such as the Deputy has indicated and there are the difficulties in relation to unestablished civil servants such as those which he has enumerated. But be those problems as they may, the amendment that the Deputy suggests to insert here to Section 15 does not in fact give any powers of consequence in addition to the powers already available.  The commission have quite adequate powers in Sections 13 and 14 to hold confined competitions for the establishment of serving unestablished and temporary officers and, in fact, do hold such competitions, as the Deputy indicated, by the reference he made to <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only difference between the <Col N="1303" /> Deputy's amendment and the position as it appears in Sections 13 and 14 is that in the Deputy's amendment it is mandatory on the Civil Service Commissioners to hold such competition where the Minister so directs, on the one hand, and that the existing practice is, of course, that the Civil Service Commissioners do it without a mandatory statute and that, on the other hand, the effect of the Deputy's amendment would be such that the competitions that are visualised in the other sections would be without the saver that is there already&mdash;&ldquo;they shall not be held without the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  Clearly, the Minister for Finance must consent to the type of competition that is being held, because the Minister for Finance must be responsible for the control of recruitment.</P>
    <P>I can see quite clearly the difficulties which the Deputy had in mind when he was putting down his amendment but, in fact, the difficulty usually arises from the essence of the competition. Having regard to the powers that exist in Sections 13 and 14, I do not think that the amendment which the Deputy suggests would add anything to the powers there to deal with the establishment of unestablished civil servants and I would suggest that the amendment, therefore, is unnecessary because of the powers in Sections 13 and 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister is it correct that there have been occasions on which proposals have been made to grant established status to unestablished officers and that the argument has been made that, as a practical proposition, it would not be possible to comply with the requirement that a competition shall be held? That is really what I am trying to get at&mdash;that if the Minister as the appropriate authority decides that it is desirable that a particular grade shall be established, subject to the requirements of the provisions of the Act, that that is the effective decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this talk about competitions, in the line of what I have read out in regard to these four female positions, is, to use a word favoured by a member <Col N="1304" /> of this House who is now a Minister, a lot of codology because here we have a case where, if four girls are to be appointed to established positions, there will be no change in the work they will do; the only difference is that when they have completed a long period of service the State can recognise that service by giving them a pension.  Before they can be given that, they have to sit down and read a book for the benefit of the interviewer, to explain two or three of the words and have also&mdash;which is far more important than the oral test&mdash;to have three years' service as female stores assistant and their work and conduct must be satisfactory&mdash;that is the effective test.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, is the only reason why a greater measure of established service cannot be extended to these thousands of State servants merely a question of decision by the Minister? If it is, I do not quarrel with him because it is a much bigger issue.  If the Minister or his successor, in their wisdom, decide that they want to establish a grade, have they full and effective powers to see that that is carried out or is it the position that the commissioners can evade their responsibility on the grounds that an effective and satisfactory competitive examination cannot be held, even for the most menial position, which involves nothing but manual labour?</P>
    <P>In my submission, a servant of the State performing manual labour has exactly the same claim as one performing clerical work and it is not fair or proper, once the principle of providing superannuation for the servants of the State has been conceded that that should be denied to persons performing manual tasks, however lowly, merely because of a technicality in regard to competitive examinations which were never intended to apply to manual work.  The intention was, quite clearly, that they should apply to the clerical grade of the service and nothing else. To apply them now in regard to a doorkeeper, messenger or something like that, or a labourer in the Park, is stretching the thing far beyond the original intention.</P>
    <P>If there is a practical difficulty, would the Minister indicate what it is? <Col N="1305" /> If my amendment does not solve the difficulty, there is no purpose in passing it.  I understand that on many occasions the argument has been made that, even though it may be desirable to grant established service to a particular group, it could not be done because of this problem of competitive examination, even if the Minister wished to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The situation as I understand it is that in the last 32 years, since the 1924 Act, there has been no case in which the Minister for Finance and the Civil Service Commissioners have differed about the holding of a competition.  There is ample power in this Bill, in Sections 13 and 14, for an open or for a limited and confined competition to be held if it is considered appropriate.  That is the statutory position and that has been operated by the Civil Service Commissioners. In 30 years of practice&mdash;and this is re-enactment of practice&mdash;there has never been divergence of opinion. That is in so far as the word &ldquo;request&rdquo; is used in the Deputy's amendment. The Deputy's amendment, I suggest, in relation to the matters about competition that he has mentioned rather begs the question by using the word in it, just as I have the word already in Sections 13 and 14.  It would not make the slightest difference.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that in 30 years there has never been a difference between the Minister and the commissioners.  Maybe that proves what I am getting at.  I do not know. What I am concerned with is to discover, apart from financial reasons, what are the obstacles to providing established service to many thousands of State employees who have a genuine and proper claim to it.  I have been informed very definitely that on a number of occasions where this submission has been made the argument has finally resolved down to the fact that it is not possible to provide for the establishment of the particular grade because a suitable and acceptable competitive examination cannot be devised.  That may be in the eyes of the commissioners or the eyes of the Minister or jointly.  I do not know. <Col N="1306" /> Whether it is or not, it is quite clear to me that it is side-stepping the issue in the light of what was originally intended by way of competitive examination and the way it is being applied now in certain cases where it suits the Minister and the commissioners.  Nobody can suggest to me that the competition for these four posts in the Post Office is a competitive examination and I give all credit to the commissioners for devising it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I might perhaps explain to the House that the remaining amendments on the sheet are all cognate to the same problem which arises first under Section 19.  So far as this is concerned, we are merely deleting a reference. Deputies will see that under Section 13 of the Bill the appropriate powers are taken to deal with what is commonly known as the public interest clause.  When I was considering the Bill since the Second Reading I found that there appeared to be some inadvertent clash between the provisions of Section 19 and the subsequent sections that were written in as a result of Section 19, and the provisions of Section 13 (3) in particular.  Section 13 (3) provided that the Government decided that an appointment should be made in the public interest, while Section 19 provided that the commissioners should, so to speak, sit in judgment over the Government.  There has been a re-enactment of the existing <Col N="1307" /> law through the drafting of it for purposes of condensation and clarity in certain respects have been changed from the original Bill.  The practice that has operated up to the present time will continue to operate in exactly the same way but for the purposes of avoiding what appears to be a conflict between Section 19 and Section 13 (3) I think it is better that we would provide that in relation to the public interest appointment, the person concerned would be deemed from the date of the appointment to possess a certificate of qualification, that is to say, the additional sub-section that would be inserted into Section 29 will avoid a certain amount of unnecessary rubber-stamp procedure and rubberstand procedure perhaps that some people might think was not of a very desirable kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy, since he did not sit down, was going to ask another question.  As I explained on the Second Reading, we cannot possibly tell at this stage what the final financial implications will be because we do not know the full extent of coast erosion.  Until such time as it is possible to have the examinations, surveys and preparation of schemes for which provision is made in this Bill, it is not possible to forecast the cost of any particular scheme. This Bill is a machinery Bill to enable schemes to be prepared and surveys made.  When the schemes have been prepared and the surveys made, then we will see the cost in relation to each particular scheme and then we will be able to assess the cost in relation to the State as a whole.  For me at the moment to attempt to give the Deputy, or the House, any estimate of the total cost would be completely misleading and I know the Deputy would not wish me to do that.  Until the problem has been examined under the mechanics provided in this Bill we cannot really make any estimate, and any estimate we did make would be more than the wildest guess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have no trouble at all in giving an estimate.  I will give it to him now.  This Money Resolution renders the Bill unworkable, and the Minister knows that. There is a rather peculiar history in <Col N="1312" /> relation to coast erosion.  The Government and Government Departments are responsible for the fact that the money is not there to deal with coast erosion.  Under the Compulsory Act of 1923 officials from the Department of Lands were sent down through the country, having power under that Act to withhold certain sums which were to be used for the protection of the lands affected and the protection of embankments.  They did not do that. They allowed the landlords to get away with the loot.  Now, the Minister comes in here with a Bill which he knows is unworkable.  The Minister is not a child.  The Minister served some little bit of time on a public authority. He has already had proposals for Ringabella and the expenditure there will be something over £200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may speak to the Money Resolution&mdash; that is, as to why money should or should not be voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it is no use voting this money on the ground that no local authority to my knowledge will be prepared to give the other 50 per cent.  I have very definite knowledge of my own local authority.  I know what happened there.  Two areas in Cork County are affected by coast erosion. In the town of Youghal one penny in the £ at the moment makes £46.  Where the amount needed for coast erosion is £26,000, that means £13,000 to be provided where one penny in the £ brings in £46.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ringabella, in South Cork, there is a scheme at an estimated cost of close on £400,000.  The total number of county councillors representing that area is eight out of 64.  Therefore, the Bill is completely unworkable.  At the moment there are proposals before the Minister and before the Minister for Local Government in relation to the line from Ballymacoda right into Ballycotton involving an expenditure of something in the region of £40,000. Any man in his senses knows that the <Col N="1314" /> hope of six or seven councillors, representing one area which is affected, putting a burden of £2/- in the £ on the ratepayers of the rest of the county is something that will not materialise.  Therefore, whatever time and money was wasted in preparing this Bill might as well be thrown in the tide.</P>
    <P>It is a waste of public money and a waste of our time here.  The Minister must have been living up in the clouds, far removed from contact with the rural community, when he devised a Bill of the type we have here.  He has the pleasure of representing here an inland area which is not affected, but I wonder if there was one portion of his county affected and if three or four county councillors representing the area came in with a bill for £20,000 to him in his capacity as county councillor for another area, what would be his attitude?</P>
    <P>At present, rates in this country have been brought to breaking point. In my county, owing to the machinations of the Coalition Government, the bulk of the rates this year will have to be collected by the bailiffs, and yet the Minister comes in and wastes the time of the House and incurs the expense of drafting and everything else on a thing of this description!</P>
    <P>The Minister knows it is unworkable, and I definitely oppose the Bill in regard to this Money Resolution. It has rendered the whole Bill unworkable because there is no hope of getting anything out of it except the mere assertion: &ldquo;We brought in the Bill and it is up to the local authorities to work it if they like.&rdquo;  This kind of bluff has gone on too long in this House and outside, and it is time somebody called it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposing the principle of the Bill.  I want to make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is agreed even by Deputy Corry that the protection of our coastline is a very desirable objective, but if the principle of the Bill is sound, it is rendered unsound <Col N="1315" /> if the financial provisions are not such as would make it workable.</P>
      <P>As far as I know the principal scheme for which this Bill is introduced is concerned with County Wexford where I am sure a very large sum of money would be needed to repair the damage and prevent further coast erosion.  In that case, I think on Section 19 of the Bill, we would be entitled to put forward arguments which I hope will convince the Minister that he should, instead of having a definite percentage named, have an elastic section which would enable him if a case is made to him-as I am sure it could be made-that 50 per cent.  on the local ratepayers of a county would be far too great a burden, he could, even if it went to 80 per cent. or 90 per cent., use his discretion and make that sum available.</P>
      <P>There are, perhaps, a number of minor schemes all round the coast where local authorities could put up 50 per cent.  or something near it, but in my opinion it would be better to leave out the stipulated percentage altogether and leave it to the discretion of the Minister.  But we want assurances from the Minister on Section 19 of the Bill that on Report Stage, when he listens to the arguments on that section, he will be prepared to bring in amendments to meet our point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what the position of arterial drainage was over a number of years and of the series of attempts that were made to solve it.  There was never any real attempt made to satisfy the people generally until the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act came, under which the State undertook to pay the full amount.  I am not going to go as far as that because I believe this is somewhat different, but I think there should be elasticity in that section so that when a good case is made to the Minister proving, perhaps, that if erosion is allowed to go on, areas close to the sea will be obliterated and, perhaps, if allowed to go further, it would endanger the position of the capital town in the county and its population, he can meet it.  I think that in that case, the Minister or any Minister for <Col N="1316" /> Finance in any Government should be prepared to listen to reason and should also be prepared to place themselves in the position where they could use discretion to accept what would be the expert advice put forward by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corry pointed out, I fear that in its present form and with the financial provisions that are being out lined in the Bill, even a local authority could not take it on themselves to promote a scheme because they would know very well, where a very large sum of money would be involved, it would be only a waste of time.  They may do it in the hope that there would be a change of attitude on the part of the existing Government or some future Government, but that is the only incentive they have, to go to the trouble of promoting a scheme at all.</P>
    <P>That is the attitude I would like to take on this Bill.  I think it is a fairly reasonable attitude and I am sure the Minister knows very well from all that has been put to him by members of various Parties from various constituencies where this problem is very acute, that if he does not do something like that, it would be just as well, as Deputy Corry said, not to introduce the Bill at all.  I think we could let the Money Resolution go through and argue particularly on Section 19 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the provisions in this Money Resolution will ensure that so far as major or urgent schemes are concerned not a shilling will be spent.  If the Minister or the Government think they are doing anyone who is concerned about an urgent or a major scheme any good by this measure they are making a great mistake.  The time of the House should not be taken up with such proposed legislation.  It will not work where it is urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance knows quite well that the background to this Bill is provided by Rosslare.  There may be some other areas where the erosion problem is not so urgent. This is a matter of serious urgency for some time past.  It has been under consideration for over 50 years.  The <Col N="1317" /> Great Western Railways were responsible for this erosion, but those multimillionaires are not now being held responsible.  C.I.E., whose main line to Rosslare Harbour is threatened, have not been suggested as contributors.</P>
    <P>This is a more serious matter than the Government appear to appreciate. It involves the livelihood and the homes of a large number of people in Rosslare and its vicinity.  It deserves the best will and the most sympathetic consideration we can give it. All we do give it is a piece of permissive legislative machinery.  No local authority can commit their ratepayers to the amount of expenditure that would be necessary to prevent or arrest erosion in that one area in Wexford.  The half-dozen councillors who represent the area concerned know that it is futile for them to go to a county council meeting and tell the general meeting that it will cost the county ratepayers between 2/- and 4/- in the £ to arrest this erosion.  The council would be very slow to pass the necessary resolution.</P>
    <P>This should be appreciated by the Government.  As Deputy Beegan has pointed out, unless the Minister is prepared to relax and change his present attitude untold damage will be done.  The Minister should provide that, in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, a scheme would be hammered out that would not impose so much difficulty on the local authorities concerned. It is our duty to inform the Minister that we do not think this Bill will work.  It may work in the case of minor schemes but not in the case of Rosslare where considerable expenditure will be necessary.  Nearly 30 years ago a group of experts estimated that a huge sum would be necessary for it.</P>
    <P>Neither the State nor the local authority at that time was prepared to undertake the work and the damage has been going on progressively since, so much so that it has now reached a critical stage.  We shall have something else to say on that aspect of the matter when we come to the appropriate section of the Bill, under which provision is made for delays.  It could <Col N="1318" /> take anything from five to six years to make a start on this work.  The Minister and Government should make up their minds, if they want to save Rosslare and other areas where crises exist, that the local ratepayers will be unable to meet the demand that this Bill would impose on them.</P>
    <P>County Wexford ratepayers contribute something like £350,000 annually to public services.  The State as a whole contributes £140,000,000.  We would not object to this Bill if it provided that the contribution of the ratepayers to the prevention of erosion would be on that proportion.  The ratepayers would be pleased to pay on that basis.  Any Government must realise that the position in Rosslare has been getting progressively worse over the past 40 years.  We know the history of the whole thing; we know that the Government should be responsible for the maintaining of the foreshores. Under Article 42 (2) of the Constitution, &ldquo;the domain and ownership of the seas surrounding the Republic, and the creeks, bays and ports and tidal waters&rdquo; are vested in the State.  The State is also responsible under the Foreshores Act, the State Property Act and all other Acts, for the maintenance of the foreshores which are vested either in the Department of Local Government or in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>When you consider the question of saving Rosslare you must agree that the foreshore is the vital matter; it is the foreshore that is being washed away.  There is no mention of the foreshore in this Bill.  I am wondering if the job can be done at all; if some legal luminary will not advise that because the land is not affected to any great extent the local authority have no power to do this work.  However, the Government have the responsibility to protect the people from the ravages of the sea just as they are responsible for protecting them against invasion, pestilence and famine.</P>

Under the provisions of this Bill I am afraid that work will never be done and that we are wasting time discussing it if the Minister does not change his mind and agree that this work is the responsibility of the State.  Local authorities could not possibly do all the work necessary to save the foreshores. There are 12 maritime counties in the Republic and I should think that Cork and Wexford have the longest.  The other 14 non-maritime counties will get off scot free under this Bill.  It is unfortunate for the 12 maritime counties that under this legislation the Minister will not undertake the duties of the State. Instead he would tax the ratepayers who at the moment are organising and sending deputations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Forestry and Land Commission Workers' Superannuation&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:-</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that legislative proposals should be introduced at an early date to provide a superannuation scheme for forestry and Land Commission workers.&mdash;(Deputy James Tully.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the motion was adjourned on Wednesday night last I was trying to impress on the Minister the great similarity between the employees of local authorities in this country and the employees of the forestry section of the Department of Lands.  One of the points made during the debate&mdash; I think by Deputy O'Hara &mdash;was that there was no general demand from forestry and Land Commission workers for any type of pension scheme.  I think Deputies were speaking from experience in their own constituencies when saying there was no demand.  I can claim to have experience in every constituency in the country where there is a forestry section, and the trade union I represent has had repeated demands from its members all over the country.  Let there be no doubt at all in the Minister's mind that there is as great a demand from the forestry workers for the protection of a superannuation scheme as there was from the employees of local authorities before such a scheme was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I think it would be most unfair if those workers were deprived of the benefits of such a scheme for a further period.  The statement was also made that it was impossible to work such a scheme where Land Commission workers were concerned. On Wednesday evening I referred to the Land Commission gangers in particular and I said that, because of the fact that there was a relatively small number of them and they were almost <Col N="1321" /> in permanent employment, there should be very little difficulty in putting a scheme in operation for them. In this morning's post I received a letter from the secretary of the supervisors' association in which he stated there were 38 permanent supervisors employed by the Land Commission. While some of those people have up to 40 years' employment with the Land Commission they have no superannuation scheme.  That is an injustice which should be rectified at the earliest possible time, and I think that time is now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see no reason whatever why the forestry section of the Land Commission should try to prevent its workers getting something which almost every other State, semi-State and local authority employee enjoys, particularly in view of the fact that they are not asking for something for nothing.  I think I proved very conclusively on Wednesday last&mdash;I could not be certain because it would need an actuary to go into the matter&mdash;that as far as a layman can find out, for the first ten years at least the forestry section would be collecting from the workers subscriptions which would build up a scheme with funds at its disposal of anything up to £52,000 per year.  Out of that amount they might in years to come be asked to pay superannuation.  If the forestry section are to continue as we expect they will, it will mean that the greater the number of employees concerned the greater the number of subscriptions coming in.  Even when the time comes for a number of those people to retire there still will be quite a substantial sum paid in every year which will more than counterbalance the amount being paid out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the points which I put to him last Wednesday and which were put to him by various other speakers, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the whole question and not to dismiss it summarily but to go into it very fully.  I am sure if he is agreeable to do so he will find that the case is even far stronger than that I made here on Wednesday night and to-night.  I would ask the Minister to tell me whether he <Col N="1322" /> is prepared to consider the matter fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  I understand Deputy Tully made a case for the supervisors and the gangers in the Land Commission and forestry section. If the Minister finds it is not feasible at the moment to bring in a superannuation scheme to cover all the workers mentioned in the motion, would he agree to bring in a scheme to cover the supervisors and gangers on the staff of the Land Commission and the forestry section in view of their long service to the State?  If he does I will be prepared to accept that for the moment anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My motion actually calls for that.  It stands to reason that if everybody cannot be included the Minister will bring in a scheme to cover those to whom Deputy McQuillan refers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McQuillan's point, the motion does not specify gangers and supervisors; it specifies workers. The motion asks that legislative proposals be introduced forthwith for this purpose.  I will not say that I accept the motion but, as I told Deputy Tully on the last occasion on which this matter was before the House, I certainly will give it consideration to see if anything can be done.  I promise that.  Naturally if workers are being considered I cannot see how those over them, gangers and particularly supervisors, could be omitted from such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time that the question of workers and gangers has been raised.  The question of superannuation for supervisors has been raised on many occasions in this House.  I know their plight has the sympathy of many Deputies and, speaking for myself personally, I would like to see a scheme introduced which would give them some little security when they leave office.  At the present time supervisors are supposed to finish their services at 65 years of age.  The way of providing for them is to keep them on in the Service long past the time when most <Col N="1323" /> people retire.  I will have the whole question examined to see what can be done.  I want to assure the Deputy who moved the motion that it will be approached from the sympathetic angle rather than being dismissed summarily as he said himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann considers that the aim of the afforestation programme of the State should be to plant a minimum of 1,000,000 acres at a rate of not less than 25,000 acres per year and requests the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure the implementation of this minimum annual rate of plantation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There are two motions in the names of Deputy Tully and myself dealing with forestry.  The one we are about to discuss to-night deals with what should be the annual plantation target.  The other, which we will be discussing later, deals with the question of whether the planting programme would be better carried out by other means than those at present used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the House to approach this motion completely objectively.  I have not introduced these motions for the purpose of raising any political issues or for the purpose of attributing blame for the neglect of afforestation. I think there is probably no clearer example since this State was established of our failure to make use of <Col N="1324" /> the sources available to us than forestry.  It is a glaring example of our short-sightedness over a long period of time but I suppose at this tage it will serve little purpose to seek to blame one particular Government or another Government for it.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the question of forestry is very simple.  The main problems that this nation has to face are insufficiency of production, massive unemployment and massive emigration. As a country, apart from the raw material which we can produce from the ground by way of food, apart from some minerals, we have little or no raw materials upon which to base industrial development.  Timber is one of the most important raw materials in the modern world.  Timber is not only used for making furniture and so on but it is now the basis of an infinite variety of other substances and the basis of numerous secondary industries. We as a nation lack raw materials.  Yet, we have available to us all the necessary means of producing this most important raw material, timber.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1908 a British Royal Commission assessed that the amount of land in this country which was unproductive and which was available for afforestation was over 1,000,000 acres.  There have been many subsequent assessments.  These assessments come to the same conclusion, that we have between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 acres of land suitable for afforestation. In the case of most of our industries or a great many of our industries we suffer from a number of handicaps.  In the case of afforestation we suffer from no handicap.  We are able to produce a full-size tree in a shorter space of time than the other European timber-producing countries.  We are able to grow a full-size tree in a shorter space of time than Scandinavia.  Timber requires a damp, mild climate and we have that.  So that, we have available to us the natural conditions necessary to enable us to produce timber.  We have the land on which the timber can be grown, land which is for the most part lying completely derelict and unproductive.  We have the labour required to enable us to plant that land and, certainly, we have the <Col N="1325" /> capital necessary in order to utilise that labour and utilise that land and convert it into a raw material.</P>
    <P>I know that many people are inclined to think that forestry is such a long term project that it is not worth bothering about.  Apart from that being a short-sighted and selfish attitude towards the development of the country, it is an attitude which nowadays is based on misconception of modern development.  From the 12th to the 15th year after planting a forest you can begin to draw an income from it through the thinnings, thinnings which can now be pulped and can form the basis of secondary industries.</P>
    <P>Despite the obvious advantages, for some reason which, I must say, I have never been able to clear up in my own mind&mdash;many excuses have been advanced from time to time&mdash;we have made very, very slow progress in afforestation since the State was set up.  True, we have made much greater progress in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to introduce this as a point of political controversy but I notice that the Leader of the Opposition, speaking at the Ard Fheis of Fianna Fáil, yesterday, criticised my Party, <i>inter alia</i>, for seeking to suggest that we were the only people who thought of forestry.  I do not think we have ever suggested that we were the only people who thought of forestry.  Many people in the course of the last 50 years in Ireland have worked as hard as they could to try to get forestry pushed ahead but what I think the Leader of the Opposition overlooked was that, though he may agree with forestry, that though successive Governments may agree as to the desirability of pushing forestry ahead, none of them have really made, until recently, any serious effort to do it and thus we have the position in which, over the last 35 years, we have planted at the rate of some 5,500 to 6,000 acres a year on an average.</P>

      <P>I shall amplify it.  I will give the present Minister full credit for having stepped up that rate very considerably but, dealing with the <Col N="1326" /> over-all position, we get the picture that, over 35 years of our own Government, we have planted only between 5,500 and 6,000 acres per year on an average.  It has gone up some years, gone down other years.  We have a smaller area under timber than any other European country.  The percentage of our land under timber is 1.4 compared with, for instance, 9 per cent. in Denmark, 17 per cent. in France, Belgium and Spain, 21 per cent. in Switzerland, 26 per cent. in Germany, 41 per cent. in Austria, 60 per cent. in Sweden, 73 per cent. in Finland.  We have only 1.4 per cent.  We have a lower area under timber than any other European country though we are capable of producing timber more economically and more rapidly than any of those other countries and though we more than those other countries lack raw materials.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure these other countries have the equivalent of 3,000,000 sheep, but if the Minister wants to engage in a debate on that I will take him on any day.  At all events, it will quieten the Minister if I say that the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Lands were members of the Government which in the year 1949 sat down and decided solemnly that the annual plantation rate should be 25,000 acres per year. That decision was embodied in the long-term programme submitted to the American authorities and presented to this House.  It might be well if I refreshed the memory of the House in regard to what was said at that time in relation to that programme.  I am quoting from page 22 of the European Recovery Programme (1949-1953).  It is a public document (P. No. 9198). Paragraph 49 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;So far, reafforestation has been carried out only on a very small scale; in recent years the rate of planting in the State forests has been approximately 6,000 acres per year.  It is proposed to step this up to 25,000 acres per year.  The aim will be to plant 1,000,000 acres by <Col N="1327" /> annual increments of 25,000 acres. At maturity, and assuming an average yield of 3,500 cubic feet of timber per acre on a 50-year rotation, the annual return on a 25,000-acre felling will be of the order of 87.5 million cubic feet, or approximately 350,000 standards of sawn timber.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the decision of a Government submitted to this House in the year 1949.  I would like to have seen a higher annual rate of plantation decided upon then but I was quite prepared to accept an annual rate of 25,000 acres a year as being a vast advance on what had been done before. Unfortunately, we have not yet reached that annual rate of 25,000 acres a year.  In 1949-50, we planted planted 3,393 acres; in 1950-51, with the impetus given to the afforestation programme by the present Minister, plantation went up to 9,372 acres; in 1951-52, it reached the 15,000 mark; then it slumped back in 1952-53 to 12,400 acres and it was the same in the following year.  In 1954-55, it went up to 13,900 acres, and in 1955-56 the area planted was 15,000.  This year I understand the planting programme will be 17,500, which will be the highest plantation rate achieved since the State was set up.  I am very glad to pay tribute to the Minister for having achieved that planting rate, but that is still short of the planting rate which I think everybody will agree is the necessary planting rate of 25,000 acres a year.</P>
    <P>I mentioned some of the main economic problems facing the country, the need for increased production, the need to provide employment to enable the vast numbers who are at present unemployed or who have to emigrate, to live in their own country.  Forestry is now the biggest single undertaking in the State.  There are more than 5,000 men employed in forestry as the result of an expansion which took place in forestry from 1948 onwards. Employment in forestry grew from 2,000 to 5,000 acres.  That is no inconsiderable increase, but I do not know whether members of the House appreciate fully the seriousness of the lack of development in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> I am glad to see the Minister for Agriculture here.  He is looking rather sceptical, but I wonder does the Minister for Agriculture appreciate that from 1951 to 1955 37,000 people who had been employed in agriculture became disemployed?  There was a fall of 37,000 in agricultural employment in that short period.  That is not due probably to any fault in the organisation of our agriculture.  The tendency for disemployment to occur in agriculture has been a world-wide one.</P>
    <P>What is particularly disturbing, and I would like the Ministers who are in the House now to bear this in mind, is the fact that during that period while 37,000 people were disemployed in agriculture we only succeeded in creating 1,000 additional jobs in non-agricultural occupations.  That is the net result of five years of endeavour.  I am quite prepared to give credit to this Government and to the previous Government for using their best endeavours to promote development, but the net result of those endeavours was a net disemployment of 36,000 people in a period of five years, quite apart altogether from emigration.  With all the money we spent and with all our best efforts, we only succeeded in creating in that five-year period 1,000 new jobs in the non-agricultural sectors of our economy.  Surely that must show some basic defect in the policies we are pursuing. I am not talking now of the policy of this Government, the last Government or any Government.  I am not concerned with trying to make political capital for one side or the other.</P>
    <P>We must face the stark realities of our failure to pursue an economic policy capable of coping with the problems with which we have to deal.  We have a falling population.  From the census we know the extent of that fall.  We have an emigration rate of 40,000 to 45,000 per year.  We have an unemployment problem ranging from 40,000 to 70,000 to 75,000 depending on the season of the year.  We are not engaged here to-night in a general economic debate.  I merely give these facts to underline the vital importance of actively pursuing a policy of afforestation and putting the maximum <Col N="1329" /> amount of endeavour into it.  I am quite satisfied the Minister is doing that.  I am quite satisfied the Minister would like to plant 50,000 acres per year.  I am quite satisfied he is doing his best.  Having regard to the slowness of the progress made and to the fact that year after year successive Governments and all political Parties have voiced their agreement and their approval of afforestation, in the light of the lack of progress it is desirable, I think, to try to remove doubts as to what our target is.  For that reason I tabled this motion which proposes an annual target of 25,000 acres per year. The Minister has tabled an amendment, accepting that target of 25,000 acres but providing that it should be reached by annual increments of 2,500 per year.  In three years' time, on that basis, we would reach the 25,000 acres per year.  I am prepared to accept that.  It is a reasonable rate of progress and I accept the Minister's amendment in that regard.</P>
    <P>The House, however, should put on its records as a definite indication to the Minister, whether it be the present Minister or any other Minister, that the annual target is to be 25,000 acres per year.  I would like to make it clear&mdash;I think I have made it clear on a number of occasions&mdash;that as far as I am concerned and as far as anybody interested in forestry is concerned, we have reached the stage when we are no longer prepared to accept excuses if the programme is not implemented. I am quite certain the Minister will do his level best to achieve that programme. I have become so used over a period&mdash;not merely since I came into this House but long before it&mdash;to hearing different excuses put forward for the lack of progress that I have now reached the stage where I am not prepared to listen to any excuse or even to listen to reason in relation to forestry.</P>
    <P>We all know that forestry involves long-term planning.  In order to plant successfully one must plan at least five years ahead.  If one decides on 25,000 acres per year one must start probably four or five years before that to acquire the land necessary.  A large proportion of the land may be unsuitable and, therefore, one must acquire more <Col N="1330" /> than the actual amount required for planting.  In addition, one must have a plantable reserve.  If one intends to plant 25,000 acres one will want a plantable reserve of approximately 75,000 acres in hand.  I know the Minister is doing his best in that direction and I hope the legislation he introduced last session will facilitate him in carrying out his programme.</P>
    <P>It is essential that all planning should be done carefully so that we will not be told two years or three years hence that there are not enough seedlings, not enough reserve of land, not enough thinned forests, or something like that.  It is well we should know exactly where we stand.  The House wants a reasonable target of 25,000 acres a year and it wants that target achieved.</P>
    <P>Even by planting 25,000 acres per year we should still be doing considerably less proportionately in comparison with other countries.  In Britain, which is an industrial country suffering more from over-employment than underemployment, the target of the Forestry Commission is 5,000,000 acres.  In the year 1954 the British Forestry Commission planted 70,400 acres.  In addition, 19,100 acres were planted through the medium of State-aided schemes.  In effect, in 1954 they planted 96,500 acres. That is six times more than we did in that year.  It must be borne in mind, too, that Britain has a much higher percentage of land under timber than we have.  As I pointed out, Britain is a highly industrialised country suffering from overfull employment.  Yet, the British Forestry Commission engages in a vast programme of afforestation. The land area is about three times greater than ours, but Britain planted six times more timber than we did in one year.  There is, therefore, nothing extraordinary or nothing ambitious in our aiming at planting 25,000 acres.  It is the very minimum we should aim to achieve.</P>
    <P>I should mention, of course, that quite apart from the decision of the Government in regard to the 25,000-acre target in 1949 which is embodied in the long term plan, a forestry survey was made by an official of the F.A.O. who came here, and in the course of that survey he approved of <Col N="1331" /> the planting of 1,000,000 acres, half of which would be for purely commercial timber and the other half on the basis of a full social forestry programme.  So there can be no question or room for argument now on the plantation rate or the target we should reach.  Our concern should be that these targets are reached and that is the purpose of this motion.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain&mdash;and I would like to pay tribute to the Minister and the Government&mdash;that the Minister has been doing his best and I congratulate him on having been able in a fairly short space of time practically to treble the amount of forestry work which was being done before.  That is an achievement, but we cannot rest on our laurels and we have to reach the target which we set ourselves seven years ago.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the amendment tabled by the Minister which ensures that we will reach that target in three years' time, I would again like to make definitely clear that I do not think we should be prepared to accept any excuses next year or the year after or in three years' time if the targets laid down in the Minister's amendment are not reached.  All the difficulties that can arise are difficulties that can be anticipated.</P>
    <P>Of the various items of capital expenditure indulged in by the State, forestry is the most productive.  We spend some £12,000,000 or more on our roads.  It is very necessary to have good roads but good roads do not provide us with an income; they do not produce anything that would add to the productivity of the country.  They do not add to our exports.  We spend, I think, something over £1,000,000 on forestry.  I would like to see that process reversed.  I would prefer to see us spending £12,000,000 on forestry and £1,000,000 on roads.  From the point of view of productivity we would get much more and also from the point of view of employment, because of all the various forms of public works, forestry is the one which has the highest labour content.  It is much more than in the case of road work and <Col N="1332" /> is higher even than housing.  In addition to that, forestry produces a solid asset, from 12 to 15 years afterwards, when it begins to yield a return.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House will approach this motion in an objective sense and that what I have said will not be misconstrued by the members of the Opposition as an indictment for their neglect.  It is as much an indictment of previous Governments as it is of them; it is a general indictment, if you like, of our lack of foresight as a nation in that respect.  Possibly, it is one illustration of the lack of economic thinking and planning which has characterised our development since the State was founded.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Moylan has tabled an amendment and I do not know whether he intends to proceed with it. It suggests that instead of the motion which I propose, or the amendment which the Minister proposes, that a select committee consisting, I think, of 15 members of this House should be set up to examine the desirability of this annual target of 25,000 acres. Frankly I think that would be merely placing an additional difficulty in the way causing additional delay.  I would regard it if adopted by the House rather as a side-tracking of the amendment intended to void the efforts of those who had all these assessments and decisions made from time to time setting this target of 25,000 acres a yield a year.</P>
    <P>For goodness' sake, let us get together on that; let us try to ensure that the target is reached and that we get results.  As I said before, we already have an additional 5,000 people employed on forestry.  That is an increase of 3,000 in a short space of time since the present Minister took over.  That is a welcome development, but let me remind the House and the Minister for Agriculture who is looking sceptical and cynical about it that were it nor for that increase we would not even have found the miserly 1,000 additional jobs outside agricultural employment, and that the increase is extremely small in the light of the fact that in a period of five years we succeeded in disemploying a net total of 36,000 people.  If an annual target in <Col N="1333" /> forestry of 25,000 acres a year is pursued actively we will have more than 5,000 people employed and I hope close on 20,000 people employed in forestry. Apart from the direct employment thus created, there will be produced raw material which I hope will provide employment for twice as many and will enable us to increase our produce and our exports, because I think we should aim at planting not merely sufficient to meet our own requirements&mdash;and we import between £16,000,000 and £20,000,000 worth a year at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is purely a question of economics.  It is a matter of whether you get a greater return from using the land for the growing of timber&mdash;purely a matter of mathematics and economics.  However, there are vast areas, on which there are no sheep, quite capable of growing timber. There are also areas, on which there are few sheep, from which a much better return could be got from afforestation.  In many countries agricultural land is being laid down for forestry at the moment.  I am not saying we should adopt that principle.  But we have over 1,000,000 acres of land which is sub-marginal, practically unproductive at the moment.  I should like to see that land utilised, providing the employment that would result from its utilisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very necessary and, I think, a very fair augury that an atmosphere of quietness and deliberation comes into the House when we deal with a motion of this character.  I have a slight touch of the same forestry disease as Deputy MacBride, and I do feel that while the Minister for Agriculture may well and properly make the point that agricultural land should be devoted to agricultural purposes, to the production of agricultural produce readily saleable, we must all know of the tremendous areas of land which could not only <Col N="1335" /> beneficially be planted but, even in the process of their growth, could become immense scenic additions to the countryside.</P>
      <P>Over the years, we have been far too complacent with regard to forestry and I am glad to see both the motion of Deputy MacBride and the amendment of the Minister before the House for discussion.  They show at least that there is a reawakening to what the potential for forestry is.  The Minister for Agriculture seemed to express surprise when Deputy MacBride adverted to the fact that some £15,000,000 to £17,000,000 worth of wood and wood by-products come into this country annually.  It seems to be a terrible travesty on economic planning and sane judgment that we are still importing these immense quantities of wood-pulp for the printing and newspaper industries.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely an unfortunate truism that if there had been any reasonable impetus or concerted effort to develop forestry 30 years ago we would now be living in a period where the huge industrial potential of our forests would be showing reality in the form of absorbing an important part of our labour.  A target of 25,000 acres a year may sound ambitious, but when one examines what the necessary home consumption would be and what potential exports could be it does not sound so tremendous.  There should never be, and I hope it never again will be, political capital made out of forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that it is something which can be deliberately and effectively measured in a materialistic way and a real economic analysis of its value be furnished.  I know that people are asking why are we waiting until now to make this tremendous drive towards reafforestation which some members of the House are now advocating.  Unfortunately for this nation the impetus did not come 30 years ago.  However, there is no doubt about it, if one faces up to the amount of the forest denudation that occurred during the period of the last war and the subsequent rebuilding of the nations after the war, there is a tremendous field for planting not only in <Col N="1336" /> our own country but in many European countries and in Britain as well.</P>
    <P>In a small nation with its recurring problem of unemployment, with its difficulties of seasonal lays off in some branches of industries, with its difficulties of migratory labour as we have in the west, a realist can see that in forestry and in the tackling and development of forestry one can find it an increasing rather than a diminishing benefit because forestry develops from stage to stage.  Once you keep the initial cleaning, planting and weeding going, after years go on you will absorb more and more people into the general development of afforestation. Then you ultimately reach the stage where the forests reach maturity, when you can look forward to the immense employment potential that the matured timber can hold forth.</P>
    <P>If we were ever in difficulties such as were created by the last world war we would at least have the raw material to ensure the continuation of production in many of our timber processing and furniture manufacturing industries. Forestry has inherent in it the giving of employment in such matters as the actual preparation of ground, planting and so on and this employment increases according as the forest grows. Take the congested districts as an example or an area such as I represent. When the forest is coming to maturity you have, instead of the emigrant ship, the drift from the land and the drift to England we have known in the past, permanent employment in the forests and in addition you have families settling down in the area around the forest.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is enthusiastic but enthusiasm is something that can best be gauged by the reality of performance. I want to see the energy and singleness of purpose the Minister purports to have translated into action in the form of plantings and development. I know the Minister and his Department can put up many difficulties and I say deliberately to the Minister that they are cock-eyed in some ways.  There is, for instance their views on what land can or cannot be utilised for planting.  One has only <Col N="1337" /> to examine the temperature and soil in the Scandinavian Peninsula and up to the ice barrier and what has been done there in the matter of forestry to realise that there must be a type of tree adaptable to any type of land in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this matter because the Minister will recall that I had much to say on his Estimate.  However, I feel it is worth while that Deputy MacBride should come in here and give this stimulation and urge for activity to the forestry programme.  We must be realistic.  Any industries we develop in this country must be related as far as possible to the availability of raw materials at home.  Is there any more potential source of raw material than the forest?  In addition, the forest plays a large part in the development of one of this country's invisible assets &mdash;tourism.  There is no part of Ireland in which forestry development has taken place that has not had its scenic appeal enhanced.  One has only to drive through Wicklow, parts of my own county and parts of Tipperary, particularly places where there was formerly barren mountainside, to appreciate that facet of forestry development.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister in relation to the impetus he has given: &ldquo;well done!&rdquo;.  I came into this House and I pilloried the Minister for many a day before we planted in Glengariff. I say now that there has been a tremendous stimulus given in that whole area stretching out into the Beara Peninsula.  Much more land is being offered, inspected and acquired, and much more work is being done.  If the effect of the establishment of that centre in Glengariff can mean so much to that area, I feel like saying to the Minister that the job can be done if he puts the same drive into other areas.  I cannot say&mdash;it would be unfair of me to say it&mdash;that the Minister has not put energy and effort into this development.  He could not have achieved the acreage he has to-day without that, but I want to say&mdash;I said it when speaking on his Estimate, and I think Deputy MacBride's motion clearly indicates it&mdash;that he will find here, as far as his forestry drive is <Col N="1338" /> concerned, tremendous sympathy and support at all times, such as is necessary for the successful conclusion of the job.  I feel we should take this motion and the Minister's amendment in the spirit in which they are offered &mdash;as an earnest of the unanimous desire of the Dáil to give the Minister the green light for the speedy development of the forestry programme.</P>
    <P>Forests are assets.  Year after year you can see them growing to the benefit of the nation and the enhancement of its wealth.  With that picture before our minds there is no Minister&mdash;and certainly not the present Minister&mdash;who will not get from the House all the assistance he requires in the matter of money and legislation to acquire the type of land suitable for forestry.  I do not say that the Minister should make inroads on agricultural land.  The Minister has a wide field of land to plant before the necessity will arise to take one acre of fertile, arable, agricultural land for the purpose of forestry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that I am not the first to sound very critical in the course of this discussion.  So far, we have had a programme of mutual admiration in operation.  For many years I have listened to promises made in this House that a forestry programme at the annual rate of 25,000 acres would be put into operation.  I understand now that there is a decision to arrive at that figure by increasing the present rate by 2,500 acres per annum.  I am almost inclined to demand that that promise be given solemnly on a stack of Bibles.  There was agreement here four years ago on a rate of 25,000 acres.  A thorough investigation was made of our forestry requirements by the Forestry Division. If anybody cares to study the Dáil Debates for the last two or three years he will have no trouble in finding a whole string of arguments made on the basis of the consumption of timber in this country against embarking on a very large afforestation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I may be critical in many of my remarks, I want it to be quite clear that I personally think the mover of this motion should have gone a great deal further.  The mover of this motion <Col N="1339" /> will be a very old man before he sees this 1,000,000 acres planted.  In view of the fact that 30 years have elapsed in which very little was done in regard to forestry, for the next four or five years we should embark on a vast afforestation scheme.  The people are becoming more conscious of the need for forestry.  That is all to the good and the more debates there are in this House on forestry generally, the better from the public point of view.</P>
    <P>The last speaker hesitated to tread on toes but I have no hesitation in jumping on the toes of all Parties in this House for the past 30 years with regard to their afforestation programme&mdash;Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or the first inter-Party Government.  I have listened to excuses being trotted out here about scarcity of netting wire, about destruction of young plants by rabbits, and so on.  There was never any shortage of excuses for not embarking on a larger programme.  Of course, the main reason for not doing so was the dead hand of the Department of Finance.  No matter what Minister was in charge of forestry, no matter how earnest he may have been, he was obstructed or baulked all through the years by the Department of Finance.  When it is a matter of getting money for any worthwhile scheme, the Minister concerned has a tremendous task in getting the necessary money from that Department.</P>
    <P>We have now a unanimous backing in this House for a forestry programme, even though some of us are dissatisfied with the proposed rate.  At least, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to preface my remarks on forestry generally by a quotation from a statement made by one of the most prominent and experienced builders in Ireland, on the question of timber.  I shall not mention his name but I will give it to any Deputy outside the House who wants it.  This builder pointed out that the prices of imported timber of similar quality, on the average, for the five year period 1951-55, inclusive, was 66 per cent. more than that for native timber.  He went on to point out that recently the <Col N="1340" /> Irish wood was of such good quality that he himself used it for joinery and for furniture.  He mentioned the Irish timbers that were used&mdash;beech, elm, sycamore, birch, Scotch pine and spruce.  He pointed out that there are tremendously good prospects for native wood.  He says that if Ireland, as regards timber, is not cursed with the usual inferiority complex, its course is clear&mdash;to grow more timber.  That is a statement by one of the most prominent builders in this country in which he makes a comparison between native timber and imported timber and says that the cost of the imported commodity was 66 per cent. higher than the cost of the native timber.</P>
    <P>Even if, to-morrow, we had enough forests to meet our own requirements, we could still pursue an exportation programme at prices competitive with other countries.  The mistake that is being made all along is that the programme is estimated purely on the minimum requirements of the home market for some years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride pointed out on a percentage basis the contrast between the area under afforestation in Ireland and that in other European countries. In no civilsed country in the world is the ratio for afforestation as low as it is in Ireland.  That has been said 40 times in the House in the last ten or 15 years and it seems to be like a pious hope to get it to sink into the minds of the people who count in this nation.  The area varies in other European countries from 9 per cent. in Denmark up to 65 per cent. and 70 per cent., but the average throughout Europe is 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. Taking it on that basis, even if to-morrow morning we had the 1,000,000 acres of land which is mentioned in this motion planted, we would still have only 6 per cent. of our land under timber in comparison with other European countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture questioned Deputy MacBride here on sheep: was it not more advantageous to have 3,000,000 sheep in the country than to embark on an afforestation programme?  From a man with the ability of the Minister that is an extraordinary statement.  We have seen <Col N="1341" /> throughout the years what the position was in regard to cattle and sheep.  We know how insecure the market for these two live-stock products is.  We know that as far as sheep are concerned, we export the wool and that to-day we are priced out of the British market on much of our products from the land.  Even taking that as part of the argument, much of the land with which the afforestation programme would be concerned is not being used at the moment for the production of sheep.  A great number of the sheep the Minister referred to are bred and reared on some of the best land in the country.  In afforestation land we have not that number of sheep being reared. In the mountain areas we have only a limited number.  All over County Galway, which is one of the best sheep breeding areas in the country quite a large number of the sheep in the locality are bred and reared on the best of land.  That argument does not count.</P>
    <P>Let us take it another way.  There are 17,000,000 acres of land in this country.  Of that 17,000,000, 11,750,000 are supposed to be arable land.  Of the remainder, 3,000,000 acres consist of coarse grazing.  Out of that 5,250,000 that is described as non-arable land there is at least 1,500,000 of that ideally suited for afforestation.  That will not interfere in the slightest with the land that is now described as agricultural, the other 11,750,000 acres; as a matter of fact if this non-arable area or portion of it was planted it would be of immense benefit to the agricultural programme of the country from the point of view of soil conservation, protection, and climate improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride pointed out that the average area planted over the last 30 years was, I think, around 5,000 acres.  Let us have a look at the figures of employed in the afforestation branch.  The number employed indoor and outdoor is around the 5,000 mark. I suggest that in that branch there is an undue proportion in the administrative section and that the administrative section, the Civil Service end of <Col N="1342" /> it, outweighs the advice of technicians and skilful foresters.</P>

      <P>I have to bring it home to the Minister what the position is.  Perhaps I might, on the next motion deal in more detail with regard to the Department itself.  Through the years the Parties in this House and outside it have, to my mind, only paid lip-service to afforestation.  A difficulty has been finance and while no money could be made available or very little for the afforestation programme which would mean immense wealth in years to come, we were able to leave around £460,000,000 in external assets.  We were able, in 1949, to lose 30 per cent. of that 460,000,000 when the British devalued the £.  How would we have fared if that £160,000,000 we lost through a flick of the fingers of Sir Stafford Cripps had been invested in standing timber in Ireland?</P>
      <P>Any Minister for Lands and forestry who has to come before a Minister for Finance should remind him of the lunatic policy pursued by Finance over the years with regard to the wealth of this country, being poured out of it instead of into the soil on projects like forestry.  We have the statement here in recent months that the consumption of timber here would be met by an afforestation programme of 15,000 acres per year.  I presume we have respect for international authorities who are invited here to give us advice in connection with afforestation or anything else.  According to the F.A.O. Report the consumption of timber in Ireland is the lowest per head of any European country.  The basis of this is: Ireland, 1; Britain, 2½; Denmark, 4½; Sweden, 6.  It should be apparent to anyone in this House that when the consumption of timber is so low within the country it means there is a corresponding reduction in the manufacturing and in the employment end and it is in the manufacturing end of the programme that the real employment is given.</P>

      <P>I regret very much having to ask the House to bear with me in connection with the subject matter of question No. 13 on last week's Order Paper.  When I put down this question, I thought there would be no difficulty whatever in getting a favourable reply from the Minister for Education in relation to this matter.  I asked the Minister then:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... why he has deferred his decision in relation to the proposals of the Roscommon Vocational Education Committee in connection with the alteration and extension of the vocational school in Ballaghaderreen, and if, in view of the serious overcrowding in the existing school and the fact that a bank is prepared to provide the necessary financial accommodation, he will issue sanction without further delay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been unable to authorise County Roscommon Vocational Education Committee to proceed with their proposal to alter and extend the vocational school in Ballaghaderreen as it has not as yet been found possible to include it in the limited amount of building projects which vocational education committees generally can be permitted to undertake in present circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the financial difficulties in which the Government finds itself, I would have let the matter rest there but, as the House will note, all the Minister was asked in my question was would he give permission to the Vocational Education Committee to go ahead since the money was being made available by the bank.  Mark you, there was no question of the Vocational Committee coming to the Minister or to the Local Loans Fund and asking for the money to go ahead with this project.  It was merely a matter of the Minister giving his sanction to the committee to go ahead on the basis that a private commercial concern was prepared to give the necessary accommodation.  All the <Col N="1344" /> Minister had to do was sanction the proposal.  He replied that, as far as he was concerned, he could not give permission in view of the fact that this project could not be included in the limited amount of building projects which Vocational Education Committees generally can be permitted to undertake under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Here is the story.  Roscommon Vocational Committee are very anxious, like every other Vocational Committee, to meet the demands of the community in relation to educational facilities.  For a good many years past the people in the Ballaghaderreen area have been pressing for more facilities and the committee decided that the building there needed extension, alteration and enlargement. Plans were prepared.  The existing cloakroom was to be turned into an engineering room and an additional classroom.  The domestic classroom was to be enlarged and likewise the woodworking room.  These plans were essential to facilitate pupils being trained before they were called upon to face the rigours and competition of life, perhaps outside this country.</P>
    <P>The existing building can accommodate 80 pupils.  There are 110 pupils on the rolls this year.  To the regret of the committee and the dismay of parents in the area, 30 pupils had to be refused admission.  That shows the demand that exists and the anxiety locally for vocational education.  The committee prepared plans.  They did not go to the Minister, cap in hand like many other bodies at the present time, for the necessary funds.  They went to the bank.  Lo and behold, the bank agreed to give the financial accommodation necessary, namely, £7,000.  The plans were submitted to the Minister some 18 months ago and the Minister was asked to give permission to the Vocational Committee to carry out the work.  I have quoted the Minister's reply that he could not see his way to including Ballaghaderreen in the current projects.</P>
    <P>If the Vocational Committee were asking the Minister for the money, I could understand him being worried to death, put to the pin of his collar to <Col N="1345" /> get the money for so many other more desirable and more essential projects perhaps.  I could understand him saying to the people in Ballaghaderreen: &ldquo;I regret very much that I shall have to put you on the waiting list.&rdquo;  No such request for money was made to the Minister.  No demand was made on the Local Loans Fund.  The money was being raised from a commercial bank.  I cannot understand the Minister's attitude.  At a time when we can spend up to £750,000 on jet aeroplanes and runways and some £500,000 on palatial foreign embassies, plus considerable sums of money on foreign fuel to heat the Minister's own Department, surely the Minister could see his way to giving permission to the vocational education committee in Roscommon to spend £7,000 on improvement works where a bank was prepared to make the necessary financial accommodation available.</P>
    <P>I could go on here for a week pointing out the extraordinary situation that obtains, with money being flashed around for all sorts of projects.  That is one side of the story.  I want to demonstrate now for the House how little one Minister knows of what another Minister is doing and how little co-ordination there is between one Department and another on a matter of policy.  Prior to the Summer Recess the Minister for Local Government made several speeches here and outside the House appealing to local authorities to get their necessary financial accommodation for building from insurance companies or from banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister wanted to lighten or ease the burden on Government funds and every Deputy in the House is aware of the fact that banks and insurance companies were approached by local authorities on the request of the Minister for Local Government so that Government funds would not be overtaxed.  I want to quote for the benefit of this House a passage which occurs in Volume 156 at column 270 in case anybody thinks I am pulling a long bow.  There was a question on the Order Paper of 9th May, 1956, by Deputy Briscoe in connection with the advance of £4,000,000 to Dublin Corporation <Col N="1346" /> for housing purposes.  The Minister's reply was in effect that a sum of £1,000,000 of the £4,000,000 was being advanced from the Local Loans Fund and he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The balance of the £4,000,000, to the extent that the Corporation are unable to raise it independently from appropriate lending agencies, has been promised by the Government from public funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, Dublin Corporation was told specifically in this House to go to appropriate independent lending agencies to secure the necessary financial accommodation for the construction of houses but that if the Corporation or other local authorities were unable to get money from the banks or insurance companies, then the State itself would make the necessary moneys available.</P>
    <P>Here we have Roscommon Vocational Education Committee, a subsidiary body of Roscommon County Council. It goes along to an independent lending agency, namely, the bank.  The bank makes the money available, £7,000.  The vocational committee was following the advice given by the Minister for Local Government not to overtax Government funds but when the vocational committee applies to the Minister for the sanction to embark on the scheme they are told by the Minister that he cannot sanction the expenditure of this £7,000.  Let us follow the Minister's supplementary replies to some questions that I asked him.</P>
    <P>I queried the Minister in a supplementary question and asked in view of the fact that there would be no great burden on Government funds as a result of the Roscommon project would the Minister explain why he saw fit not to give sanction?  The Minister went on to state that so far as he could see looking at next year's allocations it appeared that if the county council obtained loans through a bank it would be necessary to reduce the amounts available through the Local Loans Fund by that amount.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Does it mean that the Government has control over the private commercial banks?  Does <Col N="1347" /> it mean that if the vocational committee goes in and borrows money from the bank for building purposes that the amount of money that is borrowed will be offset against the amount of money available to the Government in the Local Loans Fund?  If it does, it has disclosed the hidden hand, something that this House has not been aware of in many years, if it means that any money borrowed from a bank would be taken later on from the amount of money made available to the Government by its own banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am endeavouring to control the amount of work that will be done in the extension of vocational schools in relation to the priorities desirable over the country as a whole.  I cannot allow myself to be put in the position that because these banks, from the particular pool of capital in the country, give money that I will be left in my other pocket without that particular amount of money for vocational schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it necessary for the bank to make that amount of money available to Roscommon Vocational Education Committee out of a pool of money within the State?  Has the Minister any information that the particular bank concerned was not prepared to expatriate some of its external assets, some of its investments abroad?  Surely the Minister is not in a position to know from what source a private banking concern would make that money available to the vocational education committee?  What information has the Minister as to how the bank would ensure that the £7,000 would be given to the committee?  Has the Minister inside information as to the workings of the bank, as to the amount of investments abroad that would have to be sold in order to meet that loan of £7,000?  I want an answer on this question from the Minister because it is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>If what the Minister states is true, if it is true that according to the Minister he cannot allow himself to be put in the position that because the banks from a particular pool of capital in the <Col N="1348" /> country make money available to a local authority he will be left in his other pocket without that particular amount of money for vocational schools, then the Minister must have some control in some way over the banks.  There is no other answer.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that the Minister for Local Government has requested local authorities all over the country to go to banks and insurance companies to get money necessary for building.  If the Minister for Local Government makes that plea to local authorities, what the devil does the Minister for Education mean by refusing to sanction a request made to him by such a local authority when they have got satisfactory financial accommodation from a bank?  Can the Minister explain how it is that the Department of Local Government is embarking on one policy while the Department of Education under the Minister's control is blandly and placidly sailing off in the opposite direction?</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly in this matter.  I had hoped that the Minister through the pressure of questions in this House would have seen fit to have put his name on the piece of paper and given the permission but evidently he did not see fit to do so.  Evidently, at the moment, he is prepared to hold up sanction of this scheme on the flimsy excuse that if he gives that particular sanction he will be short of that amount of money out of Government funds.  I suggest that that cannot be correct; the Minister cannot be serious about that suggestion.  He cannot be serious in suggesting to this House that the banks make a loan available to a company or a local authority, or to a statutory body like the vocational committee, if a private commercial concern such as a bank make available to a vocational committee that will interfere with the amount of money the Minister has for the rest of his programme.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister even at this late stage should reconsider his decision and send down permission to the vocational committee, saying &ldquo;God speed the work.&rdquo;  In that way the boys and girls who are now waiting for a chance to get education will <Col N="1349" /> not have to wait that much longer than they will have to wait in consequence of the Minister's decision to defer this very desirable project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with what Deputy McQuillan says in regard to the worthy work of the Roscommon Vocational Education Committee.  With their desire to improve the accommodation in the school at Ballaghaderreen I entirely sympathise.  I would be very glad that these improvements could be carried out.</P>
      <P>The position is that all over the country there are Vocational Education Committees working in the same very earnest spirit, planning in the same very effective way, hoping to improve both the accommodation and the facilities that would be put at the disposal of young people for continuation and vocational education.  It is as the guardian of the general interest of these Vocational Education Committees that I have had to agree that the amount of capital money that will be paid during the current year and during next year for the building of new schools and the extension of present vocational schools will be a limited amount.</P>
      <P>I think it has been well appreciated that in the general capital programme of the country, as far as Government and local authorities are concerned, it is desirable that there would be an understanding as to the amount of capital available that will be used up in that particular way.  I have agreed within certain limits to the amount of capital that will be spent on vocational education buildings.  It is a fact that if a committee borrows from a bank for its construction programme I will not be able to get from the Local Loans Fund the full extent of the capital I may want to help those committees to complete these programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, if I am spending £200,000 next year and some of the committees have approved projects for building, I will be able to draw only £150,000 from the Local Loans Fund.  Accordingly, there is a limit to the amount of money I will allow to be spent on vocational schools this year and next year.  I <Col N="1350" /> want to control the priorities of the schools that will be built because I think the Department is there, and I am there, as the final arbiter as to priorities in school building, to watch the various conflicting applicants for money and to decide on the most urgent cases for additional buildings.</P>
    <P>I have no concern as to how the banks get their money.  I am concerned with the amount of capital available that could reasonably be spent in this way.  As Minister for Education, dealing with a capital programme of a particular kind, I have no control over the banks and do not want to have control over them in any way. I feel sure Deputies will understand that I am not going to allow the banks to be the arbiters of what schemes should get priority because some particular Vocational Committee happened to arrange that they would get £10,000 or £15,000.  Because the banks agree to give them such sums, they are not going to be the people who will get priority in the vocational schools building programme.</P>

    <P>The foods resulting from the forms of production mentioned are of a very different character and are replaceable by each other in a satisfactory dietary only to a limited extent.  In this connection, it has to be kept in mind that a dietary must be adequate in all nutrients, e.g., proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals and vitamins, and that foods cannot, therefore, be judged solely on calorific value. Furthermore, proteins differ in biological value, meat proteins being regarded as superior to vegetable proteins.  Also, the efficiency with <Col N="1209" /> which foods such as grain and potatoes are converted into live-stock products such as meat, milk or eggs depends on the kind of animals fed, as well as on other factors such as housing, health and management.  It must be emphasised, therefore, that, because of the many complicating factors involved, any conclusions or comparisons which can be drawn from the above figures are of limited value.

      <P>The method of selection of tenants of local authority houses and the classes of persons to whom preference shall be given are governed by Sections 29 and 35 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948 (as amended by Sections 28 and 34 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952), and the regulations made thereunder.  The Housing (Management and Letting) Regulations, 1950 and 1953, give effect to the statutory provisions referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state the conditions of payment of tuberculosis allowances by local authorities, and the manner in which such payments are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory conditions governing the payment of an allowance under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1952, to a person suffering from tuberculosis or other specified infectious disease are laid down in Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947, as amended by Section 36 of the Health Act, 1953.  The statutory conditions are that the person:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is suffering from an infectious disease or a disease suspected to be an infectious disease by the chief medical officer of the health authority in whose functional area such person ordinarily resides, and</P>
      <P>(b)  is undergoing treatment therefor to the satisfaction of the chief medical officer of the health authority in whose functional area such person ordinarily resides, and</P>
      <P>(c)  is thereby prevented from making reasonable and proper provision for his own maintenance or the maintenance of his dependents.</P>
      <P>The rates of allowances specified in the Regulations are maximum rates and in determining the rate of allowance payable to an applicant health authorities have regard to the means of the applicant and of his family.</P>
      <P>Allowances granted are, I understand, paid mainly by Paying Order, each week.  Dublin Corporation, however, mostly pays recipients, or persons authorised by the recipients, in cash each week but in some cases the Corporation pays by means of Paying Order when so requested by recipients.</P>
