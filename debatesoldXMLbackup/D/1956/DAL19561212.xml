    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Unemployment Problem.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that the recently announced Government allocation of £1,000,000 will not effectively reduce unemployment which is now running at a higher level than at any time since the war and that unless more effective immediate remedial action is taken, unemployment figures are likely to reach the 90,000 to 100,000 levels early next year, and, if so, if the Government will revise their short-term policy for dealing with the problem and adjust their policies to ensure that there will be no further increase in unemployment pending the implementation of the long-term programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that because of its terms the allocation of £1,000,000 will not result in any improvement in the unemployment figures which are still rising at an alarming rate, and, if so, if he will state what further measures the Government propose to deal with the problem; further, if he will state (a) the maximum unemployment figure which it is anticipated will be reached, and when, and (b) when it is anticipated that the figure will be reduced, and to what extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the apportionment of the additional sum of £1,000,000 which the Government decided to make available for expenditure on certain works during the remainder of the current <Col N="2170" /> financial year&mdash;including large sums for the E.S.B., certain harbour improvement works, the land rehabilitation project, the purposes of the Special Employment Schemes Office, the purposes of the Office of Public Works (including schools), the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, and the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts&mdash; was announced as recently as the 23rd of last month, it would be too early to expect that the allocation would already have been reflected in a significant improvement in the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>While a seasonal increase in the numbers on the live register is usual in the early part of each year, any suggestion as to what the figures may be early in 1957 can only be speculative. The object of the allocation of £1,000,000 is to prevent any such increase in unemployment as is mentioned in Deputy MacBride's question, and the Government are confident that the expenditure of this sum will have an early favourable effect.</P>
    <P>The situation will, in any event, continue to be kept under constant review by the Government, and there will be no delay in considering, if necessary, the practicability of additional short-term measures, pending the results of the Government's long-term programme, as announced by me on the 5th October last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government not realise that if any additional remedies are to be brought into operation now is the time to bring them in, not when the crisis has developed further than it has already developed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fully aware of that.  The Deputy may take it that the Government is very fully aware of all aspects of the unemployment problem and is constantly keeping it under supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask permission, Sir, to raise this question on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, since the allocation of the £1,000,000 announced by the Government, the unemployment figure has been rising at the rate of 1,000 per <Col N="2171" /> week and the emigration figure, so far as can be calculated, at a similar amount?  Is he further aware that the allocation to the special employment schemes and the allocation of £150,000 to Small Dwellings for the whole State is nothing but a method of putting back some of the money which was previously taken away?  In fact, the money allocated to the special employment scheme is still less by 50 per cent. than the sum allocated last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he received recently a deputation from interested parties in the house-building industry; if he will state the nature of the representations made by the deputation; and what decision has been arrived at by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday last, the 5th instant, with the Minister for Local Government, I received a deputation from the Dublin and District House Builders' Association, whose representations related to the subject of the valuation of houses for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  The matter has since been carefully considered by the Government, and it is believed that a solution, in principle, of the problem has been found.  The solution is being worked out in detail with all possible expedition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when the Local Appointments Commission propose to fill the vacancy for medical officer in the Ardagh Dispensary, County Limerick, which has been vacant for a considerable time; and, if in view of the fact that dispensary patients in the area have, as a result of the vacancy, to attend private medical practitioners, the Commission will expedite the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Appointments Commissioners have not, in fact, been requested to recommend, to the local authority concerned, a person for appointment to the post to which the Deputy refers.  Until they are so requested, the commissioners cannot take any steps to fill the vacancy.</P>
      <P>In regard, however, to the statement made in the last part of the question, I have ascertained that the local authority have appointed a temporary medical officer in the dispensary district, and there should therefore be no need for holders of medical cards in the district to attend private practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the information contained in the latter part of his reply is not correct? While there may be a temporary officer doing the work or employed by the local authority, the fact remains that the people who would ordinarily go to the dispensary for treatment are now obliged to go to private practitioners and have to pay them fees for the services they are receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that there has been no break whatever in the occupancy of the post between the resignation of the former dispensary medical officer and the appointment of the temporary medical officer.  The <Col N="2173" /> former officer resigned on the 4th May and on that date a temporary officer took up duty and has been on duty ever since.  There would appear to be no reason why there should be any necessity for the state of affairs which the Deputy alleges exists.</P>

Imports of seed barley in the same period amounted to 100,868 cwt. comprising 63,140 cwt. from Denmark, 37,023 cwt. from Britain and 705 cwt. from Sweden.

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will ascertain from Bord Fáilte Éireann whether they have any arrangements for recouping losses incurred by Tóstal councils in organising the activities of An Tóstal on behalf of An Bord; and, in particular, whether they propose to recoup Wexford Tóstal council in respect of the heavy loss which they have incurred, bearing in mind that legal action may be taken against the council by various traders for recovery of debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the organisation of An Tóstal is a matter for Bord Fáilte Éireann and that I do not intervene in the details of the arrangements made by the Board in discharge of this function.</P>
      <P>However, I am informed that it is the policy of the Board that the organisation of An Tóstal must be based on local initiative, effort and financial support.  Responsibility for the organisation and presentation of local programmes rests with the local Tóstal councils or other groups concerned. The Board correlates and publicises the programmes so organised and, as an incentive to local effort, is prepared to entertain applications by local groups for financial sponsorship in certain cases.  Such sponsorship, where given, takes the form of grants or guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, in the case of Wexford, the local Tóstal council committed itself to the holding of an International Boxing event before it requested the Board to sponsor the project financially.  The council was informed that the Board did not consider the event worthy of the support sought; but, on special consideration, the Board agreed to give a financial <Col N="2176" /> guarantee up to a certain limit.  In doing so, the Board made it abundantly clear that the amount of the guarantee would not be exceeded in any circumstances. The council accepted, in writing, the terms of the guarantee and decided to proceed with the organisation of the event.  It must, therefore, accept responsibility for any loss incurred on the event in excess of the sum guaranteed by the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the very steep fall in the volume of production of our manufactured industries is extremely alarming and will he not make a fresh assessment of the causes for this fall?  I think that at the time that he and the Minister for Finance gave the reply the latest figures were not then available, at least not to the House. Whether they were available to the Minister or not, I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy waits to look at the statistical information which I am making available to him, he will see the areas in which there have been increases in unemployment. Some of these increases are probably due to seasonal causes.  Others are due to causes which, probably, the Deputy will be able to assess to some considerable extent himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it essential that he and the Government should have a clear assessment themselves and should be in a position to assess the causes of this most alarming fall in both production and employment and, further, can the Minister state whether he considers it possible to secure an expansion of production and industrial employment while a restricted credit policy is being pursued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The credit policy, as I have indicated to the Deputy on a previous occasion, is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy will see, when he looks at this table, that there is an assessment of the extent of the unemployment in certain industries but not all of those are industries which concern Industry and Commerce alone.  A number of these industries concern agriculture but are nevertheless brought under the heading of transportable goods because what is produced, although it may be an agricultural commodity, is transportable goods for the purpose of our record.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, 1955, my nominees on the G.N.R. Board recommended that in view of the uncertain state of public transport in the Six Counties area there should be no change in the existing transport arrangements in County Donegal for a period of 12 <Col N="2181" /> months from that date, when the matter would be reconsidered and a further report submitted by them.</P>
    <P>It would not, in my view, be either practicable or desirable to come to any decisions on the subject of transport in Donegal until the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport has been received and considered and also until the future pattern of the G.N.R. cross-Border services has emerged.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, it is my intention to give the local interests concerned an opportunity to express their views before any final decisions are taken in the matter.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the announcement in the public Press last Saturday that supplementary allowances of petrol will be granted to doctors, veterinary surgeons, clergymen, commercial travellers, midwives and nurses and that supplementary allowances will be made to firms engaged in the car rental business.  Supplementary allowances will also be given to disabled drivers and to taxi operators.  It was announced at the same time that applications from other categories of private motorists will be considered where the applicants can show beyond doubt that the use of a motor-car is absolutely essential to enable them to earn their livelihood or to perform their business and that it is not possible for them to make alternative arrangements.  It will not be possible to meet requirements in full in these cases, but some supplementary allowance will be granted.</P>

      <P>and <b>Cunningham</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the cessation of operations at Labadish starch factory, County Donegal, and, if so, whether he is taking any steps to enable the immediate recommencement of work in order to facilitate farmers and to give employment to workers over the Christmas period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by Ceimicí Teo. that the processing of the total quantities of potatoes delivered at Labadish starch factory has almost been completed and that, in the absence of further supplies to enable the factory to keep working at full capacity, it is necessary to cease operations.  It has been announced however by the company that the factory will be reopened at a later date, provided sufficient supplies of potatoes are available.  I have been assured by the company that they will maintain as many as possible of the factory workers in employment over the Christmas period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the proper steps were taken in the past few months to ensure a sufficient supply to maintain production in the factory over the Christmas period?  My information locally is that that is not the case and that is one of the reasons why this question is addressed to the Minister now.  My information is that that was not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2183" /> In fact, instead of encouraging supplies, supplies were discouraged from coming in during the past few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain supplies were not discouraged.  In fact, I know the company sent a representative to visit persons who had potatoes to warn them to send them in. That is the information conveyed to me.  But potatoes have not arrived and the factory cannot continue in operation unless it has potatoes to process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether, when talking of a representative being sent around to ask the farmers for potatoes, he would ascertain whether or not such representative called only on those people who had contracted to grow specifically for delivery to the factory?  There are many more growers outside of the contractual growers, and the amount of potatoes which could be procured from them is very much greater, but the emphasis was on those who had contracted to grow rather than on potato growers generally throughout the county.  The representative who was sent around did not take that into consideration and that is one of the reasons why we feel proper encouragement was not given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Donegal farmers is as hardheaded a business man as anybody else and, if he is satisfied that the price is a good one and he knows the factory is there, I see no reason why he should wait to be coaxed into sending his potatoes to the factory.  Advertisements appeared in the local papers on 17th November and again on 24th November advising farmers to send in their potatoes immediately.  The second advertisement told them the last date for delivery would be 26th November though, in fact, the company took potatoes after that date.  The fact remains, however, that the factory cannot operate unless it gets potatoes, and the only people who have got potatoes convenient for processing are the farmers in Donegal.  If they will now send in their potatoes the factory wheels will turn again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the price and terms of payment at which Tea Importers, Limited, have secured supplies in India during the current year; and what payments in respect of such supplies are outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. I have already had occasion in recent weeks in reply to questions in Dáil Éireann to draw attention to the fact that the private affairs of commercial concerns cannot be made the subject of questions and answers in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that, in so far as the purchase of tea is concerned, Tea Importers Ltd. act as a commercial concern.  The transactions to which the Deputy refers are commercial transactions in the fullest sense and I think that, on the face of it, it would be improper to furnish the information asked for.  Indeed, the Board of Tea Importers Ltd. have advised me that were such information to be made public they would be placed at a disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> other buyers in the world markets.</P>
      <P>I may say, however, that the bulk of the company's requirements is obtained in public sale and that the price is governed by the demand in the particular auction.  The terms of sale are as laid down in the rules or the terms and conditions of sale of the organisation holding the auctions. Where tea is bought privately the price is the subject of bargaining and negotiation as are also the terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis on which the tea is bought is such that at any point of time it may be said that the company would <Col N="2185" /> probably owe for one week's purchases. The amount of the payments outstanding would, of course, vary according to the scale of the buying in the previous week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister then declines to give the information.  Will the Minister say whether, for some of the transactions of that concern, it is necessary from time to time for the Minister to give ministerial approval or sanction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Tea Importers is concerned, it is a State-sponsored body.  It operates for the purpose of purchasing and distributing tea and the only thing for which it comes to the State from time to time is for guarantees for the money which it needs to carry on its activities.  It ought to get a chance of carrying on its activities without being nagged at in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does exercise ministerial acts in the nature of guarantees and decisions.  Is that the fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The fact is that the State guarantees the moneys which Tea Importers require to finance them in the purchasing of tea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together. I would refer the Deputies to the answers given in Dáil Éireann on 7th November, 1956, to a question regarding turf briquettes supply.  I am advised by Bord na Móna that the difficulties which have arisen with regard to the supply of turf briquettes are due solely to the fact that demand is greatly in excess of the productive capacity of the board's Lullymore factory.  Production of briquettes at Lullymore was increased from 35,000 tons in 1953-54 to almost 41,000 tons in 1955-56.  In the present year it is expected that up to 50,000 tons will be produced.  As this is the maximum capacity of the Lullymore factory it will not be possible to cater adequately for the increased demand until such time as the new briquetting factories which the Government have decided should be established come into operation. Each of these will be capable of producing 100,000 tons of briquettes a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister see if some arrangement could be made whereby, while supplies are limited, some supplies will be released as far as possible to city dwellers who have no <Col N="2187" /> means of storing fuel?  The position is so bad in Dublin at present that many poor people and those living in flats have been without fires recently.  If the weather becomes more severe the position of these people will be very bad indeed.  If the supplies are limited, would it be possible during the emergency period, to release briquettes which normally go to industrial consumers or institutions which would possibly have alternative sources of supply, to these poor people?</P>

      <P>There is no record of ten labourers having been discharged due to redundancy on the 10th September, 1956.  It is thought, however, that the Deputy's question may refer to six labourers who were employed with the corps of engineers in Dublin and who were discharged due to redundancy on the 21st September, 1956.  One of these labourers has since been re-employed.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  In view of the magnificent response by the Irish people to the appeal for funds in aid of the distressed people of Hungary, it seems unlikely that any subvention from State funds will be necessary.  Should such a necessity arise, however, the Taoiseach has already made it clear in several public statements that the Government will be prepared to make the necessary funds available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Private Motorists' Protection Association was in communication with my Department from 1953 to early 1955 concerning their desire to secure international recognition as a National Motoring Association. Representations to have the association accepted as an affiliated member were made to the two international <Col N="2201" /> organisations concerned, namely, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, Paris, and the Alliance Internationale de Tourisme, Geneva.  In reply, each of the organisations explained that it already had an affiliated member in this country and that, in principle, it preferred to have only one member in each country. The application of the association was consequently rejected.  The position was fully explained in a letter sent by my Department to the secretary of the association on the 12th February, 1955.  Since then no further representations concerning triptyques have been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that what is known as the P.M.P.A. is now the largest Irish motoring association in Ireland and that, in spite of that, they are not in a position to issue triptyques but that it is essential for any Irish motorist who wishes to obtain a triptyque to apply to and join a British association in order to get a triptyque? Would the Minister not agree that the time is ripe for the Department of External Affairs to ensure that this national association, namely P.M.P.A., will be given at least equal rights within the State with the A.A. or the R.I.A.C., both British organisations?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure has come to me as something in the nature of a shock.  I do not think it will be challenged that I am always prepared to welcome any progressive measure that will increase our output in agriculture and industry, but for the life of me I cannot see how a measure such as this will have any bearing whatever <Col N="2213" /> on increasing our industrial output and consequently have an effect on our economy as a whole.  To my mind this measure was conceived in a panic, and if proof of that statement were needed, it is to be found in the Taoiseach's replies to two questions on to-day's Order Paper from Deputies O'Malley and MacBride.</P>
      <P>The Minister's aim is to increase industrial production throughout the State.  I maintain that the main result of this Bill will be to kill any industrial initiative that has been apparent in the West of Ireland.  When the Undeveloped Areas Bill came before the House in 1951 I welcomed it, although I described it at the time as an inadequate measure, unfit and incapable of dealing with the problems in the West. At the same time I welcomed it, as did most Deputies, on the basis that it was a step in the right direction and, in so far as it would give employment and induce industrialists into the western areas, it was to be welcomed by the House.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a deliberately thoughtout attempt to sabotage the Undeveloped Areas Act.  That is very strong language to use.  Through the use of quotations I propose to bring it home to the House that, if it is not a panic measure, then it was thought out for the purpose of sabotaging the provisions of an Act already in operation and doing a certain amount of good in the West.  The Minister can have whichever interpretation he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this other measure came before the House there was nothing but jealousy and envy displayed on the part of Deputies, particularly Labour Deputies, at the terms of that Bill.  I was horrified to find the Minister himself, Deputy Corish, as he was then, Deputy Desmond and other Deputies criticising the Undeveloped Areas Bill although that Bill was designed to help the West of Ireland which is a neglected area.  For years a number of Deputies from the West had been pressing that some measure be brought in to deal with the special problems existing there.  I will not say that the Undeveloped Areas Act was an answer to their prayers but at any rate it was an indication on the part of the Government <Col N="2214" /> that these special problems did obtain there and legislation was introduced for the purpose of remedying them as far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Norton thought that the measures that were being introduced for the West at the time were of no benefit, that no extra employment would be given as a result of those measures.  Deputy Norton is on record as stating:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The West is mainly a trading and pastoral area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite evident that he is of the opinion that the West is an aboriginal country where the natives trade skins and live by moving sheep from the mountains to the plains.  He describes it as &ldquo;a trading and pastoral area.&rdquo; He said, at column 900, Volume 128 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...and it will be extremely difficult to induce the ordinary private person to establish industries in the West, even with the facilities provided in this particular section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was referring to the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  Deputy Norton, now Minister for Industry and Commerce, went on to say in the same debate:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our main desire is to ensure that the Bill is utilised to the fullest extent as a means of planting industries in the West.  ...We in the Labour Party seek to supplement private enterprise by State activities. We believe that a combination of both will give the West more industries than they will get by a reliance on private enterprise alone.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That quotation is from a speech made by Deputy Norton in support of an amendment introduced by Deputy Desmond in which Deputy Desmond sought, not alone to give grants to industrialists in the West to set up factories, but sought from this House power to be granted to the Industrial Development Authority so that that body itself could set up factories and start industries going.  In other words, they were not content with the measure as introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Lemass, but they <Col N="2215" /> wanted to improve it by making sure that the State would have power to start the industries through the organisation that was to be set up by the Industrial Development Authority if private enterprise did not come forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I quote this for the Deputy?&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If the real purpose of this Bill is to improve the economic and social conditions of those of our people who reside on the Atlantic seaboard <Col N="2216" /> then I welcome it as a move in the right direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Make the best you can of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister said that.  I do not deny that that is on the records of the House but I am quoting what the Minister said.  According to him and his colleague, Deputy Desmond, the powers in the Bill were not sufficient to give the necessary industrial drive in the West and, consequently, he and Deputy Desmond felt that it was necessary to introduce amendments to that Bill in the hope that the measure would be improved.  That amendment by Deputy Desmond was not accepted.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that a certain amount of good was done by the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Minister himself was the first to admit it in this House in the last few weeks when he pointed out, in an answer to some Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches, that under the inter-Party Government more money was spent in the West of Ireland under the Undeveloped Areas Act than was ever spent under Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, the Minister must have an idea that the Act was doing good.  He felt some interest in it when he went down on a few occasions, one in particular, to Sligo, to the opening of a factory the establishment of which was helped by a substantial grant from An Foras Tionscal.  Therefore, the Act was doing good.  I wonder how many new factories will be established in the West of Ireland as a result of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is anxious to point out that he wanted the Bill to be a success. I want to put on the records of the House that Deputy Corish's interjection on the Bill that was introduced to help the West was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Bill should be entitled &lsquo;To Hell or to Connacht&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that does not display envy that Connacht was getting something that Deputy Corish's part of the country was not getting, I do not know what it portrays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Dillon at the time had the view that the Undeveloped Areas Bill was all wrong for the West <Col N="2217" /> and that all that should be given to any new industrial project was a loan, that the people who were looking for help should get loans, not grants.  If that was his view at that time in connection with the West of Ireland, which needed special treatment, how can he reconcile it with the fact that, to-day, when he is a Minister, his colleague introduces legislation that will enable industrialists all over Leinster, in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere, to get substantial grants, in spite of the opposition displayed by Deputy Dillon to the Undeveloped Areas Bill, when he suggested that only interest-free loans should be made available to anyone who wished to start an industry in the West?</P>
    <P>The whole situation shows how little thought has been given by the Cabinet as a whole to the implications of this measure.  I shall not bore the House by quoting what Deputy Dillon said at the time.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Deputies whose areas were not included in the Undeveloped Areas Act that, in no circumstances, do I begrudge the fact that substantial aid will be given to these localities.  I do not want to be misrepresented on that.  I know now&mdash; it is not just a suspicion; it is a conviction&mdash;that this measure, if it passes through this House, will have a serious detrimental effect on development in the West of Ireland.  I do not believe that the Deputies from the other provinces would like to see that happening as a result of legislation here. Deputy Carew in a very reasonable contribution to this debate pointed out that places like Limerick will be entitled to get substantial grants for the establishment of new industries. He said that he himself is a director of an industry and he pointed out that under the terms of this Bill in relation to a project which would cost £75,000 in Limerick, up to £50,000 would now be made available as a State grant towards the establishment of such a project.</P>
    <P>Let us compare that situation with what is happening in the West.  Let us take any small town in the province of Connacht where the people are miles from the seaboard, where conditions <Col N="2218" /> are poor, where unemployment is rife, where the technical know-how is nil.  Let us see how they stand in relation to grants.  Supposing an industrial project was mooted for the town of Castlerea, a project costing £75,000 like the one Deputy Carew spoke of, the fact of the matter is that the greatest amount of money that would be made available by way of State grant to establish that industry would be 50 per cent. of £75,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that under the provision of the Undeveloped Areas Act it is possible to give more.  I am putting it on record now that the maximum grant given in any case in the West of Ireland to a new industry has been not more than 50 per cent.  A project, therefore, starting in Castlerea at a cost of £75,000 would receive a maximum grant of £37,500 while, in Limerick, according to Deputy Carew, under the Minister's new Bill, the maximum grant will in future be £50,000.  Where is there any incentive to an industrialist or to a group of industrialists to start a new industry in the West?  Is it not a fact that, with the grants now being made available, every industrialist will, if he can possibly manage it, move into Dublin? There is no incentive to him under this measure to get away from Dublin.  He will not get a penny more by taking his industry away from Dublin.</P>
    <P>Over the last 15 years we have heard this Minister and that Minister and the other Minister preaching about the desirability of decentralisation and the necessity for getting industries established away from the City of Dublin because Dublin is regarded as being top-heavy.  The effect of this legislation will be to entice industry away from the West and the South, and elsewhere, and induce it into Dublin City. Deputy Lemass said that he was prepared to give the Minister this Bill.  I cannot stop the Minister getting the Bill but I appeal now to the 24 other Deputies from the West of Ireland and the congested areas.  I ask them seriously will they let this legislation through?  Will they permit legislation to be passed which will undo the benefits that have been conferred on the West under the Undeveloped Areas <Col N="2219" /> Act?  For years, the West has been neglected by all the political Parties. For years Deputies have fought to get special measures through this House to stem emigration and yet, when emigration is at its highest and unemployment is rife, we have legislation introduced here which will have the effect of drawing industry away from the West.  Will the 24 other Deputies from the West be a party to such legislation?</P>
    <P>In case those Deputies from the West are under any misapprehension may I point out to them that the purpose of the Undeveloped Areas Act was &ldquo;to ensure that industrial enterprise in the West will be at no disadvantage in competition with similar enterprise in the East&rdquo;?  That Act brought a certain amount of benefit to the West.  It would have brought more as time went on.  Is it not a fact that if grants up to 50 per cent. of the cost are now made available in the East that will have the effect that industry in the West will start at a disadvantage, if it starts at all?  This is not a Party matter.  This is not a matter of Fianna Fáil versus Fine Gael.  It is a matter on which the Deputies from the West, members of all Parties in this House, should get together to ensure that the Minister will take the necessary steps to safeguard the good work that has been done up to the present in the West.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to say at this stage that he will safeguard the Undeveloped Areas Act by extending the grants and making them 75 per cent. minimum now, thereby ensuring that the inducement to the East will no longer prevail, I will be prepared to agree that his intention is not to do harm to the West of Ireland.  Even if it is his intention to do the best he can under this Bill, he will do harm to the West if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to know that so far as the Undeveloped Areas Act is concerned, up to 50 per <Col N="2220" /> cent. of the total cost is given.  Grants have been given of 70 per cent. for specific purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister who is wrong.  The grants are on the basis of the construction of the building, the cost of machinery and the cost of training staff.  The Minister knows perfectly well that the grant is worked out on that basis.  I have been present on a number of occasions with An Foras Tionscal to argue out the pros and cons of what the grant should be. In relation to other projects, I made very careful inquiries and I have found that in no case did the Minister give grants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not give them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are given by An Foras Tionscal on his behalf.  No grant was given that amounted to 100 per cent. of the cost of the project.  I am not aware of any such grants and I would like if the Minister would give us some information when he is replying to this debate if such grants were given in the West of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twelve months ago I asked the Minister, in a parliamentary question, if he was aware of the conditions in Roscommon, Castlerea and Boyle and if he was prepared to bring in legislation to enable the Industrial Development Authority to do something for these towns.  His reply was that, as far as he was concerned, any development committees in these towns should send on to him or to An Foras Tionscal particulars as regards sites, money available and employment conditions. He said that if any suitable project to meet conditions in these towns was put he would pass such project on to the towns.  That was the position 12 months ago.  These towns found it hard enough at that stage to get any industrial projects.  I ask the Minister what chance will they have of getting an industry now when a man in the City of Dublin can get 50 per cent. of the cost of a project?  Is such a man going to bother to go down to Roscommon, Mayo or Galway to start <Col N="2221" /> an industry when he can get 50 per cent. of the cost to start one in Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, two-thirds of the cost of starting it in Dublin.  The situation is fantastic and I only hope that Deputies from Roscommon, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal and Kerry will awaken to the fact, before this measure has gone through the House, of the damage that is being done to the congested and undeveloped areas.  We have had a lot of talk and ballyhoo about saving the Gaeltacht.  A new Minister has been appointed within the last few months to ensure that the language will be preserved by taking the necessary steps in the industrial and economic sphere.  The first thing that a colleague of that new Minister does is to give facilities to the East of Ireland that are at least as attractive to industrialists as those that have been given in the West.</P>
      <P>I do not see how the Government can reconcile their anxiety about conditions in the West of Ireland and their desire to stop emigration with the introduction of a measure such as this.  Are they prepared to say that they have no policy for the West and that they would prefer to see industrial development taking place around Dublin?  They should let us know if that is so.  It might not be a bad policy, but let us know if it is the policy of the Government.  My personal belief is that if a man can get employment within the State, even if it is not in his own town and even if he has to go 100 miles to another town to get it, he would be better off to get it in Ireland than to have to go abroad. I want to know if there is any kind of prepared plan thought out by the Government as to how industrial development is to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure has been popped in here to the House and the implications of it are those that I have pointed out. Whatever good was done under the Undeveloped Areas Act is now finished.  This present Bill cancels out the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I hope that Deputies from the West of Ireland <Col N="2222" /> will intervene in this debate to ensure that, so far as it lies within their power, the Minister will take alternative steps by the introduction of some new measure or measures, to counteract the effect that this Bill will have on the West as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one small point that I would like to make in regard to this Bill and I think that it has been made already.  In the form in which the Bill is, it will undoubtedly have the effect mentioned by previous speakers.  Is the Bill the best method for the promotion of industrial activity?  It does not strike me as being the best method particularly in certain areas.  Rather does it strike me as being the reverse.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan has exercised himself with regard to the detrimental effect of this Bill on western areas and perhaps by implication he suggests that the Leinster areas would correspondingly benefit.  I think there is an awful lot in what has been said about the damage that will be done to the West but, as far as I can see, there will be no compensating advantage to the East.  The giving of grants without some specific and substantial reason must have a stifling effect on enterprise in the industrial sphere. What it will boil down to is that nobody will start a business or an industrial concern in the areas which Deputy McQuillan thought would benefit unless they get a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to administering legislation of this nature there will be a lot of heart searching with regard to the provision of grants.  In respect of the undeveloped areas you have specific circumstances which would justify the provision of grants, but in the eastern areas people are going to fall back on the grants and there will be no use of their own initiative.  Will the Minister be prepared to give grants on such a generous scale that there will be no inhibitions arising from that?  Quite apart altogether from the record of the Tánaiste and his Government with regard to delaying tactics in the provision of grants, can you visualise any Government that would be prepared to rubber stamp the <Col N="2223" /> issue of loans such as is visualised here?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the fact that certain loans are available will become a <i>sine qua non</i> in the development of industry.  People applying for these loans will find themselves sewn up in the administrative details.  People who might quite legitimately consider that there is an opening for them will now have to ask themselves whether they qualify for a grant and, if they do not qualify, will a grant be given to somebody else in a comparable position which would render their own project uneconomic.  I agree with the people who say that this Bill seems to be a rather ill-conceived piece of legislation. I think the interpretation put on it by Deputy Lemass in his opening statement, reported at column 1944, Volume 160 of the Official Report, is the only possible interpretation.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, as the matter has been so thoroughly ventilated, all I will say is that this does not seem to be a well-thought-out scheme.  It will suffer from many of the disadvantages mentioned by Deputy McQuillan. Instead of being a help, it may very well prove to be a hindrance.  What is fundamentally lacking is the failure to appreciate that the procedure adopted on former occasions is not, for certain vital reasons, generally applicable in the simple form in which it would apply to this Bill.  Quotations and references to the Undeveloped Areas Act can be applied to the general background of this Bill only with a certain amount of discrimination.  I think there is not an awful lot to commend this effort, and apart from commendation, which is beside the point, I have very grave doubts whether this type of legislation will prove of great benefit in the promotion of industrial activity here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate on this measure and while I can see the point of view of Deputy McQuillan and of others like him from the West, I think it would be only fair they should consider what has been the position heretofore.  From time to time all of us have taken deputations to the <Col N="2224" /> Department of Industry and Commerce consisting of people who were anxious to start industries here.  We have had the galling experience of somebody pointing out a blue area on a map and saying: &ldquo;If you are prepared to start there, you will get substantial grants but, if you do not, you will get nothing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the people of the West, although sympathy is of very little use to them.  However, as Deputy McQuillan and other Deputies from the West of Ireland know, people from the West have been getting their share and, in my opinion, more than their share over the years.  They have been given preference in this, that and the other.  My own constituency has a grouse over land division because they see people from the West getting preference there too.</P>
      <P>I think it is only fair that the people who live in areas outside the congested districts should get a chance; I feel that when industrialists come along they should be given some opportunity of starting new industries in areas other than the West if they so desire. The law as it stands gives quite a substantial advantage to the congested districts.  The people who want to take advantage of the benefits available in the West can still do so.  There will be plenty of people who will be willing to take advantage of the benefits that exist.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I think there is no reason at all why something should not be done to encourage industries in areas such as that in which I live, not talking at all about Dublin City.  From time to time all of us representing country constituencies have complained about industries starting in Dublin.  We have overlooked the fact that one-fifth of the country's population live in Dublin at the present time, a great many of them unemployed.  Nobody would begrudge those people an opportunity of getting a day's work if it could be provided for them.</P>
      <P>Possibly when this Bill becomes law, we shall find an influx of people anxious to start industries.  One section of the Bill lays down that the type of industry to be started must be one not at present in operation in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2225" /> The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I think only industries of a new type will be considered.  I would appeal to the Minister that, when the Bill becomes law, if people come along asking for facilities to start industries they should get early attention.  I know quite well the people in the Department of Industry and Commerce are up to their eyes in routine work.  I will not propose there should be another Minister appointed for the purpose of looking after new industries, but I think we could get rid of a great deal of the red tape, the green tape, or any other colour tape so that people who are anxious to start new industries would be able to do so with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>When an industrialist makes an application there are long delays because inquiries of all sorts have to be made in various parts of the world.  Those people are left kicking their heels for long periods.  I am not blaming the Minister or the Department, but that has been the practice down through the years, not alone in our Department of Industry and Commerce but in similar Departments throughout the world. There is this system of taking things easy in the hope that to-morrow they would appear in a different light.  I think that in this Bill the Minister has taken a step which will make a general improvement in industrial development. I would appeal to him that, when the Bill becomes law, applications for the establishment of new industries would be dealt with as quickly as possible. If there is an unavoidable delay people should be told the reason for the delay and the soonest possible time they can expect a definite decision.</P>

      <P>I think there has been a good deal of misconception in connection with this Bill.  It is hard to imagine, if Deputy McQuillan read the provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Act, that he could be guilty of so many misrepresentations in his attempt to describe what the Act does. As far as the Undeveloped Areas Act is concerned, I think I am entitled to clear up some misrepresentations, or attempted misrepresentations, of my position in connection with that Bill <Col N="2226" /> when it was discussed in the House. Speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill, as reported at column 492 of the Official Report for December 6th, 1951, I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the real purpose of this Bill is to improve the economic and social conditions of those of our people who reside on the Atlantic seaboard, then I welcome it as a move in the right direction.  The problem along the Atlantic seaboard is a very old problem.  It is deep-seated and widespread.  Generations of oppression, generations of neglect, poor land, shallow land and no industries have given us the problem of the western seaboard as we know it to-day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Anybody who cares to follow my speech through will see it was one of support for the Bill, expressing here and there doubts as to whether or not it would succeed in producing any miracle changes as far as the West was concerned.  I concluded with this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In so far as this Bill will make a contribution to relieving that situation, to improving the social and economic conditions of the people along the western seaboard I most heartily welcome it in so far as it makes that genuine effort.  I would be prepared to make all the money necessary even in excess of £2,000,000 available to the board realising that we are expecting the board to undo in a relatively short time all the neglect and to reverse the process which has been in operation for generations.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I said at the outset, I do not think there is any one solution to the problem there.  I think substantial alleviation should be found and will be found by getting a number of agents to co-operate to relieve the problem.  But the problem is there and I think everybody concerned with relieving it and relieving the plight of these people will welcome a Bill of this kind especially if it is used as a genuine effort to face up to a problem which is a challenge to the existence of this House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In face of those two obviously enthusiastic statements in support of <Col N="2227" /> the Undeveloped Areas Bill, Deputy McQuillan sets himself the task of trying to prove that I was opposed to that measure.  He carefully omits those two quotations and tries to give the impression that this is a method now of wreaking a vengeance which did not exist on the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  Every fair-minded Deputy will agree that I supported that Bill realistically and in terms which did not permit of any misunderstanding of my position.</P>
    <P>So far as the implementing of the Undeveloped Areas Act is concerned, I think my record in this field is a pretty creditable one.  Let me give the House some information.  In the year 1952-53&mdash;I shall take even thousands of pounds for convenience&mdash;approval was given for £104,000; in 1953-54, £129,000; in 1954-55, to June, 1954, £140,000.  This makes a total for these two and a half years of £375,000.  This Government came into office then. From the 2nd June, 1954, to the end of that year it made available £79,000. In the year 1955-56, it made available £301,000.  In the year 1956-57 to the 3rd December, 1956, it made available £517,000.</P>
    <P>If you want to make a calculation so far as approvals are concerned, in the period 1952-53, 1953-54, 1954-55, up to the 2nd June, 1954, approvals amounted to £373,000.  Since then and under this Government they have amounted to £890,000, a very substantial increase on the previous operations.  Now let me refer to payments in each of the years.  In the years 1952-53, 1953-54 and 1954-55, to the 2nd June, 1954, total payments were £69,000.  Since the 2nd June, 1954, the total payments amounted to £232,000.</P>
    <P>Anyone who tries to say that the Government was endeavouring to sabotage the Undeveloped Areas Act or was not encouraging the fullest expansion of activities under the Undeveloped Areas Act will have these figures to confront them, to confuse and confound them.  I am as much in favour of the Undeveloped Areas Act to-day as I was when I voted for it and I propose to continue in favour of the <Col N="2228" /> Act and to continue to give every possible assistance in the full implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Act is due for renewal, I think, in 1958.  If we are contemplating continuance of that activity, the renewal of the Act will have to take place much earlier than that because some people would require to know just where they stood under the Act and others would want to feel that, if the Act came to an end, the authority to help them to develop industries in the undeveloped areas did not die with the lapsing of the Act.  I have had under consideration the question of recommending to the Government not only the continuance of the Act but making more and still more money available to continue that measure. Therefore, there is no reason, unless somebody wants to do political mischief, why anybody should be afraid that the activities under the Undeveloped Areas Act are being curtailed in any way.  More and more money is being paid out and more and more approvals are being given.  It is my hope that the Act will be continued and that more and more money will be provided to continue it.</P>
    <P>What does the Act do?  Deputy McQuillan made a comparison which I think was a grossly unfair comparison. He took one case where a factory got 50 per cent. and he said that if you put up that factory anywhere else besides Castlerea you could now get 66? per cent. automatically.  An Foras Tionscal has power to make grants up to 100 per cent. of the cost of the buildings. It has power to make grants of 50 per cent. of the cost of the machinery.  It also has power to make a contribution towards the training of workers.  All this is subject only to one thing and that is only a temporary limitation removable at ease by this House, that they can do all that within a maximum expenditure of £2,000,000.  No doubt when the £2,000,000 mark is reached the Minister will come to the House and say: &ldquo;I want more money because the original allocation has been used up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position under An Foras Tionscal.  What does this Bill <Col N="2229" /> do?  This Bill enables a grant to be given towards the cost of the buildings and it is subject to an absolute maximum of £50,000 or two-thirds of the cost of the building, whichever is the lesser.  Somebody obviously needs a lesson in simple arithmetic if they cannot see the difference between a scheme which permits a grant to be made of 100 per cent. of the cost of the building, 50 per cent. of the cost of the machinery and a grant towards the training of workers, and a scheme which permits as a maximum 66? per cent. of the cost of the building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as An Foras Tionscal is concerned, it has power to do that.  So far as this body is concerned, it will have power to do it. The powers in each case are the same. This body may not give an industry 66? per cent. of the cost of a factory. It has power to do it as An Foras Tionscal has power to give 100 per cent.  An Foras Tionscal may say it does not think the circumstances justify a 100 per cent. grant and this body may take the view in a given set of circumstances that a 66? per cent. grant is not justified.  For the purposes of making a comparison, Deputy McQuillan surely ought to have compared like with like and he obviously did not do it, as these figures indicate.</P>
      <P>A number of questions have been raised on this debate and some of the speeches have really answered the others.  Deputy Lemass opened by playing down the Bill as much as he could and finally wound up by saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister can have his Bill as far as I am concerned but I want to make it clear that in my view, and I may at some time in the future be empowered to influence Government policy, I think it has no importance whatever in relation to our industrial development.  Therefore, this means nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the same Party, Deputy Brennan, reading the same Bill, speaking on the same day, from the same <Col N="2230" /> benches said he interpreted this Bill &mdash;remember Deputy Lemass said it was doing nothing&mdash;to mean the death knell of the Undeveloped Areas Act. Am I unreasonable in saying that both of these Deputies cannot be right?  If Deputy Brennan is right, Deputy Lemass is wrong; if Deputy Lemass is right, Deputy Brennan is wrong, but they both cannot be right expressing these diametrically opposite views.  I think I had better leave it to the two Deputies to settle this dispute between themselves.  Interference from me would not produce any measure of cordiality in this field.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said also that I could if I wanted extend the Undeveloped Areas Act in such a way as to apply it to an area other than the undeveloped areas, in other words, to places not at present within the undeveloped areas.  That was one of the suggestions made by Deputy Lemass to avoid the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  I know of no better way of killing the Undeveloped Areas Act and of killing the undeveloped areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not represent me as suggesting it.  I said it was a course open to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was because I did not want to kill the Undeveloped Areas Act or to harm the undeveloped areas that I did not take that course. If I did, it would mean providing the rest of the country or a substantial area of the country with the same facilities as are granted in the undeveloped areas.  I wanted to keep the Undeveloped Areas Act, with its special facilities for people living in those areas, while at the same time not denying to other areas in the country the benefits which will flow to them from the implementation of this Act but to extend the Undeveloped Areas Act to other areas throughout the country would at once put them in the most deadly competition with the undeveloped areas.  If you could get the same facilities for establishing an industry in Meath or County Dublin as you would by establishing it in Donegal or Connemara, it is quite clear nobody would go to Donegal or <Col N="2231" /> Connemara; they would all crowd around the capital of the country and draw the same benefits there as they would draw in the western areas if I had fallen into the trap and had been guilty of what I would consider an unpardonable crime against the development of the western areas.</P>
      <P>We have to recognise that all this money for industrial development is money of the Irish people.  We have treated the western areas generously and we are treating them generously. I do not know if there is any greater incentive given in the legislation of any country than we are giving in the Undeveloped Areas Act, but there are other areas with claims as well who have a right to feel that they would get assistance for the provision of extra industries.  From the overall Irish point of view is it not better that we should do everything we can to deal with the problems of emigration, unemployment and other endemic problems and establish new industries whenever it is possible to do so either under State auspices in the form of State sponsored bodies or by the assistance which is given to enterprising industrialists in the schemes contemplated here?</P>
      <P>I think the rest of the country is entitled to some consideration.  Let us do what we can for the West under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  Let us help the West in every way possible.  But it is not necessary to detest the rest of the country and to deprive it of benefits in order to help the West.  I do not see that the enactment of this Bill will harm the West because it still has outstandingly greater benefits than will be available under a Bill of this kind.</P>

I think the Deputy can see at all events that, as far as helping the undeveloped areas is concerned, these figures speak for themselves.  In fact, I think it is now true to say that we can find places outside the undeveloped areas which are worse off than some places in the undeveloped areas.  For example, there were some places that were hit by the changes which took place in 1922 and which never recovered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Again, I commend the Deputy to some of our friends opposite who say this Bill as it stands at the moment is a challenge to the undeveloped areas.  If you do that in that kind of way you probably will be told you are using up on the East and the Midlands the money that should have been reserved for the western areas.  Under this Bill we can do what we can to help the Midlands, eastern and southern areas without harming the undeveloped areas and I think that is a desirable development.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilbride referred to the fact that I was at a meeting in Sligo on the 17th November and I did not say a word about this scheme coming along. I do not know to what extent Deputy Gilbride considers dates or knows what is happening in his small part of the world.  All I can tell him is that a speech was made by the Taoiseach on the 5th October in which he indicated that a Bill to give effect to this scheme would be introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy comes in now when questions are over acting the hero.  The Taoiseach made a speech on the 5th October saying that this Bill would be introduced to give effect to the scheme which is now outlined. I made a speech at Sligo on the 17th November six weeks afterwards. Although the Taoiseach's speech appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 6th October Deputy Gilbride said he never heard of it between that date and the 17th November and that nobody knew about it when I was talking in Sligo on the 17th November.  You might as well argue with a fog as argue with reasoning of that kind and I just have to give it up.  These are the facts and Deputy Gilbride does not pay his memory or his sagacity a very great tribute by making confessions of that kind in the House.</P>
      <P>I think, Sir, these are all the points which have been raised on the Bill and I want to conclude by saying that I do not think that this is a challenge to the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I hope it will not be operated in that kind of way.  There is a special problem in the undeveloped areas.  We should watch that problem and aid its solution in every possible way while at the same time not denying to other parts of the country, some of which are or will be in the course of time in a worse position than some places in the undeveloped areas, some assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, Sir, amendments Nos. 2,3,7 and 9 all deal with the same matter.  I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 43, before &ldquo;the year&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, in any case in which the standard output of coal is the volume of output of coal in the 12 months ending on the 30th day of September, 1956,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since the discussion that we had on the Committee Stage, a case was made to me in relation to both the export provisions of this Bill and the coal-mining provisions, that it was possible that during the year ended 30th September, 1956, there would have been a freak contract obtained which would mean that exports in the year to the 30th September, 1956, were higher than might have been the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister dealing with amendments Nos. 2 and 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The two things are together.  They both deal with the change of the datum year.  It was represented to me that there might be a freak contract obtained in relation to the year ended 30th September, 1956.  Equally, the case was made that there might have been a freak seam of coal obtained during the same year. The case was made here on Committee Stage that I should take a wide period of years and take an average or allow a wide option.  I did not accept that <Col N="2236" /> view then and I do not accept it now, but I do accept the view that, if there was a freak occurrence in the year ended 30th September, 1956, the operation of that freak occurrence should not be to the detriment of the company concerned.  If the same thing happened in two years, then I think it would be perfectly fair to say that it was not a freak but that it was part of a regular pattern.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I have provided in the amendment that is now before the House which deals specifically with coal-mining, that a company will have the option of choosing for its datum year whichever it prefers, either the year ended 30th September, 1955, or the year ended 30th September, 1956, thus giving the company the opportunity of getting away from a freak occurrence of the nature to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the two cases are quite as similar as the Minister suggests.  It is quite true that, as I argued in Committee, in the case of coal-mining there are practical factors which may vary the output of a mine from one year to another and these practical factors are almost certain to occur from time to time in some regular cycle.  For that reason I argued that the standard output for a coal-mining undertaking should be the average of three years rather than the accidental output of a single year.  The Minister's decision to allow a coal-mining company the choice of one of two years is probably just as good and is unlikely, I think, to cause any inequity in the operation of the Bill. I still think that the average of three years would have been a better arrangement, having regard to the circumstances under which coal-mining concerns are carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case, however, of companies doing an export trade, the case I argued here was not based upon the possibility of a company having got a temporary increase in its export business in a single year which would make it impossible for it ever to benefit under this Bill because it could not get back again to that year's level.  The effort to get our industrial firms into export trade has been going on for <Col N="2237" /> some time and the introduction of this Bill now, confining the reliefs given by the Bill only to firms which export in the future or increase their export trade in the future, operates to penalise those who were the first to respond to the appeals addressed to them by this Government and the previous Government to increase, if they could, their export trade.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think the basis year for manufacturing companies should be brought back and I suggest as a date which has some relation to Government activity is that upon which the organisation to encourage exports, Córas Tráchtála, began to function.  Clearly, at that time there was an export drive begun.  That certainly was what the organisation was intended to achieve.  That organisation contacted many firms in the country, urged them to examine the possibility of getting into export trade and carried out market research so as to indicate to them the openings that were available to them.</P>
    <P>Companies that responded to that effort, those who made the maximum attempt on the advice of Córas Tráchtála to do export trade then, are going to suffer in comparison with those who have waited until now to do anything of that kind.  I think that is undesirable.  I think it is likely to defeat the declared purpose of this Bill because I believe that it is the firms which were the first to respond before which will be the most likely to exert themselves to increase their effort now.  To signal out these firms for discrimination to their detriment is, I think, unwise.  My suggestion was that these firms should be given a choice extending back over a number of years, extending back at any rate to 1953.  The Minister has decided to give them a choice of two years.  That is better than the Bill as introduced, but I still think he is unwise.  I repeat that this Bill will have very little effect because the inducements given to firms to undertake the very risky business of export are entirely inadequate; that, whatever effect it will have, will be improved by the alteration in the Bill, and that can be still further improved if the Minister adopts the suggestion I put forward to him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 34, before &ldquo;a&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(save for the purposes of the proviso to the definition in this section of &lsquo;goods&rsquo;)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is, in fact, consequential upon the change in the definition of goods which is covered in amendment No. 6.  This amendment relates in the main to the case where two companies are so closely related that one company, with a controlling interest in the second, owns 90 per cent. of the shares of the other.  In such a case the goods exported by one company will have relief notwithstanding that the goods are manufactured by the other company.  The relief, of course, will only be given to the company which exports the goods.  This amendment is introduced to meet the &ldquo;family of companies&rdquo; to which Deputy MacEntee referred the other day in so far as there is common ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has a later amendment that goes further than that.  His amendment would have the effect of widening the scope much more.  If his amendment were accepted it would mean that the company exporting the goods would be entitled to the relief irrespective of whether those goods are manufactured by it, by another company or by another individual. Under the framework of this Bill, that would leave a loophole for evasion which, if it were availed of extensively, would seriously imperil the purposes of Part III of the Bill, namely, to avoid <Col N="2239" /> the measure of tax relief in respect of increased exports.</P>
    <P>It would also have the effect in many instances of depriving those who already have a business, with an export proportion attached to that business, of the business they already have.  If a company already has an export business, it gets under Part III of the Bill a relief in relation to the excess computed in a certain way.  If, on the other hand, I were to adopt Deputy Lemass's amendment, the effect would be that a new company, because it would get the entire relief in respect of existing exports which would be quite untraceable, could take all the business away from the existing concern.  I do not know whether I have made myself clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly has not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We will assume that a business which manufactures a particular type of textiles has exports in whatever is the datum year to the value of £100,000.  In the current year &mdash;that is to say, after the datum year&mdash; as the Bill stands it may export to the value of £150,000.  It will get the concession in respect of £50,000 of the excess related to its total sales. Because it is the manufacturer of those goods it, and only it, can get the concession. If Deputy Lemass's amendment were adopted, then I could set up in business, I could buy the product of that firm, I could export it and I would get the relief not merely on the £50,000 but on the total £150,000 because it would be a new business.  Once you drop the words &ldquo;manufactured by the person who exports them&rdquo; you have no chance whatever of seeing where the goods come from originally.  The effect, therefore, would be (a) that it would not be for increased exports at all and (b) that the newcomer would be able to displace the existing exporter. That is a situation which, I think, the Deputy will readily agree would do far more harm to exports rather than assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows quite well, whatever argument he <Col N="2240" /> bases upon my inefficiency as a draftsman, that I do not contemplate that the tax relief will go to anyone except the manufacturer.  It may be that the form in which the Bill appears before the Dáil might have to be reconsidered to ensure that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have intended that but he made a different case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the goods must be manufactured by the person who exports them, but I urge that he should encourage the export of goods by whomever they are exported.  It should be sufficient for the manufacturer to qualify for the tax relief to show that the goods he manufactured were exported through a trading organisation operating within the State.</P>
      <P>I gave instances of the type of case I had in mind.  I mentioned the efforts made by Córas Tráchtála to set up a marketing organisation to sell in America the products of certain kinds of prepared foods manufactured here. The main difficulty which Córas Tráchtála expected to meet in America was that the quantity of goods which they would have would be insufficient to interest the people in America, if they were dealing with only one manufacturer here.  So they got two or three manufacturers to combine to produce a similar article under the same trade name.  In that way, they were able to offer to the firm in America a not inconsiderable amount of these goods, enough to interest them and to get them to buy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That type of organisation cannot operate under this Bill.  If a manufacturer decides to export his goods through such an organisation, he will not qualify for the tax relief.  He must export them himself, or through a subsidiary company, and, if he does not do so, he cannot qualify.  I know of other instances of the same kind where efforts were made to set up merchant houses to handle the products of more than one Irish manufacturer. British exports throughout the world were developed mainly by the enterprising merchant houses who did not manufacture a thing, but were the <Col N="2241" /> medium through which the market possibilities of the world and the British manufacturers were brought into relationship with each other.  I would like to see that development begin here and I hope that we shall not put into this Bill anything that would discourage it.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers of Irish woollen products, in selling their goods throughout the world by getting them incorporated in the pattern books of British merchant houses, sold their goods all right but the goodwill went to the British merchant houses.  I asked them not to adopt that practice because it brought the goodwill to the British merchant houses, and not to the manufacturer and it did not secure for them any safe market abroad. These Irish woollen manufacturers, if they follow that course, will qualify for the relief, if they send their goods to the warehouse of a British merchant house, because they are selling abroad, but if they sell their goods through an Irish merchant house, they will not qualify.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone some part of the way to meet the difficulties I mentioned. The practice of some manufacturers of selling through subsidiary companies is dealt with, but there is another problem there, and, if the Minister will not move to meet it now, I am urging him to consider the possibility that he is doing something that will force development into undesirable trends.  If he can so devise it that relief will go only to the manufacturer and not make it impossible for manufacturers to combine or compel them to use British merchant houses as a selling medium, he should do it.  It is undesirable that we should impose these unnecessary restrictions.  I do not think there is any safeguard in the retention of these words.  I admit that, with the Bill as it now stands, there is the possibility that a company which was not doing any manufacturing might come to claim relief under the Bill, but my intention is that only the manufacturer should get the relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that, but the case the Deputy made is that the merchant house would get the concession. As I understand the merchant house, it is an organisation which buys a commodity from the manufacturer not for the purpose of reselling it, but rather it is a combination of a sales service for the purpose of going out and getting orders which orders would be passed on to the marketing association. It is not at all the same as the case where the goods are bought by the merchant house from the manufacturer and resold to the customer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the No. 1 company which is a manufacturing company for the purposes of this Bill. It establishes No. 2 company which is an exporting company solely and which operates solely on behalf of No. 1 company. That is quite simple and is fully covered by the amendment. However, company No. 1 subsequently establishes another manufacturing company to which I shall refer as company No. 3, which is wholly owned by company No. 1.  Company No. 3 develops a small export trade but is one which may grow.  In its initial stages, and for the purpose of testing the market and so on, it avails of the services of No. 2 company.  It seems to me that as the amendment is drafted, company No. 2 would derive no benefit under Section 10 on the profits which it makes on the export of the produce of No. 3 company.</P>

      <P>This raises again the question of the desirability of keeping this, in my opinion, foolish provision that the granting of this relief is conditional on a company using no part of the profit gained in increased export trade to pay a dividend to the shareholders. The Minister gave no reason why that restriction is in the Bill.  I do not see the sense of it.  It seems to me to be ruling out of consideration the one possibility of benefit to the country that might have arisen from the Bill.  We have been trying to attract firms who do manufacturing operations elsewhere for world markets to transfer some of these operations here.  We have not been able to get them to do so because the attractions we offered were not sufficient.  With this Bill it might have been possible to say to them they would gain the advantage of a 50 per cent. remission of taxes.  Now we are to tell them they will get that remission on condition only that they do not pay any dividends to their shareholders. That withdraws any attraction there might have been.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass was all wrong here on the Committee Stage when he said in relation to the new exporting company that the effect of this provision was that it could not pay any dividends.  It could have paid dividends and would have obtained relief in respect of the proportion that it ploughed back.  That was the Deputy's reason&mdash;because he misinterpreted the section&mdash;for putting down the amendment. My reason is entirely different. I would prefer to have been able to retain the ploughing back provision but if the House will look at amendment No. 14 it will be seen that I am adopting a new method of assessing the portion of the export profits.  While it would be entirely reasonable to provide that a person should plough back a portion of their profits I do not think it would be realistic to provide that a person should be bound to plough back something that is merely being deemed to be, for the purposes of amendment No. 14, a portion of their profits.  That is the reason why I put my name to the amendment and not for the reasons Deputy Lemass had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 13 is subsidiary to that of No. 14.  The purpose of amendment No. 14 is to provide something that will enable the company to get a benefit from an expansion of exports without going to the position which Deputy Lemass advocated on the Committee Stage which would be untenable for the reasons I gave then. The basis of the original section was that it was the excess of the profits that were obtainable from the export market that got the relief and that measured the amount of the relief. There would be no difference between amendment No. 14 and the original section if the company concerned were getting the same ratio of profit for the export market as they were for the home market.  However, I think we must accept the situation that in relation to the export market the margin of profit available will not be as great as it would be in the home market and that, in any event, it is desirable <Col N="2250" /> for us to provide an inducement in this for people to go out into the export market even though by so doing they might not get the same ratio of profit as they would in the home market.</P>
      <P>The purpose, therefore, of this amendment can perhaps be explained more easily in this way.  The amount that will qualify now is, in relation to such proportion of its total profits as are the excess receipts from the exported goods to the total receipts from the sale of goods.  Let us take a concrete example.  Supposing in the standard period that the excess receipts from exports of manufactured goods came to £10,000, and the total receipts from the total sale of goods, home and exports, came to £50,000 and profits were £5,000, then the effect of this formula is to provide that one-fifth of the whole profit, that is to say, as £10,000 is to £50,000 would be the profit that would be attributable to excess export sales and it would mean £1,000 of profits would be so attributable. As I said, if the ratio of profits between home and export is exactly the same, there is no benefit in this amendment, compared with the original section, for the exporter, but the moment the ratio of profits starts to drop as between export sales and home sales then there is a benefit to the exporter from this formula.</P>

There are points which have occurred to me and which I think would have produced amendments from me.</P>

    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to those points.  One concerns Section 13.  Paragraph (b), as I understand it, precludes from the benefits of <Col N="2256" /> this Bill any company carrying on mining operations.  That, I think, is perfectly legitimate in regard to those mining companies who got the benefit of the Act which was passed early this year, the Finance (Profits of Certain Mines) Act, and, of course, so far as coal-mining companies are concerned, they are separately provided for in the Bill.  There are companies, however, in this country carrying on mining operations and, in one instance, mining operations for the purpose of exports, which do not benefit under any of these Acts.  I think it is undesirable that they should be left in that position.  The Act earlier this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will mention one commodity, gypsum, and I suppose barytes and some other products could be affected.  The Act earlier this year gave the tax concessions to companies carrying on new mining operations and no benefits to existing mining companies that might extend their operations into the export trade.  This Bill gives concessions to coal-mining companies who increase their production. It seems to me that there are gaps being left which will be regarded as inequitable and to which some thought should be given.  A company carrying on the mining of gypsum, whether an old company or a new one &mdash;gypsum is a non-bedded mineral&mdash; might not qualify under the earlier Acts.  There are gypsum companies producing gypsum products here and exporting them.  Indeed, exports run to several hundred thousand pounds in value, and, as I understand the position, if they extend their exports, they get none of these benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain that.  Section 16 provides that expenditure on an industrial building shall qualify for this initial allowance but leaving out of account any part which was met directly or indirectly by the State, by any board established by statute, or by any public or local authority.  I think the Minister <Col N="2257" /> has in mind Foras Tionscal or possible grants under the Bill which the Dáil was discussing to-day.  As far as the Industrial Grants Bill is concerned, it is specifically stated to be towards the cost of the industrial buildings that grants will be given and because of that I make no point.  In so far as State grants are given towards the cost of buildings anywhere, it is reasonable enough to provide that the initial allowance should not operate, but, in the case of Foras Tionscal, there is power to give grants for a variety of purposes&mdash;the erection of buildings, the construction of approach roads, the training of staff or the purchase of plant.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice of Foras Tionscal to signify when deciding the amount of the grant what part is appropriate to buildings and what part appropriate to other purposes.  Foras Tionscal have considered the proposals brought to them, assessed their possibility, and determined the amount of aid required in order to offset any possible disadvantage attached to the location of the undertaking.  They have generally stipulated that their grants will not be payable until the buildings have been completed and it seems to me that some difficulties may arise on that account.  It is true that the Bill refers to the extent to which expenditure on buildings has been or is to be met by State grants, but obviously there will be circumstances under which somebody will be called upon to decide in such cases what part of the total grant is to be regarded as appropriate to the construction of buildings.  Indeed it could be argued in view of the practice of Foras Tionscal that no part of the grant was attributable to the cost of the buildings in so far as it has been the practice to require that the private interests concerned should have completed the buildings before Foras Tionscal actually parted with the amount of money they had agreed to give.  It would be helpful to those in that position now or who may be in that position in the future, if the intentions of the Bill in that respect were clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to gypsum, first of all the Deputy was <Col N="2258" /> not quite correct in the case he made. There is certainly one company here that mines gypsum, that turns the gypsum into plaster and plaster boards, and in so far as it does any processing of the gypsum in that way and exports the plaster or the plaster board, it qualifies for relief under Part III of this Bill.  Clause (b) of Section 15 does not exclude because the processing is superimposed on the mining operations.</P>
      <P>In relation to the export of unprocessed gypsum, of course that would not be the case.  It is a matter which was brought to my attention on last Friday or Saturday night for the first time and it is one that will require some consideration as to whether it is wise to encourage the export of unprocessed gypsum.  The plaster or plaster board should be encouraged and export should be encouraged, but it is at least a matter for consideration&mdash;I will not put it any further than that at this stage&mdash;whether it is desirable to make it easier for the unprocessed gypsum to be exported and that it might not be better to concentrate the advantage on the processed article.  That is a matter to which I am quite prepared to give consideration.</P>

      <P>In so far as any processing is done afterwards it is quite clear that cover is afforded when it is processing.  In so far as non-processing is concerned, that is a matter which I would prefer for each individual variety of mineral so as to be quite certain that before I considered any question of giving a concession for the export of the raw material I was not. in doing so, undermining&mdash;if I may use a pun in relation to that raw material&mdash;the processing which is carried on in it because, obviously, we want the greatest amount of value to be added to the raw material here before it is exported.  Barytes is one of the minerals mentioned by Deputy Lemass and is covered in the previous Act.</P>

Incidentally, roads were a bad example for the Deputy to give because the term &ldquo;structure&rdquo; in the Bill covers things that are not normally thought of as buildings&mdash;walls, bridges, roads, and so on.  Leaving that to one side, it seems to me that the Deputy is rather putting the cart before the horse.  When this Act becomes law&mdash; it is in respect of new buildings&mdash;presumably An Foras Tionscal, in consequence and with the Act in front of them, will segregate the purposes.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the intention of the Bill is quite clear and I think nobody will fight with the intentions of the Bill.  Where a building costs £100,000 and £40,000 has been given by way of grant only £60,000 will rank for relief.  That, I think, we will all accept as the line that must be taken.  I think it will be possible to get over, in respect of past decisions by Foras Tionscal, any difficulties that <Col N="2260" /> may arise without much trouble so far as the future is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was before the House on the Committee Stage, I drew the attention of the Minister to a problem which affects a number of landholders.  While in some of his proposed amendments the Minister seems to have dealt with certain analogous problems, either he has failed to deal with the one I raised, or my mind, untrained in the interpretation of legal terminology, has failed to grasp his intention.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 22 deals with a right in or over land for a limited period. It is proposed elsewhere in the Bill to introduce other sections or amending words, all dealing with a right in or over land for a limited period.  Such a right generally is created as part of a marriage settlement and consequent upon the transfer of lands from parents to children.  The occasion on which such agreements are allowed to fall into desuetude must, in view of the conditions surrounding them, be very few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem on which I spoke to the Minister is a substantially different one.  My concern is not that of extinguishing property rights, as has been in a measure suggested, but to point out that certain controls over property and land should not be regarded as rights, morally or judicially. Those who are familiar with the history of Irish land tenure know how tenacious was the hold of those landholders who acquired their lands as a <Col N="2265" /> result of the various confiscations. They are aware of many agreements made arising out of grim need&mdash;and as grimly exploited.  I am not referring here to shooting, fishing or mineral rights, but to the continuation in perpetuity, by specific State action, of a rack rent.</P>
    <P>The economic circumstances and the passing of the years have, in practice, abolished those charges.  They reappear only when the State, directly or through any of the local authorities, acquires land and in all such cases when either the State or the local authority acquires land, the capital sum is deducted from the agreed price, to the detriment of the landholder from whom the land is being acquired. The sum retained is designed to meet an improbable demand, a demand that in practice has not been enforced and is actually unenforceable.</P>
    <P>The existence of the charge is never taken into consideration in the matter of sale and purchase between individuals. It is only when the State enters the land market that it raises its spectral head.  I think there is, and there must be, in State procedure, a rigidity not affecting the ordinary individual.  So that the State may act in accordance with what has become the recognised practice in land transfers, an amendment of the law is, I think, essential, an amendment which sets a time limitation to the right to demand payment in perpetuity.  This is a right which in practice has not been sought, has not been enforced and is only being held by a State Department and by local authorities under Section 38 of the Land Act of 1923, which makes provision for the redemption of fee farm grants.  Section 59 of the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931 provides that if rent has not been paid for five years and the whereabouts of the lessor are unknown, the tenant is free from covenant, condition or agreement.  That is it in great measure; there are some further words which may qualify it.</P>
    <P>Apart from the difficulty it makes for the landholder, it gravely has affected forestry development and the acquisition of land for forestry.  The price paid for forestry land is not exceptionally high.  From the amount to be <Col N="2266" /> paid is, first of all, deducted the capital sum for annuities&mdash;which is understandable&mdash;but why should a further capital sum be deducted or held to meet a demand for a charge which has never been enforced and never been sought and which was introduced away back during the mists of history, by some too cautious landlord who found that economics entirely worked against him and found that he could never collect?  I am concerned only with having in this Bill a limitation whereby the State and the local authorities will not insist on perpetuating some regulation that has, by custom among the people, completely disappeared.</P>

      <P>What I fear is that those rights of support and residence that the Attorney-General speaks of are the ordinary rights that may be contained in a marriage settlement or in a transfer from father to son and these surely do not need any legislation, but the other thing does.</P>

      <P>Surely it is a question of what limit you will put on them?  If they are the type of thing that is envisaged in this section, it is an enforceable claim.  That is all that would be envisaged?  Any arrangement that is not an enforceable claim is not contemplated by the code. Therefore, it is desirable to bring in some limit and the question is what limit?  I take it the 12 years is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind what time limit you have, but you are not dealing with changes of property <Col N="2267" /> which are not in practice enforced or enforceable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what Deputy Moylan has in mind is something that might require a shorter limitation, but it is a question of whether it is a matter for the code dealing with land.  The point is that there are certain rights that have no meaning at all in practice, until some interest such as the State seeks to intervene, and then they appear because of a clause that is in them as a blot on the title.  When they so appear, it is a question of extinguishing them.  I see there is a certain difficulty here and I would ask the Attorney-General is the 12 years the period which fits most uniformly into the pattern?  Is that the best way of getting uniformity with the remainder of the code?  Would a shorter period suit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve years is the appropriate period, I think, for this, but Deputy Moylan is not really referring to these personal rights over land at all.  I gather he is not objecting to the 12-year period, or any period in respect of the type of rights referred to in amendment No. 22.  He is speaking of some other rights over land and I do not know what they are. I am advised that pretty nearly every right, you may say, over land, with the exception of rights of easement, shooting rights&mdash;I am sure the Deputy is not interested in them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Everything else is covered in the definition section or carried forward through legislation or covered in some specific way.  Land charges are all covered.  We went through that on an earlier stage.  This deals with certain rights for a limited period and rights that are not exclusive rights of residence, as rights of residence were taken, in the Keegan case to which I referred earlier, as equitable rights and they are covered already.  I am afraid I do not get the Deputy's point, I think he is referring to something as not being covered which should be covered.  What is the particular point not covered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a man owns a farm of land which is acquired by the Forestry Department.  The price is agreed and the sum to cover land annuity charges is deducted from the price.  All is fair.  But liability for some charge, the origin of which is unknown &mdash;it has never been demanded, never claimed and never paid as long as the farm is there&mdash;arises.  It never appears until the State is negotiating with the farmer to purchase the land.  Then the State computes the capital sum that would extinguish this charge and they also deduct that, with the result that the price of the land becomes so low that it is not worth the man's while to sell it to the Forestry Department.</P>
      <P>In the same way a local authority may want an acre of land for a labourer's cottage and they discover there is a charge of this nature on the farm.  Before the farmer can be paid for the land and the title cleared, he must clear the blot created by this charge, which again has never been met or demanded.  I am sure in the Attorney-General's wide experience he must have come across that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That would follow here, but the period would be 12 years. I think that anything in the nature of a claim arising in that way, unless the claim has been enforced, becomes automatically extinguished under the limitation of the 12 years?  Is that not the point here?</P>

      <P>So that the answer to Deputy Moylan would appear to be that whatever the merits of this kind of charge that does not come to light <Col N="2269" /> until there is a sale may be the fact will be that if such a charge is there, it will be extinguished after 12 years and the only point that would arise then is evidence of title.  Usually requisitions on title would furnish that information, but the net point is that the limit is 12 years.  If the right has not been exercised for 12 years, it is barred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent, this Bill will in some respects, I am sure, prove to be experimental. There will be a likelihood of some hiatus here or there, or that a judicial decision will cause an amendment or bring up the question of moving amendments to it.  In the nature of a Bill like this, would it not be a good idea if the Minister set himself the task of having this Bill reviewed within a year of its coming into operation? The tendency is to let legislation such as this run for a long time without attending to it.  I wonder if the Minister would be prepared to bring the Bill forward for consideration again?  Our position is that, short of a substantive motion, it is very difficult to raise the matter unless the Government raises it.  Some method should be taken to raise it again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (d), lines 17 to 19, to delete &ldquo;either in tort or in contract or otherwise (including suing or being sued for specific performance),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment will be more than a drafting amendment in one sense.  It may be convenient to raise at this stage a point which I made on the Second Reading <Col N="2279" /> and about which I am not entirely satisfied although the Attorney-General replied and made certain points about it.  It is that paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 must include undoubtedly a right to sue in ejectment.  There is one existing case of the right of a married woman to sue in ejectment and that is her right to sue her husband in ejectment.  As I understand the position at present, that right is being held to apply only in cases where it can be established that the conduct of the husband has destroyed his right to be in the marital home.  A married woman cannot eject her husband from the marital home, even if she is the sole owner of it, unless she can establish to the court that he is guilty of conduct which, roughly speaking, would entitle her to a legal separation.</P>
      <P>As I read this Bill originally, I had a feeling that the terms of paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 might alter that state of the law.  I think that danger is somewhat heightened by the exclusion of the words in this amendment.  That gives her a completely free right of suing. I think it is probably true to say that to give her the right to sue does not give her any greater or different right to eject.  Subject to your permission, Sir, I might mention another section at the same time.  I think the two sections must be read together.  It is paragraph (c) of Section 4.  That combined with paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 and sub-section (2) of Section 2 all seem to me to amount to a statutory provision which could be construed as saying that in an ejectment action between a wife and her husband, with regard to the marital home which was the property of the wife, it would be no defence for the husband to say that he was the husband, that he was there by virtue of the marriage and that she could not succeed in ejectment by virtue of the marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the existing situation.  If a wife tries to eject her husband from the marital home, even though she owns it, his defence is simple and straightforward: &ldquo;I am there because <Col N="2280" /> I am the husband.&rdquo;  That is a relationship which the wife cannot terminate at her will.  The situation about anybody else in my property is that I can get them out of the property, assuming they are not tenants or anything else, merely by terminating their licence to be there.  A man can eject a son from his own home.  He can eject a daughter, a brother or a sister from his own home once he is the sole owner.  He cannot eject his wife at all because he cannot proceed against her but a wife cannot eject a husband at present because his defence is: &ldquo;I am married to her and nothing happened which would take away the rights of a married person to live in the marital home.&rdquo;  As I read it, the combined effect of these three sections &mdash;two paragraphs of Section 2 as amended and paragraph (c) of Section 4&mdash;must be that a wife is capable of suing her husband in ejectment in like manner as if they were not married.  I think a court asked to construe that will be forced to come to the conclusion that a man's wife can sue him in ejectment merely by establishing he was in the house and had not her express permission to be there.  I may be wrong about that.  I know it is not the intended effect of the section but I would like the Minister to consider it between this and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy enlighten me a little bit further?  Does the Deputy quite clearly appreciate the effect of the amendment?  It does not weaken, and it was not intended to weaken, paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2.  It is proposed to put in the phrase &ldquo;capable of suing and being sued&rdquo;.  It does not weaken it. It is intended to be comprehensive.  I do not know how the Deputy ties that with Section 4 to say that the husband's right of <i>consortium</i> is in any way affected.  Does the Deputy think it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might make myself clearer, the right of <i>consortium</i> can be affected in the particular case where the marital home is the sole property of the wife if you give her an unlimited and unrestricted right to sue her husband as if she were not married <Col N="2281" /> to him.  The existing situation is that she can sue her husband in ejectment, but she cannot succeed and cannot sue him successfully in ejectment unless she is able to establish that he has not got a right to live there, has not right of <i>consortium.</i>  She has to prove that he is guilty of conduct which would entitle her to a separation.</P>
      <P>That is the existing law as I understand it.  I think this section, coupled with paragraph (c) of Section 4, could be and would be construed as giving her a right to sue her husband in ejectment, among other things, in precisely the same way as she could sue anybody else&mdash;sue him in the position as if she were not married to him.  If that is right, it would be no defence to the husband in an ejectment by the wife out of the marital home for him to say. &ldquo;You cannot eject me; I am married to her.&rdquo;  She could point to the section of the Act which says: &ldquo;You may sue your husband as if you were not married to him.&rdquo;  She could say: &ldquo;That is precisely what I am doing now.  All I need to prove is that I own the marital home and I have not given him a licence to be there or I have declared it my intention that he no longer has express permission from me to be there.  That is all I need to eject my husband from my house.&rdquo;  That would be my fear arising out of it.  It might be quite an inadvertent effect.</P>

      <P>The situation at the moment is that a man might be restrained from interfering with his wife's property but he could not be restrained from entering the house.  As far as Section 4 is concerned that does give the husband and wife, each as against the other, the right to sue for certain personal torts.  We do intend that but I am not breaking up the right as regards <i>consortium.</i></P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I want to mention something which I already <Col N="2282" /> mentioned on the Second Stage and which has considerable relevance to this particular section, that is, the question which the Attorney-General has mentioned&mdash;the right which a badly treated wife has to sue her husband in certain torts.  It really boils down to a fear that I had that the right to sue in slander and assault&mdash;these are the two really that I call offensive torts&mdash; might lead to a great increase in the number of squabbles between husband and wife being brought to the civil courts.  Since I raised that point very extensively on the Second Reading, the Attorney-General at that time and the Minister as well mentioned certain aspects of the case.  Particularly, I remember the Attorney-General mentioning that there was a point of view which was to the effect that on the present law there are only two outlets for assault between a husband and a wife.  She can bring her husband into the criminal courts; she can bring in the assistance of the police and the State to prosecute and punish him for the assault or, if it become persistent and grievous, she can get a legal separation.  These are the only two legal outlets by which a wife can get a remedy at present if her husband assaults her.</P>
      <P>The same would apply to slander, really, in effect, because she can bring him in for abusive language or, probably, slander would, in certain circumstances, coupled with other conduct, be a ground for legal separation under our law at present.</P>
      <P>This adds a third outlet or remedy. That is, she can bring him to court and can sue him for damages and can get an award for damages against him of £50, £100, £500 and can recover it against him as if they were complete strangers.  I said on Second Reading that I was concerned that that would lead to actions which otherwise would not have taken place.  I can see considerable difficulties in restricting the torts or in excluding assault and slander from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General put forward a point of view, which other people have held also, that, so far from making it more likely that marriages would break <Col N="2283" /> up or fall down because of action brought in the civil court, it is putting in a safety valve at a lower pressure, that if these grievances have to be let boil up to the stage when they amount to separation, that is undesirable, whereas if, the first time it happens, it seems sufficiently serious and a wife may come to court and get damages and punish her husband in his pocket without affecting him in his person, that that is a safety valve at a lower level and, so far from doing damage to the solidarity of marriage, is quite likely to improve the position.  That point of view has been put.</P>
    <P>I have not got sufficient experience to know which is the right point of view and I should like the Minister to assure the House that he has considered very carefully and, if necessary, will consider again, this question of slander and assault.  I spoke generally about torts on the Second Reading but, having analysed the matter, I am quite satisfied that these are the only two objectional matters&mdash;slander and assault&mdash;and I should like the Minister to consider or to tell us that he has considered, and rejected on the information available to him, the idea of cutting out of the forms of action a wife can take against her husband these two of slander and assault.</P>
    <P>The other thing which possibly the Minister would consider&mdash;whether this infringes any constitutional rights or not I would not be able to say at this stage&mdash;but consider, at any rate, in actions brought by husbands against wives for either the tort of assault or the tort of slander pursuant to this section&mdash;if the Minister thinks they should be allowed to bring them&mdash; making it obligatory that the court should hold them <i>in camera</i> at the request of either of the two parties.</P>
    <P>There is provision later in the Bill for the hearing of certain actions with regard to property in private but there is not any similar section dealing with tort actions which would deal with personal injuries, such as assault. Possibly the Minister, if he is convinced that assault and slander must be left in the section, would consider the question of making it obligatory <Col N="2284" /> on the court, on the application of either party, to hold the action in private.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>All I should like to say on this is that I would agree with the view that Deputy Finlay has in this matter.  If it is easy for a wife to come into court, instead of its being a safety valve at a lower level than the ordinary separation business, my view and his view is&mdash;I do not know whether he has changed it or not&mdash; that once it goes into open court like that it is almost the end.  It would be my view that, if a wife sues her husband in open court, it will wind up with a separation and it should not be made easier for her to do that.  I am not a lawyer but, if that is being done in this Bill, it should be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>As far as we are concerned we are not trying to hold up this measure.  We are prepared to give this Bill as we were asked to do but it is a very dangerous thing to pass a Bill of this kind in a hurry and I think that that question ought to be re-examined because it certainly would be a very serious thing if, as a result of legislation passed here, it would be made easier for a family to be broken up.  That is all I have to say about that.  We are all very worried about this because we believe that a marriage contract is a very important one and ought not to be lightly broken.  Anything that would make it easier to break the marriage tie ought not to be done.</P>
      <P>Consequently, although there may be something in the second point of view expressed here, I agree with the one that Deputy Finlay gave expression to, that is, that by going into court on a minor matter it probably will wind up with eventual separation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Boland that, when it is made easier for a wife to sue her husband for minor matters, for abusive language or for matters for which she might seek to recover damages, the likelihood is that, once a married couple find themselves in court, it will lead to eventual separation. It could be a rather dangerous thing indeed if it were to encourage either party to seek court protection <Col N="2285" /> at a low level, as Deputy Finlay has said.  In fact, it is only in practice that one could decide whether this is a wise section at all or not.  If it had the effect that some of us think it might have, it could be a rather serious section indeed.</P>
      <P>The other view, which Deputy Finlay has mentioned, is that it might prevent things reaching the high pressure mark where separation is sought. I am rather inclined to subscribe to the view that Deputy Boland has expressed, that to encourage the wife to seek a decision at the lower level will eventually result in strained relationship and perhaps separation which might not otherwise be sought.  It is a rather important section if it may have that result.</P>

      <P>The position at the moment is that a wife has certain rights against her husband.  A wife can bring her husband into the criminal court.  That is done in serious assault cases.  She has the right to protect her property against her husband. Now there has not been a tremendous amount of resort to the courts by married women in relation to the protection of property.  Neither have there been many cases of women instituting criminal proceedings against husbands for assault.  There has not been very much of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position here?  The House has agreed that that as far as ordinary personal injuries are concerned, injuries arising from the driving of a motor car for example, the <Col N="2286" /> position of the wife <i>vis-a-vis</i> the husband, or the other way round, is a total anomaly.  There has been agreement that if a husband runs his wife down or in any other way causes her injuries through the instrumentality of a mechanically propelled vehicle, the law relating to personal injury actions should be rectified in that regard and the wife should be entitled to get damages either from her husband or from a third party.</P>
    <P>Where logically can one stop when one is thinking in terms of harm done by negligence?  Is it at the point of saying that when a motor car does it, it is all right; but where it is another type of negligence, or even if it is a hurt done deliberately, a hurt caused to a woman by her husband, then there should be no right of action.  I do not see how there can be a distinction.  If you go one step, then you must go the whole way.</P>
    <P>Turning to the assault cases then, the point here seems to turn on such things as defamation and slander. Where is the encouragement in this? Why is it that husbands are not in the habit of resorting to the courts at the moment?  From where does this apprehension come that there will be resort to the courts for, say, minor assaults?</P>

      <P>Because the husband knows that a wife cannot take him into court, they will compose their differences! There is no realism in this debate.  I want to read some quotations now culled from certain American publications in relation to these rights we are giving here now, rights in relation to which the same forebodings were expressed as are being expressed here now.  American judges say that there is no greater disharmony in the homes than there was before, as far as their experience goes in the courts.  One does not argue properly merely by saying this Bill encourages. This right will not be availed of in the case of abusive language, which is neither defamation nor slander, and there will be no resort by dissatisfied spouses, one against the other, simply because we lay it down in law that a wife can take action in future in respect of certain torts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>It is worth considering again.  This is the point Deputy Finlay makes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the matter can be considered again but, after what I have read and what has been put before me, I feel the case is strong for allowing this since we are legislating to put women on a better status, and it has always been regarded as a sign of advancing civilisation that women folk are equated more and more to the status given to their men.</P>
      <P>Now, these are statements culled mainly from American journals.  A judge in a 1927 case in Wisconsin said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2288" />&ldquo;Courts may prophesy, but the practice often leads to embarrassment.... Every step taken to emancipate women from the rigorous restrictions of the common law has been met with dark forebodings on the part of the judiciary.  But now that women have been put on a parity with men as to their personal and property rights, society survives, with none of the dark portends of the judicial prophets realised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Connecticut, which also allows actions for torts between spouses, a 1914 case contains this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the fact that the wife has a cause of action against her husband for wrongful injuries to her person or property committed by him, we see nothing which is injurious to the public good, or against good morals....  The danger that the domestic tranquillity may be disturbed ... and that the courts will be filled with actions ... we think is not serious.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those were the prophecies away back in 1914 and the Deputy is now repeating them in 1956.  I do not think these present prophecies are really serious at all.</P>
    <P>There is an even older case.  I will give a quotation from it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not regarded as discourteous to say that the ill-treatment of the wife by the husband, which consists of the violence of an assault and battery, is more destructive of conjugal union and tranquillity than the declaration of a right in the wife to maintain an action against her husband for an assault and battery upon her would be.  It is not at all unlikely that it would operate as a restraint upon militant husbands disposed to indulge in such evidence of conjugal union and tranquillity ...  The relief from liability in the U.S. came about by judicial interpretation of what is declared to have been the intention of the legislature on the subject ... To allow the right in action of this character, in accordance with the language of the statute, would be to promote greater harmony.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To legislate to clear away the difficulties in connection with the motor car matter and leave everything else would be stopping very far short of what our present situation requires. If Deputies ponder over it for a moment, they will feel seriously in this matter that merely because we say a wife can sue her husband for torts of the personal violence type or defamation, it does not follow that our courts will be cluttered up with women who are supposed to be living in harmony with their husbands, revealing to the public that they have been subjected to violence for a long time and been defamed by their husbands over many years.  That is far removed from reality.  The fact that we lay it down that they can go to court will not be regarded by these people as an encouragement to go to court.</P>

      <P>If what the Attorney-General says is correct, namely, that there are provisions already there in some other Act for suing or being sued as between husbands and wives, where is the necessity then for incorporating that in this Bill?  That is the point that strikes me.  I agree with what Deputy Boland has said.  I expressed the same views on the Second Reading of the Bill.  Despite what the Attorney-General has read out, which provides plenty of precedents and so on, I think that the very fact that this Bill contains these provisions will in some respect or another be a source of encouragement to some wife or husband to take the opportunity to utilise the particular provisions.  I would strongly advise the Minister to give very serious consideration as to whether he will include it in this Bill at all.  I do not think it is necessary.  I do not think the Bill itself is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will not misunderstand what I said.  A married woman has certain rights with <Col N="2290" /> regard to the protection of her property. When it comes to a matter of personal violence, the right is there for her to have her husband criminally prosecuted.  What we are proposing to give here is that, instead of having to have her husband prosecuted, she would have the simple civil right.  That is the change which is being made and we think that is a proper thing to do.</P>
      <P>What can be derived from consideration of how the matter is worked out in the United States?  There has been no breaking up of homes, no descent towards disharmony and no question of the courts being deluged with this type of action.  If we take the Americans as a precedent, we find that there is just as much individuality as before. It is the proper thing, in this progressive age, to give the woman the civil right which she now has in regard to taking criminal proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>8. (1) Where a policy of life assurance or endowment is expressed to be for the benefit of, or by its express terms purports to confer a benefit upon, the wife, husband or child of the assured, the provision shall be enforceable by the beneficiary in his or her own name as if he or she were a party to it.</P>
      <P>(2) The right conferred on a beneficiary by this section shall be subject to any defence that would have been valid between the parties to the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) The moneys payable to the <Col N="2292" /> beneficiary under the policy shall not form part of the estate of the assured or be subject to his or her debts.</P>
    <P>(4) If it is proved that the policy was effected and the premiums paid with intent to defraud the creditors of the assured, they shall be entitled to receive, on account of their debts, payment out of the moneys payable under the policy, so, however, that the total amount of such payments shall not exceed the amount of the premiums so paid.</P>
    <P>(5) In this section, &ldquo;child&rdquo; includes stepchild, illegitimate child, adopted person (within the meaning of the Adoption Act, 1952 (No. 25 of 1952) ), and a person to whom the assured is <i>in loco parentis.</i></P>
    <P>(6)  This section applies whether the policy was effected before or after the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8, it is understood, will disappear when this section goes in.  I might explain the new section as follows: On the Second Stage, I explained that Section 8 was one of the exceptions to the rule that a third party cannot enforce a contract made between two other parties.  I mentioned then that we would propose this present amendment.  There are in fact three points of difference between the proposed new section and the section as it stands.  These are: (a) the policies covered include endowments as well as life policies&mdash;on the Second Stage I also mentioned education policies but these are in fact covered by the term &ldquo;endowment&rdquo;.  (b) The type of policy covered in the section as it stands in the Bill is one &ldquo;expressed to be for the benefit of&rdquo; a member of the family.  The amendment extends that to cover, also, a policy which &ldquo;by its expressed terms purports to confer a benefit upon&rdquo; a member of the family.  This is really a drafting change designed to make clear that the section will apply even though the form of the policy does not exactly conform to the requirements of the section as it stands in the Bill at present.  The reason for this is that it is not usual for a man to consult a solicitor when <Col N="2293" /> completing a proposal for insurance and we do not want to see what would be a mere defect in form defeating his obvious intentions.</P>
      <P>The third change in the amendment is that the trust mechanism which is enshrined in the corresponding provision of the 1882 Act, is being abolished. The trust mechanism is a cumbersome one and we see no sufficient reason for retaining it in its present form.  A trust right will be created in the beneficiary, nevertheless, by the proposals in the amendment for the reason that the power of rescinding the contract of insurance is not provided for in the new section proposed.  In the case of ordinary contracts, dealt with in the next amendment, there is a power of recision.  What this amendment proposes to do therefore is to extend the provisions already in the law governing life policies to endowment policies.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 8 deleted.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Where a contract (other than a contract to which section * applies) is expressed to be for the benefit of, or by its express terms purports to confer a benefit upon, a third person being the wife, husband or child of one of the contracting parties, it shall be enforceable by the third person in his or her own name as if he or she were a party to it.</P>
      <P>(2)  The right conferred on a third person by this section shall be subject to any defence that would have been valid between the parties to the contract.</P>
      <P>(3)  Unless the contract otherwise provides, it may be rescinded by agreement of the contracting parties at any time before the third person has adopted it either expressly or by conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) This section applies whether <Col N="2294" /> the contract was made before or after the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section, &ldquo;child&rdquo; includes stepchild, illegitimate child, adopted person (within the meaning of the Adoption Act, 1952 (No. 25 of 1952) ), and a person to whom the contracting party is <i>in loco parentis.</i></P>

      <P>This again is the insertion of a new section and is the application of the new Section 8 to a policy of life insurance or endowment insurance.  The new section which will run before Section 9 relates to contracts for the benefit of the spouse and the children.  It is a very definite extension, away entirely from insurance policies.  I referred to this amendment on the Second Stage and said there would likely be a new section preceding Section 9.  This is that section.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like to raise on the section.  I have been given to understand that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in sub-section (4) is merely permissive.  I am pretty sure that in courts the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; has been interpreted as &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  May the same thing not happen here?  I would be totally opposed to any provision being passed here which would make it compulsory on a wife to give evidence against her husband.  As I understand &ldquo;may&rdquo;, it does not mean she will be compelled to give evidence against her husband, but I should like an assurance on that point.  The ordinary layman will always interpret &ldquo;may&rdquo; as permissive, but the courts have interpreted it differently.  Has that not been the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  A definite ruling is that &ldquo;may&rdquo;, coupled with a duty, may mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  That should not occur in this case.  The change being made is a change towards what the Deputies were contesting for. Under the 1884 Act, a husband or wife <Col N="2295" /> was a compellable witness.  That is being repealed.  What is being put in here is that a spouse may be called. That is only taken to mean a competent, and not a compellable witness. I would like to assure the Deputy that these words were chosen very carefully to bring about that change.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke briefly on the Money Resolution, I pointed out that Section 19 was the operative section and that it was unworkable owing to the financial provisions.  I still hold that view.  It is very little use bringing in a Bill of this kind, unless the financial provisions make it workable.  We have had experience of measures of a similar kind coming before the House on occasions since the State was established and we know what happened.</P>
      <P>In the light of that experience, I say that if the Minister were really sincere in having something attempted in this matter, he should have made it at least elastic, so that the Minister would have discretion to exceed 50 per cent. in all cases where it could be proved that the cost would be so great that local authorities would be unable to promote them on their own.  We know that coast erosion is a big and complex problem and that to do it properly would be very costly and expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of this section says the Minister may contribute out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas such amount not exceeding one half of such coats and expenses as he considers proper.  We had this question of the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; mentioned here a few moments ago.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this, I take it, does not mean that it compels the Minister to give even one half.  It is worded in such a way that he cannot exceed 50 per cent.  He could amend the sub-section by deleting the word &ldquo;exceeding&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;not less than 50 per cent.&rdquo;  In that <Col N="2298" /> way he would be giving himself discretion to give a bigger grant than 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>We all know that some of the schemes envisaged when this Bill was being drafted and considered will be of such magnitude that no local authority will undertake to provide 50 per cent. and afterwards try to recoup from the people who benefit a certain percentage of that.  The Minister would shorten the debate very considerably if he would say that he is prepared to do that.  Fifty per cent. or even 75 per cent. in some circumstances would not be going far enough, but if he left it open, he could then have the matter considered, and there would be some incentive for the local authorities to promote a scheme.  The way the section reads at the moment, and particularly paragraph (a), no local authority will attempt to go even as far as to promote a scheme, never mind to see that it is carried out and afterwards contribute what will be their share of the costs and expenses.</P>
    <P>The Minister should throw his mind back on legislation that was passed here on similar lines.  I am sure he remembers very well the Barrow Drainage Act and what that implied. He has also, I am sure, a fair recollection of how it worked out and all the subsequent agitation that was carried on.  There was apparently no satisfaction until the 1945 Act came along and relieved the local authorities concerned and the riparian owners of their contributions. There was a very vigorous agitation carried on about that scheme. Every Party in the House was approached and everybody was sympathetic. However, the Act being as it was, nothing could be done until it was repealed.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better to bring in a Bill that would not need repeal or amendment at a subsequent date after it had proved a failure?  We had the 1925 Drainage Act.  The financial provisions were on somewhat similar lines and the Minister also knows quite well how that Act worked out.  He knows very well that the contributions from the benefiting landowners were never collected and that if they had been collected, it would mean, in many <Col N="2299" /> instances, taking the only cow, perhaps, away from some of them.  The result was that many county councils acted realistically.  Instead of insisting on being paid and issuing distraint warrants for the collection of the drainage rate, they made it a county-at-large charge.  They concealed that fact, of course, and those in power, I suppose, closed their eyes to it. Nevertheless, the difficulty was there.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a case in point in his own constituency and that is the River Rye, which is a very small scheme compared with a scheme of coast erosion protection like some of those I have in mind.  Does he for a moment imagine, if it depended on the Kildare County Council to promote that scheme, the council bearing 50 per cent. of the costs and expenses of carrying it out, that it would ever be promoted?  After all, that is only a trifling expenditure compared with what it would cost in places like Rosslare and some of the other places mentioned by Deputy Corry and Deputy Desmond in the course of the debate here.  In view of that, the Minister should show a bit of commonsense and deal with this question in a practical way.  He has yet time to do so.</P>
    <P>We have another paragraph here, paragraph (d), which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be a contribution by any owner or occupier of any of the protected lands consisting of the amount received or recovered pursuant to any agreement, between such owner or occupier and the promoting authority, providing for the making by such owner or occupier of a contribution towards such costs and expenses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is making the Bill even more ridiculous because it is bringing in a third party.  It is bad enough to bring in the local authorities, but to bring in individuals and have collected from them sums apportioned on a calculation made out in decimals which many of them would not understand, no matter how you would try to bring it home to them, is fantastic.  It would not satisfy any of them.  Certainly they <Col N="2300" /> would not be prepared to pay and I am sure no county council will embark on promoting a scheme, no matter how much they desire to carry it out and how much they wish to protect the people concerned, if this proviso is here.  They know very well what their difficulty would be.</P>
    <P>In the first place, perhaps only four or five councillors would be directly concerned with the area.  There would be, anywhere, perhaps from 20 to 40 county councillors who would not be directly concerned and they have to think of the ratepayers.  They have to consider their position when going forward for election and that is a point which weighs with everybody who offers himself as a candidate.  No matter how sympathetic they might be, they would not be prepared to go as far as they are expected to go in this section, and one of the things they know they could not succeed in would be the collecting of money from the people.  The people would not agree to it, in my opinion. You might get one, two or three out of 30 or 40, but the remainder would never agree to that.</P>
    <P>In view of that, I think the Minister should delete that sub-section altogether and then we would be coming somewhat nearer to the objective it is desired to achieve.  I remember the 1925 Act and the schemes carried out under it, and I know what happened. I know the people concerned whose lands benefited, or were expected to benefit, and they had all kinds of arguments to put up.  Many of them suggested that there was favouritism. They organised together and they were determined that they would not allow the seizure to take place, or if it did, that it would only succeed after violent resistance.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister want to have something like that happen again?  I do not believe it will go as far as that because I do not believe any county councillor would go so far as to promote a scheme while this present section remains in its present form.  The Minister may be very anxious to do something about this.  I am sure everybody here who understands the problem is also very anxious to do something about it, but we are not going <Col N="2301" /> the proper way about it and it would be better not to attempt it than to attempt it in the manner in which it is being attempted.</P>
    <P>The last day this Bill was under discussion the Minister taunted Fianna Fáil with not having done anything. He mentioned that I was over in the Board of Works for three years and made no move.  I would like to tell the Minister that I would not support a measure of this kind, never mind sponsor it, because I do not think it is good enough to carry on a game of make-believe, and that is about all this measure is in its present form if Section 19 is not very considerably amended.  Any Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil was drafted to accomplish and serve a purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>To have the work properly carried out, even though it might take a considerable period to do it, but it is better to do the thing properly at the outset than to have a very feeble effort of this kind.  As I said, the Minister has yet time to make this Bill a workable measure.  If he refuses to do so, I can only come to the very obvious conclusion that he does not want it to work and that it is only mere eye-wash.  Although I have no expert or technical advice, or proof, I firmly believe that to tackle the position in Rosslare would cost something in the region of £150,000 or £200,000. How does the Minister expect the Wexford County Council is going to undertake to pay 50 per cent. of that money and try to get from the rated occupiers a certain percentage of that £75,000? What is the good of bringing in a measure of this kind and rendering it unworkable and impracticable from the very first?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose we will be taunted also if we vote against this section, but I feel we are obliged to vote against it if the Minister does not give way, because there is no use whatever in being a party to putting through a measure of this kind which we know is damned at the very outset, and that is what is happening.  Of course, they may go through the country and say : &ldquo;Oh, <Col N="2302" /> well, Fianna Fáil voted against this very desirable measure.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil is not voting against the principle of the Bill, but it is very anxious that it should be made a Bill which can be operated and any misrepresentation carried on about Fianna Fáil voting against this Section 19 will not weigh very much because the people have memories which are sufficiently long to understand what happened in regard to the Barrow and numerous schemes carried out under the 1925 Act.</P>
    <P>I said here on the Money Resolution that perhaps this was not altogether on a par with arterial drainage, but it is very nearly on a par, in certain cases. I have mentioned one specific case, that is, Rosslare, and while I said I have no proof as to what the cost would be, I believe it would be a colossal amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was estimated to cost £350,000 in 1930.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is worth doing at all, it is worth doing properly, even though the cost is great.  After all, Rosslare is only one part of County Wexford.  If coast erosion got a grip, it might not be so many years&mdash;and even 100 years is not long in the life of a nation&mdash;until Wexford itself might be in danger.  For that reason, I am appealing to the Minister to use his better judgment and to accede to the appeals made to him.  I do not want to prolong this debate or to be branded as an obstructionist, but I say that in a measure of this kind I firmly realise my responsibility, which is to voice my opinions here and to repeat my appeal to the Minister to make the Bill a workable Bill by amending this section and putting in the proper financial provisions that will make it workable, or if not, withdraw the Bill altogether.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Beegan pointed out, this is the operative section of the Bill, but, before we go on to discuss it, I should like to ask the Minister a question.  In his opening speech on Second Reading, he quoted the report of an inter-departmental committee.  Was that report ever published?  We are <Col N="2303" /> entitled to have that report.  As far as I know, it was never tabled in the Dáil and I would suggest to the Minister that he should table it in the Dáil, because it is a public document. It is the only report that is available since the setting up of the State and it should be tabled in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be found. There was no record of it ever being tabled.  Section 19 sets out the finances of this measure.  Apart altogether from the finances within the other sections, most of us feel it is an unworkable Bill, but Section 19 certainly puts the &ldquo;kibosh&rdquo; altogether on it as a workable Bill.  The Minister can assure himself that, in the lifetime of the nation, there will be little or no money ever spent under this Bill.  No self-respecting local authority, where a major scheme is needed in their area, would undertake the responsibilities of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that it is a permissive Bill, that the matter is in the hands of the local authority and that if they want to save their community from the ravages of the sea, they must provide 50 per cent. of the cost.  There are about ten maritime counties as far as I know, having either long or short seaboards.  They may have some erosion more or less. The one at Rosslare in the County Wexford is, I think, the major one. It is known in the whole country at the present time and it is the one in <Col N="2304" /> the most critical condition.  Those ten counties have, I suppose, a valuation of roughly one-third or possibly two-fifths of the total poor law valuation of the land in the whole country, and why should any single one of those maritime counties be forced, in order to save their local community, to tax that individual community for the purpose of coast erosion?</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by Deputy Beegan, that was tried before now in the matter of arterial drainage and it was shown, after experience ranging over a number of years, that it was a complete and absolute failure.  The 1925 Barrow Drainage Act provided for a 50 per cent. contribution from the lands affected.  That went on for a number of years.  The people living along the Barrow whose lands were said to be improved by the first Barrow drainage rose up in arms, and rightly so.  They found they were unable to carry the burden placed upon them under the Barrow Drainage Act, 1925, and Deputy Sweetman, as he was then, in this House was one of the most vigorous members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

Will he advocate that?  Will he sponsor a Bill to put half the cost of arterial drainage on the ratepayers in the counties where this drainage is going on, including Kildare and Carlow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question in this section.  The Minister knows quite well.  He was a member of a local authority for a number of years.  Time after time in this House, he was most vocal about the burden the ratepayers had to carry.  When it is found to be necessary to protect the coast and the property of the people, the only means the central Government could find of financing that is to put half the burden on the ratepapers.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think for a moment that there is a single local authority in this country which will ever pass the necessary resolutions in order to bring this Bill into force or have anything done under it?  He knows quite well that the taxable capacity of the local authority and of the ratepayer is very limited.  He is surely aware that at the present time they are taxed to the very absolute limit and that the lands in any of the counties of Ireland are taxed to the limit.  The Minister is fully aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here and there around the coast, owing to the ravages of the sea, it is necessary to put up coast protection works in order to protect lives and public property.  We have Rosslare <Col N="2306" /> port, which is public property.  I think it is owned jointly by C.I.E., which is a State institution, and the Great Western Railway of England.  All authorities are agreed that it was the erection of that port which was responsible, and is still responsible, for the erosion at Rosslare, but there is not one single word in this Bill to suggest that the port of Rosslare, whoever owns it, should contribute anything towards the protective works that are necessary further north of Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <P>There is not a single word in this Bill to suggest that C.I.E.&mdash;whose main railway line between Killinick and Wexford is within 200 yards of the seacoast at the present time, at that erosion point and in danger of being swept away&mdash;should contribute to the cost of the protection work.  No, it is the landowners and small farmers who must pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Harbour authorities are mentioned, but there is no harbour authority whatever in Rosslare.  It is only harbours such as Wexford Harbour that come in.  The Wexford Harbour Board is not able to run a pilot boat or pay a pilot, and yet they are asked to contribute.  They are suggested as a contributing authority, while they cannot buy oil to run a pilot boat.  The small landowners and the small farmers of Rosslare, whose land is being washed away for many a year, will be asked to contribute, like the riparian owners of long ago on the River Barrow.  They will be mulcted because protective works are to be put up to protect their lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under paragraph (d) of this section, there will be a contribution from the owner or occupier of any of the protected lands.  It is hoped to protect the village of Rosslare some time by protective works, but the owners of that village, or of the property and housing in that village, are not being asked.  I do not suggest they should <Col N="2307" /> be asked.  I do not think any local person whatever should be asked.  The State is charged with the responsibility of protecting all the people of this country.  It is their fundamental duty to protect the people in whatever way they can manage to do so.  It is their duty to provide for it out of taxation just as they do to maintain an army or a police force, war equipment, prisons and all the rest.  It is the State's duty to provide protective works to protect the people's property and to protect the State from the ravages of the sea, just as they would protect it from an invader, however he might come in.  That is the fundamental duty of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not serious on this Bill at all.  In introducing this Bill, he told us that the committee set up in 1929 to deal with coast erosion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...recommended that the Government should not assume general responsibility for the protection of the coast against inroads of the sea, but they envisaged circumstances in which individual property owners might undertake works of coast protection subject to Government control or the State might contribute towards the cost and in cases undertake such works itself.  In the case of applications for State assistance the committee suggested that the following considerations might properly govern a decision, namely, that the object to be attained is of national importance, that it could be attained at a cost which is not greater than the purpose warrants, and that the persons whose property is to be protected cannot afford to defray the whole cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is taken from Column 928 of the Dáil Debates for the 14th November. They recommended that the Government should do nothing, or that the persons whose property was protected would have to defray the cost.  I think they were a rather silly committee, even to suggest, in regard to any place, any piece of property, that the private owner should be obliged to protect that property against the ravages of the sea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2308" /> The Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government take the view, and the present Bill has been framed on that basis, that the obligations in respect of coast erosion which might be assumed by the State should be restricted to cases of serious erosion as distinct from storm damage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We scarcely can disagree with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister further said that the responsibility was being put on the local authority in the Bill to initiate the scheme.  Now, the burden on local authorities, as a result of State activity over the years, has been quite considerable.  Why should any maritime county&mdash;there are only nine or ten of them&mdash;be compelled by legislation of this House, to build protective works? The local authorities are asked to provide houses for the people.  Of course, the former Government, in its wisdom and judgment, knowing quite well that the local ratepayers were unable out of their own resources to house the people in any particular area, provided that three-fourths of the cost of housing the people in an area would be borne by the State.  Local authorities are charged with responsibility for providing water and sanitation and they are getting 40 per cent. of the cost from the State for that purpose. The same principle runs right through and we find that 50 per cent. of the cost of all hospital services and medical services of all kinds is paid by them.  Lo and behold, it is suggested now that the local authority should be charged with 50 per cent. of the cost of putting up protective works against the sea.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not set out any limit whatever.  We know that experts who examined the erosion in Rosslare in the year 1931 estimated in that year&mdash;and that is a long time ago now&mdash;that it might cost anything in the neighbourhood of £350,000.  I suppose things have increased at least four time in cost since that day.  Therefore, on the basis of the 1931 expert opinion given as to the cost of protective works at Rosslare, those works might cost in the region of £1,000,000 or £1,250,000 today. That is the situation down there.  For the Minister coolly to suggest to this <Col N="2309" /> House that the ratepayers of County Wexford should be saddled with £500,000 or £600,000 or the repayment of a loan to that extent, is just nonsense. No self-respecting local authority, that ever may be elected in that county when we are all dead and gone, will ever undertake or ever could undertake to put on the ratepayers in the county, where three-quarters of the rate comes from the land of the county, the burden of the cost of protective works in Rosslare.</P>
    <P>The least the Minister might do to end this is to do as Deputy Beegan said.  We will end this right away if the Minister will stand up and say that the State will pay more under certain circumstances for major erosion work, and that he is proposing to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage that in such cases the State is prepared to go more than 50 per cent. or more than 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>This nation this year out of the Central Exchequer is proposing to spend £140,000,000 for the protection of the people.  The most the Wexford County Council were able to raise out of the rates this year was about £350,000.  They were very concerned about having to raise that amount of money.  They spent days and days on the estimate, trying to get it down a penny or twopence&mdash;a farthing or a halfpenny here and there.  They were concerned with the burden they had to put on the people.  They knew intimately the conditions they lived under and how difficult the people found it to pay these rates.  Surely, if this nation and the central Government can afford to spend £140,000,000 on the protection of the people&mdash;it all cannot be claimed to be spent for anything else but the protection and the welfare of the people&mdash;they could at least afford to put up the cost of major protective works in any part of the coast around the Twenty-Six Counties, wherever needed.</P>
    <P>That is the case which we can make, and make very well, against the provisions in these sections.  If this Bill is passed&mdash;and I suppose the Minister will steamroll it through with a majority behind him&mdash;Dáil Eireann at some future date, when it knows that <Col N="2310" /> routine work has to be done and cannot be done under this Bill, will have to amend the legislation, just as the Fianna Fáil Government in the past had to amend the principle of arterial drainage legislation.</P>
    <P>The balance of the money will be contributed by the promoting authority.  It will be very hard to find a promoting authority which will promote anything under this Bill when they know what the burden will be. Even the most reasonable of elected local authorities in this country will consider they have no moral obligation or duty to pass the necessary resolutions provided for under this Bill, in order to burden their people, ratepayers large or small, some of whom may live 40 miles away from where the erosion is taking place.  They will not put an extra shilling or two shillings or three shillings in the £ on them.</P>
    <P>When the Minister came into the House with this measure he did so under pressure from the Deputies from County Wexford, from his own Party and every other Party and from the people who were seriously affected in the port of Rosslare.  C.I.E. have also brought this erosion to the Minister's notice because unless protective works are put up the port will be cut off from the railway and this port is the gateway of the shortest route across to England.  The port will have to be abandoned by the railway.  Representations have bene made also to the Government by the owners of the port, and strong representations have been made by the residents of Rosslare village pointing out that the erosion of the past 30 years has reached crisis stage and that something must be done about it immediately.  If, with the best will in the world, the Minister gave 100 per cent. this Bill would mean it would take two years to bring any scheme into operation.  It is meant to be a delaying Bill and it needed no other section than Section 19 to prevent it from functioning.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will go to the Government and get sanction for a better scheme rather than take up the attitude of mind that we have found in the Department of Finance in all my experience in this House, the attitude that the local authorities and the land <Col N="2311" /> are not bearing a burden half heavy enough and should be capable of carrying, or made to carry, more of the burden that should properly be borne by the State and the Central Exchequer. It is quite plain that that also was the attitude of mind that dominated the inter-departmental committee that considered coast erosion from 1929 to 1931.  Perhaps even at this late stage the Minister will see his way to indicate to the Dáil that he will bring in an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to say just one other word. I cannot see under this section that any other local authority will contribute towards coast erosion work at Rosslare.  There is no use in the Minister pleading that.  The local landowners, with only two or three acres that may be saved will not contribute; the harbour authority will not contribute; Wexford Corporation will not contribute.  There is no other authority to contribute so that the full burden will be left on the county council in this case, but I can assure the Minister that they will never contribute, and the Minister will never be asked to contribute, anything unless he alters the financial provisions of the Bill as circulated.</P>

      <P>I will, and I will show the hollowness and the hypocrisy <Col N="2314" /> that has come from that side of the House.  I would ask Deputies to look at Volume 132 of the Official Report, which includes the report for Wednesday, 4th June, 1952.  I think, if I am not mistaken, Deputy Beegan was then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I am pretty certain that at that date he had the honour of being there.  On that occasion, Deputy Dr. Esmonde put this question to the Taoiseach, as reported at column 437 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dr. Esmonde asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate whether any Department of State has been made responsible for the prevention of coast erosion, and whether if there is at present no responsible Department he will, as a matter of extreme urgency, indicate the Government's intention in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a reply first by Deputy Donnchadh O Briain who was Parliamentary Secretary to the then Taoiseach, Deputy E. de Valera.  Then followed a great many supplementaries. The matter ends with Deputy E. de Valera saying, as reported at column 439: &ldquo;The present position is that the local authorities and the private owners are responsible.&rdquo;  That is the view of Fianna Fáil.  That is the view which I have altered in this Bill by coming to this House and saying for the first time that the Exchequer will give a grant in accordance with the terms of this section.  Deputy Beegan &mdash;I said it on previous occasions and I will say it again&mdash;is an honourable Deputy.  In the light of that quotation from his Leader, should he not now withdraw the allegations he made?</P>

I think the Minister should go and that this Bill is a definite instance of the manner in which public money has been squandered in this country.  The idea of assembling Deputies here week after week to consider legislation of <Col N="2315" /> this kind, which the Minister himself knows is unworkable, is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>The Minister has just quoted a statement made by the Taoiseach at that time&mdash;and the Taoiseach, please God, next February.  That is putting a very short run on you.  The Minister quoted a date&mdash;4th June, 1952.  That was the period when we discovered that Deputy Sweetman and his colleagues had borrowed £72,000,000 to run this bit of an island for three and a half years.</P>

      <P>Since I spoke here last week on this matter I have done a little investigation in my constituency. I have found one farmer in Glounthane with land purchased under a Compulsory Purchase Act in relation to which the tenant appealed to have portion of the money held over from the landlord for the upkeep of the embankments on that estate.  The Land Commission refused.  Since then, there have been two major breaks in that embankment.  On each occasion, the Land Commission came down and endeavoured to compel that tenant to consent to an increase in his annuity in order that that embankment be repaired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a list of them here &mdash;no less than 18 in my constituency&mdash; on this line.  Under paragraph (d) of this section&mdash;the unfortunate man having been prohibited by the State from holding back any money from the landlord for the purpose of maintaining embankments&mdash;the State now proposes to relieve the Land Commission of their responsibilities in that regard and to compel the unfortunate man again to contribute.  The ratepayers of Cork County have to pay the money the landlords looted with the assistance of the Land Commission.  At present the Land Commission have their responsibilities on those estates.  Under this Bill they are being relieved of them. That responsibility is being taken off the shoulders of the State and transferred to the shoulders of the unfortunate tenants and the ratepayers of the county.</P>
      <P>In Rosslare there is another estate in exactly the same position.  The embankment is broken down at present and some 35 acres are flooded by the tide.  The unfortunate tenant has to pay rates on a valuation of over 30/- per acre on that land and has to pay the Land Commission annuities on it. Until we succeed in compelling the Land Commission to repair the embankment, that is the burden on the unfortunate widow woman down there.</P>
      <P>The same position obtains throughout the coast line of my constituency, East Cork.  Estate after estate is in the same position.  There is the Gaskell Estate, four estates in Little Island, three in Ballymacoda and two in Ballintubber.  The responsibility of the Irish Land Commission in respect of those estates is now being transferred to the ratepayers of the county and to the tenants on those holdings. That is the purpose of this Bill.  This is not a Bill to stop coast erosion.  It is a Bill, very thinly camouflaged indeed, to relieve the State of its burdens and put them on the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2317" /> I gave an instance here last week of the position regarding Youghal.  The Minister says that Fianna Fáil did nothing.  I quoted the case of Clonard, Youghal, to him last week.  The whole of the cost of that was borne by the State, and that was done under Fianna Fáil.  Let us see where we are drifting under this Bill.  It is an outrage.  I am not concerned with what anybody said on the Second Reading.  The day the Second Reading was going through I was doing my bit to get rid of the Minister.  I think the order he got from Carlow-Kilkenny on that date should stick in his mind for a long time.  I am now concerned with a very thinly veiled endeavour in this Bill to relieve the State of very grave financial responsibility.</P>
    <P>Let us see where we are.  I wonder would the Minister get from his colleague, the Minister for Lands, the amount of money that had to be expended on the repair of embankments in that area during the past five years? Then we will get some idea of the burden that has to be thrown on the shoulders of the ratepayers of Cork County.  Deputy Allen alluded to the position in Rosslare.  If the Minister went to the trouble of looking up the appeal made by the people of Youghal in regard to the coast erosion at Clarecastle, Youghal, he surely is aware that the railway line there is also very dangerously threatened.  Is he prepared to take any steps whatever? Is it because C.I.E. are now Government controlled that they are not to bear any portion of the burden in connection with the repair of that embankment or the stoppage of that erosion?  Can the Minister show me any section of the Bill under which that unfortunate urban council in Youghal, with their £46 from a penny in the £, can compel C.I.E. to come in and contribute to the £15,000 they will have to find under those proposals?</P>

      <P>Just in case there might be any suggestion that anybody other than Deputy Eamon de Valera took that line in relation to the responsibility for coast erosion, it might be as well if I read portion of column 437 of the same volume to which I have already referred.  Deputy Donnchadh O Briain said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Responsibility for the prevention of coast erosion rests, generally, with the owners of the property affected, who may be a private individual or concern, a transport undertaking or a local authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A local authority, clearly, can come in under clause (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 19, no matter what Deputy Corry may say.</P>

      <P>I am going to finish what I am saying.  I also would like to put on record another sentence that I had not seen when I was quoting Deputy Eamon de Valera before.  In column 439, Deputy Eamon de Valera, as Taoiseach, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present position is that the local authorities and the private owners are responsible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he addressed a question, which would be a very pertinent one, perhaps, to address to Deputy Corry, in view of the remarks he has been making here this evening:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should like to know&mdash;as a matter of interest, if the Deputy can tell me&mdash;what the local authorities have been doing about it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was then addressing Deputy Esmonde, but I would suggest that Deputy Corry should answer that question now from his leader, Deputy de Valera.  That was the view on the 4th June, 1952 of Deputy Eamon de Valera, as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, in Government, and until such time as Deputy Eamon de Valera comes into this House and repudiates his view, I am entitled to take, and I will take, that as being the official view of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

The Minister should accept his responsibility and bring in legislation to enable protective works to be erected. They cannot be erected under this Bill.  No self-respecting local authority will accept responsibility for imposing the burden that is proposed in Section 19 on the ratepayers and small farmers because the burden on them at the moment is greater than they can bear.  The Minister should be ashamed, on behalf of a Government that is spending £140,000,000 in the present year, moryah! protecting the people and their rights, that the Exchequer cannot afford to provide ways and means of erecting coast protection works to protect the property and lives of the citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When I became Minister for Lands in 1948, one of the first problems that came before me was a matter of coast erosion, the repair of embankments in County Kerry.  The history of that case was that, in 1942, a particularly strong sea made a breach in an embankment and flooded about 200 acres of land.  A Land Commission inspector was sent out to investigate. His report was that £180 would repair the breach, provided the work was put in hands within a week.  Deputy Allen's Government was in power from February, 1942, to the end of 1948.  When the change of Government came about in 1948, I and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, were saddled with the responsibility of providing £17,000 to repair a half-mile of the embankment, which was perfect in 1942, but which, with every tide during all those years, had been wiped out.  Now Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen are very concerned about coast erosion. There was one glaring instance.  Much the same thing happened in Rossbanagher, in Clare, and in several other places.</P>
      <P>It appears that when these Deputies are in opposition, the Government has a very big responsibility to do certain things, but when their Party is in Government, they allow wholesale waste to occur.  A few hundred pounds spent at the right moment would save the expenditure of huge sums later on.  I fail to see how their anxiety can be justified under the Bill now before the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Afforestation Programme: Transfer of Responsibility&mdash;Motion (resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was proposed <Col N="2323" /> by Deputy MacBride on 5th December, 1956:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the importance of afforestation to the national economy and of the necessity for securing a rapid expansion of the afforestation programme, Dáil Eireann requests the Government to examine the advisability of transferring the responsibility for the carrying out of the National Afforestation Programme to any one of the following: (1) a separate Ministry, (2) a separate State sponsored corporation analogous to Bord na Móna or the E.S.B., (3) a specially constituted Forestry Commission, (4) Bord na Móna; and Dáil Eireann requests the Government to report the result of such examination as soon as it is completed to both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate was resumed on the following amendment proposed by Deputy Moylan on that date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To delete all the words after &lsquo;That&rsquo; and substitute: &lsquo;a Select Committee of Dáil Eireann, consisting of 15 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom five shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to inquire into, consider and report upon the whole question of afforestation in relation to the national economy; to indicate, having regard to any social consequences, the objectives to be aimed at and the organisation and administration best calculated to attain these objectives; and to furnish their report to Dáil Eireann within six months from the date of their appointment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned on the last occasion, I was submitting to the House that there was no case for either the motion or the amendment. Indeed, I expected a good and useful debate on this, but that debate has not materialised so far.  There is now only a little over an hour and a half left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about one aspect of this debate and that is the suggestion that forestry should be <Col N="2324" /> handed over to Bord na Móna.  I am very interested in this principally because I am a farmer.  I do not think that Bord na Móna is the body best suited to do the work that is at present done by the Forestry Branch. The best body to carry out afforestation is the present forestry staff.  They have nothing of which to be ashamed. On the contrary, they have everything of which to be proud.  They have done a very excellent job of work.  Deputy MacBride gives certain reasons why Bord na Móna should be in charge of forestry but, despite the reasons he advanced, that is the last thing I would like to see happen.</P>
    <P>I do not want to level charges against anybody but I think I should bring to the attention of the House the fact that the only advantage Bord na Móna has as compared with the present Forestry Division is their method of acquiring land.  Deputy O'Hara on 14th March last asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If he will state in respect of each county (a) the area of bog in the possession of Bord na Móna, (b) the average price per acre paid to the former owners, (c) the estimated average tonnage of saved turf which one acre is capable of producing and (d) the price per ton paid for saved turf last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied that the average price paid per acre was £1 irrespective of county or location.  That is the cash side of it.</P>
    <P>What disturbs me still more is the powers Bord na Móna have under Section 30 of the Turf Development Act, 1946.  That section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At any time before conveyance of ascertainment of price or compensation, the Board may, subject to the subsequent provisions of this section and for the purpose of exercising or performing any of his functions, do all or any of the following things:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) enter on and take possession of any land;</P>
    <P>(b) exercise any right which the Board is authorised by this Act to acquire;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2325" /> (c) terminate, restrict or otherwise interfere with any easement or other property or right which the Board is authorised by this Act to terminate, to restrict or otherwise interfere with;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on in sub-section (3) the Act stipulates that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board shall not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) enter on or take possession of any land under this section without giving to the occupier of such land at least one month's, or, in the case of an occupied dwelling-house, three months' previous notice in writing of its intention to do so,&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Section 29 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Board, for the purpose of exercising or performing any of its functions, may do all or any of the following things.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If forestry were handed over one of the things they could do would be to acquire land permanently or temporarily and either by a greement or compulsorily.  They &ldquo;may do all or any of the following things&rdquo; and one <Col N="2326" /> of the things they can do is to take possession of land.  I do not like to say that Deputy MacBride is not aware of the Turf Development Act but I think he did not advert to the very sweeping powers given under that Act, powers which would be exercised by a State body against an ordinary small farmer.</P>
    <P>I know that in my own county Bord na Móna have walked in and plastered a notice on a gate-post stating that within one month from a certain date the property would become the property of Bord na Móna.  Perhaps there is good reason for that in the case of Bord na Móna.  They take over bog and we know that there are vast stretches of virgin bog all over the country of which the owners make little use.  Indeed, some of these bogs were a death trap for the owners' stock more than anything else.  Provided a reasonable price was paid the activities of Bord na Móna may have been of benefit because, when they take over these bogs they usually fence them.</P>
    <P>No matter how poor agricultural land it, it would be a very serious thing to take it over for the State.  I pointed out on a previous motion that the Land Commission does not acquire land for itself or for the State.  It acquires land to relieve congestion and to benefit other people.  As Minister for Lands, I am only too well aware of the attacks that are made upon me, the Commissioners and the Land Commission inspectors for doing even that.  To give such a sweeping power of acquisition of land for forestry purposes would only lead to serious trouble.  Indeed, I doubt if any proposed measure along those lines would pass through this House.  While many outside have not perhaps a very high opinion of this House, the majority of Deputies and all Governments can always be relied upon to come down on the side of right; that is, the side of law, and on the side of humanity where the State is dealing with human beings.  This would be a very dangerous power to give.</P>
    <P>I do not hold myself out to be an authorty on this matter but I cannot let the occasion pass without bringing to the notice of Deputies the vast <Col N="2327" /> powers Bord na Móna have for taking over land.  It is the poorest of our farmers who own the land most suitable for forestry.  I pointed out on a previous occasion that, if we are to run our country properly, arable land should be devoted entirely to producing food for human consumption.  Semi-arable land should be improved and those who own it should get every encouragement from the Government to get from it the maximum production possible.  The bulk of the waste land should, if those who own it will sell it voluntarily, be utilised in growing timber.  I am a firm believer in that.  Perhaps time will prove me wrong.  I believe that a vast area of mountain land and cutaway bog would, if the people would sell it to us voluntarily, be better employed in growing timber.  We will have to squeeze a good deal of cash out of the taxpayers' pockets to grow timber on some of that land, but if we fail to do it in our time, it will be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>If the steps which we are now taking to grow forests had been taken 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago, we would not now be paying out £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 a year for our timber requirements. We are spending a sizable sum in establishing forestry, but I would not subscribe to the proposition that we should use the methods or the powers which Bord na Móna have. These two bodies are in a far different position.  Forestry is a long-term business.  The tree we plant this winter will not be cut down for 50 years to come and it is only the State which could possibly afford to wait that length of time for a return on its money.  The E.S.B., if it puts up a plant, if it puts up a turf-burning station or an oil-burning station, can get current from that station in a matter of weeks or months.  The same is true of Bord na Móna, but forestry is a different proposition.  Forestry means establishing something now the returns from which will not come in for a long time to come.  It will be 15 to 20 years before the first thinnings come out of the forests that we are planting now and that is a long time to wait.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <P>A few weeks ago, the forestry people in Britain had to admit that they had to cut back last year on what they did the year before and that they would have to cut back this year on what they did last year.  We have not got the same vast acres of land that they have, in Scotland particularly, where in Berwickshire, an English nobleman, handed over 100,000 acres for forestry in one bloc.  There are no such suitable estates in this country.  We have now reached the stage where we are thankful to get 50 or 100 acres from the small farmers. There is no reasonable comparison between this country and England, either as regards our forestry needs or the availability of land.</P>
      <P>A few figures in regard to the amount of work being carried out will not be out of place.  The whole House seems to be well satisfied with the progress of our programme, with the exception of one or two Deputies.  I do not want to paint a glorious picture or yet a gloomy one, but the figures I propose to give will convince most Deputies that a smashing great job of work is being, and has been done, in the last few years.</P>
      <P>In regard to the acquisition of land, in the year 1947-48, 7,497 acres were acquired; in 1949-50, the acreage was 9,152; in 1950-51, it was 21,601; in 1951-52, 19,107; in 1952-53, 19,418; in 1953-54, 20,444; in 1954-55, 17,497; in 1955-56, it was almost 20,000 acres and in the first six months of this year we have acquired over 10,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the acreage planted &mdash;1947-48, it was 6,000 acres; in 1948-49, 7,736; in 1949-50, 7,392; in 1950-51, 9,000 acres approximately; in 1951-52, it was 14,992; in 1952-53, 12,488; in <Col N="2329" /> 1953-54, 12,449; in 1954-55, 13,500; in 1955-56, 15,000, and for the present year, 17,500 acres.  Next year, we hope to reach 20,000 acres; the following year, 22,500 acres; and the year after, 25,000 acres.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Vote has grown in the same proportion.  In 1946-47, it was £344,260; in 1950-51, it was £699,865; in 1954-55, it was £1,436,050; in 1955-56, it was £1,731,954 and this year, it is £2,066,004.</P>
    <P>Employment has kept pace with these other figures.  In 1949-50, the number employed was 1,966; in 1951-52, it was 3,338; in 1954-55, it was 4,049; and last year it was 4,258.  This year, when planting is in full swing in January and February, the number of men employed will be about 5,300 and next year there will be almost 6,000 men employed.  I think that is a good rate of progress.</P>

      <P>If a start had been made in 1908, when Avondale was given to the State, goodness knows what our target would be to-day.  There would be a much more pleasant picture to-day because the huge sums of money which we have to pay over to foreign countries for our timber requirements would now be kept at home.  However, it is not much good to us to talk now of what was and was not done in the past.  I could say, it is a pity that the generation of 100 or 150 years ago did not get our freedom for us instead of the generation of 1916-21.  However, we must take the country as we find it to-day and take our financial resources as we find them and try to put our house in order now.</P>
      <P>There have been vast changes in practically every sphere of life during the past 40 years.  It is a pity that forestry was not tackled with the same enthusiasm in those days as the steam-rolling of roads, the building of schools and many other matters: The answer to it is that Governments could not do everything in one day.  What is true of individuals applies equally to Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride quoted Mr. Roy <Col N="2330" /> Cameron on several occasions in the course of his remarks.  Personally, I do not think those quotations helped the case he is making for his motion. Mr. Cameron was here for only a few days.  He arrived in Dublin on the 25th July, 1950, and after spending a few days in Dublin meeting the Minister for Lands, various other Ministers and the Taoiseach, he went on his tour from which he returned on 5th August. Altogether he was here nine days going through some of the forests.  I must say that the technical advice he gave us was very good.  We owe him a debt of gratitude for it.  He touched on some aspects of the problem but some of his views brought a smile to my face. In paragraph 76, of his report he said that the Forestry Division in Ireland was not free from the frustrations of departmental procedure.</P>

The reason why Mr. Cameron referred to these delays was that at that time the forestry technicians were looking for £136,000 with which to buy tractors and heavy machinery.  The Department of Finance naturally had to look into such an application and I remember at the time that there was a delay of a few weeks while the Department of Finance inquired what the machinery was required for.  Perhaps I lost my temper as did the forestry technicians at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, replying to a parliamentary question, said that Bord na Móna had purchased £55,000 worth of machinery and that before it ever left the crates, it was sold later <Col N="2331" /> as scrap for £5,000.  If Bord na Móna can spend £50,000 of the taxpayers' money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attacking the administration of Bord na Móna. Deputy MacBride has asked in his motion that Bord na Móna would be responsible for the administration of forestry.  Speaking to that motion, he quoted from the report of Mr. Cameron in regard to these vexatious delays in the obtaining of funds for the purchase of machinery.  Sometimes such delays rile the best of us, but, in the expenditure of public money, it is very easy for Ministers, with the best intentions in the world, to squander money taken from the pockets of the people.  I myself have seen shocking waste, which I brought to the notice of the authorities responsible. There must be supervision. Human nature being what it is, there should be some form of supervision over the best of us.  There is nobody free from the need for supervision, even in the management of our individual businesses.  Even then, we are not free from supervision because the hardest taskmaster of all is circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am not criticising or running down the administration of Bord na Móna. I was pointing to the reply the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave to a parliamentary question in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get the Deputy's point.  Deputy MacBride made a statement on 5th December last, reported at column 1970 of the Official Report for that day.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When a young man decides to enter for the Civil Service, he sits for an examination for writing assistant or something like that, and <Col N="2332" /> then it is a matter of the toss of a coin whether he will be assigned to the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of External Affairs or the Department of Lands.  That does not seem to me to be the ideal method of recruiting the business executives of a vast undertaking such as forestry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>First of all, that system of recruitment does not apply to forestry.  Young men attached to the Forestry Division are chosen, first of all, for their knowledge of forestry, agriculture and soils.  They are given three years intensive training in Shelton Abbey in County Wicklow.  During those three years, if we find there is something lacking, we do not keep them on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I do not see that there is anything wrong with the manner in which we appoint our young men.  After all, we are all born into the world pretty much the same.  There is no such thing as preconditioning a baby to be a good doctor, to be a good school teacher, to be a good forester or anything else.  We must simply take youngsters as we find them and then fit them into the different conditions of life which suit them&mdash;into business, into professions or even into the Dáil. Deputies should not speak on that line about anybody because none of us here got any preconditioning.  All of us came in here pretty raw.  Perhaps we had certain views outside, but when we found out how the machinery of State works, we got a different slant on the whole thing.  I think the young men and women entering the Civil Service have given excellent service to the State, as good as any soldier in the field of battle.  The unfortunate part is that they work in jobs through which their work is not known or brandished throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan said that social forestry had as much an attraction to him as social silage.  I do not know how much Deputy Moylan knows about <Col N="2333" /> silage, whether social or otherwise, but, while he looks down his nose at social forestry, I should like to point out that it serves a useful part in the peculiar conditions we have in this country.  There is a vast area of land in this country that will not grow commercial timber in the first rotation. There is land which will not give a first-class crop in the first rotation, but when the land is conditioned by the growing of social timber, it will give a very good crop, perhaps in 25 years' time.  I am in favour of planting a very large acreage of that type of timber.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is only the case for the last two or three years.  I know, without being a forestry expert myself, there are mountainsides that will not give first-class commercial timber on the first crop but I do believe if it is sown with timber now, in 20 years' time when the trees reach what foresters think is their full growth, the second rotation will give a first-class crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully cognisant of that but there is a very broad motion and a very broad amendment before us and, if I might say so, there is not enough time spent on talking about forestry here.  I like to speak on it myself and I like to hear other Deputies' views and the views of people outside the House.  We cannot have too much talk on forestry.  As Deputy MacBride has said in his opening remarks it is a pity there was not a great deal more talk about forestry in years gone by.  Now that the iron <Col N="2334" /> is hot, now that forestry has been put on its feet, I would like to keep it that way.  I would not like to let the iron cool or let the enthusiasm that has been aroused cool in this regard. Now that forestry has been established in places were it never was before, it has given the people within a radius of 20 miles around it a new slant on it and has set them thinking that there is something in forestry.  That is a very welcome step in the right direction. While I was never one to cry over spilt milk I like to take things as I find them and set them right to the best of my ability.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moylan asks in his amendment that a Select Committee of Dáil Eireann, consisting of 15 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection should be set up to consider and report upon the whole question of forestry in relation to the national economy.  With all due respect to Deputy Moylan I think the Government is the proper body to do that.  I am the type of person who will examine any project or proposal that is put up to me but while I will certainly ask the Government to consider the first three suggestions in the motion I would be only misleading the mover of the motion if I told him I could recommend the last suggestion, No. 4, to the Government.  I want to give warning in time that I will oppose that whether I am in or out of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must admit that forestry has grown beyond all expectations.  Deputy MacBride says it is a vast undertaking. At the same time in another part of his speech he conveyed the impression that there is something lacking in it. It has become a vast undertaking but it is not a vast commercial undertaking at the moment.  It is a fairly big technical undertaking.  However, I can easily foresee the day when the produce of our present forests will reach stupendous dimensions.  Now is the time to prepare for the day when a tremendous cubic footage of timber will be coming out of our forests and while it is not the case at the moment in a few short years a pretty sizable tonnage of timber of all kinds will be coming out of our forests.  There will <Col N="2335" /> be first, second and third thinnings. There will be mature timber from some of the older woodlands.  Also the earlier plantings will be falling mature soon.  While the earlier plantings will only amount to perhaps 500, 1,000 or a couple of thousand acres, nevertheless they have to be dealt with.  The proper course to take would be to set up some means of disposal of that huge amount of produce, to prepare the way now for it, and then in time to hand over the field work, that is planting, the maintenance and all the care, and so on, of the timber that must be undertaken to the body which in its earlier years is charged with the disposal including the processing of the forest produce.</P>
    <P>Those are the lines upon which my mind has been running for a considerable time past.  I believe that is the proper business approach to the question. The amount of thinnings and timber we are selling at the moment is easily disposed of in the form of pit props, small lots to farmers for fencing, for farm tools, etc., and a certain amount, say 25,000 to 30,000 tons to factories who are processing it into wallboard, newsprint and the like. However, we must face up to the disposal of the huge amount of timber that is coming out.  I would say to the House not to be surprised if a concrete proposal emerges along those lines within the next 12 months but certainly within the next two years to prepare for a situation which is only six to eight years ahead, because this is the time to prepare for it.  As I say, I shall have this motion examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying now that it should be done to the detriment of other districts, but seeing that the matter of stemming the tide of emigration in those areas is so urgent, the <Col N="2336" /> Department should initiate schemes in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that the flight from the land where the land is poor has been one of the greatest goads that has been influencing me in trying to push forestry in those areas.  I would point out, however, that in those areas it is not easy to get the farmers to sell us their land.  That is the big difficulty.  There might be a proposal put forward which I would not consider for a moment, that is, taking their land by force.  I would never consent to that.  We are trying to push forestry into the type of areas the Deputy mentioned.  These areas will not give a first-class crop on the first rotation.  The trees planted for the first time in these hills and valleys which Deputy Flynn has in mind will not give us a first-class crop, and if we do not fall back on Deputy Moylan's much despised social planting nothing will ever be done.  I am falling back on the social programme in those areas.  While the first crop will not give a first-class return, the second rotation, which will come when most of us will be dead and gone, will give a first-class crop of timber.  I think that in pushing forestry into those areas we have done a good day's work.</P>
      <P>In Clare, Donegal, Mayo and Galway where forestry was put in very backward areas for the first time it was even sneered at by some people.  To-day those people who sneered at it, three, four or five years ago, are the loudest in shouting about the benefits forestry can bring to those areas.  It is one way to help those areas as they did not seem to have any great store of mineral wealth, like places in Wales which have cores of iron ore and other valuable minerals.  I sincerely hope the day will come when minerals will be found there but until that day comes I think a Government would be lacking in its duty and would be guilty of gross contempt if it did not do the only thing possible and that is to push forestry in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the motion moved by Deputy MacBride is going to be ineffective whether it is <Col N="2337" /> passed by the House and accepted by the Government or passed by the House and rejected by the Government. All that it asks is that the Government should examine certain administrative machinery and the control of policy; it asks that this should be done over some unspecified time and that, at the end of that time, the Government should report to the Dáil. Everybody will admit that it is time that we should have a fresh look at forestry to see what we are going to do in the future with the scientific knowledge that is now at our disposal and with what I might call the experiments of the pilot plots that have been planted here within the last 30 to 40 years, and in those parts of England, Scotland and Wales that have the climate and general conditions similar to our own.  But if we are to take full advantage of what science and experience have opened up to us for forestry I think we will have to do something more about it than merely to get an unwilling Government to look at vague propositions over an unspecified time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to do it, I think we should do it along the lines suggested in the amendment.  We are getting to the position where all Parties in the House are fairly well agreed that we should get as many trees grown as possible in the shortest possible time.  How that is to be done should be discussed by this committee that we suggest, representative of all Parties in the House, and see whether we can get common agreement upon a policy to do that.  In 1923 and 1924 the Cumann na nGaedheal Government set out as their programme 3,500 acres a year.  They never reached that in their ten years of office.</P>

In the 1930's we trebled the amount of the annual plantation <Col N="2338" /> of land.  In recent years when we got over the effects of the war, and materials again became available, an increase took place in forestry.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious what the Minister would do if this resolution were passed.  He would accept it just as the motion about referring back the Post Office Estimates was accepted in 1949 and they said they would reconsider it.  We know the consideration they gave it when they came in the next morning.  I want to say to the Minister that we should have an inquiry into this matter so that all Parties in the House, and the people of the country, will be satisfied that we are on the right road to getting the trees grown which this country requires for its economy in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course you are going to examine it.  All I want the Minister and those in this House who want to see this thing examined thoroughly to do is to vote for this amendment to get it examined.  We know the playacting the Minister and his colleagues indulge in.  A Minister said to-day&mdash; and I agree with him&mdash;that if we are going to have State forests, whether in charge of a State Department, the present one, or under a special Ministry or by a State company, the principal difficulty that that authority will be up against is the getting of land for afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that if we place more emphasis on the encouragement of individual farmers or groups of farmers to plant their own land we will get much further and get there much faster.  In 1933, I happened to be Acting-Minister for Lands and I put <Col N="2340" /> a proposition to the Government at that time which they accepted and agreed to.  It was that we should give every farmer who was prepared to plant an acre of land a grant of £10. Translated into present day values that £10 is worth £25 and, in my belief, there are at least 200,000 out of the 300,000 odd farmers who, on the average&mdash;if they were given that £25 to-day per acre, with the knowledge that has been gained and if they were given the advantage of getting the right sort of timber&mdash;would plant very much faster than any organisation directly under a Minister or by a State company.</P>
    <P>If you take the amount of money we are paying for forestry at the present time, you will see that it costs us to run the State forests, and plant the 14,000 or 15,000 acres we are planting, £6 per year for every acre over the average of 250,000 acres or so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>About £1,500,000 on about 250,000 acres&mdash;roughly, about £5, or £6 at the maximum, with an annual planting rate of about 15,000 acres.  If we were to give the farmers £25 per acre and if we got sufficient voluntary organisations to help and encourage them to plant, that £1,500,000 would plant 60,000 acres a year.  If our target were 1,000,000 acres we would reach the 1,000,000 acres in about 16 or 17 years.  I do not know how many years it would take, planting at the rate of 15,000 acres per year&mdash;over 60, at any rate.</P>
      <P>There is a history behind the difficulty of getting land.  Our people had such a long struggle to get possession and ownership of the land that they hate to part with it for any purpose or at any price.  The suggestion I make is that we should give to-day's value for the £10 grant which was given in the middle thirties when money was hard to come by, both by Governments and everybody else.  If we did that, we would get a great number of farmers to plant a portion of their land and if the average was only five acres for two-thirds of the farmers of the country it would give us 1,000,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are organisations in this country that have as their object the encouragement <Col N="2341" /> of tree planting.  In my conversations with many members of one organisation I said to them that if, instead of criticising this Government or any other Government, they applied themselves to the problem of, first of all, encouraging people to sell land to the Forestry Department or whatever forestry organisation is there and, secondly, encouraging people to take advantage of the grant that should be there at present values, we would get ahead very much faster.  That is my belief.</P>
    <P>If you look at what are probably the two most afforested areas in Europe, Sweden and France, you will find that a very large percentage of the forests in those countries is individually owned and not State-owned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of the woods are individually-owned by the farmers in these countries.  In south Sweden, where most of the exportable timber comes from, you have 25 per cent. or 50 per cent. of each farm under forest and the other 75 per cent or 50 per cent. is arable land so that you have winter and summer employment in those areas.  If we could develop in that direction, we could have winter employment on the land&mdash;in the forests, planting, thinning, felling and delivering&mdash;and employment in the summer on the agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that if the farmers got reasonable encouragement to plant their own land by giving them this grant of £25, they would do it at the present day because they have seen markets for alternative products which <Col N="2342" /> they can produce whiz up and down in a very rapid fashion.  They have seen eggs slump.  They have seen cattle slump and they have seen the price of turkeys go down with a bang but they know and everybody knows that, having regard to the age in which we live, the products of the forests in the form of timber or wood pulp are growing in consumption every year and are likely to continue to grow still further.</P>
    <P>It would be a good investment were these farmers to put their efforts into planting the trees, if their immediate expenses for trees, wire, and so on were met by this grant.  I think it would be less expensive on the State. If the Minister or his Government happened to be broke, he could always do with the State forests what he did with the chassis factory and the turf machinery.  He could sell the forests and get the money to pay the grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If we get the committee going here in the House, I believe we would get agreement on all sides of the House that no matter what we do in the line of State forests, whether they are to be continued under the Department of Lands, started afresh under a special Ministry or started under a State company, we would also get agreement that in our circumstancs, side by side with the campaign for the development of the State forests, we should have an all-out campaign to develop tree planting by means of the State grant which was £10 as far back as 1933 when the £ was worth two and a half times what it is worth to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the farmer's point of view, if his immediate expenses can be covered forestry is a good investment.  One of the things I would like this committee to do when it is set up, as I hope it will be, is to go much further into the technicalities of forestry than we possibly could do here in this House, dealing with&mdash;I say it without any offence&mdash;a non-technical Minister, a Minister who says what he is advised to say and not what he knows in regard to the very highly technical question of forestry. <Col N="2343" /> A committee of this House could examine the officials of the Forestry Department closely on technical matters; and I may tell you that if I were a member of that committee I would like to pursue what I have often discussed with some of them, that is, why they do not go out for a shorter rotation for pulp wood.</P>
    <P>There are both soft woods and hard woods that will give a very much shorter rotation than a lot of the varieties of timber they are growing to-day and modern technique has evolved systems of dealing with hard woods for pulp as well as with all classes of soft wood.  If we could reduce the rotation of the felling of timber by half, by planting it on reasonably good land, we would reduce the cost of running a pulp mill, because it would be supplied from a very much smaller area than it could be supplied to-day with our forests scattered over great distances.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will set up this committee so that these questions can be pursued, where an answer can be demanded by the committee.  They would have power, under our amendment here, to send for persons, papers and records, and to inquire not only into the questions that Deputy MacBride has in his motion, as to the administrative control of forestry, but into the whole question of afforestation and the objects to be aimed at and any organ or administrative machinery that they deem it wise to inquire into.</P>
    <P>We have a big advantage over Sweden and France in the growing of timber, in that the rate of growth here is very much faster.  There is no country in Europe&mdash;and no country I know of outside New Zealand&mdash;which would give us the same rate of growth of timber for pulping.  If we get after it with the knowledge that has been gained by the technicians in the Forestry Department over these years, if we select the trees suitable to the land that any farmer has and if we can encourage them to plant some part of their reasonably good land that may be rough for other purposes, we will evolve a system of life upon the farms that will give us much more stability <Col N="2344" /> than depending on single items, whether it be cattle, eggs or white turkeys.</P>
    <P>There is a vast goodwill which can be harnessed behind an organisation to grow timber.  It is difficult to harness it behind a State machine.  The State machine is not so constructed that it can hook up with a voluntary organisation too well.  I am perfectly certain that the gentlemen, the officials in the State Forestry Department, have done their best over the years and are as good as any other set of civil servants one could get; but when things go wrong it is the system of organisation which may be at fault and not the individuals running it.  The officials in any machine must run it according to the rules.  In my belief, we could make rapid progress, if advantage were taken of the knowledge and experience they have gained, and if we would listen to the reiterated reply, when Governments and Minister are asked: &ldquo;Why do you not plant more trees?&rdquo; Invariably there is the reply: &ldquo;It is the difficulty of getting land.&rdquo; That is true, it is the difficulty of getting the land.  In my belief the only way to act is to recognise that fact, and if we accept it, we must give the farmer a reasonable grant for planting his own land and the timber will be grown. Then the individual farmer and the community as a whole will get the timber much cheaper than if we were to continue with the present organisation.</P>
    <P>Now, I am quite prepared to admit that an organisation such as Bord na Móna could do a better job than any State Department, whether it is under a Minister directly as a separate Department or is one of the Departments under the control of a Minister.  An organisation of that kind, exercising the powers that the Department of Forestry has, but not subject to immediate requirements to get finance sanction for every penny that has been spent ahead of time, could get ahead very much faster.  That is in the nature of the case.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, I believe that no State organisation or semi-State organisation will make our country worthy to be called a country with <Col N="2345" /> forests, unless we get the land which is in the ownership of about 300,000 people and unless we can encourage them to do their share.  I believe we can do it.  I believe, further, if this amendment of ours is accepted, that we will start on the right road.  I believe there is a fund of goodwill for it, but that goodwill requires to be exploited, and I think a report by such a committee making recommendations as to how forestry was to proceed over the years ahead would become a common policy and we would hear no more about changing it than we do about changing the Constitution.  It would become fundamental policy for every Government and would have universal support.</P>
    <P>I think if Deputy MacBride wants to see forestry go ahead, he will vote for our amendment.  I just want to reiterate that his resolution cannot be effective, whether it is passed or rejected, whether it is passed and accepted by the Government or passed and rejected by the Government. There is no date fixed upon which the ministerial inquiry under the chairmanship of the Minister for Lands would report.  It could report on Tibb's Eve and satisfy the terms of Deputy MacBride's motion, whereas our amendment would have this question examined by 15 men put forward by their Parties, people who have an interest in forestry and have a report back within six months.  They can examine the whole question, send for all the records and for persons, to inquire into and to consider this whole question of policy for the future, the objectives to be attained and the work and administration best calculated to attain these objectives.  That committee must report within six months, not in an indefinite period such as would be the case under Deputy MacBride's original motion.  I put it to the House that anybody who is in favour of getting ahead with this job should vote for this amendment and have it passed. They should accept this amendment and vote for it as a substantive motion when it is put to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is noticeable that this subject of forestry is being discussed much more often in recent years than heretofore.  It is also noticeable that generally there is much more agreement on all sides of the House as to how forestry can best be advanced in this country.  I shall concede right away that Deputy MacBride is a forestry enthusiast.  He has always shown himself to be sincere since I began to read his speeches.  I feel, however, that in his wild enthusiasm to see forestry programmes speeded up, he has quite a wrong slant on at least one vital problem, that is, the problem of land acquisition.</P>
      <P>Coming from one area in County Mayo and living in a congested area, I fully appreciate the difficulties of acquiring land for forestry.  I began my public life in 1942, and one of the things I advocated at that time was expansion of the forestry programme and I remember well how indifferent people were in those years to my appeals.  At the present time, it is true that people have become more forestry minded but the fact is that even yet it is very difficult to convince many of our smallholders that they should sell their land for forestry purposes.  We all appreciate that the bulk of the land which is acquired for forestry is in the one region, in the mountainous areas, and it is to these areas that generations ago many of our people were driven by Cromwell: &ldquo;To Hell or Connacht,&rdquo; to the rugged mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>When they were driven there, they had to eke out a living and down through the years many of these people, our forefathers, cleared those lands, limed them and drained them. Because they had to work so hard, they developed a love for the land and their smallholdings seem really valuable to them, so that when any Department of State or any other body wants to acquire land for forestry purposes or any other purpose, we find many difficulties arise, not the smallest of these being difficulties of title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said in that connection <Col N="2347" /> Deputy MacBride seems to me in any case to have a wrong slant on things if he thinks that because he is anxious, or because I am anxious, or the Minister is anxious to have these lands planted, these people are likely to surrender them easily.  All of us have at least heard of the land war and we have read of how our people resisted the landlords in this country and particularly in my native county.  It was in the Straide area of County Mayo that Michael Davitt&mdash;God rest his soul&mdash;was born.  The people there are traditionally opposed to anybody entering on their property, no matter who he may be, even when he comes from the Forestry Division or from any private or public company such as Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I wish to say, therefore, I feel it would be very wrong to hand over the right to acquire land or the responsibility for planting timber to such a board as Bord na Móna.  I know and appreciate we are not discussing the affairs of Bord na Móna here, but I would like to say, in passing, that in my county they are very unwelcome. They treated many of our tenant farmers, particularly in poor areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the Deputy can discuss Bord na Móna on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>They paid sums of 10/- or 15/- per acre and have treated the people badly, and to hand any further authority to these people would be a move that I, personally, would resent and something the people I represent would resent.  Therefore I say again that I think the ideal body to deal with this situation for the time being is the Forestry Division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should all like to see a little more progress and more and more acres of our mountain lands planted.  However, the difficulty of acquisition arises all the time.  Deputy Moylan referred to it; Deputy Aiken referred to it, and the Minister referred to it.  The greatest difficulty which confronts us is the difficulty of acquisition.  All these Deputies, including the Minister, are from the country.  Though Deputy MacBride is a city Deputy, I am aware <Col N="2348" /> that he has a good idea, generally speaking, of rural conditions, but if he lived among those people, as I do, he would appreciate that that great difficulty exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan&mdash;I want to mention it in support of what I have said&mdash; emphasised an important point in regard to the Cameron Report.  He pointed out that while we should all like to pay tribute to Mr. Cameron, the F.A.O. expert who came to this country and helped us in many ways with his good advice, he certainly knew very little about actual Irish conditions.  That is true: he spent only nine days here altogether.  Lest I should be taken as being critical of Mr. Cameron's report, I want to join with the Minister and others, including Deputy MacBride, in expressing thanks for his valuable report.</P>
    <P>There is nothing easier than to criticise Governments and Ministers, but we should appreciate, too, that successive Governments in this country have made some considerable progress in afforestation.  I pointed out already that when I entered politics in 1942, I found that the people at that time were very reluctant to listen to anybody speaking on forestry.  I appreciate that the Government of the day had their difficulties in convincing the people, regardless of how much goodwill was behind it, of the desirability of the advancement of forestry.  The then Minister and his Government certainly had a problem to convince the people.  I will say, by way of mild criticism, that I think more progress could have been made, but we can take pride in the fact that, with the passage of time, successive Governments and successive Ministers have made progress and that the future, far from being black or bleak, is quite bright.</P>
    <P>Our technical men in this country have gained considerable experience. Deputy Aiken referred to certain experimental plots which we have in certain areas and we are all aware that our technical men have gained a lot of knowledge from these plots.  Questions regarding climatic conditions, the planting of trees adjacent to the sea coast, and so on, have been watched very carefully by our technical <Col N="2349" /> men, who have compiled quite a lot of useful information.  That being so, I feel that, with the passage of time, there will be further and greater progress towards the goal of increased afforestation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to ensure that in future some attempt will be made to reach the targets decided upon by this House and the Government.  In 1949, it was decided that there could be an annual plantation rate of 25,000 acres.  Now, seven years afterwards, we find that we have not nearly reached that target.  The present Minister and former Ministers have all assured us that it is not their fault, or the fault of their Governments, or the fault of their Departments, that the target has not been reached.  If I am to accept that, it points clearly to the unwillingness or the inability or the unsuitability of the present organisation.</P>
      <P>This motion was brought forward to ensure that something will be done to prevent further delays in proceeding with our afforestation programme.  I do not know whether or not the Minister's statement indicates that he proposes to accept my motion.  It is a reasonable motion.  If the Minister does not accept it, then I think he is not fit to be Minister for Lands.  I do not know whether or not he is expressing the view of the Government as a whole, but if the Government refuse to accept the motion, then I think it is an unreasonable Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that, of the speeches made here to-night, I whole-heartedly welcome Deputy Aiken's statement, <Col N="2350" /> which I regard as the most constructive statement made from that side of the House by any member of the Front Bench there so far.  The reason I cannot accept the amendment is that, in my view, it will tend to postpone the consideration of the matter.  For six months, there would be a select committee.  Then it would make its report which would then go to the Government and another six months would be lost.</P>
    <P>I will make this proposition to Deputy Aiken: If the Government do not report back to us on this matter within a fortnight of the House resuming after the Christmas Recess, I am prepared to join in a motion with Deputy Aiken or any member of the House requiring the Government to report back forthwith to this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should like to see a permanent voluntary committee of this House composed of people from all sides who believe in forestry and who would take it upon themselves to keep an eye on forestry, to help it and push it along to the best of their ability in this House.  That suggestion might be considered by members of different Parties.  If we are to take forestry out of the political sphere, I feel we should have such an active body here composed of members from all sides of the House.</P>
