      <P>I have only one brief comment to make on this section.  I gather from a reply which the Minister gave me yesterday to a Dáil question that he anticipates that the bulk of the tax chargeable under this section will <Col N="318" /> fall upon fuel used by manufacturing industry.  There does not appear to be much sense in granting initial allowances on plant and machinery to induce industry to expand its operations while at the same time imposing an extra £500,000 on their costs through this tax.  It is true that other fuels are also increasing in price and that that has induced a number of manufacturing firms to change over to fuel oil in anticipation of saving a substantial amount of their costs.  The effect of the increased duty is to eliminate that saving.</P>
      <P>I have personal knowledge of a number of concerns which had hoped to reduce their costs considerably by changing to fuel oil and where the whole of that saving has been eliminated by this tax.  There may be some consequential advantages from that point of view but, in our circumstances at the present time, it should be the desire of the Government to keep manufacturing costs at their lowest, both from the viewpoint of preventing further increases in the internal price level and for the purpose of encouraging manufacturing firms to seek export markets.  Whatever justification there may be for imposing additional taxes at the present time, it would seem to be thoroughly bad policy to impose them upon the raw materials of manufacturing industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave an estimate of the yield from this increased tax on bets at £150,000.  I am curious about that estimate.  The <Col N="319" /> Finance Accounts show that receipts from the betting tax in the last year for which I have seen the figures were close upon £700,000&mdash;£680,000, if I am correct.  A 33? per cent. increase in the tax, therefore, should bring in or around £220,000 or £225,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points with which I should like the Minister to deal under Section 13.  In the first place, I should like to point out to the Minister that at the present time there are certain monopolies of bookmakers setting up offices in different small towns throughout the State.  I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that, in order to attract new business, and to have an advantage over their rivals, they are offering a tax concession.  This present section is not operative until the 1st July.  At the present time, some of these monopolies, instead of charging 7½ per cent., are offering the punter only 5 per cent. if he bets with them.  I would refer the Minister to Section 24 of the Finance Act of 1926 which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be charged, levied, and paid on and by every bookmaker who makes, lays, or otherwise enters into any bets&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that there is a statutory obligation on the bookmaker under that section to take the full levy of 7½ per cent. from the person who places a bet.  I think this matter is so important that every Deputy in this House must be concerned with it.  There are bookmakers in this country who, for quite a considerable number of years, have been carrying on with one or two offices in <Col N="320" /> these small towns, and now they are faced with these gentlemen coming along and starting 30 to 40 offices. Apparently the object is to get between 150 and 200 offices in this State. I think the Minister should move, and move swiftly, in this matter.  There is no doubt that they are flaunting the law, and in addition to flaunting the law, they are publishing in the local and national Press the fact that they are giving this concession.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I am not quite clear.  The Act of 1926 and the Act of 1941 clearly state that the tax should be paid by the bookmaker. Perhaps an arrangement has been made between the bookmakers and the punters, but it must be only an arrangement, because neither in the Act of 1926, nor in the Act of 1931, nor in the Act of 1941 is there any mention of any change except in the rate of the tax.  Section 24 of the Act of 1926 has not been changed in any way and this Act does not change it except to increase the amount of the levy to 10 per cent.  Sub-section (2) of Section 24 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of this section the amount of a bet shall be the sum of money which by the terms of the bet the bookmaker will be entitled to receive, retain, or take credit for if the event the subject of the bet is determined in his favour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, if I go into a bookmaker's office and have £1 on a horse and the horse loses, the bookmaker pays 10 per cent. on that £1.  Suppose the horse wins at five to one, then I am to get back £6.  The bookmaker, under the present system, pays me £6 less 10 per cent.  I would point out to the Minister that there should be some clarification of this matter.  I maintain that, under Section 24, all the bookmaker is entitled to retain is the tax on the original stake, win, lose or draw.  If I have £1 on a horse and I lose the bookmaker pays the State but if I win at five to one the bookmaker, on behalf of the State, collects the full total from my winnings.</P>
    <P>The yield from this tax will evidently be very close to £250,000 and the public should realise that, in the long run, <Col N="321" /> it is the ordinary man in the street who is paying this out of his own pocket.  In actual fact, this tax is not costing the bookmaker anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act is quite clear.  The Act makes the bookmaker liable for the payment of the percentage on the bet and what arrangement the bookmaker makes between himself and his clients is a matter entirely for himself.  Whether one bookmaker makes one set of arrangements and another bookmaker makes a different set is a matter of the ordinary contract between them.  The bookmaker is bound to pay the State and the bookmaker collects money from the punter.  I hope that the Deputy pays substantial sums on this because it is when he wins that he will pay the tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(&nbsp;)  Entertainment duty will be not charged on payments for admission to any ball or dance where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the whole of the net proceeds of such ball or dance are to be devoted to a charitable purpose.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the intention is that this dance tax will not apply to dances run for charitable or educational purposes.  When the tax was in operation before there was a similar relief but, by regulation, the Revenue Commissioners provided that that relief would become operative only when 50 per cent. of the receipts of the dance was paid to the charity or educational purpose for which it was run.  It seems to me that by that regulation the Revenue Commissioners have gone a long way to negative the intention of the legislation.  Assuming that a similar regulation will apply in the future it means that a number of dances run for charitable purposes will be subject to the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> I have had representations on this matter from a number of organisations which are regularly engaged in running these functions for the purposes of raising funds for building churches, schools and other purposes.  They have intimated that they anticipate considerable difficulty arising out of that regulation.  They have indicated that with the complete exemption granted for dances outside a certain mileage limit from the town they will have difficulty in attracting people to their functions if they have to restrict their outlay to 50 per cent. of the receipts.  They indicated that that may mean they will have to hire cheaper and, consequently, less popular bands and otherwise curtail their expenditure in the circumstances which they foresee, otherwise they will become liable to the tax.</P>
    <P>I can see no reason why if the intention is to exempt dances run for charitable purposes that the 50 per cent. limitation should be maintained if the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied with the bona fides of the operation, if it is quite clear from the characters of the promoters of the undertaking and the persons associated with it that the whole of the net proceeds, whatever they are, are going to the charity for which it is run.  It seems to me the exemption should apply and that is the purpose of the amendment.  It may not involve an amendment of the Bill.  It could be done by an amendment of the regulations and a variation of the percentage might meet my point.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge that this limitation is far too restrictive and in quite a number of cases people will find themselves liable to pay tax on the receipts of dances for charitable purposes and they may be deterred from undertaking the organisation of these functions in the knowledge that they could not keep within the limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong when he says this is a matter of regulation.  It is a matter of statute.  The section of the Finance Act, 1943, lays down the position in respect of the manner in which there is exemption in so far as the proceeds <Col N="323" /> go to educational, philanthropic or charitable purposes, subject to the overriding limit of the percentage on expenses.  It is not a section that applies only to dances.  It is a general entertainments duty provision.  It was in 1950 that there was an increase to 50 per cent. in the basic arrangements in the 1943 Act.  The concession started many years before that.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy's amendment were accepted it would mean that anybody could run a function on a commercial basis for himself and take all the profit except the residual pound.  The possibilities of fraud would be absolutely limitless.  The Deputy will perhaps remember that that was one of the methods that was adopted in relation to pools for which legislation was necessary during the past year. Exactly the same thing could be done if the Deputy's amendment were accepted.  I am afraid I could not accept it.  The Deputy in making the case for the amendment suggested a variation of the percentage.  I am prepared to watch the course of events as they work out during the year and if I find that there is a hardship over the course of the year I certainly will look into the matter again next year. Candidly, I doubt whether there will be the difficulties the Deputy suggests. However, if we find during the course of the year that these difficulties emerge to any substantial degree I will look into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like, unless I see a very strong case in practice, to differentiate between dances and other forms of entertainment.  It is not merely a dance provision.  It is a general entertainments provision and I would like, therefore, to see some real evidence from the point of view of its working out the way the Deputy suggests. If it was only dances I would not bother, but it covers entertainments as a whole and I would rather leave it that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertLahiffe" hpid="Mr. Lahiffe Mr. Lahiffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like if the Minister would clarify the position obtaining in regard to travelling entertainment companies who pay entertainment tax.  Some of these companies may run dances in marquees in conjunction with a carnival.  Some of them run dances in conjunction with a circus and so forth.  Some of these companies are composed mainly of Irish nationals.  There is a number of travelling entertainment companies in this country which are owned and controlled by Irish nationals.  When the entertainment season is over they remain in this country and spend their profits here.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, they are operating in competition with foreign-owned and controlled companies of the same kind.  The competition is unfair in this way.  Some of the local entertainment companies, let them be carnival companies or circuses, run dances in marquees. They have to import vehicles for which they must pay the full import duties.  They must pay the full road tax on these vehicles and they must also pay the full entertainments tax on amusement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, a similar company may come into this country from outside, pay no road tax here, no import duty on their vehicles and practically no entertainment tax except the tax on dancing, thereby raising the possibility of running the Irish owned and controlled firms out of business.  If an Irish company wanted to go outside the country or go into Northern Ireland they have to pay a very severe import duty.  They have to pay a severe tax on their vehicles.  They are actually prohibited by taxes from operating in England, whereas English companies can come in here, pay no import duty on their vehicles, pay no road tax and they operate against the Irish companies.  They take all the profits back to England and spend them outside the country.  I would ask the Minister to consider this question. Our Irish firms particularly circuses <Col N="325" /> are operating under unfair conditions in relation to these people.  There is a large number of these circuses coming into the country now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the purpose of the section might be defeated by the rather restrictive wording of sub-section (2).  We agree it is desirable to exempt from entertainment duties film shows in the Irish language.  However, to require that the whole of the performance shall consist of films in the Irish language might operate to prevent exemption being secured in cases where the greater part of the show would consist of such films and some part of it of films of another type. <Col N="326" /> If the purpose is to encourage the production and display of films in Irish, it would seem reasonable to grant such exemption if the greater part of the show consists of films in the Irish language. I will not press the point but I think that the purpose of the section is somewhat defeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already in operation a provision by virtue of which if not less than one-third of the performance consists of an entertainment film with an Irish language sound track then only half the duty is paid.

The case has been made that they would be wholly Irish films and, on that account, they are quite happy, I understand, with the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which confirms the duties which were imposed by Order in March last, when the Minister announced the imposition of these duties by Order and the other measures taken by the Government at that time to rectify to some extent the position regarding the balance of payments.  I expressed the view that the measures were inadequate and ineffective and, in respect of some of them at any rate, likely to be objectionable in their results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not disputing that the trade situation is such that measures to deal with it are necessary and that these measures must, temporarily at least, include some restrictions upon unnecessary imports.  The Government, however, decided to restrict imports by making them dearer through the process of the imposition of these special levies.  I think they could have got the same result in a way which would have been more effective and <Col N="327" /> less onerous so far as the consuming public are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed the view that, in so far as motor car aggregates are concerned, the position could have been dealt with by regulating the total imports so as to bring about a reduction. If there are any difficulties under trade agreements or otherwise in doing that by Government Order, it could be done by voluntary arrangement with the importing firms.  I think they would gladly have co-operated with the Government in that regard.  The effect of acting in that way rather than by the imposition of special duties on the trade would have been beneficial.  The difficulties which have arisen in the motor trade are inevitable where special duties have been imposed&mdash; duties announced by the Government to be temporary, duties liable to be removed at any time if the situation justifies it, duties causing an increase in price which may not be permanent. In such circumstances, people are disposed to postpone making purchases. The prospect that the tax may be withdrawn or modified and that prices may come down in consequence will operate to discourage trade until the position is clarified.  If, on the other hand, the situation had been dealt with by reducing the volume of imports without any special levy increasing the price of the product the effect on the public would have been completely different, and, so far as it was possible within the reduced volume of imports, trade would have been maintained.</P>
    <P>A similar observation could be made regarding the imposition on newsprint. The situation that arose during the war was dealt with by imposing restrictions upon the size of newspapers. Whether or not an Order to that effect would have been necessary, I cannot say.  Probably the newspapers also would have co-operated with the Government in bringing about a voluntary reduction in their imports for a time in view of the trade situation, if they had been asked.  We think the Government were wrong in their approach to this matter by endeavouring to restrict consumption of these <Col N="328" /> goods by increasing the price.  The curtailment of imports could have been achieved in other ways.</P>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to the duty which was imposed on newspapers, concerning which a number of statements have been made.  The tax upon newspapers is expressed not to apply to certain classes of newspapers including papers which are regarded as religious or educational publications. Irish religious newspapers have contended that there is unfair discrimination against themselves in these provisions. Such papers published here have to bear this new impost upon their raw material&mdash;upon the newsprint which they use&mdash;whereas similar papers published in Britain are exempted both from that tax and from the periodical tax.  As the <i>Irish Catholic</i> pointed out in an article, the Government's action could not have come, from their point of view, at a more inopportune time because the newspaper industry is at present experiencing a whole series of increases in their costs including increases in wages, increases of the cost of newsprint apart altogether from the levy, the cost of carriage and other essential expenditures.  It would appear that inadequate consideration was given to the effect of the changes upon publications of that kind.  Another effect of the changes has been to penalise certain newspapers printed in the Six Counties.  As it turns out, the effect is to penalise mainly those newspapers which are nationalist in their viewpoint. The majority of the non-nationalist papers in the Six Counties have limited circulations here and are consequently exempt from tax under the provision which exempts papers, the daily circulation of which is less than 1,000 copies.</P>
    <P>The <i>Derry Journal</i> had a leading article last week on this issue in the course of which they said that the levy is being maintained, in spite of the fact that it was imposed by accident. The leading article contains the following sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Government representatives have admitted that Northern newspapers such as the <i>Journal</i> were unintentionally <Col N="329" /> caught in the net cast in the path of foreign publications.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But it is clear anyway that a mistake was made and it seems to be one that could be rectified and should be rectified by the Minister. The Dáil, I think, should not be asked to confirm these duties in the form in which they were originally imposed. The Government has now had three months' experience of their operation and must have had many representations regarding their effect.  It would be clearly desirable that these representations should be considered and that whatever changes are justified should be made, and one of the changes justified would appear to be exemption of the Six County newspapers from the tax.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from the unfair incidence of the tax, it is, on the face of it, undesirable that the contacts between the two parts of this country should be further curtailed by impositions of this kind.  I do not know if the Minister has any intention of revising those duties or making any changes, but, if there is no such intention, I think the Dáil should not give them confirmation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, and as the House is aware, these duties were imposed for the specific purpose of assisting in remedying the balance of payments situation. I have made it clear beyond question that the duties must be retained, so long as our present balance of payments situation remains.  I do not understand the Deputy's references again to-day to the levy's effect on motor cars because I have seen firms advertising that they have pre-levy cars available for sale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances, it would seem quite clear that it could not be the additional cost imposed by the levy that affected the firms concerned.  I think myself it is far more likely that the virtual collapse of the second-hand export market in cars caused this effect.  In any event, when the Tánaiste and I saw a deputation from the union concerned, we made it quite clear to them, and also made it clear by public pronouncement afterwards, that so long as the balance of payments difficulty remains, the levy must also remain.</P>
      <P>So far as the newspapers to which the Deputy referred are concerned, I am aware that the paper which he mentioned has itself been bearing the cost of the levy.  I do not understand &mdash;and I said so, when they came to see me&mdash;why they find it necessary to do that.  They could quite easily, and I think without any injury to themselves, have passed on the additional cost. The Deputy will appreciate that while we must all resent, as we do, the unnatural division of our country, we must accept for customs purposes that the Border is there and it has always been so accepted in all the duty regulations, all the duty Orders and duty Acts.  If we are to make a difference in this respect, surely the Deputy can see that the next thing we would be asked to do would be to make similar exemptions in respect of, say, shirts that could be manufactured in the Six Counties and brought in here in competition with, say, shirts manufactured in Donegal.  The tendency then seemingly would be for British firms manufacturing articles in Britain and exporting them here to transfer part of their manufacturing industry to the Six Counties rather than here.  I think it would be impossible, no matter how much we may and as I say, do, regret the partition of Ireland, to breach the customs code in the way the Deputy suggested.  We could have dealt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the general point made by Deputy Lemass is concerned, <Col N="331" /> we certainly could have dealt with this by means of physical restriction of imports, but I think this way is preferable, because physical restriction of imports, unless accompanied by all the paraphernalia and administrative costs of rationing, inevitably creates a black market.  The Deputy may disagree with me, but I think he will find that all the experience everywhere is, as I say, that inevitably, if there is going to be a demand for a certain article in excess of the supply of that article, then there will be competition for it and it will have the effect of putting the article under the counter and a black market inevitably follows. There could not be an effective physical restriction on the pre-March consumption demand figures that would not mean subsequently there would be a greater demand than the number of articles permitted to be imported would meet.  Inevitably, in respect of the range of goods mentioned, the result would be that those articles would go under the counter and a black market would be established in them.  I think the House would agree with me at once that it would be absurd to introduce a rationing system for the range of goods included in these Orders.  The administrative costs would be enormous, the difficulties of determining rations for non-essential or less essential articles would be quite immense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole effect of the restriction of physical imports would therefore have been to create a situation that would be far less preferable to that created by the duties.  The duties have acted as a deterrent on the people themselves so that they would operate their own rationing system.  The restriction of physical imports, if the Deputy wishes so to describe it, is a much greater deterrent, but, in relation to the wide range of articles we have here, it is a step that should be taken only if it is clear that the alternative method adopted has failed.  I do not think it has failed.  I think it has had the results we anticipated to date.  I cannot see any possible method, over the general range of articles covered in these Orders, through which it <Col N="332" /> would have been possible to introduce physical control without having the immediate result of goods going under the counter and a black market in them operating immediately afterwards.</P>

Is the Minister aware that, since these restrictions came into force, men who have not been unemployed during the past 11 years have been thrown out of employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I will be forgiven if I express some doubts as to the real purpose for which these levies were imposed.  I base that view on the fact that the levy which has been imposed in respect of newsprint has increased considerably the cost of pro-production of newspapers in this country.  It was only very recently that it was found necessary to increase the price of the daily newspapers, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce instituted an inquiry into the increased price.  That was probably quite right because certain doubts were expressed on the matter, even in this House.  I heard charges being made against the newspapers that were forced to increase their prices.</P>
      <P>As a result of the inquiry instituted by the Prices Advisory Body, it was found the increases were necessary in order that the papers should carry on. As a result of the new levy, the costs of production of the newspapers have increased almost out of bounds.  That applies not only to the cost of newsprint itself which was already abnormally high, but, in addition, there has been the enforcement of the extra charge in respect of telephonic communication, plus the extra cost of the transport of papers throughout the country through the additional tax on petrol.  This levy on newsprint has made the task of producing newspapers almost impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appealed to the newspapers to give their aid and I think, to <Col N="333" /> some extent, they have met that request.  However, instead of putting on this levy, surely the Minister could have, by Order or by some other means, compelled the newspapers to produce only standard sized issues.  He could have directed that they should produce only 12, 16, or 20 page papers. At present, some newspapers produce 20 page issues, while others have only 12 pages and so on.  Some uniformity could have been secured through an Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or of the Minister for Finance himself.  The point I want to make is that, in addition to the increased costs imposed by this levy, there are increasing demands by the various trade unions.  The possibility is that as a result the newspapers will be crippled completely so that, instead of securing what the Minister is looking for, the levies probably will have the reverse effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The papers to which the Deputy refers could, of course, deal with the matter by shrinking their size voluntarily and so enable the existing stocks of newsprint to be carried over for a further period.  In that way, they would not feel the impact to the same extent as they would if they kept up the production of larger sized newspapers, when they would have to renew their stocks at an earlier date. I differ from the Deputy in this matter. I think it is preferable to avoid the type of physical control the Deputy suggests, if control with similar effects can be achieved in a different way.  I think it is better to give complete freedom in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy McGrath when he says the levy has caused the results to which he refers.  If he looks at the statistics on the export of second-hand cars for the first few months of this year, and compares them with the figures for the first few months of last year, he will find there has been a very substantial drop indeed in these exports.  I gave the figures here on a previous occasion.  I think the figure for the first few months of this year was only about 20 per cent. of that for the same period last year.  With the collapse of that <Col N="334" /> export market, it is natural there would be a lessening in demand for new cars.  I think those engaged in the industry themselves appreciate that it is the collapse of that second-hand car market that is responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I met a deputation from the union concerned and they appreciate that the collapse of the second-hand car market has had a tremendous effect.  The situation that has arisen in the balance of payments is one that must override our anxieties in other respects.  If we do not surmount those problems, then the result on our national economy in the long run will be disastrous.  If it were not for that consideration, no one of us would wish to impose these restrictions. We all hope the matter can be rectified without any grave hardship being imposed.  The best way of rectification is for people to achieve a target of savings which would have the result of our being able to have greater production and which would enable us, accordingly, to expand the national output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is completely mistaken in his approach to this matter.  If this special levy in regard to motor cars is not removed now, it will never be removed.  There is not a Deputy who can foresee the day in which there will be a Government in office with a sufficient margin of revenue to remove that special levy in preference to reducing some other tax.  The probability is that the remission of any tax will not be possible at all for some years to come, but, if it ever does become possible, this is not the tax which will be selected for repeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I believe that to be so, the people do not believe it to be so.  There is a difference between a motor car and a bottle of stout or a suit of clothes. Even a person who requires a motor car for the conduct of his profession or business can postpone making a purchase for at least a year and if the public believe this tax is a temporary <Col N="335" /> tax, as it was described by the Minister, and is liable to come off again without notice, as the Minister said, it is quite an easy matter for them to postpone making the purchase of a new car for 12 months.  During those 12 months, a very considerable amount of difficulty and hardship can develop for those who are employed in that trade.</P>
    <P>It is true that those who are in the trade anticipated a falling off in the sales this year, but not to the extent that has occurred.  Indeed, it is necessary to think ahead in this matter, because all the firms engaged in that trade have built up a team of skilled workers which is being rapidly reduced. These workers are not staying in the country and they may not be available again if the trade expands. It would be far wiser for the Minister to have set a target for himself representing a reduction in car imports which he desired to achieve this year for balance of payments purposes, and to have asked the traders concerned to work to that target.  They would have done so and I do not believe the situation which would develop would have produced anything like black market prices for cars.  The trade is far too competitive for that and indeed it is quite obvious that the competition for business which is available now is forcing some of the weaker firms into a course of action which can imperil their future.  If the Minister wants to rely upon the fact that some makes of cars are not yet increased in price to cover the levy charged, then the implication is that the situation will get worse, that when the full impact of the levy is put upon all prices, there will be another deterioration in the volume of sales and consequently in employment.</P>
    <P>The same applies in regard to newsprint. I do not know if the Minister's officers thought fit to discuss their ideas with those who are directly concerned in any trade before putting them into effect, or even if they have discussed them since.  So far as newsprint is concerned, the position is that there is not sufficient world production to meet the world demand.  The world demand for newsprint, because of the <Col N="336" /> growth of literacy in the countries of Asia and elsewhere, is expanding far more rapidly than the production of newsprint is expanding, or is likely to expand, so that newsprint prices are mounting.  On top of this rapidly mounting price, the Minister has imposed this levy which is a very considerable additional charge on the cost of newspapers.  Newspapers cannot increase their price to recover that increased cost as freely as is suggested because there must be a point at which an increase in price will mean a very substantial curtailment in their sales.</P>
    <P>The problem of curtailing imports for the purpose of rectifying the balance of payments situation was precisely the same as that which we found during the war, when we could not get enough newsprint and had to regularise its utilisation within the country. The device adopted then and accepted by all newspapers was the imposition by ministerial Order of limits on the size of newspapers.  That, I am quite sure, would have been accepted as a temporary device by all the principal newspapers in the country at the present time.  It would have rectified the balance of payments situation far more definitely and would have involved none of these cost problems for their producers.</P>
    <P>With reference to the Six-County newspapers, I see no objection in principle to exempting from the tax upon newspapers, newspapers published in the Six Counties.  I am not going to be led into an argument as to whether that principle might not be extended further.  This is hardly the occasion to debate that but in the case of these newspapers there are obviously special considerations.  Apart, as I said, from the desire to maintain links of that kind with the Six-County area, there are special problems which we need not ignore.  Circulation limits in effect mean that the Unionist newspapers printed there are not subject to restriction at all.  The restriction applies in practice only to the Nationalist newspapers.  The local papers produced in Derry and which circulate in Donegal are also in a special category.  The Minister cannot be unaware of the fact that there is a belief there that political considerations <Col N="337" /> enter into this, because their main competitor in Donegal is the Fine Gael organ which people would not read, unless they were forced to read it.  There is the idea that this tax is imposed on the Derry papers in order to force them to read that Fine Gael paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely these Derry papers must be recognised as being in a very special situation?  They were produced in Derry for many years. Some of them are very old newspapers and the bulk of their sales is in these border counties, particularly in Donegal.  It is unfair to them to say: &ldquo;You will pay a tax of ¾d.  a copy on every paper you sell and you must recover that by increasing your price,&rdquo; when the local paper in Donegal, which is its competitor, is not so compelled to increase the price.  I think the argument the Minister advanced does not hold water at all and there certainly can be no objection in principle to exempting papers printed in Ireland from the scope of the duty.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to the problems of Irish Catholic papers. There are possibly other religious periodicals and newspapers in the same category, which are in competition with British papers which have been completely exempted.  So far as they are concerned, they are doubly hit by this special levy when their competitors are not hit at all.  This is a matter which could be rectified by the Minister, if he wants to rectify it.</P>

      <P>While we can all sympathise with the Minister in his efforts to combat the effects of McGilliganism in Finance, I think he should keep a little bit of elasticity and not act in a panic-stricken fashion.  There is no doubt that Deputy Lemass has made an unanswerable case in respect of the Six-County newspapers.  It does not matter a row of beans to the financial <Col N="338" /> situation whether a few newspapers coming in from the Six Counties are subject to the levy or not.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should keep the situation sufficiently elastic to deal with small problems of that kind, problems which may cause a good deal of damage, inconvenience and ill-will. Remember, it is not the Minister alone who will be blamed for these taxes. The whole Dáil will be blamed.  I appeal to the Minister to give heed to what Deputy Lemass has said and make the change.  It will not matter to him.  In all sorts of Finance Acts, when levies or duties or taxes are being imposed, small exemptions are made for practical reasons or for reasons of general national interest. The Minister has already made an exemption in these levies in relation to newspapers; he will not impose it on papers with a circulation of under 1,000 copies per week.  Why not apply that to the Six-County newspapers as well? Such an exemption will not matter much in the long run.  Indeed, we shall have to do very much more than that if the situation is to be changed.</P>
      <P>If this country is to make progress and if we are to get rid of all these special levies, we will have to ensure that there will be no necessity for them.  Our balance of payments problem will have to be cured in a much more fundamental way if we intend to increase our national productivity and give our people the standard of living they want, provided they are prepared to earn it and to produce it.  The necessity for all these special levies, irksome though they are and grave as are the difficulties they have created, could have been avoided if the Government had had a better approach to the problem of getting production up on the land, not to talk of production from the factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government gave the Minister for Agriculture his head and he got his way in having a crack at wheat. But, if our wheat production goes down to nil, we will have to get £18,000,000 worth of dollars per year to buy wheat.  I do not know how we will do that.  Already, this year, it looks as if our cattle exports will yield us something in the order of <Col N="339" /> £10,000,000 less than they did last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section of the Bill which imposes levies on hundreds and thousands of articles in daily use.  The Chair has heard the Minister say these levies will have to be kept on, no matter at what inconvenience to the people, until the balance of payments situation is rectified. I made one simple statement which cannot be controverted.  I said that all the money the Minister will collect from all these duties will be very small.  If we cut out all or as much of the imports of these commodities as the Minister aims to cut out, that will go a very short distance towards correcting our balance of payments problem, unless, at the same time, we are prepared to support native producers to produce what the average people require, both from the farm and the factory.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his various speeches here in recent months, has seemed to get some inklings of the fundamentals of this situation.  He says now that our people cannot live at the standard at which they wish to live, unless they are prepared to earn that standard by their work and by their production.  His illustrious predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, tried to make the people believe that all they had to do was wish for a standard of living and it would be delivered to them on a plate.  When we tried to warn them, he told us we were dunderheads.  I would like to know where is the wizard, Deputy McGilligan?  He came in here to vote twice last night, so he is fit to walk; I have often known him fit to talk, irrespective of whether he was sitting down or walking.</P>

      <P>He came in here twice yesterday to vote, and I want to see that wizard coming in here now and telling us where to get the £20,000,000 he said he could get in order to avoid <Col N="340" /> putting on these levies, which will produce a mere couple of hundred thousand a month.  He said he could get £20,000,000, about £1,500,000 a month.  He was prepared to find that if the people elected Fine Gael.  All they had to do was elect Fine Gael and Fine Gael would produce a Minister for Finance who had the knowledge and the determination to reduce the cost of Government by £20,000,000 per year.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister for Finance to send for Deputy McGilligan now to tell us how to produce this £20,000,000 that he told the people he could produce, that he promised he would produce, on behalf of Fine Gael, and thereby save the imposition of these special levies, levies which will drive up the cost of living, which have, indeed, already driven it up, on the people to whom Deputy McGilligan promised better times, lower taxes and lower prices.  When Deputy McGilligan was embarking on his programme of spending money like water in every direction so that he could, by the mere throwing out of a large volume of money, get back into the till something additional on his beer and other taxes, he was warned time and again by many members of the Fianna Fáil Party, including myself, where his policy would lead and what would be its results.  He deliberately inflated in an inflationary situation.  When prices were rising, he pumped out more money, which had the result of driving up prices higher still and of generating the stream of imports which the Minister is now taking panic measures to stem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was required in 1948 and since was a steady pursuit of a sensible policy of telling the people that we here could continue to live at a certain standard of life, only if we earned it by our efforts.  He made them believe that that was just stupidity on the part of Fianna Fáil&mdash;that, with a little bit of financial wizardry, their standard of living could be doubled and at the same time their leisure increased.  It was as a result of that policy and of that propaganda of Deputy McGilligan and those associated with him over the years that this situation was created <Col N="341" /> in which we have to impose all these taxes, fresh extra taxes, and impose all these special levies on a multiplicity of articles in daily use.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Fine Gael Party will let this lesson sink in and that their supporters down the country will let it sink in.  Their first act, coming in here as a Government the last time, was to add fuel to the flames.  Prices were rising.  Everybody knew that a steady hand would have to be kept at the helm; and they jumped in to spend millions of money unnecessarily, more than Fianna Fáil had been spending. It was they who set the headline by dishing out the millions to the Civil Service.  By that action, they indicated to the people that, in their belief, we all could live at a higher standard of life without more effort, and that act alone had a great influence in creating this situation that has to be met by increasing taxation on many things and putting these special levies on a thousand different articles.</P>
    <P>I hope that, before this debate ends, Deputy McGilligan will come into this House.  I asked yesterday when the debate opened that he should be sent for.  I want to challenge him to come into this House and tell the people that, when he promised them he was going to reduce taxation by £20,000,000, he was merely talking with his tongue in his cheek and that he was deliberately deceiving.  I think the Fine Gael Party have a right to treat Deputy McGilligan from this time forth with the utmost contempt if he is afraid to come into this House during a financial debate and take part in it.</P>
    <P>There have been three major financial debates within the last three months.  Deputy McGilligan has voted on every one of them, but not on one of them did he speak for one minute. Does anybody remember a financial debate for the past 30 years in which Deputy McGilligan did not take part? He often spoke for hours on Second Readings, on Resolutions and on Committee Stages of this kind.  He would keep the Dáil going for a week, but he has not come into this House and the reason he has not come into it is that he is afraid to come in.  The people can see now the results of what was <Col N="342" /> alleged to be his wizardry in finance &mdash;that it was simply a piece of financial stupidity&mdash;if you would not call it blackguardism&mdash;because Deputy McGilligan had an idea of what he was doing.  He had some inkling, and he deliberately inflated in an inflationary situation, merely to avoid certain political difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have here the debate on the Vote on Account for 1951-52, 8th of March, 1951, and I was warning Deputy McGilligan where he was going.  He was boasting about what he was spending and I said, in column 1619:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately you are not paying for it.  It is the future taxpayers who will have to pay for it.  You are just passing the buck.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a question of know-how,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and I replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A thimble-rigger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to put too great a strain on Deputy Aiken by asking him to try and understand what is going on now.  Let him wait another year or so and it may dawn on him. But there is the situation.  It is not an easy situation.  It is not one that will induce anybody in charge of finance to rest very easy in his sleep at night.  It is attended by risks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you faced up to it you would not sleep at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The ordinary sensible person with a knowledge of finance would have known that, if we continued to spend and attempted to live at a higher standard of living than our production would afford, we were going to run into great difficulties, and that our last state would be very much worse than our first.  Any person who has access to credit can live at a higher standard than he is prepared to work for; but he can only do it for a time.  The bills start to come in.  Deputy McGilligan's bills were presented to Fianna Fáil, but we were not long enough in office to stabilise the situation.  The present Minister for Finance came in and Deputy McGilligan's shadow, and his <Col N="343" /> influence was still around Fine Gael. They created the difficult situation for which the people of the country are going to have to pay.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it will not rest at mere parting with pounds, shillings and pence.  Owing to the financial blackguardism of the gentleman I have been talking about, we have parted with our ability to develop rapidly to meet the present economic situation facing our people.  The only thing that drove the Fine Gael people to face this situation was their inability to borrow the money they desired to spend.  Only when their loan failed did they admit that their policies would create difficulties.  Only when the difficulties were almost overwhelming did they take some measures&mdash;and some of them, as has been pointed out, were panic measures&mdash;to deal with the situation. The Minister seems, from his speech, to realise that the standard of living of our people in the future must depend, not upon their wishes, but upon their actions, that we can live, not at the high standard at which we wish to live, but at the standard that we are prepared to work to earn.</P>
    <P>There is a very grave economic situation existing at the present time. Anyone who thinks at all of the future must be very nervous indeed because of the economic trends of the present day.  Instead of trying to build up whatever strength we have in the country, we have been throwing policies like wheat-growing, production of our own farm products for our own needs, out the window.  In a difficult, unbalanced situation in regard to our foreign payments, we seem to be doing our utmost to add £18,000,000 more to the national deficit.  It is just crazy policy and I hope that the Fine Gael supporters throughout the country will insist that the Government will make changes, will change their outlook, will not only get rid of McGilliganism but will also get rid of Dillonism, because it is that combination that has brought us to this situation and that combination, if it continues, will bring this country to a state in which it will <Col N="344" /> require intense efforts of our people to recover.</P>
    <P>What the country wanted for the past 20 or 30 years was a steady pursuit of a sensible policy.  It is wanted in the future.  It is wanted more urgently now than in the past because we have gone through the reserves our people had; we have gone through them like water.  We have little more. The people have lost confidence in the Government.  They will not even support the national loans.  It will require, therefore, a steady and patient effort on the part of the Government and energetic work on the part of the people to enable us to turn the corner and to increase national production, which must be the basis of any increase in the standard of life of our people.  I shall conclude by saying once again that I hope Deputy McGilligan will come into this House on the Committee Stage of this Bill and talk.  Let us hear from him.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the new taxes imposed by the Minister have, as the Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy McGrath, said, led to a very large amount of unemployment in one of the largest industries in this country, the largest industry in Cork&mdash;the Henry Ford concern.  Deputies from any area in the vicinity of Cork every day have unfortunate people coming to them asking: &ldquo;What have you done with us?  Is there any hope?&rdquo;  Those people, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, are in highly specialised industries and will undoubtedly have to leave this country and get employment elsewhere. That might suit the programme laid out here by the financial wizard of Fine Gael, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy O'Donovan, or the policy laid out by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  It might suit them. They are the propagandists of the safety valve of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole of this trouble can be traced back to the spree that the Government indulged in when they were last in office.  It is rather amusing to see what did happen in that period and the result of it to-day. Those people borrowed some £72,000,000 to run this country for <Col N="345" /> three and a half years.  At that time, the Yanks lent and the dead weight debt, the interest debt, that has to be found every year increased from £4,000,000 in 1948 to over £10,000,000 a year in 1952.  That was £6,000,000 a year that had to be found by taxation or otherwise.  Those people thought they had their own way of finding it.  They might have had a chance of finding it in 1952 by borrowing to pay the interest on what was owed already.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on 13th May, 1952&mdash;Volume 131, column 1438 of the Official Report&mdash;Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Finance, pointed out the danger to them.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been borrowing and borrowing for the last three years. We have doubled the national debt. We have more than doubled the amount which we must provide in this Budget for sinking fund and interest, the amount which we must raise under various heads for sinking fund and interest charged to the Supply Services and sinking fund and interest charged to the Central Fund.  It has risen from £4,000,000 to £9,000,000 over the past three years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By a question that I asked in this House in the same week, I found that it had risen from £4,250,000 to something over £10,000,000.</P>
    <P>I quote from column 1439 of the same volume:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. MacEntee: I am perfectly certain that if Deputy Costello were sitting over here, if by any misfortune, by any punishing stroke of Providence, Deputy Costello were put here, there is not a single measure, a single tax, imposed in this Finance Bill, he would repeal.</P>
    <P>Mr. J.A. Costello: I would repeal every one of them if I were over there.</P>
    <P>General Mulcahy: He would remove £10,000,000 in ten minutes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a wonder that those financial experts are not now removing £10,000,000 in ten minutes, instead of coming in here imposing further taxation, instead of driving men who were working, as Deputy McGrath said, for <Col N="346" /> the past ten to 20 years in Henry Ford's, out in the emigrant ship.  That is what they are doing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to impose taxation, let him impose taxation on wheat, as Deputy McGrath said; let him tax the foreign wheat coming in and not drive the agricultural community of this country to drop production of 129,000 acres of wheat in 12 months.  Let him deal with sugar in the same way.  There has been a reduction in the production of beet here that represented 27,000 tons of sugar less last year than were produced the year before last, at a cost of £1,200,000 going out to purchase sugar that could be produced by the Irish farmer and provide an income for the Irish farmer.  That is where the money has gone.</P>
    <P>People have to get their hair cut and they tax the hair-cutting machine. Every time a person wants to get his hair cut now, there is 27 per cent. put on to the machine for cutting it.  If he wants to shave there is a tax on that, too.  It is a luxury now if anybody wants to get his hair cut.  It is also a luxury if he does not want to grow whiskers.  Those are the things that have been taxed.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to restore the balance of payments the method is very simple.  First, he should take the Minister for Foolish Affairs, or the Minister for Agriculture, as they call him, and send him out of the country. It would pay this country to pay for an extended holiday for that gentleman until those fellows get out of office.  They had to send him out before when he was advising the farmers to grow oats and when the rats of the country were eating them.  They shifted him out then and why not shift him out now?</P>
    <P>We, agriculturists, are asked for more production while we see the people who are not responsible for producing anything in this country getting increases for every increase in the cost of living.  The increase that is meted out to us is to cut, by Government action, the price of everything we produce.  Then the Minister for Finance comes along and tells us to save so that he can borrow from us to <Col N="347" /> pay the people who do not produce. That is the basis upon which the whole of this thing is founded but I know that as far as agriculture is concerned, there is not going to be any increase in production.  The Government can shake their hats at that.  There will be a reduction in production so long as the particular taxes put on the agricultural community by that Government over there remain in force.  There has been a penal tax of £5 per ton on our wheat, a penal tax imposed by coming along and preventing the Irish farmer from getting what he was bound by agreement to get.</P>
    <P>This Government did it before. When those people were over there before they reduced the production of beet by 14,000 acres.  This year it is going down by 18,500 acres.  Why? Let the people ask themselves that.  It was all right the last time.  They could go to Uncle Sam every month and borrow more and more.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who &ldquo;bummed&rdquo; the whole of the United States for two months of this year pretending that he was looking for new industries.  What he was looking for was to see if he could get anybody to lend him a bob but there was not a bob forthcoming.  The Taoiseach was sent after him to &ldquo;bum&rdquo; for money but he could not get any money either.  They came home then and went to the farmers and producers of this country, and asked them for a loan, and they did not get it.  Why do they not get out?  Are they determined that they are going to pull this country down into such a condition that nobody can build it up again?  Is that the sole reason they are remaining there?</P>
    <P>Those are the things the people are asking themselves.  This Government wanted £20,000,000.  They looked for it and it was not there for them.  The income of the agricultural community has been reduced by £13,000,000 in 12 months.  Now the bottom is falling out of the cattle trade and three-fourths of the rates will be collected next year by the bailiff.  There are some sensible Deputies sitting over there who know that.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the dragnet has not brought in any of the financial wizards I was looking for.  I was in hopes that it would.  I would like to see the Minister for Education here.  He would probably tell us how he was going to remove that £10,000,000 in ten minutes.  Those are the things in which we are interested. If we are going to have any kind of a balanced economy in this country, we must cease importing luxuries and by luxuries I mean anything that the agricultural community, or any other industry in this country, can produce here, that they are driving out of production, and that has to be bought out of the taxation imposed on the people of this country.</P>
      <P>That is what is wrong as far as the finances of this country are concerned. The Minister knows that.  He knows very well that if we had not to export money now, to purchase from the foreigner the sugar that was produced here up to now by the Irish farmer, he need not impose those taxes to-day. The Minister knows that he will have to pay the foreigner for the 129,000 tons of wheat that were produced here until the Minister and his Government taxed the wheat.  That money must be found by a tax on hair-cutting machines.  I suppose one will have to get one's hair cut and there is 27½ per cent. on that machine.</P>

      <P>Those are the items that make it up.  The Minister knows he will not get any further loan from America.  The Minister knows that both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach went to America for that reason.  The Minister has not told us the cause of the holdup in connection with the oil refinery. Those are the matters in which we are interested.  The Minister comes in here with tax proposals which will drive into the labour exchanges of this country all our people and drive out of the country men who were in constant <Col N="349" /> employment for a number of years. The Minister knows that and knows that a desperate case needs desperate remedies.</P>
      <P>The Minister finds himself in the position in which Deputy MacEntee found himself in 1952, that of having to find by taxes the money required, except that, in the case of Deputy MacEntee, the money needed was to pay for the spree indulged in by Deputy Sweetman, the Minister for Finance, and this mixum-gatherum crowd during the three and a half years they were in office before.  That £7,000,000 a year extra must still be found and will have to be found by taxation, no matter who is on the Front Bench opposite.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The evil men do lives after them&rdquo;. Borrowing has been going on at the rate of £25,000,000 and £30,000,000 a year to run this bit of an island.  The Minister knows that and he knows that every year there is a further burden added.  Four million pounds were required in 1948 for service of the public debt.  It was £10,000,000 when the Coalition ran the last time.  It is £13,000,000 now according to a reply to a question I asked in this House a fortnight ago, but the general public have decided it is not going to go any higher because they are not going to lend them the money.</P>
      <P>It is time a halt was called. That is the condition of affairs that has been brought about by one wild, spending spree from 1948 to 1951. Uncle Sam asked: &ldquo;How much do you want, boys?  I will give it to you.&rdquo; Then we had the Minister for Agriculture coming in here and telling us that he had an awful job because he had to spend £1,500,000 in five minutes. That is the way the money was spent and now the country is paying for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was tomatoes the Deputy was interested in.  He was one of the boys who helped in the spending spree.  Now he has a sick head and I cannot help him, although I would love to get him a cure.  I am endeavouring to point out that you cannot have this burden of debt increased every couple of years without further taxation and that you cannot, as is sought to be done, drive the main producers of this country out of production and go abroad in order to pay for what they were producing without further taxation.  Those are the two main things.</P>
      <P>Added to that is the fact that one section of the community in this country is protected against every wind that blows.  Every time there is any increase in the cost of living in this country, one section of the community will get a couple of million pounds more, no matter where it is found and the rest of the country can pay.  Those three things account for every item of extra taxation and every unit of electricity burned by that unfortunate Minister for the past three months in an endeavour to discover where he was going to find something to tax.  God knows he has to go very far indeed when he has to go down to the old razor and the hair-cutting machines.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, his activities have created a further problem.  His activities will mean a further increase in the cost of living.  There is no doubt about that.  There will be a further round, I take it, of increases for the protected classes.  That is what it is all leading to.  They are no longer able to borrow because no one would lend them the money.  Why did they not get out decently then and admit that the people would not trust them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the time at Ballyduff when we hunted Deputy Lynch when he tried to come in before and I gave a description of what was happening. I said we should raise money by taxes every year to pay for their borrowings. On the other hand, those other gentlemen believed they should borrow again to pay the interest.  I remember saying there was not a bank manager in Europe who would lend them a &ldquo;fiver&rdquo; between them.  That is what <Col N="351" /> is happening here.  Nobody will lend them money.  They are too irresponsible.</P>
    <P>The banks of this country look around and see all that has happened. They see a Minister in charge of agriculture who believes in bringing in agricultural produce from the ends of the earth and in driving out of production the farmers of this country.  They see a Minister for Industry and Commerce who sits still and who does his part in the rake's progress by wiping out the pig industry by taxing pig feeding. They see these things happening. People with money in this country are not fools.  They ask: To whom will we lend it?  I seriously suggest to the Minister for Finance that if he has any sense at all he will advise the Taoiseach to take a ramble over to Áras an Uachtaráin to-morrow morning and throw in his hand and get out before his Government brings this country to such a financial mess that nobody will be able to bring order back again.  Get out, and my advice is to get out now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the items in the section under debate at the moment in which I am particularly interested is the import levy on newsprint and newspapers.  I raised this matter on another occasion with the Minister. At that time, I thought something would be done in regard to the duty now being levied on papers produced in the Six Counties which circulate on our side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions, we have heard the Minister's colleagues talk about the ending of Partition.  On many occasions also, we have listened to members of the present Government talk of the Six Counties as belonging to the Irish nation and say that, in fact, they are part of the Irish nation. At the same time, the Minister for Finance now puts a levy on papers printed in the Six Counties&mdash;a levy that describes these papers as foreign newspapers.  If we are to take any heed of what is said by the members of the Government in their rantings and, we might say, ravings, throughout the country at various times in <Col N="352" /> connection with the Six Counties, the status of the Six Counties and who really owns them, it seems strange&mdash; listening to those claims and outbursts that are made occasionally&mdash;that we should find a member of the Government, with the Government's approval, coming here and saying that papers printed in Derry City are foreign newspapers and, as such, should be taxed.</P>
    <P>It has been stated in some northern papers that the levy was an accidental levy, that it was never really intended to bring within the new taxation net the papers now circulating in the Twenty-Six Counties, but printed in the Six Counties.  If that is so, if it was purely accidental, why have the Minister and the Government not taken steps to remedy that accident and to relieve these papers of the tax they are now bearing?</P>
    <P>On various occasions, in this House and outside it, I have listened to the people on the Government Benches talk about the way we can end Partition. The theme we have most recently heard, after many changes and fluctuations, is that we should get to know the people in the Six Counties and understand them.  Where else can we get a better understanding of the people in the Six Counties and the way they live and the way they carry on their business than in their newspapers printed in the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>If there is anything genuine in this new theme that understanding is what is most needed between the people of the Six-County territory and the people of the Twenty-Six Counties, then the northern newspapers circulating in the Twenty-Six Counties are obviously one of the main answers to that problem.  Despite the fact that that could be so, and likely is, we find that the Minister for Finance is still sticking to his guns in regard to this levy on Six-County newspapers.  He is adhering to it and he intends to-day, I take it, to make it a final law that will be binding for a considerable period, if not for all time.</P>
    <P>Since last I spoke here, one of the theories I heard advanced and one of the theories that best holds water in regard to this matter is this.  County <Col N="353" /> Donegal is the worst hit county so far as his levy is concerned.  Down through the years, we have been dependent to a large extent&mdash;almost exclusively&mdash; for our provincial newspapers on those printed in the Six Counties.  That includes Catholic and non-Catholic papers: it is not just one or the other.</P>
    <P>All sections of the community in Donegal, to a large degree, depend for their provincial news on the papers printed in the Six Counties.  So far as I know and so far as I hear, the officially sponsored and owned provincial paper&mdash;owned and directed week after week by the Fine Gael Party&mdash; circulating in Donegal has been falling on evil days.  It has not been paying its way of late, and small wonder.  The name of the paper is <i>The People's Press:</i> that is what is printed on the front.  However, it is commonly known as &ldquo;The Gutter Press&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Donkey Press.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring to the Minister's attention one of the main reasons, that now appears evident, why this tax has been laid on the provincial Press printed in the Six Counties and circulating in Donegal.  Since the tax was supposedly accidental, the big reason why it is being retained is that this &ldquo;Gutter Press,&rdquo; circulated on behalf of Fine Gael throughout Donegal, has fallen on evil times.  It cannot pay its way and the best way to boost its circulation is to put all other papers in the area out of circulation. Apparently that is the motive and if it is, then it is just as much in the gutter as the paper I have been talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should realise that, despite the fact that he belongs to the Fine Gael political Party, he should try and raise himself a little above the level of this paper and those associated with it.  He should try to bring some sense to bear on this problem.  He should remember that, since 1772, the <i>Derry Journal</i>, printed in Derry City, <Col N="354" /> has been the main paper circulating in the North, North-East and North-West of Donegal.  He should realise that that paper has got a tradition behind it, that its traditions have been well-founded and that its traditions have been nationalist for a long time.  He should realise that the people who, down through the years, have been supporting and buying that newspaper should not now&mdash;in a county which, God knows, suffers enough disadvantages already due to the Border&mdash;have to suffer this further burden of the increased price of the Derry newspapers by a penny per copy.</P>
    <P>If the real reason behind all this is to try to boost the sales of <i>The People's Press</i> in Donegal, in an endeavour to keep the truth from the people as to what is going on in this House, then I suggest that, to do the thing honestly, the Minister should propose to raise some sort of subsidy or make an Order to subsidise this sort of Press which cannot maintain itself.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Minister that if there is no hope of getting any relief for Six-County newspapers circulating in the Twenty-Six Counties, he is doing irreparable damage in curtailing the circulation of such papers in the Twenty-Six Counties by means of this levy.  The latest stand that this Government has been taking, that of trying to understand the people of the Six Counties, is being defeated by this tax which <Col N="357" /> has been brought in and which we are asked to confirm here to-day.</P>
      <P>Even now at this stage, will the Minister say whether or not this tax was put on by accident or was it intentionally put on?  Was it really considered at the time that it would affect Six-County papers and cause them to be treated as foreign newspapers?  Or, as has been said in leading articles in some of these papers in the recent past, was it really the fact that the Minister and his advisers, at the time of bringing in this tax earlier this year, were not aware that these papers circulated in the Twenty-Six Counties although they were printed in the North, and would come under this tax?  Would the Minister indicate whether it was done by accident or by design?  Of course the Minister is not anxious to commit himself in any way on this particular matter&mdash;he never has been so far as I am concerned, at any rate. He will whip up those behind him and will go into the Division Lobbies to confirm this tax and at the same time some of his Party supporters can come along and say later: &ldquo;It was an accident&rdquo;.  If the people on the Government Benches to-day are going to vote for this tax, I want it to be clearly understood that they are doing so intentionally and by design and that no excuses will be taken from any of the Minister's colleagues later on if they come along with such excuses as: &ldquo;This just happened by accident.  We did not intend to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are tired of listening to that sort of plea in regard to any unpopular measures.  My county is hit badly in this matter.  I take it that the Government is not one bit interested whether that happens or not for the very good reason that my county has never been very friendly or well-disposed to this Government.  The Government can rest assured that in future my county will be less well-disposed, now that we know that we cannot get anything from the Government, not even the ordinary newspapers at the prices at which they circulate elsewhere. The least we can hope for and expect from the Government is that they will come to Donegal, not on this question of newspapers but on the <Col N="358" /> question of a general election and that they will do it soon.</P>

      <P>Those of us who have had to listen to Deputy Blaney over the years since he came into this House know that there is no member who can so debase the standards of debate here.  We have listened to one of the most disgusting pieces of scurrility that this House has ever had to put up with.  Deputy Blaney should not try to judge other people by his own standards of conduct.  Deputy Blaney should try to remember that if he proposes to carry out public business by the standard which he has just laid down or standards which he suggested I observe, others have a higher standard of honour in discharging the duties of the positions to which they have been appointed.  The suggestion that the circulation, the politics or anything to do with the <i>People's Press</i>, had any connection, good, bad or indifferent with the special import levy on newspapers coming into this country is untrue.  Any Deputy who had a shred of honour would not make such a suggestion against a Minister.  It is like the suggestion that the Deputy made a very short time ago about a breach of a Budget secret by a member of the Cabinet, a suggestion from which he then had to run away, when even the members of his own Party realised and fully understood that it was an irresponsible, scurrilous suggestion then as this one is to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney is incapable of understanding ordinary, straight language.  For the benefit of other Deputies who are capable of understanding, let me say quite categorically what the reason was for the imposition of the special import levy. It was imposed as a fiscal means of deterring imports.  The special import levy on imported newspapers was imposed for that purpose, as I said a half an hour ago.  Much as we regret it on all sides of the House, there is in existence, against our will, a customs barrier.  So long as it is there we must operate on that basis in relation to industry.  When goods are imported across it duties must be paid on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I told Deputy Lemass earlier, deputations from Six-County newspapers came to see me.  I did not tell them that the duty was imposed by accident.  I did not try and shelter <Col N="360" /> under any such excuse.  The duty on imported newspapers was imposed because of our balance of payments situation.  It was understood at the time that, of necessity, the price of certain newspapers bought here might be increased.  So far as the remarks of Deputy Aiken are concerned I do not think that I should, on this section, go into the wider issues that he raised except, perhaps, to say that I believe we shall have this year, this harvest, approximately the same amount of native wheat as we had last year.  Perhaps we shall have slightly more and that it will run in or around the 300,000 tons that were fixed by the previous Government as being the desirable amount with which to amalgamate imported wheat for the purpose of giving a suitable machine-run flour.  There is no justification for the suggestion made by Deputy Aiken that any wheat was imported up to this or will be imported this year because we had run below that figure.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the purpose of these levies is that they will act as a deterrent primarily.  In case anybody might misinterpret me in referring to Deputy Lemass's remark about the revenue that would be raised from these levies, I want to make it perfectly clear again that the revenue from the special import levy goes into the capital and not into the current revenue.  Therefore, it does not seem apposite to me for the Deputy to suggest that it would be considered in the same context as ordinary remissions of taxation.  I maintain that the fiscal method is better than physical control. I gather from Deputy Lemass that the official policy of his Party is that physical control would be better.  I think physical controls should not be introduced unless it is clear beyond question that fiscal control has first failed.  It is because I feel that fiscal controls are preferable that I adopted these methods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing this section of the Finance Bill, I think the public should be made aware that the only reason that these taxes are necessary is simply because the public have been conditioned by the Coalition Government to the belief that the <Col N="361" /> amount of external investments available was almost limitless.  It is just as well to consider, as I have said, these levies and the effect they will have on employment, the effect they will have on the requirements of the people, in that light.  We have now the fantastic situation that, at the end of some nine years after the war, we have spent the whole of our foreign savings, that 350,000 people have emigrated from this country, that agricultural production is only about 10 per cent. higher than it was in 1926 or 1911 and that the total number of people employed here, taking agriculture and industry together, is the same as in 1926.  It is a pretty grim picture.  It means we have wasted the whole of our period.  It means that while progress has been made in practically every other North European country, whether that country was neutral during the war or devastated, the same progress has not been reflected here. It means that we failed to use the advantages of our neutrality during the war, and that we failed to take advantage of the tide of savings that came into the country during the same period.</P>
      <P>The Minister now chooses to impose these emergency levies in order to try to stop the flow of savings that is gradually ebbing from the people of this country because they have been conditioned by the Coalition Government to believe that everything could be pleasant for them, that no effort was required, that external assets were indefinite in quantity, that they could be utilised for any purpose. There has been no proper plan to improve production on a fundamental basis and, as a result, we are now in this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no great volume of easily found reserve savings for capital investment. We are now trying to find the capital money for this year's capital services.  The Minister for Finance has informed the people that, over and above this emergency levy, unless the people are prepared to save twice what they saved last year, he will be unable to keep the State capital programme in the way he would desire.  He has not <Col N="362" /> told the House what he would do if these savings failed to be accumulated in the manner in which he wishes them.</P>
    <P>These emergency levies were imposed as a result of utterly foolish thinking on the part of the Coalition since the war on the whole subject of our savings and our external assets.  There have been periods since the war when the Coalition Government were almost giving medals to those who were prepared to sell their assets.  They almost had a roll of medals to dole out to those who were prepared to sell their assets, suggesting that the sale of these assets was doing something good for the country.  We have begun to learn the bitter truth of that nonsensical talk, which began in 1949 when the Taoiseach told the Bankers' Institute about the desirability of repatriating external assets.  Without speaking of the necessity for the provision of a sufficient margin so that we could increase our production by capital schemes, the Coalition Government simply gave the people the idea that there was an easy method of progress, that everything would come right in the long run.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is absolutely true to say that the Minister for Finance has not yet told the truth to the people about our present position, that when the Government spends money they encourage imports, that when a large amount of capital expenditure is engaged in, the inevitable result is the import of more goods, that if men are paid extra wages, they spend 10/- in every £ of those wages on imported goods, that unless either a rise in cattle prices continues or there is a genuine increase in total production in the State, the day will come when the whole economy of the country will be distorted to the point that far too many people are engaged in importing goods in one form or another, either in producing goods largely of imported materials or of causing goods to be imported in one form or another.</P>
    <P>Now we have reached that position and the Minister for Finance is introducing these levies, and he and his colleagues do not even agree about the general economic climate of the country <Col N="363" /> at the present time.  We have Labour Ministers going around telling trade unions that the increases in wages are an effective fulfilment of their promise to reduce the cost of living.  We have the Trade Union Congress's official journal denying that it is necessary to restrict consumption in any way and implying that, so far as any action taken by the Government along those lines is concerned, it is wrong.  We have Ministers going around during the course of the by-election using the expression: &ldquo;To hell with the balance of payments&rdquo;.  We have the Taoiseach on 26th January, 1956, in his address to the Cork Chamber of Commerce, explaining the reason why this levy is necessary, and these are his own words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...if we recognise the futility of seeking to offset rising prices by a rise in money wages unaccompanied by a rise in output...  We are faced in 1956 with the prospects of experiencing the effects of a full year's wage and salary increases which cannot fall short of £15,000,000... it would not be surprising if more than one half of the increase in money incomes were spent on imported goods or home produced goods with a large import content.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister and his colleagues encourage increases in wages and salaries.  The Minister increases the salaries of the Civil Service and then proceeds to put emergency levies on goods in order to stop people spending.  It is a lunatic form of economy, a lunatic method of expanding production in this country. Whatever its temporary necessity may be, it is just as well that the people realise the position with which they are faced.  These levies are necessary simply because Ministers of the ilk of the Minister for Defence have been roaring around this country for ten years, telling people that we have £500,000,000 invested in Britain and that the sooner we bring it all back the better, and that if anybody even quietly warned people that there were liabilities against this £500,000,000, that the liabilities had come so close to the assets that a dangerous position <Col N="364" /> was reached, he was a Britisher; he was encouraging this country to lend money to the British to suppress the Mau Mau.</P>
    <P>The Coalition deliberately gave the idea to the people over the last ten years that any single person who gave any warning in regard to the repatriation of assets had something anti-Irish about him, that he was trying to stop employment, was trying to encourage emigration.  In this way, those people who had the time or the energy to study economics, if they should listen to any one of my colleagues or myself, would get this little worm into their brain: &ldquo;That fellow is trying to encourage emigration.  That fellow is anti-Irish.  That fellow is really pro-British.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the atmosphere in which we have been living in the past nine years.  All we in Fianna Fáil wanted to do was to ensure that our external assets would be devoted largely and mainly either to reducing our imports, with greater production in that direction, or to increasing our exports.  The position is, as I have already said, that the economy of the country has now got out of hand and it will be extraordinarily difficult for the Minister for Finance to bring it back into a form in which we can continue to make progress.</P>
    <P>Even during the past few months, I do not consider that the present Government have made the position sufficiently clear.  I remember the Minister for Finance telling the country in 1951 that he was going to spend lavishly and still more lavishly.  I remember the Tánaiste saying in 1951 that it was ridiculous for the people to deprive themselves of all the pleasures of life and that the more external assets that were spent the better.  No one of the Coalition Government ever seemed to realise that one day agricultural prices would cease rising, that one day they would be faced with some crisis which would make it necessary to have an extra reserve of net, immediately usable external asests with which to deal with the difficult trading position.  They did not seem to realise that, in addition to requiring a volume of savings <Col N="365" /> enabling a complete and revolutionary change to be made in our agricultural production, in order that we could expand our industrial exports, over and above that, we needed millions upon millions of pounds with which we could assist in cushioning the result of a trade depression, equally of an inflation, or of any other circumstances where it became difficult for us to import the normal amount of goods required for our people.</P>
    <P>There is nothing over-conservative in that statement I have made.  We have not at this moment got that cushion of savings enabling us to get over difficulties which we all have to admit are partly due to world conditions and partly due to the conduct of the Coalition Government and of the Ministers in the way they have spoken about this matter ever since the war. Now that we have to impose levies, it is as well the country should know the reason for them.</P>
    <P>How many times in the past nine years has any Coalition Minister, when speaking on the question of our foreign assets, ever referred to our foreign liabilities?  I have read the newspapers week after week and month after month and on every single occasion these speakers merely wave before the people this huge sum of £400,000,000 or £500,000,000 of foreign assets, some of which are private and cannot be touched by the Government, save by some special socialist measures, and some of which may be seen and can be controlled to a certain extent.  How often have Ministers in the course of the past nine years adverted to the fact that our foreign liabilities were growing steadily every single year and that we have now reached the point where, according to the statement made by Deputy de Valera, which nobody has contradicted, the net balance between assets and liabilities is approximately £100,000,000?  That includes both private assets and those which are visible and which we can control.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister say&mdash;and this, of course, has given people the idea that they can go on indefinitely exhausting these external assets&mdash;that wage and salary increases can be given <Col N="366" /> without any increase in output; and people have the idea that, so long as the money is spent on giving employment, the import content resulting from the employment does not matter and that, somehow or other, the money will be found to pay for the imports that come in as a result of the spending of that money.  We have the Taoiseach's admission that the last round of salary and wage increases will, in his view, cause a huge increase in imports this year; and he says that these increases took place without any increase in output.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government have, by their own policy, caused a complete distortion of the employment-giving capacities of this State since the war, until now the expenditure of money has driven up imports while not sufficiently expanding exports or reducing imports but causing rather the import of more and more goods.  The task of reorganising our economy now and of getting a voluntary decision by the people for a tremendous expansion in production, will unfortunately be more difficult. The Minister now wants the people to save more money and we have, at the same time, the extraordinary position that he has not yet secured the leadership of the workers in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have the statements made by trade union leaders over the radio encouraging the people to save one day and the next day making statements, through their official organ, that it is not necessary to reduce consumer spending.  The Minister for Finance had better be very frank with the people and tell them that, if they are going to save, they must reduce consumer spending; and, if they save enough to provide him with the capital he will require over the next three years, that may have some effect on employment in the State.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister really imagine that these emergency levies will be sufficient to deal with this problem?  If he asks the people to save money, they will only refrain from spending money purely on imported goods.  He has not made the position sufficiently clear. When we discuss these import levies, we may as well, as I have said, discuss <Col N="367" /> them in an atmosphere of realism, an atmosphere in which the country will know where it stands and in which we have now to build up patiently a sufficient volume of savings and increase our production in every form, our production for export and any other production we have which will have a measurable effect in reducing imports.</P>
    <P>But the reason for these levies in the main lies in the foolish and idiotic speech made by the Taoiseach at the Bankers' Institute in 1949, which was misunderstood in many ways and misapplied in others ever since that time. All I can say is that, although we did make some effort when we were in office to bring the position back to normal&mdash;to a reasonable extent, we did manage to bring the balance of payments position back to normal&mdash;we did not complete the job.  I admit that. We were not able to complete the job and do all that was required in order to reverse the adverse trend.  We were not long enough in office to do that, but we did at least make an effort.  The Government now will find it extraordinarily difficult to reverse the state of affairs which they themselves have inaugurated.</P>

      <P>Once more, I can say I had no intention of taking part in this debate and I would not do so now were it not for a number of remarks made by Deputy Childers.  Deputy Childers used to be a specialist in figures.  For a long period Deputy Childers was engaged in taking out the statistics in economic matters that suited his case and waving them around the country.  But, to-day, I notice a remarkable difference in his approach.  There have been no figures.  But there has been the philosophy that, if the country is in difficulties&mdash;mark that &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;that is due entirely to some statements that were made, since the war, by the people who are now on this side of the House.  He did produce two figures, to the best of my recollection, in the whole of his statement: one, that there were £500,000,000 external assets and the other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not give two hoots.  The fact of the matter is that I asked the Central Statistics Office at the beginning of this year to make out for me an estimate of what our external assets were.  I wanted to have a full appreciation of this campaign.  I wanted to know how our assets had altered over a period of years.  On another occasion, I read out here in this House the figures with which I was supplied.  It is sufficient for my purpose now to take the figures at the beginning of the period&mdash;that is, roughly the end of 1946&mdash;and the middle of last year.</P>
      <P>What was I told?  The figures had varied during the period.  I give the Opposition the point that they were low at the end of 1951 in that period. At the end of 1946, they were £500,000,000 and, at the end of 1955, they were £500,000,000.  Now, it is not the same money.  I will point out to the Opposition that there are certain parts of it&mdash;the least valuable parts of it&mdash;which have declined more in value than other parts.  Deputy Lemass&mdash;I think he probably holds the same view &mdash;is quite capable of thinking that out for himself.  At any rate, the gross is £500,000,000 at the end of 1955 just as it was £500,000,000 at the end of 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have we done in the meantime? Deputy Childers does not see that we have done anything, but, wherever I go, I see the benefits of the capital investment programme, recently referred to as having been inaugurated in 1949 in a paper before the Statistical Society.  Is that, or is it not, correct? Was it inaugurated in 1949 or was it inaugurated at some other time?  Can we make that progress without realising some of our assets?  Can we develop the country?  What are the figures?  Up to the end of the year <Col N="369" /> 1954-55, the gross total of capital expenditure by the State was about £200,000,000 and we can add another £50,000,000 up to the end of the financial year 1955-56, making a total of £250,000,000.  Now everywhere I look I see the benefits resulting from this expenditure.</P>
    <P>Take the then net national debt. Subtract assets from liabilities, since the liabilities are greater because certain of the national debt is not covered.  What do we find?  We find that the net value in real terms of the national debt to-day is no greater than it was when war broke out.  I like to look at real terms.  I do not like the kind of philosophical buffoonery that Deputy Childers indulges in in this House.  He was very careful at another period.</P>

It is, of course, sticking out a mile who got the greater shock.  We are told that 200,000 people emigrated between 1951 and 1956.  Was the policy that was in operation by Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Finance, likely to lead to mass emigration?</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass knows the answer to that as well as I do.  I notice the manner in which he is asking the question.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Childers, on the last occasion I recollect his speaking in this House, saying that it was Clann na Poblachta and Deputy MacBride who were responsible for this whole change in our attitude towards financial matters in this country.  All the more credit to Deputy MacBride if he was responsible for it, but I think, if Deputy MacBride would permit me to say it, other people had some say in the matter, too.

Taking that crude statistic&mdash;I know about liabilities and all the rest&mdash;we find that on 20th <Col N="372" /> March there was £224,000,000.  The original figure increased by £4,000,000, and in the corresponding period of the previous year it had gone down by £10,000,000.

      <P>I only want to make a comment.  The Taoiseach makes suitable statements when it suits Deputy Childers, but he made a &ldquo;foolish and idiotic speech&rdquo;&mdash;was it to the chambers of commerce?  Now everything goes back to that.  On another occasion, it all goes back to Deputy MacBride and Clann na Poblachta. Which way do you want to have it? You cannot have it both ways.  Deputy MacEntee might have felt that he could have done a good job on the finances of this country, if it had not <Col N="373" /> been for this pull asunder, which I have frequently referred to, when Deputy Lemass made up his mind on the subject.  I know on which side I stand.  I stand with Deputy Lemass on that.  I want to make it quite plain that I am with him four square in the attitude of mind he had in the autumn of 1952.  But it might be that, if Deputy MacEntee's policies at that time had got a bit of a run, they could have done a better job in relation to the economics and finance of this country than to have two entirely different policies pulling against each other in operation at the one time.</P>
      <P>One reason, and one reason only, why the Opposition Party appeared to fix up the balance of payments was this.  Raw material import prices, which are about half our total imports, dropped 25 per cent.  in price between March, 1951, and the end of 1954.  That, of course, fixed up the balance of payments; you had £25,000,000 straight away.  But look at what had been done by Deputy MacEntee's financial policy, in the emigration that it created and in the condition that the population of this country went down by 55,000.  The first place it impacted on me was in Ringsend in the spring of 1953.  Every person in the place was going around asking: &ldquo;What are you going to do?  Where are you going? Go down to the labour exchange and you will find the man behind you and in front of you is going away to England.&rdquo;  The chickens had come home to roost.</P>

      <P>An atmosphere of realism should be introduced.  The fact of the matter is that I deeply regret that the population of this part of Ireland has gone down by 60,000 in the last five years.  I had thought that the population had been fairly stabilised.  I said originally that this Government had started about its work slowly and systematically.  It is all right for Deputy Lemass to say, as he did the other day, that it takes this Government 100 years to have an idea. This Government is going to have plenty of ideas&mdash;the Deputy need not worry about that&mdash;particularly on the economic front, but we are not going to create difficulties for ourselves and for the country in the manner in which they were created in the autumn of 1952 here.</P>
      <P>I do not care how much propaganda the Opposition make about our savings having been dissipated and that kind of thing.  Everybody knows that the banks&mdash;and I am glad they did it&mdash; owing to the policy that they followed in this country during the year 1954-55, did make great additional quantities of capital available for industry.  I would like personally, if I may express a personal view, to have seen that capital made available in the form of permanent risk capital, in the form of flotations.  I would prefer that.  But, at least, nobody can criticise the commercial banks for the manner in which they have served private enterprise in 1954 and 1955 in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very telling speech, a very telling speech indeed, but against Section 20 of this Bill because it would seem to me that the whole tenor of his remarks was <Col N="376" /> devoted to proving, first of all, that there was no balance of payments problem, and secondly, that there had been no excessive realisation of assets. It was purely, as Deputy Lemass says, consequent upon the fact that the Minister for Finance and his advisers had been very badly informed as to the nature of statistics and, in fact, had misunderstood, misread and misinterpreted the figures which had been produced to them by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that there had been a number of conflicting financial policies pursued in this House.  He referred to that which had been operated by the former Minister for Finance in the first Coalition, the present Attorney-General, the lost child in this debate. He referred to the policy that he had pursued from 1948 until 1951.  He referred then to that which had been followed over the period when we were in office in 1952 to 1954; and now we have another.  He implied that he did not agree with any of them, that he was taking his own stand against the world and seemed to say that there was not any serious problem confronting this Government.</P>
      <P>If there is not, if the Minister for Finance has not got a very serious problem to deal with, why is he taking these steps which we have been told are hampering and inconveniencing all those who are engaged in one form or another of commercial enterprise in this country?  If there is not this problem, why was it necessary, for instance, to take almost savage action against the Six-County nationalist papers?  Why is it necessary to disorganise and dislocate our whole motor assembling industry?  There is a considerable number of other trades and industries which are affected by these levies.  Surely the Minister for Finance has not taken these extraordinary steps merely to punish people because they have been trying to build up some sort of native industry?  Yet, it seemed to me that there was not any other conclusion to be drawn from the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no balance of payments <Col N="377" /> problem, he assured us; we have no need to worry about our disappearing external assets; as a result of the capital expenditure which has been going on at such an extraordinary rate over the past six or seven years, we have a huge productive apparatus in this country which will enable us to face the future with confidence.  I should like to know where it is.</P>
    <P>I read the Report of the Committee on Industrial Taxation.  What do I find about what has happened to the moneys which have been invested? Table 16 is on page 23 of this report. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary has noted the figures which are given there.  The Table is headed &ldquo;New Capital For Calendar Years 1950-54 Analysed in Reports of Central Bank.&rdquo; The total amount of new capital which was raised or invested in this country over that period was £112.9 million, of which the Minister for Finance took £78.4 million, Dublin and Cork Corporations £20.9 million, making in all £99.3 million, and the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, between them took £2.1 million&mdash;which would represent, of course, an investment in productive enterprise&mdash;and industry and commerce between them took £8.9 million, the total being £11,000,000 out of the £113,000,000 which was raised by the people of this country and spent on enterprises of one sort or another.  I can think of some of these enterprises which were productive&mdash;the expenditure on the E.S.B. will be productive, and the expenditure on Bord na Móna will, no doubt, amply repay the investment made.</P>
    <P>The investment on enterprises which are immediately productive has been less than 10 per cent. of the whole. I wonder what conclusions the Parliamentary Secretary would draw from that.  Undoubtedly we have been improving our housing conditions and trying to modernise one form of our transport system.  Undoubtedly we have been putting some money into agricultural land, but where are the enterprises that will enable us to bear the burden of this capital expenditure?</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is not going to get me off on that sideline.  He referred to the extent to which our external assets had been realised and said that all we had to do was to go through the country and see all the splendid enterprises that were there as a result.  He implied that they were giving an adequate return for the money spent on them.  That is not the view being taken by a great many people.  Many of us think that too little has been spent on enterprises which would give a really economic return and too much spent on things which will give us social return, but which will not enable us to meet the commitments which we have incurred in respect of them.</P>
      <P>What does the report of the committee say?  The Parliamentary Secretary said that I was forgetting the amount of private investment which had taken place.  The committee, having considered the matter and pointed out that £113,000,000 was raised from the people over four years, went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will be noted that in the five years, 1950 to 1954, only £8.9 million went into industry out of a total new capital of £112.9 million.  Even if the greater portion of that £8.9 million went into industry, it is still a very small part of the total capital raised.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> It seems to me that statement fully supports the argument which Deputy Childers made here this morning and which the Parliamentary Secretary attempted to controvert.</P>
    <P>I merely wanted to pay a compliment to the Parliamentary Secretary for the excellent speech which he delivered against Section 20 of the Bill, and to deplore the fact that he seems to differ radically from the Minister for Finance in his approach to the problems with which the country is confronted.  I deplore that fact, because the country does not want, in present circumstances, to have divided counsels in the Government, and between the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary, who if my recollection is correct, was appointed really to hold the hands of the Minister for Finance, to be a sort of guardian angel, and to make certain that he would walk the straight and narrow path.  It is a rather extraordinary thing that the Minister seems to be able to walk that path alone and that the guardian angel seems to be falling into the abyss, the depths of which Deputy MacBride plumbed so many years ago.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say, but I do hope, however, that if there is a division on this section, the Parliamentary Secretary will have the courage of his convictions and vote against it, because he has shown that the section is unnecessary, that the position of the country does not require the imposition of these levies, or the inconvenience and dislocation that it is causing to so many people, and the dislocation of industry which is arising from it.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed with the reply which the Minister gave in relation to the import levy on newspapers. While a certain amount of heat was introduced into the matter, I believed that he would give us some hope that he would not retain what he confessed was an unforeseen wrong in relation to the Six-County productions.</P>

      <P>I am being guided by something which the editor of the <i>Derry Journal</i> wrote in an editorial after a deputation interviewed the Minister in Dublin not so long ago.  I understand that all duties are imposed for the purpose of raising revenue, prohibiting imports, or protecting home-produced goods.  The Minister has never made it quite clear whether the imposition of this levy on newspapers has been for the purpose of prohibiting imports, or producing revenues, or a mixture of both.  The fact remains that all duties, when imposed, are imposed only after a careful examination of the article selected.  I take it that was done in this case and that the Minister saw that his levy was going to hit Irish production.  When I say Irish production, I mean something that is produced in Ireland and Ireland, to me, is the 32 Counties. Anybody employed in the Six Counties, or down here, is an Irish man or woman entitled to his or her living.</P>
      <P>Certainly the Minister did not give to the deputation which visited him here, the impression that he foresaw the effect of this levy on newspapers. I should like to quote from the editorial in the <i>Derry Journal</i> of the 8th instant in which it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Even more remarkable, in our view, is the fact that the levy is being retained in spite of the fact that it was imposed by accident.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Minister gave the wrong impression to the deputation, I thought he would condescend to give an explanation as to why he misled the deputation or whether the deputation was misrepresenting him.  Somebody is wrong.  An explanation is required from somebody very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that it was not aimed primarily at Six-County newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, however, is that the levy is maintained and, as Deputy Blaney pointed out, we in Donegal feel we are victimised, in so far as we are being precluded from getting the views and the general outline of affairs in the Six Counties. The Minister may say that 1d. per copy <Col N="381" /> will not prevent that happening, but the important fact is that it is such an imposition as will quite possibly eventually put these people out of circulation in Donegal entirely.</P>
      <P>The poor people who buy the provincial papers will naturally switch over to something which, perhaps, is undesirable and if Deputy Blaney spoke very harshly regarding what he suspected was the reason for it, I would point out that the Minister's attitude and action in that respect have left him open to that suspicion, particularly in so far as he has not made any effort since to redress the situation he himself now agrees is undesirable as a result of the general imposition of these levies.</P>
      <P>I appeal earnestly and seriously to the Minister to reconsider the whole situation.  We are not interested in the <i>Derry Journal</i> alone.  We are quite anxious at all times to get the views of all sections in the Six Counties.  The organs of the Protestant element in the Six Counties have been circulating in Donegal for centuries past, just as the nationalist organs which some of us were more accustomed to purchase.  I think the Minister should at this stage give some consideration to the possibility of redressing this matter.</P>
      <P>Papers like the <i>Derry Journal</i> are already under a certain handicap.  The number of pages they use is laid down in restrictions governing the publication of newsprint in Great Britain and the Six Counties.  They are already restricted to a certain number of pages.  That was itself a sufficient handicap without this other final imposition.  The <i>Derry People</i>, the <i>Fermanagh Herald</i> and the <i>Ulster Herald</i> are three papers which circulate in the Twenty-Six Counties and I am afraid they will be seriously hit as a result of this imposition and will eventually have to withdraw from circulation and that means going out of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is <Col N="382" /> desirous that that should happen.  I appeal to the Minister at this stage, in spite of any ulterior motives which may have been attributed to him and in spite of what may have originally prompted him to take the actions he did, to reconsider the whole position, in view of the undesirable results which have followed and try to bring about some amelioration of the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy who interrupted when Deputy Blaney was speaking and who made reference to the circulation of the <i>People's Press</i> that we have in Donegal the <i>Donegal Democrat</i> which has the largest circulation of any paper circulating in the county.  I merely point that out to show that in so far as I am concerned in the south west and south of Donegal the action the Minister has taken, whether intentionally or otherwise, will not force me or my supporters to read the paper referred to.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any reference to the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary other than to say that many people who will read it to-morrow will be amazed.  I can understand why the Minister for Finance left the House when he began to speak.  He proposed a theory in economics and fiscal policy which we have not heard since Deputy MacBride ceased making the case that, by a few strokes of the pen, all our economic problems would be solved and prosperity would be ensured.  That is a bad feeling to create and I do not for one moment think the Minister agreed with one word of what he said. The Parliamentary Secretary went so far as to say that we have no financial problems whatever, although, when Deputy Lemass asked him whether we had, he declined to reply.  All these impositions are bringing the people down to the level of paupers and when they read what the Parliamentary Secretary said they will begin to lose confidence in democratic Government of any kind and also in the Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last evening, the encouragement that emanates from the success of the new ventures through the Gaeltacht Services plan should find extension in more enterprise and in a more thorough and exhaustive market research. I had said to the Minister that we in West Cork in the Gaeltacht areas were a significantly neglected stepchild of this section of departmental activity.  I find no excuse for such obvious neglect, because as I said, if only for one factor alone, and that the significant part played by that area in the achievement of our liberty, we should get special consideration. Allied to that is the fact that abundant in these Gaeltacht areas in South-West Cork is that ready intelligence that typifies the area.  The Minister should have no difficulty in extending into that area some of the schemes sponsored by this branch.</P>
      <P>Further than that, there still exists in these areas the hereditary residuum of various crafts, particularly lacemaking, and I want to end on this note: While the Minister may say to me: &ldquo;But we gave you a new industry in Ballingeary,&rdquo; I would reply: &ldquo;Is fada a bhíomar ag feitheamh leis.&rdquo;  We have been waiting a long time for something, and I want an assurance from the Minister that that is only an earnest of the expansion contemplated, because if we are serious about the preservation of the people with the full spoken knowledge of our language in the area and environment of their birth, we must get something into these areas that will at least give them an economic living or the prospects ultimately of an economic living in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot pay more than lip service <Col N="386" /> to the revival of the Irish language and to the preservation of Irish culture and tradition by any other means than by effective effort to do something within the areas concerned.  As I said earlier the most significant part of the tragedy of the recent census of population is that the major depopulation is taking place in those very areas which are the spearhead and the vital factor in the preservation of our language and our Gaelic customs.</P>
    <P>I appear critical; I do not think the criticism is really directed specifically against any Minister.  I criticise what I term bluntly the lack of imagination and enterprise and effort in getting industry into the Gaeltacht areas.  I do it not in a spirit of criticism of the Minister, but in the hope that we may ulimately get somebody to face up to the magnitude of the problem and stop this miserable scratching on the surface of a vital national problem, one that goes to the very roots of our cultural foundation.</P>
    <P>If that is done, the Minister with the earnest of success that I have described regarding certain marine products development, has scope to speculate in expansion, and mark you, any significant effort by Gaeltacht Services to do something to give much-needed encouragement to people within those areas will be welcomed, because these people at present, despite all the talk and despite all the various suggestions that have been made, feel that the Gaeltacht areas are doomed and that we here in the National Parliament will wake up to do something for these areas when the very cause for which we strive will have been defeated by the continued exodus and decay of the population in these areas.  If 'twere done when 'tis done, then 'twere well 'twere done quickly.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cursai an mheastachain seo a phlé go hiomlán as Gaeilge ach ós rud é nach bhfuil an oiread sin taithí agam i labhairt na Gaeilge leanfaidh mé i mBéarla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to speak entirely in Irish on the subject, but, like many other Deputies, I am not a practised <Col N="387" /> speaker of the language and therefore I would prefer to make my remarks in the medium of the foreign language. This is probably the last year in which we will have Gaeltacht Services as a separate Vote before this House.  At least we expect that, with the establishment of the new Ministry, we will have a co-ordination of all the various sections or bodies which heretofore have been working in their own way for the benefit of the people of the Gaeltacht, for the expansion of the Gaeltacht and the preservation of the native language. It is only fitting on this occasion that we should pay tribute to this section that has been dealing with this branch of Gaeltacht industries. By and large, I think they have done a good job, as the Estimate shows the House on this occasion.  The officials of that section have always been helpful; they have been particularly courteous and attentive to the Deputies who had occasion to visit them at any time.  I think it is but right that we should pay that tribute to this section, in view of the fact that I may have some criticism to offer as I go on.</P>
    <P>I think the Gaeltacht Services Section of the Department of Lands have not heretofore regarded themselves as the people on whom rested the entire responsibility of employing at home the people of the Gaeltacht.  In view of the alarming situation revealed by the recent census figures, which really indicate a crisis as far as these areas are concerned, I think some section of some Department, if not the new Ministry itself, must make a new effort, an all-out attempt, to improve and expand services for the improvement of the Gaeltacht and the welfare of the people who live therein.</P>
    <P>Whether the Gaeltacht Services Section of the Department of Lands are incorporated in the new Ministry or not, I think that section would be a suitable body to be used as a spearhead of any all-out drive to bring about better conditions in the Gaeltacht areas and finally to arrest the flow of emigration from these areas. There is much they can do.  Like every other section, their main limitation is that of finance.  Give them the goodwill <Col N="388" /> of the other Departments, particularly of the Department of Finance, the blessing of this House in the way of money, and the necessary legislation to further their work, and they will go far.  I believe they should be brought to regard themselves as the people on whom rests the greatest responsibility for furthering the work they are doing to a stage where they would do something more comprehensive for the Gaeltacht areas generally.</P>
    <P>What has been done simply proves what can be done.  While the work this section has done has been done well, it could be done much better.  Let us hope that some of the projects of the past are to be regarded only as pilot projects which will be expanded in the future.  While discussing the future activities of Gaeltacht Services, I would suggest that when an industry, sponsored by Gaeltacht Services, reaches a stage where it is capable of standing on its own feet, it should be handed over to private enterprise, to be run by a public company which would be in a position to make it a greater success than it would be as a State-sponsored body under Civil Service management.  Those of us who come from the Gaeltacht areas do not grudge the extra revenue which has to be raised each year to finance these projects.  We believe it is well-spent money and, if we criticise it, we believe we are entitled to do so in order to improve the management and better the economical supervision of the projects concerned.</P>
    <P>Take for example the tweed industry. I do not want to take the marine products which are still in their infancy and which should be given a chance. Take the tweed industry that is being carried on by Gaeltarra Éireann very successfully in Donegal.  The same industry is being carried on by many private individuals who play an important part in giving employment to the people in the same way as Gaeltarra Éireann is doing in relation to its part of the industry.  However, it is significant that while private enterprise interested in tweed production is paying an excess profit tax, Gaeltarra Éireann must come to the Exchequer each year for subventions on its <Col N="389" /> trading account.  I do not know what the position is in respect of the current year, but I do know, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, that there was a very heavy loss in its trading account last year.  I asked a question, in the course of scrutinising the accounts, as to what the position for the current year was likely to be and I was informed that we could again anticipate a loss.  The Minister will correct me if that is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of many reasons.  At one time, when I was not a member of this House, I believed the losses of Gaeltarra Éireann were due to the fact that the trading account and the capital account were given as one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The real cause of the trouble is that Gaeltarra Éireann has to supervise a huge number of small industries scattered all over the West.  A private concern would naturally gather all of these under one roof with a consequent lowering of administrative costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is helpful enough in a way but I am afraid it does not cover the whole situation.  I am speaking subject to correction when I say that those things which showed and do show profits when carried on by private enterprise do not show an overall profit at the end of the financial year when carried on under Gaeltacht Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not go in for profit.  The outdoor workers get the price we collect for the goods, less the administrative costs.  What would be a profit to a private concern goes to the workers in our case.  I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but I should point out that we are not a profit-making concern.  We do not go in for profit and neither do we think it would be desirable to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Gaeltarra <Col N="390" /> Éireann is not a profit-making concern then, in cases like the production of tweed, I would expect it would not dip too deeply into the taxpayers' pocket at the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the situation where private enterprise carries on a similar type of industry, employing a large number of people.  They point out that they are competing with Gaeltarra Éireann, who, at the end of the year, can go to the Exchequer and recoup their year's losses.  Granted they did not intend to be a profit-making industry.  If the tweed industry which is flourishing when conducted by private enterprise, must in the case of Gaeltarra Éireann seek financial assistance year by year from the Exchequer, then how can the people who are conducting the same business by private enterprise have to pay excess profits tax on their manufacturing concerns?</P>
      <P>Certainly I understood that the real reason for the coming into being of Gaeltarra Éireann in the first instance was to create industries in a place where no other private enterprise was likely to step in, and in spite of the fact that they might be losing money in pursuing those industries for the benefit of the people and the areas where they are located.  I quite well understand that but I do say that in the case of the tweed industry it could be more usefully conducted now by private enterprise.  Gaeltarra Éireann has done the useful work of sponsoring that industry&mdash;setting up all the factories, spinning mills and so forth. The industry has now reached a stage where it can successfully be divorced from all the incumbrances of overhead charges, a rather expensive staff and perhaps a multiplicity of inspectors or supervisory officers, who could then pursue some other type of industry that is not getting the attention it needs from private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Private enterprise is not allowing much of this industry to die at the moment.  The point I am making is that when it has reached a stage where it can no longer be regarded as an industry which private enterprise would not pursue, it should be taken away from Gaeltarra Éireann who could then use their time, staff, energy and finance to organise other industries that are dormant and will not be organised by private enterprise. The successful ones should be left to be run by people who are already running these industries most successfully in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at least one great advantage that private industry has and that is that they can have their factory and their industry under one roof with one supervisor.  In order to bring these industries out to scattered areas it is necessary to establish a number of units that a private person would group under one roof.  Each one of those units must have a supervisor and then you have the overhead costs, transport and material costs, and so on.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into an argument with the Minister on this question of the industries which are capable of standing on their own feet but I do wish to put forward to the House the suggestion that the tweed industry is one which is now being carried on by people in Donegal and elsewhere who have a tradition of centuries of experience behind them and who are making an outstanding success of their own concerns.  They have to compete with Gaeltarra Éireann who have the taxpayers at their back.  I would say that it is only reasonable that such industries should be handed over to private enterprise and be carried on with the same success as private enterprise has achieved in Donegal in regard to tweed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we may deprecate competition <Col N="392" /> in industry on the one hand, we also realise that it possibly has tended to create the necessary stimulant to making industry successful even though it is run by private enterprise.  If Gaeltarra Éireann have set a standard in the payment of wages I would say that in so far as they set the standard that is very good, but they could unduly depress the activities of private concerns by undue competition.  By that means they could put out of work many of the people&mdash;and there are literally hundreds of them&mdash;employed in Donegal in industry, sponsored and very well run and organised by private enterprise.  These are people who have gone out to America and established offices in the cities there.  They have established a most remunerative dollar-earning business for the past number of years and I think it is only fair that there should be competition in such cases.  The only thing I would be apprehensive about is the expansion of private enterprise if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Deputy leaves the question of the tweed industry I would ask him to consider this.  Supposing these industries established by Gaeltacht Services were handed over to private enterprise in the morning, does he not think that the first thing they would do would be to kill all the small outlying industries that give employment in backward areas for which these industries were established?  Would they not, in the Deputy's opinion, collect all those under one roof for the sake of cutting costs, bearing in mind also that if Gaeltacht Services has one advantage, that they can come to the taxpayers' pocket, the private concern has a bigger advantage against that about which we do not hear anything but about which I will speak when I am replying?</P>

      <P>I would not like the Minister in any way to discourage the very successful enterprise we have in the tweed producing industry in Donegal.</P>

    <Col N="393" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very cognisant of the fact that private enterprise, side by side with Gaeltarra Éireann, is doing a good job and we are only desirous of seeing these industries expanded. All of them employ weavers in their own homes and the tendency recently is to bring them under one roof for better supervision and control. The production of cloth at the moment is a very highly skilled business and it is only with the best trained weavers and proper supervision that the most expansive market we have under our control can be maintained and further expanded.  But private enterprise is successfully carrying on this work.  We have far-flung interests; the looms are allocated to the homes of the weavers; the goods are collected and the new work allocated in return.  This is one of the most important things that has gone to maintain people in the Gaeltacht of Donegal who would otherwise be along with their thousands of brothers and sisters in the industrial cities in England.</P>
      <P>I believe we should take the tide at the flow and make the most of the opportunity that is presented.  Sound foundations have been laid and whether we are going to proceed by means of private enterprise or by the further extension of Gaeltarra Éireann, let us proceed to expand anyhow, and expand quickly, because the need for it never was more obvious or evident in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a further appeal to make. There has been a good deal of talk here over the years about decentralisation. I suggest that an office which deals with Gaeltacht industries should itself be located in the Gaeltacht.  I know the Minister's reply to that will be that Dublin is the centre from which all the various branches are administered and that it is the natural centre through which to carry on the sales organisation.  Much of the costs incurred could be eradicated by having the Gaeltacht Services Branch of the Department of Lands with headquarters in Glencolumcille, Ardara or elsewhere in Donegal.  In that way there would be immediate supervision over the major portion of the work; less <Col N="394" /> supervision would be necessary and, therefore, fewer people needed.</P>
    <P>At the same time the moneys required to pay the executive staff would be spent in the areas where it is most needed, the areas to which I claim it rightly belongs.  There would be a better grip of the needs of the industry in that immediate control than there is in the present system of remote control. I strongly advocate the decentralisation of those sections of the Civil Service directly concerned with Gaeltacht industries, particularly the decentralisation of Gaeltacht Services.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that there is undue supervision.  The Gaeltacht Services staff are so imbued with the idea of strict supervision that they have perhaps carried it too far.  A story told to me by a factory worker, while it may be an exaggeration, will illustrate the point.  We shall call him &ldquo;John.&rdquo;  I asked him: &ldquo;John, how is the factory going now?&rdquo;&ldquo;Och,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Very well.  This was a good week. We had only 11 inspectors from Dublin this week.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the fortieth time I have heard that story since I came into this House in 1943. I think he was not the only John who said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably an exaggeration, but it serves to illustrate the likelihood of overlapping in supervision. Some of the people may have been Board of Works officials concerned with maintenance, expansion or the installation of plant.  It is always assumed that they all come for the one purpose&mdash;as inspectors from Gaeltarra Éireann.  But I think it is correct to say that an inspector is not an unusual sight in these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to make my annual plea in relation to the tweed industry. I think most Deputies have made the same plea in the past.  Donegal tweed is now so popular and so fashionable that it can be sold in competition with any tweed anywhere.  Some Deputies mentioned in the course of the debate that spurious tweeds were being sold as Donegal tweeds.  That may be so, but genuine Donegal tweed can stand on its own anywhere.  It is a mistake <Col N="395" /> for people to refer to it as Donegal homespun.  Donegal tweed, as we know it now, has little or no relation to the Donegal homespun we knew in the past.  Donegal homespun was made from black-faced wool, spun in the cottages and woven on the looms in the homes or in the factories.  That was 100 per cent.  Donegal homespun.  It is now only produced for use in the home. Donegal tweed <i>qua</i> Donegal tweed is made from machine spun wool and woven in Donegal.  The wool is much finer.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point with relation to the homespun industry.  With the collapse of the homespuns, it became difficult to find a market for the black-faced wool other than the export trade or the Dublin merchants. We would like to see the spinning wheels in use again, producing 100 per cent. Donegal homespun.  It is not, of course, suitable for the now fashionable fine tweeds, but it is suitable for many other things, such as rugs, blankets and upholstery.  In fact, in some parts of the Six Counties magnificent furniture covering is being produced, manufactured almost entirely from homespun black-faced wool.  I would have expected that Gaeltacht Services would have been alive to the possibility of getting production of that kind under way.  If the Minister succeeds now in finding a use for the black-faced wool, we will be prepared to say that not only is Gaeltacht Services jogging along with a successful report each year, but it is really awake and doing something worth while for the depressed Gaeltacht areas.  The time was never more opportune.  The necessity was never greater.  I urge upon the Minister that he should find the necessary capital now to establish even a pilot industry along those lines. It would be a great boon to these areas.</P>
    <P>If Gaeltacht Services will undertake something of that nature, having first decentralised the office and come amongst the black sheep of Donegal to study conditions, they will then have a more realistic approach and a better understanding of economic conditions. I doubt if many people here understand <Col N="396" /> what the conditions are along the western and north-western seaboard. I have often thought that, if they did understand them more fully, they would be more enthusiastic in their support of projects which would help to keep our people at home, living happily and contentedly in their own areas.  Thousands of houses which once brought up the best families that could be reared in any country, as was proved by the way these people distinguished themselves when they went abroad, are now standing roofless.  In the past year the number has increased considerably.</P>
    <P>My next point is a parochial one.  I would like the Minister to tell us when he is replying why the extension of the Gaeltacht depot, as we know it, or the lace centre at Bruckless has not been proceeded with before now.  I have referred to this repeatedly and before Deputy Derrig left office I had hoped to see it accomplished.  The matter had then been decided and we had hoped to see it pressed to fruition in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>One would like to see every single unit expanded to give more employment and to help in the balance of payments position by adding to our exports.  I think in the case of Bruckless there was some trouble over the water supply.  Now that the public water supply has come within easy reach I would suggest that the Minister press for the further extension of the pipe line.  We in Donegal County Council are already pressing it and I can assure the Minister that anything we can do to ensure the matter is expedited will be done.  At this stage, I believe that the water supply can hardly be given as a reason for holding up the extension of the depot because the depot, even if it were started to-morrow, would hardly be completed before we would have the pipe line extended from Dunkineely to Bruckless.</P>
    <P>We in Donegal feel that, while the marine products industry may be making satisfactory progress, there  not enough activity on our long coastline in that respect.  I would like to hear from the Minister, when he is winding up this debate, what plans <Col N="397" /> there are for the further extension of the marine products industry.  The raw material that is available is literally being washed in by the sea, but it is allowed to lie and rot on the shore.  For the initial stages in the development of that industry the Exchequer has to come to the aid of the industry.  Nobody can point out, as has been pointed out in this House in regard to the tweed industry, that private enterprise can do it better or that there is no need to ask for assistance from the taxpayer.  This is an industry that will have to be operated by a body like Gaeltacht Services. It is an industry that certainly is adaptable to the western seaboard since the raw material is there in plenty.</P>
    <P>One would expect, now that the absolute necessity for extending industries in that area has been established, that that industry would be pursued with even greater vigour.  We have many schemes designed for the benefit of industry in the Gaeltacht areas.  The Undeveloped Areas Act, which was passed here in our term of office, was a genuine attempt to decentralise industry. If it has not succeeded to the extent to which it should, that does not take from its importance or usefulness and the very genuine desire behind it. No matter what way the Undeveloped Areas Act operates, Gaeltacht Services have established themselves as a section of our services that is creating industries in those areas and is charged with the responsibility for doing so.  I think we should look to that section for greater expansion in the future, and the Minister should put it under the obligation to provide all the industries it possibly can that would be likely to succeed in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem arising on this Estimate has been debated down the years on practically the same lines.  There has been practically no change in the Estimate this year except in one request.  There is an item of £6,000 to set up a new accounting system.  Though it is the only new item in the Estimate, it is a long-needed one and I am hoping that, when this system is adopted, we will have a profit and <Col N="398" /> loss balance sheet submitted to the House.</P>
      <P>A hubbub has been created in this House, by everybody who spoke, in regard to the recent census returns. It makes me sad to reflect that it is only in the year 1956, apparently, that Deputies are waking up to the fact that grave and serious depopulation has been taking place in the Gaeltacht areas.  That is nothing new.  That has been going on for the past 25 years. It began gradually, and it became progressively worse until the point of decline was reached after which comes the final collapse.</P>
      <P>Some 20 years ago this Department, and the way it was being run, engaged my attention.  I felt it was essential that something drastic would have to be done.  I felt that I would risk my own political reputation and existence &mdash;because that is a small matter&mdash;in order to focus attention on it at once. In my opinion the tweed industry, which is the principal industry in the Gaeltacht, was being ruined by the Department, and any effort being made to help the Gaeltacht areas and to preserve them was only leading to ruin. I think the only person who defended me at the time was Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the inauguration of an air service to the United States of America and Canada is in contemplation; and whether, in view of the much needed employment which would be given and the fact that <Col N="404" /> other European countries have found transatlantic services to be an economic success, he is prepared to give favourable consideration to any proposals for the inauguration of such a service, which may be submitted to him by Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>The inauguration of an air service to the United States and Canada is not contemplated at present. I would give favourable consideration to any proposals for the inauguration of such a service that would not involve the Exchequer in heavy capital investment on which there would be no worth-while return or in continuing subsidy payments.</P>

Would he use his good offices with the board, who may be of the opinion that the Minister is antagonistic to a policy of a transatlantic service at this stage?  Is the Minister further aware that when he stated, as quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 5th June, at the European Airport Authorities, that he hoped next year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that he hoped the Irish flag would be carried into other countries with which we had not yet aerial contact.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Deputy's return to the House should be marked by such an infantile performance. <Col N="405" /> My reference to Aer Lingus carrying the Irish flag to other countries refers to my anticipation that next year Aer Lingus will be flying to Germany, Switzerland and Italy.  That is the extent to which I was referring. I am prepared to give favourable consideration to the inauguration of a service to the United States and Canada provided that it does not involve capital investment from which there would be no worthwhile return or that it does not involve continuing subsidies.  The last transatlantic scheme contemplated by the previous Government would have involved the Irish people in very heavy subsidies from which they would not have got any material return.  I am not antagonistic to transatlantic services but I am antagonistic to the dissipation of the resources of the Irish people on services which would not give a return.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has received any complaints concerning the difficulty in obtaining supplies of certain types of electrical switches which are required for various housing schemes, and which carry an import duty of 50 per cent.; when it is likely that switches of the required standard will be manufactured in this country in sufficient quantity; and whether in the <Col N="406" /> meantime he is prepared to grant duty free licences for the quantity required until home supplies are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As certain types of electrical switches are not yet available from home sources, arrangements are in operation for the grant of duty-free licences for the importation of reasonable quantities.  It is expected that supplies will become available from the home manufacturers in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that certain supplies have been held up in the port for from six to nine months pending some settlement of a dispute as to whether they are liable to this duty or not?  In view of the fact that these switches are required for housing schemes will he try to have the matter settled as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The present arrangement has been arrived at as a result of conferences between the home manufacturers and the electrical trade and is operating satisfactorily.  I know one case in which a person sought to circumvent the arrangement arrived at by importing, on a duty free licence, a type of switch for which the licence was not issued.  I do not know if that is the matter to which the Deputy referred, but if the person concerned burned his fingers, he struck the match himself.</P>

It went on for ten weeks, a total of 38 days; 110 witnesses were examined at public sittings and of these 48 were also examined in private.  Based on all the work flowing from that, the commission is now preparing a report, and it should reach me in the course of the next month or so.</P>

      <P>As I stated in the Dáil on the 21st March, 1956, during the course of the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill, the installed generating capacity of the E.S.B. is at present in excess of requirements and is likely to be so for some time to come.  In these circumstances the board have had to review the generating programme and, until the review is completed, I cannot say what the effect is likely to be on the estimated date of completion of any particular station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The E.S.B. has more electricity stations than it can use.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the Ballyshannon fishermen allege that the E.S.B. has ruined the salmon fishing in the estuary of the Erne; and if, in view of the fact that the livelihood of many families may be affected, he will have the matter investigated with a view to having conciliatory action taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the E.S.B. that there are no grounds for this allegation.  The board's view is that the reduced run on salmon was due to the unrestricted exercise of the public right of fishing in the estuary between 1946 and 1949 for which the board cannot be held responsible.</P>
      <P>While, as indicated above, I have made inquiries in this matter, I must make it clear that the operation of the Erne generating stations is in performance of the statutory obligations and functions imposed on the E.S.B. and is, therefore, a matter in which I have no function and no authority to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware the statistics show that the number of salmon going up the pass from the estuary to the dam was considerably depleted last year and will he not undertake to get the views of the fishermen in the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no statutory functions and no power to interfere in this matter.  The function of generating <Col N="415" /> electricity and doing the ancillary things which flow from that is imposed on the E.S.B. by statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that it is not an uncommon thing to have dead salmon removed from the pass which is used for bringing the salmon from the estuary to the dam?  Would he not consider it necessary to make inquiries with a view to having some suitable type of pass constructed? After all, the livelihood of many fishermen is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Deputy's last question, I caused this matter to be discussed with the E.S.B. to see if such intervention might produce the desired results, but there appears to be a complete conflict of views between the fishermen and the E.S.B.  The fishermen contend that the E.S.B. by releasing floodwaters are damaging the fishing.  The E.S.B., on the other hand, contend that the difficulty is caused by the fact that the estuary is being over-fished by the fishermen and <Col N="416" /> they are now paying for the over-fishing of the previous years.</P>

      <P>The records show that the question of the return to Ireland of the remains of Roger Casement was raised with the British Government when Mr. J.R. Clynes was Home Secretary in 1929-1931.  Following rumours that Pentonville Prison was to be demolished, a formal request for the return of the remains was made in January, 1936.  A reply, refusing the request, was received the following month.  Since then, numerous approaches have been made to members of the British Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to divulge the contents of the communications from the British Government on this matter. I can, however, tell him that they do not differ in substance from statements made in the British House to the effect that, apart from legal difficulties, the return of the remains would not tend to improve relations between the two countries but rather the reverse.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 24th May last, the existing statutory provisions in this matter are designed to ensure that ingredients or materials injurious to health are not added to articles of food for sale, or that any such article which is not of the nature, substance and quality demanded is not sold to the prejudice of the purchaser.  Furthermore, certain colouring matters specified in the Public Health (Saorstát Éireann) (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations, 1928, may not be added to food.  It is not an offence to sell dyed or artifically coloured fish as such providing that none of the prohibited colours is used.</P>
      <P>Action on public health grounds would not be justified in this matter unless one of the above provisions is contravened.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before sub-section (5) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5)  The board may require the club to contribute towards the general expenses of the board to assist it in fufilling its functions under this Act such proportion of the net revenue of the club as in the opinion of the board is reasonable. &mdash;(Deputy O'Malley.)</P>

      <P>In speaking to this amendment when the debate was adjourned, the one thing we were <Col N="429" /> anxious to ensure was that there should be more cohesion between the board and the club and, with that object in view, we hoped that the club would be able to assist the board in improving the industry.  The object of the Bill is to improve the greyhound industry.  As I have already stated in speaking on this provision, I speak as one who is associated in a small way with the Irish Coursing Club, and I feel it is a reasonable request to make that the club should help the board. In making that request, I feel I am making a request in the national interest. If the club, as a result of its work during the years it has been in existence is able, through its revenue, to assist the board, I think it should do so; and, on the other hand, the board should assist the club, if that is necessary.  There should be greater co-operation between these bodies.  If the money is available in the club to an extent that is worthwhile, it should be in a position to help the board a good deal more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the club contributing to the board, if it wishes to do so.  The effect of this amendment would be to authorise the board to request from the club contributions from the club's funds as, and when, the board thought fit.  I believe that the board is furnished with a sufficient revenue for the purpose of improving the racing end of the industry from the levies it is authorised to collect from the betting public through the bookmakers and the tote and that it does not require to supplement that income from any other source.  I want the club to have its revenues to use for the improvement of breeding and coursing and I do not want anyone to have a statutory right to take from the club any of the funds which it has and which it could use for those purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, however, the club wishes at any time to offer the board a specific sum to do some specific task for it, it is quite free to do so, but we are trying, as best we may under this legislation, to set up a situation in which the board will primarily concern itself with racing and matters relating thereto and with the improving of amenities <Col N="430" /> and stakes so as to raise the general standard of greyhound racing, and in which they shall have the revenues derived from the levies on bets, and at the same time, the Irish Coursing Club will retain its functions primarily relating to coursing and breeding and the keeping of the stud book, and shall have its income for those purposes. That seems to me to be an equitable and sensible arrangement and I am quite satisfied that, from the levies proposed, the board will have ample income for its purposes and that there is no justification whatever for giving the board the right further to supplement that ample income by requesting from the Irish Coursing Club such sums as the board may from time to time feel inclined to request, without the consent of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>I want to submit to the House that this argument is really in a large measure unrealistic because the board will consist as to more than 50 per cent. of elected members of the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club and if both parties&mdash;and we must assume in these circumstances that if the industry is to thrive and prosper, as I hope it will, the board and the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club will work in the closest collaboration&mdash;think it is mutually advantageous that the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club should ask the board to do some chore for it, in consideration of the executive committee reimbursing the board for any outlay involved in doing the chore they are asked to do, there is nothing to prevent such an arrangement being entered into between the board and the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club. I would suggest that Deputies would not press forward with what is a wholly unnecessary and what could be a most vexatious approach&mdash;that the board should have the right to make a statutory request on the Irish Coursing Club for part of its funds which generally should be kept by the Irish Coursing Club for purposes of improving breeding and coursing, leaving the board the task of improving racing and ancillary matters out of the income that would become available to them through a levy on bets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see where the Minister has given any evidence to substantiate his suggestion that this amendment is vexatious.  It is a most reasonable amendment in so far as it is permissive.  It says the board may. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is very important. Does the Minister not appreciate the fact that the occasion could arise, and possibly will arise in the very near future if certain developments take place, when the Irish Coursing Club will have very large funds indeed through the realisation of assets?  It is possible that, in the near future, the club will have much more money than they would require to deal with the question of breeding and coursing.  I was very interested to hear the Minister specifically mention breeding and coursing.  For the first time, he suggested that the Irish Coursing Club were more or less dealing exclusively with breeding and coursing.  There was no mention of racing.  He said the board would deal with all ancillary matters&mdash;greyhound racing and all that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to realise that consideration of the Bill would have been completed sooner if such reasonable amendments as mine were accepted by him.  The fact is that since the House discussed this amendment on the last occasion, it has come to light that the Irish Coursing Club are possibly about to cash in on some of their greatest assets.  The main point of the amendment is this: if there are more moneys in the possession of the Irish Coursing Club than will be needed for the improvement of breeding and coursing, would it not be a good idea that the board could require them to contribute from that surplus cash?  If the club have surplus cash&mdash;and they may have quite a considerable amount of it in the near future&mdash;plus a continuing large amount of revenue down through the years, would the Minister not agree with me that, through the obtaining of some of such moneys from the club, the board might be able to <Col N="432" /> reduce the levy?  The Minister has stated that this levy is more or less to see how things go for the first year. Obviously, the board cannot get any money from the club if the club have not got a surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Racing Board should have funds enough under the provisions made for them.  I do not see why they should have access to further funds.  In fact, I anticipate they will have a surplus of funds after some years' operation.  The Irish Coursing Club assets have been built up over the years.  They represent a creditable performance on the part of the Committee of the Irish Coursing Club and I do not see why the Racing Board should have access to them.  I can only think that the amendments have been drafted for the purpose of reducing or attacking the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  There is no fear that the Racing Board will be short of funds.  If anything, they should have substantial funds to carry on their business.</P>

      <P>The more we discuss this Bill from section to section, the more we forget what is in the sections themselves and the more we become confused.  Deputy Barry, by way of interjection, said categorically &mdash; and the Minister nodded his head in confirmation and approval&mdash;that the board would be exclusively concerned with matters of racing as distinct from coursing activities.  That was stated, and I wonder if the Minister now adheres to it.  I would bring to his notice sub-section (5) and subsequent sub-sections of Section 16 which say that, among other matters, the board will apply its funds to the following purposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v)  The preservation of hares, and the care and management of hares in connection with authorised coursing meetings,</P>
      <P>(vi)  assisting the club in the performance of its functions or contributing to the cost of schemes operated by the club for the improvement and development of greyhound breeding and coursing,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> (vii)  any purpose conducive to the development of the export trade in greyhounds,</P>
    <P>(viii)  any other purpose conducive to the improvement and development of the greyhound industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely to goodness Deputy Barry cannot now adhere to the viewpoint that the board is going to deal exclusively with the racing of greyhounds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Pounds, shillings and pence are involved in the whole thing. The man who sends a bitch to the stud has to pay a fee.  You start off right there.  When the litter arrives they are not given away.  They are sold. Thus, the breeding industry is a big activity.  I admit that the coursing side of the thing can be regarded clearly as sport, although at the big coursing events you have betting attached to it; when there is a big coursing event on, you will see in any paper the betting odds of the various dogs that are contesting. Deputy O'Malley's amendment simply says: &ldquo;Because the board will have certain responsibilities and certain activities they should have some other source besides their income from the bookmakers in order to meet their expenses.&rdquo;  The board may have to appeal for assistance to the Irish <Col N="434" /> Coursing Club.  The income from the racing side which will flow into the Exchequer and the board is problematical. That will only be resolved as a result of trial and error.  As regards the levy on the public and the tax on the tote nobody will know what the income will be until at least three or four years have passed.</P>

      <P>I am putting it to the Deputy that we should approach this question in a sensible and practical way so that at a later stage we will not have to bring in amendments to remedy something which will not work because at this stage we forgot to put in a certain cog amongst the wheels. Everybody hopes that the income will be sufficient to meet the board's requirements so that it may not be necessary to have a levy on the public at all, but nobody knows at the moment.</P>
      <P>As I have said, Section 16 clearly makes the board responsible for the rendering of specific services to the club.  Perhaps Deputy Barry will look at these provisions if I read them out. Sub-sections (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) are all the sub-sections putting the responsibility on the shoulders of the board to do these things exclusively for the Irish Coursing Club.  Deputy O'Malley wants to provide in his amendment for the situation which may arise where the board may feel that because they are rendering these services they need some financial assistance and that therefore they should be allowed not to demand it immediately or to demand it continuously but from time to time to come along and say: &ldquo;We want £500 this year.  We have a lot of travelling to do on your behalf.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the board in the position that if they give a sufficient reason to the club they will be recouped for certain expenses.  I take it Deputy Barry in the meantime has glanced at Section 16 and the sub-sections to which I have referred and he will see the sense of what I am saying.  If, as the Minister seems to <Col N="436" /> think, there is complete and adequate co-operation between the representatives of the Irish Coursing Club on the board and the appointed members of the board, there would be no difficulty in having such matters resolved.  On the other hand, it is quite possible that some years from now the appointed members of the board and the elected representatives of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club will be in conflict, because obviously the elected representatives of the Irish Coursing Club on this board, if they are properly representative of the club, would have the interests of the club mainly at heart and would resist as far as possible paying for something that they could get for nothing.</P>
      <P>I can see the club saying at some stage: &ldquo;This is not our job.  You must do this.&rdquo;  They could refer to Section 16 and say: &ldquo;The club is not responsible for the preservation of hares and the management of hares in connection with various coursing meetings. That is the board's job.&rdquo;  That may occur as a result of the club discovering that that would cost money and that there would be no recoupment from the club by the board.  I was astonished when Deputy Barry said that the board will conduct activities exclusively connected with greyhound racing.  Is he now satisfied that the board has much wider responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have come some distance.  If the two of us were greyhounds and one of us won by that slight distance, it would make all the difference.  Even in a photo finish there is a difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some people who are gifted by Providence in being able to say in three words what it takes me an hour to say but that is not my fault.  I am trying to express what I have to say in the hope that, thick as I may be, others will understand me.  A long period of time has elapsed since this Bill was before us previously and the Minister has had an opportunity to go over all the discussions and to see whether he <Col N="437" /> could change his mind or his approach from what he previously expressed it to be, or if he is still sticking to the rigid word for word, line for line, section for section, details of the Bill as presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I offered to accept that amendment if the Deputy changed one word&mdash;&ldquo;require&rdquo; to &ldquo;request&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has forbidden me accepting that change because he has himself defined the meaning of the word &ldquo;request&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy proposed the word &ldquo;request&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I proposed that there should be a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the board will have four members of the Irish Coursing Club Standing Committee out of a total membership of seven and, therefore, if they make a request, the request will obviously be acceded to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  At this stage I am of the opinion that, so long as the word &ldquo;request&rdquo; has been defined as meaning a demand that need not be met, it does not have the same connotation as &ldquo;require&rdquo;.  I want the Minister to understand that he can put in a safeguard and, if the requirement appears to be far greater in amount than the club would be willing to meet, there should be a saving clause; some person should be brought in to arbitrate, if you like, or seek a compromise as between the differences of the two interests.  If the Minister thinks that the amendment, if it is embodied in the Bill, might create possibilities of too large demands from the board to the club, then there could be a saving clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather taken by surprise when I heard this Bill was coming on to-day because we have had so many false starts in the past few weeks.  I was not ready to go into the trap.  I did not have a chance of going over our recent discussions.  Now that I am getting back into the position of being able to appreciate what was in my mind before, there is sense in this <Col N="438" /> amendment and, if it is not accepted, we will be doing the board and the public a grievous harm; if the board is to render services to the club, which will involve the board in expenditure large or small, that should not be recouped from the public through the levies.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to be reasonable about this. Even if he is prepared to say: &ldquo;There is some sense in the thing and we will have another go at it; it may be possible to reach agreement on it&rdquo;, I will be satisfied.  But if the Minister's answer is a definite &ldquo;No&rdquo;, I am afraid we cannot let up on it because there is this definite requirement in Section 16 for the board to do jobs, jobs which will cost money, for the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Burke has gone because I am sure he would agree with me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke is here. Surely to goodness, he is big enough to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  He would agree with me, I am sure, that coursing is the better part of the sport but racing is the major industry.  That is the view held by those who have been interested in coursing and devoted to greyhounds for many years. I am quite jealous of the activities of the Coursing Club.  I do not want those activities interfered with. Neither do I want demands made upon the club.  On the contrary, I think this new board should provide any help coursing wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to be very reasonable, but my experience has been that coursing has always had to be helped. Meetings are run in a small way in local districts.  I think it is a good thing to have a body like the Racing Board, which has access to considerable funds, to help these small meetings to carry on.  I have not the slightest doubt as to the funds which will be made available to the new Racing Board as a result of this levy on the bet and on the tote.  I am quite sure the funds will be quite adequate and will not require to have anything contributed to them from the <Col N="439" /> funds of the Irish Coursing Club.  The flow, indeed, may be in the other direction.  But one has to have a safeguard. One has four members of the Irish Coursing Club on the board and, from what I know of the members, I am sure they will be matter-of-fact and intelligent in the way they meet one another.</P>
    <P>If anything, I think the assistance must come from the tracks to the mother industry which creates the goods the tracks display for sale.  That is the way in which I looked upon the investigation.  That is the way in which I look upon this legislation.  All we are trying to do is so to improve the shop window&mdash;the racing track&mdash; to clean it up and make sure the right product is properly displayed that the industry as a whole and the farmer, who breeds the raw material, will get better and more rewarding results.  I think there is no danger whatever about any shortage of funds or any excessive demands being made on the Racing Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>All this boils down really to the question as to which is more important, the beginning or the end.  I think there is a certain measure of agreement as between Deputy Barry and my colleagues.  Deputy Barry has said that racing is, in fact, the industry. Racing has now become almost the beginning and the end of the industry.  Without racing, there would be no greyhound breeding industry of any commercial value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are dealing with an industry.  The Bill itself is entitled &ldquo;The Greyhound Industry Bill&rdquo;.  It is the interests of the industry, therefore, that ought to be our primary concern.  I do not think there will be much difference of opinion between us from that point of view.  I think that the Minister has, therefore, been ill-advised in trying to divorce racing from breeding and coursing.  Certainly one cannot divorce breeding from racing.  The majority of pups bred are bred for the racetrack and, from that point of view, it is of primary importance that, right from the beginning, <Col N="440" /> this board should be placed in a paramount position in relation to the industry and everything that appertains to it.</P>
    <P>It should from the beginning also be placed in possession of the resources which will enable it to fulfil the functions this legislation will impose upon it and, it is in order to ensure that, that Deputy O'Malley put down this amendment.  He put it down on behalf of those of us who have taken an interest in this Bill, because we were coerced into the belief that, unless there was a radical change in the control, management, direction and policy, even of the reformed Irish Coursing Club, the provisions in the Bill would be found in practice to be ineffective. That is the reason we put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>We put it down, in fact, with full advertence to the report of the committee of which Deputy Barry was a member.  Let me say at once it is a very useful report and I think it redounds greatly to the credit of the members of that committee.  They must have given an enormous amount of personal time and attention to it.  What I am concerned about now is to ensure that the fruits of their labours will not be lost.  Since we are legislating in consequence of the report of the committee, if not in fulfilment of its recommendations, we should at any rate try to ensure that, where the committee have pointed to failures in practice on the part of the Irish Coursing Club, there will not be a repetition of these things in the future.</P>
    <P>I have in mind what the committee said in paragraph 111 at page 45 of the report.  Having referred to the position of the <i>Greyhound and Sporting Press</i>, they went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite these liquid assets and the fact that the assets and property of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Ltd., must be regarded as being held in trust for the Irish Coursing Club, it appears that this concern has never contributed any portion of its substantial profits to the Irish Coursing Club.  Its profits have either been ploughed back <Col N="441" /> through the construction of buildings, installation of plant, etc., or invested elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, the purpose of this amendment is to give the board a certain degree of financial control over the Irish Coursing Club to ensure that any surplus income accruing to the Irish Coursing Club will, if the board considers it reasonable to do so, be appropriated by the board for the general purposes for which the board has been constituted, that is to say, for the benefit of the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>I might go on to point out what the report says in the concluding sentence of this paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot therefore accept as sufficient, the explanation as to why the company did not contribute to the funds of the Irish Coursing Club as a whole, during a period when coursing might have received greater financial assistance, e.g., by way of reducing fees, increasing prize money at coursing meetings, or employing additional supervisory staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that, if this surplus income does accrue to the club, arising out of the properties which it now holds, it should be made available for the general purposes of the board. These are properties which, we have been told, are really held in trust for the members of the Irish Coursing Club &mdash; properties which have been acquired admittedly as a result of careful management on the part of the standing committee of the club&mdash;but they have ultimately resulted because of the activities of those who breed, course and race greyhounds in this country.</P>
    <P>We do not suggest that the board should be given powers of arbitrary decision in relation to that matter.  We are only asking that this board&mdash;a majority of the members of which will be members of the Irish Coursing Club &mdash;be put in the position to make such requirements as are in the opinion of the board reasonable.  I am sure that the Minister or nobody else will suggest that the four members of the Irish Coursing Club on the board will act in an unreasonably harsh or unjustifiable way towards their colleagues in <Col N="442" /> the Irish Coursing Club.  I think it is unthinkable to envisage such an idea.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that we must regard coursing, breeding and racing as component parts of the greyhound industry, or essential elements in the greyhound industry, I do not see any reasonable objection to accepting an amendment of this sort, which will confirm the board in a position of having primary and paramount responsibility for the greyhound industry as a whole.  I am sure that when the arguments which I have used are considered&mdash;if we can consider them now after a lapse of time in a reasonable way and exchange counsels&mdash;the amendment which we have suggested will be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to turn to paragraphs 146 and 151 of the Report of the Advisory Committee. I think Deputy Barry was in agreement with these paragraphs. Paragraph 146 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That all fees in connection with coursing and breeding, as defined by the Irish Coursing Club and approved by the Control Board, be paid to the Irish Coursing Club....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Control Board to be entitled to demand out of Irish Coursing Club funds recoupment of any expenditure incurred by it in respect of coursing or breeding, or, alternatively, the payment of an annual levy to meet possible expenditure arising out of action necessarily taken by the board to deal with abuses in connection with breeding or coursing....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If you like, this amendment accepts that recommendation.  Paragraph 151 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As the new club will receive income&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, but the point I am making here is that, notwithstanding that recommendation that these matters be done by the Irish Coursing Club the Bill, when it becomes an Act, will require some of these matters to be done by the board, and not at the expense of the club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Paragraph 150 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have already recommended that all fees in connection with coursing and breeding should be lodged with the reorganised Irish Coursing Club and that the club should be charged with responsibility for the publication of <i>The Sporting Press</i>, and for the printing business known as The Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited.  Consequently the new club will have a sizable annual income.  We have previously proposed that final appeal should lie with the Control Board in respect of the financial operations of the club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The advisory committee admits, first of all, that the club has very considerable assets, fixed and liquid.  As a result of the Bill as it is framed, the club will have an enhanced income&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>And so, I hope, will the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the hope.  That is the speculative side of it.  You have a certain position at the moment.  You are going to have that position definitely improved.  The board is going to start from scratch.  It has power to borrow at the beginning to keep itself going for a certain period.  But what I am trying to get the Minister to accept is that where the club is going to have enhanced income&mdash;very substantially enhanced income&mdash;at least, if the board is doing a job on behalf of or for the benefit of the Irish Coursing Club, it should be entitled to a contribution from the Irish Coursing Club and the board should be entitled to ask for a contribution.</P>
      <P>If the Minister says he will take out those sections&mdash;Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8, which I read out&mdash;from the Bill and put that responsibility back on the Irish Coursing Club, subject to the over-all control of the board, it might alter the position I have taken in arguing this amendment.  But so long as those are there, I say, in all equity, to everybody concerned: you must give the board power and authority to collect from the club at least what they lay out for the benefit of the club.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no prospect even that, if necessary, there could be an overriding limit to the amount which might be required?  That would be one way of dealing with this&mdash;that the board might require the club to contribute a certain proportion of its surplus income&mdash;surplus income, let me emphasise&mdash;to the board to assist it in fulfilling its functions.  I think that is perhaps one way of finding a compromise as between the Minister's point of view and the point of view of those who sit on these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot shut his eyes to the fact that the Report of the Advisory Committee points out that <Col N="446" /> there have been certain detects of judgment&mdash;I do not want to put it any higher than that&mdash;in the conduct of the affairs of the Irish Coursing Club in the past.  It may have been that they were pursuing a policy of building up assets, with the general idea of advancing the industry, but, in the meantime, these assets have been built up at a time, as Deputy Barry has told us when he previously spoke, when coursing clubs have had to be helped. The help that was given to them was not, I think, sufficient.</P>
    <P>We are pretty anxious that, when this Racing Board starts off, it will be endowed with everything that is essential to enable it to function successfully.  It is quite clear that at the beginning it will have no assets whatever, no source of income which will not be, as Deputy Briscoe has said, of a speculative nature.  There have been slumps in greyhound racing before, as those who have been associated with the sport in any way know and, unfortunately, there are not any grounds for hoping that the past will not repeat itself in this regard.</P>
    <P>For that reason, if the Minister would be prepared to accept or draft an amendment which would give the Racing Board some assured source of income from the very beginning, sufficient to enable it to function as I am sure he wants it to function, then we would be satisfied.  We are certainly prepared to have an element of give and take in this, provided that the principle is accepted that the Racing Board will have a degree of control over the financial operations of the Irish Coursing Club.  I think we are justified in asking for that, having regard to the findings of the Advisory Committee.</P>

      <P>I regret it has become more necessary than ever.  This amendment arises from the fact that, between now and the enactment of this Bill by the Oireachtas and the President, presumably a substantial period of time will elapse.  Furthermore, it is, I think, implicit in some of the statements made by the Minister that he will not proceed to appoint a day until a much later date than that upon which the Bill becomes law.  Meantime, it is well to remind the House that the Irish Coursing Club has very substantial assets, which, as Deputies who remember the debate on the preceding amendment will recall, have not been utilised to the benefit and advantage of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>

      <P>That may be.  If so, the danger which I apprehended has become somewhat reduced, but it still exists.  It has not disappeared.  The danger I fear is that between now and the time when the Minister can exercise authority over the affairs of this club by appointing the day and bringing the board into existence, the assets now the property of the club, may be dissipated.</P>

      <P>The Minister will permit me to continue.  I am aware, of course, that there are certain weaknesses in our position because we are only discussing legislative proposals. There is no statutory authority which would allow the Minister to say to the gentlemen of the Irish Coursing Club: <Col N="450" />&ldquo;Unless you preserve the assets of the club intact to be handed over to the club on the appointed day in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the Bill now before the House, I shall, before the Bill becomes law, take power to hold you responsible for the safe custody of those assets.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has at the moment no effective power of control, but at least if the Legislature embodies the amendment in the legislation which it is now considering, those who have custody of these assets will at least have been forewarned as to the course of action which the Oireachtas expects them to pursue in regard to them.</P>
      <P>I was going on to remind the House when the Minister interrupted me that the Irish Coursing Club has very substantial assets.  It has, among other things, the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited.  It has, as well as that, the control of Powerstown Park which its holding in Powerstown Park, Limited, confers upon it.  The assets are considerable.  According to the report, in February of 1952, when the report was being drafted, the valuation&mdash;I have no authority for this statement beyond that it seems a reasonable assumption&mdash;placed on the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, by the representatives of the Irish Coursing Club was no less than £60,000.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that that valuation has been reduced.  On the contrary, the probabilities are that it has been substantially increased.  I think, apart altogether from printing, the Sporting Press carry out other printing work for the Irish Coursing Club itself.  The Greyhound and Sporting Press is now printing news papers for other interests.  I assume that they are interests which could be disentangled from the operations of the Greyhound and Sporting Press but they are, I understand, operations which are conducted on behalf of persons who occupy positions as officers of the Sporting Press.  I understand, in fact, that there is a provincial weekly newspaper with a very substantial circulation being printed by the Greyhound and Sporting Press.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll gave notice that, on the motion for the Adjournment, she would raise the subject matter of question No. 3 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>My reasons for raising this question on the adjournment are threefold.  First of all, I had this question in last Friday at about 3.15 p.m., shortly after the coal inquiry ended.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the inadequacy of the evidence submitted by the Dublin coal importers in support of their claim for an increase of £2 8s. 6d. a ton, he will not sanction any increase until the claim has been re-examined in public.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That question should, in the normal course of events, have been on the Order Paper yesterday.  The Minister asked me to postpone it until Thursday.  I do not think I could be wrong in implying or inferring from that request that there was a possibility that no action would be taken in the matter of an increase until my question was put to the House.  Contrary to that, the price of coal was increased yesterday by 30/- a ton.</P>
      <P>My second reason for raising this question on the Adjournment is that the application by the Dublin coal merchants was completely dishonest; my third reason is that the evidence submitted in support of their claim was totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>When the inquiry adjourned on Friday, there was certain information which myself and other consumers' organisations had tried to elicit from the applicants through the Prices Advisory Body.  Some of that information was, in my opinion, very relevant, particularly the amount of coal the merchants had in stock at the old price.  In other words, we wanted the merchants to tell us what stocks they held prior to the 1st June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was extraordinary that those <Col N="452" /> people who were making the application were not in a position to give us the information that morning though they did say they would have it that afternoon.  In my opinion, this was a very important question.  If we elicited the information that the coal held at the old price would still be sold at the old price, it would have some effect towards modifying the increased price when it became operative.</P>
    <P>On the adjournment of the inquiry, I pressed for the information from the chairman of the Prices Advisory Body. I am repeating this because it happened in public at the inquiry.  The chairman asked me whether, if the merchants sent him that information and he passed it on to me, I would be satisfied.  I said there was no need to satisfy me because the fact of the matter was that he had to satisfy the public, that it was a public inquiry and that he could get the information.  He then told me I could publish it, to which I said it was not my function.  I left the inquiry under the impression that no recommendation would be made by this body to the Minister until the relevant information outstanding had been supplied to the body and, in turn, to us as consumers' organisations.</P>
    <P>As well as the question of stocks of coal, we were anxious to find out what percentage of cheaper coals were imported by the coal merchants.  The inquiry revealed that, while the maximum increase by the British Coal Board was 27/- a ton, there were other increases of 24/6 a ton.  The merchants contended that they imported some of that coal at the lower price and sold it to coal merchants.  The Waterford merchants admitted they bought on a 50-50 basis, that is, 50 per cent. dear coal and 50 per cent. cheap coal. The Dublin merchants could not tell what percentage of the cheaper and of the dearer coals they bought.  They maintained there were various grades on sale in Dublin in spite of the fact that the Housewives' Association and the Lower Prices Council maintain that when a domestic consumer purchased coal from the merchant there was only one coal, that is, top price coal; quality does not matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> It was further advanced at this inquiry by members of the Prices Advisory Body that the coal upon which merchants were basing their claim&mdash;best Yorkshire coal&mdash;was not available from some of the merchants. I believe that a member of the body went to some merchants and asked for best Yorkshire coal and was told that they never heard of it.</P>
    <P>I thought it was the intention of this inquiry to satisfy the public that only when an increase in price was unavoidable would the increase be imposed. The Friday inquiry proved beyond doubt that the Dublin coal merchants' application was dishonest.  The subsequent results of the inquiry, that is, the recommendation to the Minister, and his acceptance of it, of an increase of 30/- per ton for the Dublin area, which is 3/- above the maximum price passed on by the British Coal Board is, in my opinion, untenable.  My purpose now is to ask the Minister to reconsider this application, to have it re-examined and, if it is found necessary, though I do not believe it will, for the 27/- to be imposed on the price of coal coming into this country, that all sections will participate in it and bear a part of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister was naïve enough to say, in his Press statement, that he had accepted the assurance of the coal merchants that none of the old coal would be sold at the new price.  How many of the Minister's inspectors went this morning to the Dublin coal merchants to see what the price of coal was and how many succeeded in getting it at the old price of £9 3s. 6d. a ton?  Several members of the public approached me, particularly after 9 o'clock, and told me that they could only get coal at £10 13s. 6d. a ton.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter carefully.  If the public is to continue to have confidence in this Prices Advisory Body, which is the only means they have of voicing their grievances and of being protected from exploitation, if the Minister wants that confidence to continue, he should insist on a standstill Order in relation to this increased price and have an inquiry opened immediately. The only people to provide information <Col N="454" /> are the coal merchants.  The Housewives' Association and the Lower Prices Council are ready and have been ready since last week.</P>
    <P>The coal merchants, either by malice aforethought or because they were so sure that there was no need to give detailed costings, did not bother to have for the inquiry the very important information, namely, the types, the amount and the proportions of the different priced coal they had in stock.</P>
    <P>The proposal of the Dublin merchants to sell coal on a bag basis of 14/6 a bag was, in my opinion, another dishonest application.  I do not think it would be fair to the bellmen in Dublin, who supply the bulk of the poorer classes with coal, to put them in competition with their own suppliers. They would have to sell at a higher margin.  When I asked the coal merchants at the Prices Advisory Body what quantity of coal was sold ex-ship and what would the new price be on the bag basis, I could not get the information.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is sincere&mdash;and I believe he is&mdash;in protecting the consumer against any unavoidable increases, he must ensure that these increases are proved necessary&mdash;but only after detailed investigation, not like what we had last Friday.  These increases should be shared by the importers, distributors and, in part, by the consumers.  We must stop this protection and subsidising of profits at the expense of the consumer.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to check my statement about the price of coal this morning at nine o'clock and to find out if coal was available at the old price and, in view of my submissions, to have the inquiry reopened in the public interest.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll gave three reasons for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I do not propose to deal with one of these reasons.  She says that the application of the coal merchants was dishonest. This is a matter between Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll and the coal merchants.  In so far as Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll was prepared at one stage to recommend <Col N="455" /> that the coal merchants should get an increase of 27/- a ton, at least it looks as if she was travelling for some time, at all events, in that company which she now describes as dishonest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain it all.  On the question of the postponement of the question, the decision in this matter was taken by me on Monday. Because another engagement kept me out of the House, I asked that the few questions I had yesterday at Question Time should be brought over to to-day and I said that I would take them to-day. My desire in that respect was to answer the questions myself and all of my questions of yesterday were transferred to to-day.  There was no special request to Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll to postpone this particular question and all six or seven questions were postponed until to-day, but Mrs. O'Carroll gives the impression that there was some occult influence at work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy was disappointed about the publicity associated with yesterday's announcement, but the fact of the matter is that the decision was taken on Monday and this question was not postponed to enable the information to get out first and there was no question of postponing the question until the announcement was made.</P>
      <P>The third question was that of inadequate information.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll is quite clearly going on the line this evening that this House is competent to try the application of the coal merchants for an increase in price. The House, of course, is not competent to try that application again.  If the Deputy does not want the case tried again, apparently she regards this House as a court of appeal against the decision of the Prices Advisory Body.</P>

      <P>I do not presume to be able to fathom Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll's reasoning on this matter.  The Prices Advisory Body was set up consisting of two representatives who might be said to represent manufacturing interests. The other two members of the board are two trade union officials, in whom apparently, Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll has so little faith.  Another person that I put on specially is a special income-tax investigator and the chairman of the tribunal is a Supreme Court judge. That tribunal is not balanced in favour of the coal merchants and, if there is any tilt at all, it is the other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And I think it is right that it should be balanced in favour of the consumer.  I do not think the tribunal should be neutral in the matter of prices.  I think its tendency should be to keep prices back and to keep them down and, if there is any doubt, the consumer ought to get the benefit of that doubt.  That was the body which dealt with the application and it is not the first time it has dealt with that application.  During the past 12 months, in addition to holding three separate inquiries, the Advisory Body devoted a considerable amount of its time to the examination of costings, statements and audited financial accounts of individual coal merchants before the holding of the public inquiry on the 8th June.  They have had discussions and correspondence with the Dublin Coal Trade Association and with individual coal merchants in relation to their own accounts and the Prices Advisory Body have informed me that they were satisfied that they got all the information they wanted. That means that the two trade union officials there were apparently satisfied that they got all the information they wanted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me go on to the Trade Union Congress memorandum. Paragraph 16 of the memorandum of the Trade Union Congress contains this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As the present price of £9 3s. 6d. for coal in Dublin has been approved by the Prices Advisory Body, we suggest that only such increases in cost as have taken place since this price was fixed should be considered by the body as warranting any adjustment in the retail price.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Read paragraph 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make my own case in my own way.  There is a statement that only such increases in cost as have taken place since the price was fixed previously should be considered.  Twenty-seven shillings was the increase in the cost of coal, but there are other increases also.  In the price of every ton of coal there is a charge for short weight, that is loss of weight in transit.  The coal is weighed at the pit head; it is weighed on to the wagons and the wagons are sent over the railway and they are open wagons.  They finally arrive at the quayside.  They are taken off the quayside by grabs and put into ships in the harbour.  These ships are moving slightly in the tide and the wagons are tilted on to the ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has seen coal on the quayside has seen coal fall into the sea or into the river when the coal is being loaded or unloaded from the ship.  That loss in weight counts against the importers. Then it has to be unloaded at the quayside again at the port of importation and it has to be taken <Col N="459" /> from there to the coal merchants' yard. Those who have been in the coal trade all their lives know this and it is well known to sailors and to people associated in a practical way with the coal trade that a loss of weight in this way is something that is inevitable in the trade, with the result that in making up the price of coal, the importer is charged the pit-head price and he pays for the pit-head weight when it is imported, and in the whole reckoning of coal prices that loss in weight in transit is an element which makes up a charge that has to be considered in the fixation of prices.</P>
    <P>Similarly, when dealing with good quality coal, which is soft coal, the tendency for a portion of the coal to become slack is increased, in accordance with the quality of the coal.  If it is good quality soft coal, there is a greater tendency to slack than in the case of hard coal, and the more you handle that type of coal the greater will be the volume of slack in the coal. Slack, therefore, has always been an element in the fixation of the price of coal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>They give it away for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll should try to restrain her petulance and should not be annoyed because I give the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the word &ldquo;petulance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>These are two items.  It is quite easy for any Deputy to see that, if coal prices go up, the value of the slack is correspondingly increased in price.  These are two elements to be allowed for when the merchant is paying a greater price for his coal. Transport had increased also by reason of the increased price of petrol and the importers, I understand, made the case that the city rates had increased. They also made the case that one very big item which pressed on them was the fact that additional moneys are required for the servicing of capital. Coal merchants have got to pay for their coal to the British National Coal <Col N="460" /> Board within seven days and if they have to pay a higher rate, represented by 27/- a ton more than they previously paid, they have the case that the servicing of that additional capital should be an element which the Prices Advisory Body should take into consideration.</P>
      <P>Without attempting to say that the Prices Advisory Body was right and that this was a correct price to fix, the plain facts are that the price of coal has been increased by 27/- a ton in England and that, in addition, the Prices Advisory Body allowed an additional 3/- per ton, that is 30/- per ton, instead of the 48/6 which the coal merchants sought.  Presumably the Prices Advisory Body took into consideration such items as slackage, loss of weight in transport, increased transport charges, increased city rates and the servicing of additional capital.  I presume that is the reason why the price was fixed at 30/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister knew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 18/6 per ton less than the coal merchants sought, and less than they might have charged had there been no Prices Advisory Body functioning in the public interest.  On what happened between Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll and the Prices Advisory Body I am not qualified to express an opinion because I was not there.  I deal only in facts.  I understand, however, that a point was made before the Prices Advisory Body that there was second-grade coal in stock in some of the merchants' yards.  Of course, any amateur can see coal in a merchant's yard and assume that it is all household coal.  Quite a number of the merchants will have industrial coal, which is not the type of coal which was the subject of the Prices Advisory Body's examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was estimated, however, that the amount of second-grade coal in stock was approximately 900 tons.  That was the information offered by the coal merchants and the officers of the Prices Branch of my Department are now checking the quantity of all household coal which was in stock at the time the increase was sought and at the time the Prices Advisory Body made <Col N="461" /> its recommendation.  As a matter of fact, I do not think it has much bearing on the whole situation, if the total amount in stock was 900 tons or even twice that much.  The total amount of domestic coal used in Dublin in a year is 500,000 tons.  If you tried to get the fraction of that which 900 tons would represent I feel sure it would be so microscopic as not to make any serious difference in price fixation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>This time last year one merchant had 5,000 tons in stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest the Prices Advisory Body should go down and chivvy everybody to find out the few tons they had in stock?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is so infantile as to be impossible for anybody seriously to consider it.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll wanted to know what the quantity in stock was and I understand it was the intention of the Prices Advisory Body, when they had the final figures available, to supply that information.  I presume it will be supplied in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for the Prices Advisory Body.  It conducts its own business and follows its own procedure.  The Deputy knows <Col N="462" /> that or ought to know it by now.  The Prices Advisory Body will presumably supply the information she wants.  On the question of second grade coal as compared with first grade coal, I understand the position to be that the total quantity of second grade coal imported into Dublin is about 60,000 or 70,000 tons, out of 500,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy obviously thinks this is the Prices Advisory Body.  It is not.  The Deputy wants to re-try the whole case here.  It was tried by the Prices Advisory Body, weighted as it is on the consumers' side.  The Prices Advisory Body has recommended an increase of 30/- a ton, when the coal merchants sought 48/6. To the extent that they have protected the public from having to pay an increase of a further 18/6 a ton, I think they have done a good job.  We would all like to see coal prices lower, but, if we buy coal, we must pay the price asked for it by the person who sells it. That is particularly true in the case of any of the markets to which we have access and where they are charging higher prices for coal than the price at which we can get it.</P>
