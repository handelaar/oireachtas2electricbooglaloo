      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was referring to the movement of the cost-of-living index figure.  I mentioned that, so far as this country was concerned, it could not hope, with its resources, to insulate itself against economic shocks and convulsions which had made their impact on countries whose economic fabric was immensely stronger than ours, and that, if the cost-of-living index figure had moved upwards here, it had likewise moved upwards, and even to a greater extent upwards, in <Col N="1188" /> other countries with greater resources than ours.</P>
      <P>I do not quote these figures as justification for the Government alone. I quote them as justification for the country as a whole and whatever good news the Opposition can get from them they are quite entitled to it, because some of these movements took place during their period of office.</P>
      <P>Recently, a statistical table of world currencies was published.  The table set out the loss of purchasing power for the various currency units between 1946 and 1955.  It gives a list of 53 countries, showing their loss of purchasing power between 1946 and 1955. On that list, Ireland is thirteenth out of a total of 53 countries.  We have lost purchasing power and that loss of purchasing power is measured by the cost-of-living index figures in the various countries concerned and not by any international standard.  Behind us, suffering a greater loss of currency, were countries such as Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Persia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, New Zealand, Britain, Iceland, Mexico, Australia, Finland, Austria, Brazil, Greece, France, Japan, Israel, Indonesia, Chile and Bolivia.  In that company, we have managed as a nation to hold our currency in a much more self-respecting way than that list of countries&mdash;and they are only some of the countries with which a comparison has been made in this statistical return. I think, therefore, that when people write articles referring to the imminent economic collapse in Ireland they might usefully devote some of their available time to examining the imminence of economic collapses in the countries in which they reside.</P>
      <P>These figures do no indicate any economic collapse from the point of view of the stability or international self-respect of our currency.  If they do, then other countries who are well down the list behind us are in much greater danger of economic collapse than we are, though they are pointed out to us as countries which are economically strong and whose currencies are managed with the requisite orthodox prudence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we move from that to look at <Col N="1189" /> the cost-of-living index figure, let us make a comparison again from the point of view of showing how we have moved <i>vis-à-vis</i> another country, Britain. In mid-February, 1954, the cost-of-living index figure here was 124.  In Britain at that time, it was 140.  In mid-May, 1956, our cost-of-living index figure was 134&mdash;ten points above mid-February, 1954&mdash;but the British cost-of-living index figure moved from 140 to 158, that is, 18 points above the mid-February figure of 1954.  Therefore, with all the measures adopted by Britain, with her immense resources, her index figure had moved 18 points between mid-February, 1954, and mid-May, 1956, whereas our index figure moved ten points during the same period.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is an indication of the extent to which we have been able to manage, in difficult circumstances, to control the cost of living within the limits of the resources available to us. If the index figure has moved upwards from the point of view of those who have got to earn their incomes, the figures show that they have been able to get compensation, which has had the effect of giving them more compensation than the amount they have lost by the upward movement of the cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    <P>I take figures published by the Central Statistics Office on the index of industrial earnings.  Taking 1938 as 100, we find that in the first quarter of 1954, the index of real industrial earnings was 107.9.  In the fourth quarter of 1954, it had moved up to 110.8.  In the first quarter of 1955 it had moved to 109.8 and in the last quarter of 1955, it had moved to 116.9.  That is virtually a movement of ten points in the last quarter of 1955 as compared with the first quarter of 1954.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that that is based on 1938?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the comparison is all right.  The figures for the first quarter of 1956 are not yet available. <Col N="1190" /> These are the figures of earnings from which you subtract the increase in the cost of living and these figures show that our real earnings continue to rise above that cost of living.  I venture to say that the index figure for the first quarter of 1956 will show a continued rise in real earnings.</P>
      <P>We thus have a situation in which quite considerable compensation has been secured by the whole community of workers in every field of industrial endeavour.  We have not attempted to impose any wage freeze or standstill Order on wages.  A standstill Order or a wage freeze will be no part of the policy of this Government.  A situation has now been reached in which, I think, it is reasonable to say to the employers, on the one hand, and to trade unions on the other hand, and to industry generally, that we have got to be careful as to where we are going. What we need now is a period of stability in which people will know what their money will buy, in which workers will know what their wages will buy, and in which everyone will endeavour to put his shoulder to the wheel for the purpose of helping the nation over the difficulties which at present beset us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have further upward rises in prices and wages, they can have no other effect than to destroy and dislocate the whole economy of the country and I think it would be the workers and the wage earners who would suffer most in a situation of that kind.  The Government have had talks with the provisional committee of both trade union congresses.  These conferences have been full and well-informed. The congresses have approached the situation with a statesmanlike understanding of the difficulties and have shown an appreciation of the necessity for an orderly appraisal of the situation and a recognition of the difficulties involved.  Discussions with those organisations and the employers' organisations will, I hope, be continued, and I hope that on both sides, the trade union side and the employers' side, there will be a voluntary recognition, in the interest of the bodies which they represent, of the necessity for a proper and frank <Col N="1191" /> exchange of views.  I hope that that will instil in each of them a recognition of the desirability and imperative necessity of avoiding violent upward movements in prices and violent upward movements in wages or any type of industrial conflict which would weaken the economic fabric of the State, in view of the necessity for increased production on the part of every element in the State.</P>
    <P>I did not say in my speech, as Deputy Lemass alleged, that the whole responsibility for the increase in prices was due to increases in imports.  I mentioned that coal, which is a raw material of many of our industries, had increased abnormally and that freight charges had also increased.  These are charges the control of which does not reside with us and, so far as we have to buy coal, then we have to pay the world prices for that coal and buy it from those who are in a position to sell it.  As far as freight prices are concerned, a small country like this, with its mercantile marine still in the process of being built up, could never hope to set the pace in freight rates, or to keep down the freight rates that would be set by other countries.</P>
    <P>An examination of the prices situation is interesting.  In the period between February, 1955 and May, 1956 the consumer index figure showed an increase of 6.4 per cent.  In terms of points, the increase has been 7.9.  Let us get a break-down of that 7.9 and see what items in the consumer goods index have been affected and which contributed to that increase.  Of that 7.9 increase recorded in the period between February, 1955 and May, 1956, the increase for food was 2.5; the increase for clothing was .25; the increase for fuel was .78; the increase for housing .3 and the increase for sundries was 4 points.</P>
    <P>If you look at the food increase of 2.5, you will find that two items alone contributed to 1.1 of the increase.  Tea was responsible for an increase of .7 out of the 2.5.  We do not grow tea. As regards tea, we can do either of two things: we can either buy tea at the price at which we can get it or do without it.  We could never hope to <Col N="1192" /> regulate the price of tea here.  Another increase was in respect of milk.  Here the increase was .44, almost .5.  I understood that most parties in the country were anxious that the farmer should get more for his milk.  Those who take that view cannot, therefore, lament at the same time if the price of milk goes up so long as the profits on the price of milk go back to the man who owns the cow.</P>
    <P>All the other increases are trifling increases extending from tomatoes to pork sausages, oranges and biscuits. Out of the increase of 7.9 points only 2.5 is accounted for during that period by an increase in the price of food.  An increase of 4.06 in the price of sundries is accounted for by an increase in the price of tobacco and cigarettes to the extent of 1.66; an increase in travel inside and outside the country of .73; an increase in drink of .40; an increase in newspapers of .52&mdash;so that the increase in newspapers alone was responsible for one-eighth of the increase in the sundry group.  People who write articles in newspapers ought to remember that.  Education is responsible for an increase of .11.  Miscellaneous increases are expressed in the figure of .5.</P>
    <P>These are the facts.  When they are examined against the background of the movement in our food prices, it is not a record of which anybody ought to be ashamed that, in spite of considerable difficulties, the food position during that period, in an increase of 7.9 points in the consumer goods index, has been held down to an increase of 2.5.</P>
    <P>I have already quoted the figures of the index of industrial earnings which show the percentage increase granted to workers whose wages are used for the purpose of ascertaining the index of real wages.  They show that these workers have got more compensation in wages than the increase in the cost of living ordinarily would justify, but I take pride in the fact that, if we give people more wages and better wages, we give them a better standard of living, we give them a means of purchasing more goods from our producers, we create, by purchasing power in their hands, a bigger and wider <Col N="1193" /> market and we give those who produce agricultural goods or industrial goods an opportunity of selling them to customers who have money in their pockets to buy them.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any farmer ever getting rich by hoping to sell agricultural produce to a man who has no money in his pocket.  I cannot see any industrialist believing that his standard of production will increase or his standard of prosperity move upwards if he has the task of selling goods to people who have no wages, or little wages, or not sufficient wages to buy what the industrialist produces.  So long as purchasing power is the passport to buying goods, whether from the farmer or the factory, or buying services in the offices or in the public utilities, then, so long as we can have an ordinary development of the nation's economic life, money in the man's pocket and money in the housewife's purse is still the best means and the only one that I know of to ensure prosperity for agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>The question of rural electrification and the E.S.B. programme generally was raised in the course of this debate. I do not like to see the E.S.B. a shuttlecock of Irish politics.  I do not think that helps the E.S.B.  I hope we will get away from this temporary eruption in what otherwise has been a kind of neutral approach to the problems of the E.S.B. and electrical development generally.  So far as rural electrification is concerned, I gave the story at the outset.  Judging by some of the speeches that have been made, what I said was either unread by Deputies or its significance unappreciated. In 1951-52, the number of areas in which rural electrification had been completed for that year was 49.  In 1952-53, it was again 49; in 1953-54 it was 60; in 1954-55 it was 75 and in 1955-56 it was 99.  Is that not clear evidence for anybody not politically blinded that rural electrification has been accelerated at a rate previously unknown?</P>
    <P>So far as I have been concerned, I have told the E.S.B. to drive ahead on the rural electrification scheme.  These figures show that in 1954-55 and 1955-56, that is, during the last two years, we <Col N="1194" /> have hit the highest targets ever&mdash;75 in 1954-55; 99 in 1955-56.  I hope that, at least, that pace will be maintained. I should like to see it still further accelerated.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the E.S.B. had now found that they were over-planted, that is, that with the plant in commission and in sight they had more plant than they would need up to 1960-61.  I want to put this simple question to anybody in business, anybody engaged in agriculture, anybody who has even a modicum of common sense&mdash;is there any value to anybody in building a plant that you cannot work, that you cannot get value for? Is there any advantage in telling the E.S.B. to put up new power stations even though nobody will consume the current from these new power stations because the board have more capacity than they can sell from the other power stations already in existence?  Is not it just a matter of plain common sense that the E.S.B. ought to adjust its plant requirements to its capacity to sell its current?  The board have taken the view now, as I said in my opening speech, that it is over-planted, that is, that it has too much plant, and that it has been geared to a programme which the board, with its knowledge of electricity and with the technical advice which it can get&mdash;and that surely must be superior to anything we here can get&mdash;say they have more plant than they need, that is, that what is in commission and what is now operating is sufficient for their requirements for some years to come.</P>
    <P>I put it this way in my speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The development programme of the E.S.B., as set out in the Appendix to the White Paper which was published in March, 1954, provided for an increase in installed capacity to 1,022.5 mw. by 31st March, 1961, to meet a demand for electricity estimated at 3,350,000,000 units during that year.  The estimates of increased demand over the years were based on assumptions made in 1953 that the demand for electricity would double itself every five to five and a half years.  The rate of growth in demand for electricity has, however, shown a tendency to decline. <Col N="1195" /> Between 1952-53 and 1953-54 the demand increased by 11.3 per cent., and in 1954-55 it increased by a further 12.8 per cent. over the preceding year.  In 1955-56, however, the growth in demand was less than 8 per cent. despite the energetic sales campaign by the board and the considerable increase in the sales of its electrical appliances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not just an E.S.B. experience. That is a world experience if anybody had taken the trouble to examine the world figures.  The position, therefore, is that the board have passed a revised development programme which provides for a reduction to approximately 728 mw. in installed capacity in commission on the 31st March, 1961, to meet a demand which is now estimated at 2,430,000,000 units in that year instead of 3,350,000,000 units as contemplated in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The board go on to say that: &ldquo;Notwithstanding this downward revision it is anticipated that the margin of spare capacity available at times of peak load will be considerable, varying between 22½ per cent. and 33? per cent. over the years 1956-57 to 1960-61&rdquo;.  That is a surplus of actual generating capacity.  It is not based at all on the theoretical generating capacity of the board.  That excess of generating capacity is on the normal operation of the board from day to day&mdash;not its theoretical generating capacity which will have to be measured by the assumption that every plant was running at full blast for every minute of a 24-hour day.</P>
    <P>This increase is over the day to day generating capacity.  I think the statements made by Deputy Lemass indicated that he believed we were responsible for forcing the board to adopt this programme.  That is not so. That is not true.  The position is that, when the matter was discussed with the board, the board said to us that the figures in the White Paper of 1954 had proved to be unrealistic.  The assumption then was that the consumption of electricity would double in from five to five and a half years.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that it is <Col N="1196" /> taking something over 11 years instead of the five to five and a half years to double the consumption of electricity and the net question the board asked themselves is: Are we going to install plant on the basis of an unrealistic belief that the demand for electricity will double itself in from five to five and a half years, which is a world record now, or are we going to adjust our plant requirement to the realities of the situation as we see it here and to our anticipations for the future?</P>
    <P>I will quote this fact in furtherance of what I say.  The fact that existing installed capacity is more than adequate to meet the demand is illustrated by the fact that in the year 1955-56, which was very dry and during which a very heavy demand might have been expected on the steam stations, the Pigeon House station produced only 95,000,000 units.  In 1952-53, when comparable weather conditions were experienced, that station produced 417,000,000 units as compared with 368,000,000 units in 1951-52.  The stand-by capacity is more than adequate to meet any emergencies and the coming into commission of more stations during the next few years will take care of any likely increased demand.</P>
    <P>My information, obtained through an O.E.E.C.  Report, on the electricity supply industry in Europe, published in January last, shows the rate of expansion for O.E.E.C. countries during 1954 and 1955 was approximately 9 per cent.  That is the same percentage increase that the E.S.B. is experiencing, so that what the E.S.B. is doing is adjusting its plant requirements not only for the day but for the future, to its own ascertainment of what the demand for electricity will be.</P>
    <P>When you come to testing its decisions against the realities of the electricity supply industry in Europe you find the E.S.B. anticipated production, judged by the O.E.E.C. Report, represents the average increase in electrical production in the various countries comprising the O.E.E.C.  Is not that a test of reality?  Is not that an indication that the E.S.B. in this matter has been proved right?  Is <Col N="1197" /> anybody going to suggest that they ought to be asked to build up plant on the assumption that the demand would double itself in five to five and a half years when their own experience and the whole European experience is that it is now taking between 11 and 12 years to double the demand for electricity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am defending the Estimate of the Department of Industry and Commerce in Ireland and not in the world, Deputy.  I think there is no doubt that the E.S.B. knew all the time that this White Paper was being forced upon them and that the targets were set impossibly high.  I know the former Minister's view about the E.S.B.  That is a matter between himself and the board and his assessment of the members of the board is not a matter of concern to me.</P>
      <P>When this White Paper was being discussed with the board and when the board was being asked to accept certain estimates as the anticipated estimates of what would be required in this country, the board felt obliged to put on record to the Minister, in a letter dated 11th February, 1954, this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board has now sufficient plant to rule out fears of rationing. It has initiated an active sales policy and the rate of development of rural electrification has been considerably accelerated.  The stimulation of consumption will continue to be constantly under review.  The programme is related to the demand for electricity and this is difficult to foretell with certainty.  On the basis of earlier estimates the demand in 1955-56 has been given in the appendix as 1,780 million units (generated) rising to 3,350 million units in 1960-61.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This assumption of growth was a very rapid one corresponding to a doubling of the demand in five and a half years.  In fact, in the present year the output is now estimated not <Col N="1198" /> to exceed 1,300 million units as compared with a figure as high as 1,380 million units in the schedule.  If a slower growth is experienced in the period in question this would, of course, affect the construction programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the board's view in February, 1954.  Notwithstanding the board's view, the matter was pressed with the Department of Finance and Deputy MacEntee now, then the Minister for Finance, in a letter, dated 18th February, 1954, wrote to the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the reserve with which the E.S.B. put forward their estimates of demand and as recent indications are that these estimates may be unduly high, the memorandum should include a paragraph indicating the difficulty of forecasting demand and making it clear that the trend of demand will be carefully watched so that the construction programme can be adjusted downwards if growth of demand is slower than now anticipated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So you have the E.S.B. and Deputy MacEntee taking the view that the sights were raised too high, that the targets were unattainable and that there might have to be careful watching of the construction programme, with a view to its downward revision. Notwithstanding this prudent advice from the board, which ought to be the Minister's technical adviser, and notwithstanding the views of the Minister for Finance at the time, who said: &ldquo;Be careful where you are going; you may be pitching your target too high,&rdquo; the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, goes to the Government and says: &ldquo;It has got to be done.  This is my view; this is my decision.&rdquo;&ldquo;The board,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are always inclined to underestimate the rate at which the demand for electricity will grow.&rdquo;  So the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time put his point of view against the viewpoint of the board and the viewpoint of his own colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Now we can look at the whole position and see who was right and who <Col N="1199" /> was wrong.  It is as clear as daylight that Deputy Lemass was wrong.  It is as clear as daylight that the sights were raised too high and that the E.S.B. and the Minister for Finance were more accurate in their appraisal of the position than the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The board has now come to us to say: &ldquo;This programme is out of gear. The reins have to be put on it.  We are now being committed to stations which we cannot use.  We have to revise the whole programme.  It is in the light of this admission by the E.S.B.&mdash;that this whole matter is hopelessly out of hand and requires revision&mdash;that these alterations have to be made.  I think the making of them is a realistic task and I think that the completion of the revision will be good for the E.S.B. and for the nation.</P>
    <P>Instead of regarding this as an incident which is inevitable in an immense undertaking like the E.S.B., a revision which is necessary in any kind of job of the kind in any country in the world, efforts are being made here to make political capital out of the need for revision.  The strange thing is that Deputy Lemass, who was responsible for creating the situation in which the E.S.B. were overplanted, gets up to lead the pack when it comes to attacking the E.S.B. for an intelligent re-appraisal of their programme. The board and Deputy MacEntee were proved to be right. The whole file shows that, when the E.S.B. decided that the programme was over-pitched, the decision taken by Deputy Lemass was: &ldquo;It does not matter; they are never very accurate in estimating.  Push this on.&rdquo;  It was pushed on and proved to be wrong.</P>
    <P>The new programme of the E.S.B. has not been forced on them by the Government.  The E.S.B. said: &ldquo;We have got too much plant; we want to revise the programme.&rdquo;  We said: &ldquo;You have been appointed directors of the E.S.B.&rdquo;&mdash;and they are the nominees of Deputy Lemass; they are not mine and they are not a new board&mdash;&ldquo;and if that is your view, let us have the facts.&rdquo;  They have now given us a revised programme which they say will keep them, with their <Col N="1200" /> present plant and plant in sight, fully ahead of requirements to 1960-1961. Doing that will necessitate some cutting back on their programme.  It will mean, as I said yesterday, that the same quantities of turf will not now be required so speedily from some of the bogs on which Bord na Móna have been operating.  Bord na Móna will, therefore, have to adjust its programme and to help it to adjust that programme, I have, with the consent of the Government, authorised it to put in one 100,000 turf-briquetting plant on one bog, and the right to put up a second one will be decided in the light of the board's experience, not of the operation of the first plant, but of how they get on in the matter of ordering and what are the delivery dates.</P>
    <P>I think this is a good self-critical operation by the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna and I hope that these two organisations will in the future try to grow together, instead of trying to grow apart, and that each will know more about the other's future plans than has been apparent in the past.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll raised the desirability of setting up a bureau of standards for consumer goods and apparently expected that this bureau would be set up by now.  The question was discussed on a motion by Deputy James Tully in November, 1955.  The motion set out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government should speedily examine the desirability of setting up a bureau of standards for the guidance of consumers....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government was asked not to do it, but to examine the possibility of doing it, and, replying on the motion, I said I would take the motion for examination, but that we could not be committed, without a detailed examination, to the establishment of the bureau.  The whole discussion on the subject, important though it was, occupied only about two and a half pages of the Parliamentary Reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very fact that we now have had control of our own affairs for 34 years and that we have no such bureau is, in my view, an indication that either people were not terribly concerned with the matter, or that it was not frightfully easy to establish such a bureau.  I took the matter seriously, however, when the Dáil passed the motion.  I know that the establishment of such a bureau is a very complicated matter.  I have had discussions with the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and we have made inquiries as to the procedure for the protection of consumers in other countries. A good deal of information has been assembled by the Department but <Col N="1202" /> one thing is clear from the information we have got&mdash;that no effective system appears to exist in other countries.</P>
    <P>Experience seems to indicate that there is considerable difficulty in a democratic concept of society in evolving an appropriate scheme.  The matter is still the subject of examination and I hope within the next two months to be able to say whether it is within the bounds of practical politics or whether it is something to which, because of our particular social structure, it is not possible to give effect.  However, in so far as the matter was raised by Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll by way of complaint, which appeared to be based on the erroneous assumption that nothing was being done in the matter, I want to say that a good deal has been done in endeavouring to get information in this respect and an earnest of our desire in that direction is proved by the inquiries which we have made with that object in view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, in the course of his speech, said the increase in industrial production in this country in recent years was only 6 per cent. whereas, according to the figures furnished by O.E.E.C., the increase in other European countries was not less than 8 per cent.  The Deputy obtained that result by making a particular use of the figures.  I got the O.E.E.C. information on this subject and, taking industrial production indices of member and associate countries as 100 in 1952, I find it does not show that we occupy any discreditable position.</P>
    <P>An examination of those figures shows that the index of all member countries is influenced by increases in a few countries as shown by the index figure for those countries for 1955.  For example, the figure for Greece, where there is abundant scope for development because of the economic circumstances there, has jumped to 152 from 100.  Germany, for an entirely different reason, because its economy is dynamic, has jumped to 142, and Austria liberated has jumped to 132.  However, according to the O.E.E.C. indices, comparing 1952 with 1955, the following countries show exactly the same increase as this country, namely, Belgium, Denmark, France, Norway, <Col N="1203" /> the United Kingdom and even Sweden, which is frequently pointed to as a country well worthy of emulation in many respects, has reached a figure of 112, the 1952 figure being 100, while in the same period we have reached 117. Deputy Lemass is entitled to some congratulation because his Government was in office during the period, but there is no purpose in continually crying out &ldquo;stinking fish&rdquo; about the progress of our own country when, by comparison with other countries, we can take pride in some of the things we have been able to do in very difficult circumstances.</P>

May I interject to suggest that the comparison the Minister has just made is not a sound one by reason of the fact that he has been comparing the rate of increase in industrial output in countries with already highly developed industries with the rate of increase in comparatively undeveloped countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I took those figures because I had to compare them with what Deputy Lemass was quoting.  In my opening speech, I gave the figures for net output and employment for industries and services.  I will take a few of those figures now.  In 1938, the net output was £35,000,000; the number employed was 166,000.  In 1948, net output was £75,000,000; the number employed was 197,000.  In 1953, the net output was £119,000,000; the number employed was 227,000.  In 1954, the net output was £122,000,000; the number employed was 234,000.  In 1955, the net output was £126,000,000 an increase of £4,000,000 on 1954; and the number employed was 235,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures show a continual upward rise in industrial production, a continued expansion in industrial employment, and these are figures which indicate that there is a healthy growth <Col N="1204" /> there.  Let us all endeavour to accelerate the growth and to stimulate it in every way, for these figures indicate that there is life and vitality in our industries.  It is not, therefore, correct, as Deputy Derrig tried to suggest, that the volume of industrial production has decreased.  It has increased to an all-time high record and the number of persons industrially employed to-day is higher than it has been at any time since 1922.  These are incontrovertible facts and we gain nothing by trying to misrepresent them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll raised a matter which related to some parliamentary question which she asked previously. She asked whether the decision of the Prices Advisory Body and the recent application for an increase in the price of coal was unanimous.  I told her that this report of the body was submitted to me and I did not think it desirable to disclose the figures by which the Prices Advisory Body reached its decision.  I do not know what purpose Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll is trying to serve by pursuing this matter.  I know she has had contact with members of the Prices Advisory Body, and it is not a difficult task for her to ask was the decision unanimous.  I do not think it is right that every time the Prices Advisory Body makes a recommendation, a question should be put down asking how many were on one side and how many on the other side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The Prices Advisory Body regulate their own procedure.  I do not propose to interfere with them or to prescribe to whom they will speak.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll gave evidence before this body and my <Col N="1205" /> advice to the Deputy would be to drop this matter.  In so far as she hopes she will prove anything from what she is doing, let me say she is in the wrong street.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll also raised the question of coal deliveries and prices.  I know&mdash;and my inspectors checked the figures and proved them correct&mdash;that a number of coal merchants in Dublin booked orders from their customers at the old price and while there was no authority to introduce the new price.  An examination of their books shows that where they took the orders at the old price, they delivered the new coal at the old price even though they had to pay the new price for it.  The facts are there in their books and customers know that where the order was accepted at the old price, delivery of the new coal was made at the old price.  That was done by a number of customers.  Coal merchants said that in the days immediately prior to the increase in the price of coal they had orders from regular customers three, four and five times as large as the usual orders. They, of course, were not going to give people three, four and five times their normal supply of coal at the old price, when they, the merchants, had in fact only a limited quantity of coal in their yards and would have to pay the new and higher price for further supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride raised the question of C.I.E. workshops and the desirability of doing in those workshops everything that can be done in them. I have never met the chairman of C.I.E. that I have not impressed upon him my desire that C.I.E. should make in the Inchicore workshops all the commodities they require for their own use.  There is only one test I impose and that is that the manufacture of these commodities should be subject to an economic check.  I do not want them to spend £100 making something which can be bought elsewhere for £20; I do not want them to set up machinery to turn out one or two components if that would have the effect of making the cost unrealistically high and in the knowledge that such components could be bought much more cheaply from a shop which already has <Col N="1206" /> the tools to do the job and is producing the components on a large-scale basis.</P>
    <P>I know from experience that the board are anxious to produce in their works here all the commodities which they require, but they have, of course, to be sensible in this matter.  It might well be that, if they decided to make certain commodities themselves, that might have the effect of disemploying certain people until such time as the commodities had been manufactured and, in the long run, the overall unemployment might be less in certain circumstances, if they bought the commodity elsewhere.</P>
    <P>C.I.E., however, know that it is my desire that they should produce all they can for their own requirements.  I even went so far as to suggest to them that, in order to keep their workers in employment and in order to help their financial position, they might ascertain from British Railways whether they could, on the equipment available at Inchicore, make parts for British Railways in order to have work for the Inchicore shops at a time when, presumably, large orders will be placed with firms in England and elsewhere, firms which will probably find it difficult to give early delivery, in connection with the reorganisation of British Railways.  The board, without hesitation, decided that they would go after that, in the hope that they would get some of that business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham raised the question of the G.N.R.  I think the facts are pretty public.  The Six-County Government, through the Minister of Commerce, decided that they would close, or move to close, three cross-Border railways and the Minister asked me to join with him in arranging for the closing of these lines.  I felt that this was, to say the least of it, a non-progressive move and that I could not concur in the arrangement in that easy way.  I suggested, therefore, that as far as I was concerned the matter would have to go to the chairmen of the tribunals provided for under the Act.  These chairmen have met and I understand that they are at the moment preparing a report on the question of the closing of these three railways.  Since the issue of the closing of these three lines was remitted <Col N="1207" /> to the chairmen for advice, the situation has changed somewhat, inasmuch as the Six-County Government have announced that they also propose to lop off other branches of the railway services in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There are two lines running to Derry, one from Belfast around the coast and the other from Portadown via Omagh and Strabane; part of that line from Omagh to Derry is a cross-Border line and we will have to be consulted in relation to its closing.  The Six-County Government could close the other line of their own volition, because it lies entirely within the Six Counties.  I observe that the Six-County Government have now decided that they will not come to any definite decision as to which of the lines to Derry should be closed until such time as they receive the report of the joint chairmen who examined the question of the closing of the three cross-Border lines and presumably, therefore, both of these lines to Derry have had a temporary reprieve.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the chaotic situation which would result if the line from Portadown to Derry were closed, because such closing would starve counties like Tyrone and Fermanagh of rail transport services.  Indeed, I think it would do nothing but seriously retard the industrial development of these counties.  Such a step would, I believe, cause immense inconvenience to the population there and, so far as this Government is concerned, it will be no consenting party to the closing down of the Portadown-Derry line because of the immense repercussions that would have not only on Donegal, but on certain other counties as well. It might very well be that it would be made impossible to operate the line, should the Six-County Government take a particular stand,</P>
    <P>We have taken the attitude that the G.N.R. ought to be given a chance to re-equip its railway stock and to introduce dieselisation, and it is only when dieselisation fails to achieve results, that we should contemplate the closing down of important branch lines which are of vital importance for the transport of people and goods in these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> Deputy Breslin raised the question of the operations of An Foras Tionscal in Donegal.  He wanted to know how many projects had been helped there. The fact is that An Foras Tionscal have made grants to four industries in County Donegal; an industry for the manufacture of gloves at Falcarragh, an industry for the manufacture of carpets at Killybegs, a laundry and dry cleaning industry at Letterkenny and an industry for the production of ceramic tiles at Carrigans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Breslin also raised the question of the spending of money on roads in proximity to the Gweedore generating station.  He mentioned that the E.S.B. had offered 40/- per ton for turf for that station.  So far as the price of turf is concerned, that is a matter for the E.S.B.  It has the responsibility of getting the turf; it has the responsibility of fixing a price which will attract producers to supply the turf.  The Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate that that is not a matter into which I can enter.  A sum of £200,000 was made available for the improvement of roads in proximity to these small generating stations.  Of that, some £18,000 has been allocated to Donegal County Council for repairs to county roads in the vicinity of the station.  The county council have already got £8,000 of that and the balance will be issued to them during the current year.  The board can decide itself in what areas it will spend this money so as to ensure that it is spent on roads over which turf will be carried rather than putting in roads in advance on the assumption that turf will be carried over them when, in fact, the carrying of turf on these roads might not materialise at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig raised the question of the servicing of the purchase of the Viscounts.  The position is that the Aer Lingus Viscounts have been purchased out of capital made available to the board and out of its own resources. These aircraft are being paid for by repayment of the capital advances to the board.  That has been the position in the past and will be the position in respect of the three new Viscounts and the four new Fokker Friendship aircraft which have <Col N="1209" /> now been ordered by Aer Lingus in order to supplement its present fleet and to extend its activities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan raised the question of what type of vessel it is proposed to put on the Galway-Aran service.  The type of vessel in this case is principally a matter for C.I.E., which is responsible for operating the service.  I understand, however, from C.I.E. that plans have been prepared for the board in consultation with a native architect, who has visited the Aran Islands and has examined the conditions on the spot.  I hope the board will be placing an order for this vessel in the near future and that its delivery might be expected in approximately 18 to 20 months after that date, provided no hitch occurs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch of Waterford raised the question that Irish Shipping Ltd., should acquire a fleet of coasters which could use the small ports.  I think I should say at this stage that the primary object of Irish Shipping Ltd., is to provide deep sea tonnage to import essential commodities, especially in times of emergency.  The company have, however, acquired two colliers of about 1,400 tons dead weight, a dry cargo vessel of about 2,000 tons dead weight and a coastal tanker of approximately 3,350 tons dead weight. The company also have on order two dry cargo vessels of about 2,000 tons dead weight each.  One of these is due for delivery in the month of October and the other in the month of December. These small vessels can, of course, use quite a considerable number of the Irish ports.</P>
    <P>The question of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory was referred to by Deputy Lemass.  This, as the Deputy knows, is a very large project which will involve the expenditure of something in the vicinity of £7,000,000. There are a number of schools of thought on what is the best type of nitrogenous fertiliser to produce in this country.  That is a matter which has been engaging the attention of the Department of Industry and Commerce and of the Department of Agriculture. The matter does not lie with my Department alone.  It is important, however, with the changes and the discoveries <Col N="1210" /> in the fertiliser industry, to ensure that, if we are to spend £7,000,000 we have the right scheme and that we are not anchoring ourselves to a scheme which may be left behind by the other progressive countries in the world.  We are getting all the technical information we can on that subject to see what looks to be the best scheme from the point of view of our requirements here, from the point of view of the price and from the point of view of utilising native resources.  I am doing my best to push the matter ahead with the utmost expedition but I am sure the House will appreciate the need for caution in a scheme of this kind where a sum of £7,000,000 is involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley raised the question of the new hire purchase regulations and their effect on the furniture trade. Let me say that, as far as the furniture trade is concerned, it was treated generously in the matter of the hire purchase regulations because of the fact that the deposit in that case was as low as 10 per cent. and many firms already charge 10 per cent. or even more.  I know that in recent years, particularly since the introduction of certain types of shops here which generated intense competition in the matter of hire purchase, that competition has been pushed to the extent that a number of firms have been prepared to say: &ldquo;We will give you furniture without any initial deposit,&rdquo; and I know that their financial resources in that respect have driven other people in the same line of business to compete with them on the basis of a no-deposit arrangement.</P>
    <P>I do not think any person who is realistic will attempt to say that it is unfair to ask a person who wants to buy £10 of furniture to put down £1, or to ask a person who wants to buy £20 worth of furniture to put down £2 When the facts are put in that way, I do not think anybody would attempt to say that that is an unreasonable requirement.  If they have not got the £1, they can at least save for a week or two until they accumulate it and then put it down.  It is not unreasonable to get people to think before they decide to purchase anything on a hire purchase basis.  Having to accumulate <Col N="1211" /> even a small deposit induces them to look at the price and the conditions of repayment twice.  If they think of their liabilities even once, not twice, it is a good arrangement from the point of view of preventing people from being extravagant in their purchases.</P>
    <P>Far from being in opposition to it, I personally am in favour of the principle of hire purchase.  I think it is one way in which ordinary small people have been able to get around them some capital goods which they would never get if they had to put down the whole sum of money.</P>
    <P>I know many working-class houses which have pianos and good furniture. I know many poor people, who started off their lives in poorness and poverty, but who by their industry have been able, with the advance of years and better conditions, to accumulate some quite decent articles of furniture, which are a source of joy and pride to them.  They could never have bought these articles if they had to save up and put down the entire sum in one payment, because they have not got that propensity for saving.  By means of hire purchase, properly regulated, they have been able to get around them capital goods which give them pleasure and happiness, and without a hire purchase arrangement they would never have been able to acquire them.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that hire purchase itself is not undesirable, but for its successful operation it requires prudence and realism in the minds of those who engage in the practice.</P>

If anybody <Col N="1212" /> endeavours to get through the Order by doing something which is prohibited by the Order, I hope some of them will have their fingers burned by the receivers of the goods refusing to recognise the validity of the Order and refusing to pay the instalments under the Order.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will let me have particulars of any such cases, I will see if the resources of the Legislature are such as will enable us to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley, for reasons I could not fathom, took a delight in wrapping the new cotton mill in Galway round himself and claimed that this was a Fianna Fáil project and that nobody had anything to do with it except Fianna Fáil.  Of course, the Deputy is indebted to his imagination for hallucinations of that kind.  The fact of the matter is &mdash; I put this on record in the hope that this corrective will prevent the Deputy from making a fool of himself on future occasions on the same subject &mdash; this project arose out of a visit from a delegation of the Industrial Development Authority to Sweden in March, 1955.  The initial discussions took place with the Swedish firm on 25th March, 1955.  In July, 1955, a representative of a British firm which had a financial interest in the Swedish firm became associated with the project and undertook its promotion.  In August, 1955, we received a definite proposal on the subject.  The Industrial Development Authority reported to me on the matter in September or October, 1955. In November, 1955, I ascertained that two other Irish companies had become associated with the project and that the arrangements for the erection of the new firm, Galway Textiles, Limited, were proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the historical facts relating to the establishment of this industry and Fianna Fáil had nothing to do with the establishment of it at all.  Why Deputy Bartley leaves himself open to repudiation on a matter so simple as that I cannot say.  Of course, <Col N="1213" /> it does not matter who started the factory; the important thing is that we are making goods that we previously imported and that we are going to give employment down there to people of all political views.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig wanted to know &mdash; I take it this is what he meant &mdash; what was the position in regard to our fuel conservation arrangements.  The position is that we have now made an arrangement with a firm of fuel consultants whereby they will carry out a survey of the methods of handling fuel, of boiler-house technique and steam distribution and utilisation in 45 selected Irish industrial undertakings. That contract has been signed with the consultants; the work is in hands and I hope that within the next few months we will have a report from the consultants as to the result of their survey of the whole matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question of employment in the hosiery industry and was anxious that it should be safeguarded. I would be most anxious, as the Deputy ought to know, to safeguard the hosiery industry, and particularly the Donegal aspect of the hosiery industry, because I know how vital it is to the economy of that part of the country.  When the hosiery group of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers came to me from time to time and said: there was a danger of imports from Hong Kong or Japan or Far Eastern countries, I took energetic steps not only to put these imports off-side by adjustment of tariffs but also by warning potential importers here that, if they entered into commitments to buy this cheap stuff produced in the Far East and were subsequently caught in increased <Col N="1214" /> tariffs operated to protect Irish industry, they would get no sympathetic consideration from me and that any money they paid on the import of these goods designed to undersell Irish goods would have to be paid by them and no refund might be expected.  That is still my attitude, but the examination of the hosiery industry, so far as I have been able to make it, does not indicate that there is anything more wrong in it than the seasonal laying-off.</P>
    <P>In so far as one firm, whose name got into the newspapers in connection with the laying-off of staff is concerned, I have made inquiries and tried to ascertain what, in their view, is the difficulty which has led up to the laying-off of some staff.  The director of the company concerned said that the sales of the firm's knit-wear goods have declined over the past two years in the cheaper categories and they attribute this decline to the large-scale introduction into this country of home-knitting machines.  He has claimed that it is impossible for a genuine knit-wear factory to compete with these domestic operators who have no overheads and who can, therefore, undercut a genuine knit-wear factory in price.</P>
    <P>If that is happening, of course, everybody will appreciate the impossibility of being able to deal with a situation in which people purchase knitting machines and engage in knitting at home in competition with the factories.  I do not think there is anything we can do in that field and, indeed, I am inclined to doubt whether that in fact is the real problem with which the firms concerned are faced.  At all events, I have received no representations from the hosiery group of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers which is normally a most alert group if there is anything wrong in the hosiery business.  But if they have anything to say to me, or any suggestion whereby I can help, I shall be only too pleased to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of Irish tweed being affected by cloth of Japanese origin.  No representations have been received by my Department that the industry is affected by the importation <Col N="1215" /> of cloth from Japan.  In the past three weeks we have had a number of meetings with the woollen mills, and the woollen mills are never slow to tell you of any difficulty they experience or even remotely anticipate. Therefore, there would be reason to assume that if cloth was being imported from Japan to the detriment of the Irish woollen industry, the mills would have raised the matter, but so far we have had no complaint.  If the Deputy has any information on the matter we should be glad to receive it and to investigate the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig raised the question of increasing anthracite production.  Last September I assembled the anthracite colliery proprietors and urged them to increase production to the fullest extent. I reminded them that I had received assurances from the coal merchants that they would take up the whole production of sized anthracite and I offered the colliery owners all the assistance in my power to enable them to overcome obstacles in the way of increased production including sympathetic consideration by me of applications from them for guarantees under the Trades Loans Guarantee Act.  I told them I was most anxious to step up anthracite production.</P>
    <P>The colliery owners mentioned that a big difficulty in the way of increasing production was the shortage of houses which could be occupied by persons brought in the capacity of miners to operate in these collieries.  I then took the matter up through the Minister for Local Government with the local authorities concerned and I am glad to say that a number of these local authorities have co-operated to the extent that they are erecting new houses in two of these colliery areas where this special difficulty existed.  I may say the colliery owners assured me that they would make every possible effort to increase production and I think that the figures so far in that respect are quite encouraging.  The production for the first five months of the present year was 17 per cent. in excess of the production for the corresponding period last year.  I hope that increase will be maintained and, if possible, multiplied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> Deputy O'Malley raised the question of the export of copper concentrates and inquired whether there was any possibility of having the copper smelted here.  This is a highly technical process and a decision on it could not be arrived at by wishing the thing to happen, by desiring that a certain thing would happen.  The question of the erection of a copper smelter here is a matter of cold economics.  The question is, can you get from Irish copper mines and from imports from other countries sufficient copper to make the setting up of a smelter here an economical proposition?  It would cost a very large sum of money, running into millions of dollars, and we must be sure, before we consider the purchase of such equipment, whether we can get from our own mines and from abroad sufficient copper to enable us to run the smelter economically.  It may be that because of the shortage of smelter facilities in other countries, we could, if we had extensive copper mines here, manage to erect a smelter which could be worked economically.  I have discussed it with the Canadian mining group and the position is now being examined.</P>
    <P>The question of my visit to America was raised by some Deputies.  I went to America not of my own willing but arising out of the Government's desire that the possibility of inducing Americans to participate in Irish industrial enterprise should be examined on the spot, that the advantages of it should be disseminated over a large number of people potentially interested, and that, at the same time, we should use the opportunity of the visit to promote tourism in Ireland and explore the possibility of selling more Irish goods in America.</P>
    <P>We import from America approximately £14,000,000 worth of goods in a year.  We export to America about £2,000,000 worth.  We are clearly in physical inbalance with the U.S. in so far as our imports and exports are concerned, and I believe there are immense possibilities in the U.S., with its 165,000,000 people, of improving our business, particularly when you remember there are 20,000,000 people <Col N="1217" /> of Irish birth or Irish extraction in the U.S.  As I said there, if you could get these 20,000,000 people of Irish birth or Irish extraction to spend one pound on one day each year, say St. Patrick's Day, in buying an Irish-made product, our exports to America would amount to £20,000,000 a year instead of £2,000,000.  Anybody who has experience of the American way of life will know that one pound is little more than a good tip in their whole financial structure.</P>
    <P>I think there are immense possibilities there.  I went on this trip for the purpose, therefore, of endeavouring to induce American industrialists to come to Ireland to participate in our industrial development.  I tried, in the course of a visit which covered 10,000 miles in a matter of five weeks, to get to the widest possible audience. I endeavoured to encourage American investment in Ireland, to encourage Irish people in America to buy more and more Irish goods, to encourage the 20,000,000 people of Irish birth and extraction to give themselves one holiday in every ten years in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If they did that it would have an electrifying effect on our economy here. I did not spare myself, as I think our diplomatic mission in the U.S. will confirm.  I worked from Monday to the following Monday of every week. Saturdays and Sundays were indistinguishable from Mondays or Tuesdays.  You can well imagine, if you travelled as I did by plane, what 10,000 miles in the U.S. are like.  I had three meetings a day.  I had a Press Conference every day.  I had one, two or three television or radio talks a day.  I saw people from breakfast one morning until a short time before breakfast the next morning. That is the experience of anybody who goes to America with a well filled programme.</P>
    <P>I do not mind about the yappings, the whinings and the yelpings about the purpose of my mission or about the time I spent there.  I do know that a half-baked Communist body in Dublin met solemnly on a few occasions while I was away, and passed a resolution that all their members should write to a certain newspaper, not giving their names but <i>noms de plume</i>, giving the <Col N="1218" /> impression that they were very annoyed with my visit.  I know all the members of the half-baked Communist body were invited by one particular newspaper, which would print almost anything about anybody, to avail of the services of this newspaper to write articles criticising my visit to the United States because they thought it was one of the best ways of harming the Labour Party which this body detests even more than it detests the Fianna Fáil Party or, for that matter, any other Party in this country.  Its chief enemy is the Labour Party because it is the best bulwark against the progress of a Communist Party in this country.  This body decided it would yelp and whinge about my visit.  I am not worried about that.</P>
    <P>I think, in the aggregate, very substantial benefits will flow from the visit.  One impression more than another that I got from the visit is that we cannot overestimate the value of closer connections with the United States.  No matter what Government is in office, my support will always be found for the idea of sending a regular Government or conjoint Government and Opposition delegation to the United States in order to interpret Ireland to the people in America.  It is amazing the abysmally ignorant questions you get from the people in that vast Continent about Ireland even under 1956 standards.  Anybody who heard these questions would understand that the necessity for regular visits was outstanding.  That was the impression borne in on me.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this Government would devise a programme whereby there would be regular visits of Government and Opposition speakers to that vast Continent in order to enable us to interpret Ireland to a population of 165,000,000 people, all of whom, in the main, want to be friendly with us. There is a country with which we have an immense standing, immense influence and prestige if we could only capitalise on it by regular contacts at Government and parliamentary level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said a new approach should be made to our national difficulties by all Parties and sections.  I could not agree more enthusiastically <Col N="1219" /> with anything that has been said during the course of this debate.  I think our political discussions are both infantile and immature if we cannot, on some matters of wide national policy, get some measure of common agreement.  I am convinced two things should be taken out of politics.  One is agriculture and the other is industry.</P>
    <P>I think there ought to be recognition by both sides of the House that we ought to have some industrial policy, for which I am temporarily responsible, which will enable manufacturers to know the direction in which we are travelling and to know, as well, that that direction will not be changed by any change in Government.  I do not think it is impossible to do that; I do not believe that all the things that an Opposition say are wrong; and I do not believe that a Government is so inoculated with original sin that everything it does is wrong.  Between these two daft extremes of point of view, there must be a section of sober and intelligent thought.  Is it possible then to get some body of agreement with that body of sober goodwill and to get us to agree on what road we are going to travel?</P>
    <P>There is one question I should like to see discussed in this House.  That is a question of the Control of Manufactures Act.  I think it has outlived its usefulness in the way it is now framed and that it bears no relation to the situation of to-day.  I should like to amend it to bring it into line with what we think to-day and not into line with what we thought we were thinking 21 or 22 years ago, but I do not want to take a measure of that kind into this House because all the speeches that would be made on it and all the acrimony that would be created by the discussion would be ten times more harmful than any possible advantages that would accrue from bringing in a Bill of that nature.</P>
    <P>It ought not to be impossible between the Government and the Opposition on a matter of that kind to set a policy for a long time and to get agreement.  I ask those people on the Opposition if there is any aspect of <Col N="1220" /> our industrial activities here, or any aspect of our national activities on which the Opposition are concerned to know what the Government plan is, if it is possible to get a true measure of agreement with the Government plan.  If there is, I shall be only too pleased to discuss that with the Opposition. The whole objective should be to get the greatest possible measure of agreement on any plans or proposals designed to serve the best interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, however, says that there should be a new approach to national difficulties by all the Parties and every section of the people.  I answer that by saying: &ldquo;All right; I will accept that view without question,&rdquo; and if the Deputy or his Party will now say in what way they feel they can make a contribution, by collaboration with the Government, in that field of endeavour in the present circumstances, I for one will be happy to see what we can do in that direction, for the purpose of endeavouring to use our collective wisdom for the solution of the problems which can be turned up by us.</P>
    <P>Our biggest problem, of course, is the problem of the balance of payments. At all costs, that must be put right and we have to be vigorous and rigorous in opposing any attempt to run down our external assets for the importation of non-essential goods.  I agree with Deputy MacBride that to run down our external assets for the purchase of capital goods here is a policy with everything to commend it. So long as our external assets are invested in other countries, subject to control by other countries, one can wake up the following morning and find that that country has devalued its currency by 20 or 25 per cent.  That means that your assets in their money have likewise been devalued by 20 or 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had three days on which to talk on the Estimate, but he kept a deliberate silence and can do nothing but interrupt.  As I said, the most urgent problem is the problem of the balance of payments. They must be righted, no matter what is the cost, and the best way to do it is by cutting back vigorously and rigorously on unnecessary imports.  If we fail to do this, it is a reflection on ourselves.</P>
      <P>We must endeavour to export in every field in which it is possible to find an export market.  Every new industry here which produces goods which we now import can make a substantial contribution to remedying the balance of payments position.  Every £1 which we export similarly makes a contribution to our export trade, and at the same time helps in its own way to bring about some rectification in the balance of payments.  Further, everybody who buys Irish, in preference to imported, goods will also make a substantial contribution to the balance of payments difficulties.  So quite clearly the aim must be to establish more and more industries to produce the goods we must now import and to stimulate industrial and agricultural production in every way we can and to encourage our people, especially, in the present situation, to buy Irish goods in preference to imported commodities.</P>
      <P>On the question of the establishment of new industries, both Governments have vied with one another in their efforts to do so and I pay my tribute to the last Government for its efforts to establish industries in this country and to every other Government which, in its own time and in its own way, has tried to do the same thing.  If we are to stop the export of our young men and women, it can best be done by having employment available for them here, and, no matter what political differences there may be in one field or another, it ought not to be impossible to get the unity which is so essential in the matter of creating industries in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we do establish industries, <Col N="1222" /> faced as we are with the problem of the balance of trade, we must find export markets and we must do something to remove the inertia of those who feel they are doing well enough in the home market, without troubling about the export market.  We must direct our attention to exports in the many directions in which, with energy, we can export.  We must do what we can to encourage the export of more goods. Exports are essential to us, and, so far as I am concerned, I do not believe that we can continue to do in 1956 the same things as we did in 1926, merely because we did all those things in that period.</P>
    <P>I would try now, and in the future, to increase exports and so far as I am personally concerned, I would do that, if necessary, by making attractive offers on taxation level to those who will develop the export market from to-day and will seek to extend their exports in future.  The fact that some firms can do it so magnificently, while others cannot be induced to export, is an indication that export markets can be got, if our industrialists will go out and get them.  I think here again no matter what differences there are all Parties in the House can recognise and say candidly to industrialists and agriculturists that they must export in order to pay for what we import.  If we fail to do that, then it is inevitable that there will be a lowering of the standard of living for all our people.</P>
    <P>I want, on the whole, to thank the House for the way in which the Estimate has been discussed.  I will conclude by saying that if Deputy Lemass's statement that a new approach should be made to the national difficulties by all Parties and sections of the people, so far as I am concerned and I believe so far as the Government is concerned if that means an offer of co-operation, if that means an offer to fix a broad national policy which will not be disturbed by changes of Government, I for one will support that to its utmost limits.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for Fisheries for 1956-57 is for a net sum of £158,420 of which £53,000 has been granted by way of Vote on Account, leaving £105,420 to be voted to complete the Estimate as stated in the Money Resolution.</P>
      <P>As shown in the printed Estimates, the amount required for 1956-57 represents a net increase of £20,305 compared with 1955-56.  In this connection I might point out that the total original net Estimate for 1955-56 was £116,640, but during the course of the year a Supplementary Estimate was passed providing £20,500 to complete the payment of compensation to the one-time occupants of the several fishery in the tidal waters of the River Erne, and a sum of £975 was paid from the Vote for remuneration in respect of Civil Service salary increases properly chargeable to Vote for Fisheries. Taking these two items into account the net increase of £20,305 already referred to is arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To help the House in considering the Estimate I will refer briefly to the significant increases and decreases under the various sub-heads compared with last year.  Under sub-head A, Salaries, Wages and Allowances, there is an increase of £2,025 which is due to increased salaries payable to the staff of Fisheries Branch.  Sub-head E (1), Scientific Investigations, shows an increase of £805.  Taking into account <Col N="1227" /> slight variations on two sub-divisions under the sub-head, this increase is due to increased provision for shellfish experiments.  More intensive work is planned for the current year in relation to the development of oyster culture, particularly in Clew Bay. This work has been going on for some years in conjunction with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, but my Department is now assuming responsibility for the work in its entirety.  Seed oysters have been planted in successive years and there is some evidence that this work is meeting with some success.  It is intended that it should continue in the hope that eventually an oyster fishery of some importance will be re-established in the area.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head F (1), Grants to Boards of Conservators and Local Authorities, etc., there is a net increase of £6,200.  Sub-division 1 of this sub-head provides for the statutory recoupment to local authorities of losses arising from the exemption of fisheries from local rates under the Fisheries Act, 1925.  The recoupment by the State is related to the current local rates and as these show a tendency to rise it is considered essential to cover increases by the provision of £24,000 or £4,000 more than the sum provided last year.  An additional £250 is provided under sub-division 2 of the sub-head to meet increased payments under the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Act, 1934, to Ballyshannon and Letterkenny Boards of Conservators to make good the loss of fishery rates formerly payable on the estuarine fisheries in the areas covered by these boards which are affected by that Act.  This expenditure is offset to some extent&mdash;£750&mdash;by receipts from special local licences which must be taken out by fishermen proposing to fish in the estuarine fisheries concerned. Under sub-division 4, £14,000 is included compared with £12,000 last year to provide grants to boards of conservators to supplement their incomes from local sources, mainly licence duties and fishery rates.  I may say that the grants made last year were supplemented by £2,650 which remained in the Salmon Conservancy <Col N="1228" /> Fund.  The provision this year therefore represents a decrease of £650 on the total sum available last year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (6) which provides a Grant-in-Aid of £10,500 for the Inland Fisheries Trust shows an increase of £500 compared with 1955-56.  The trust, like all other bodies, is finding its expenses increasing from year to year and this extra £500 is considered necessary to enable the very valuable work being done by the trust to be continued without any serious retrenchment. Sub-head G, Grant-in-Aid of Administration and Development of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara under which £71,930 is set down in the Estimate, shows an increase of £29,545 compared with last year.  The administration provision of £28,430 is £405 more than in 1956.  The sum towards development works included in the Estimate is £43,500 compared with £14,350 last year, i.e., an increase of £29,140.  The provision for administration expenses covers mainly the salaries of administrative and technical staff employed by the board.  It also includes a sum of £4,400 to cover travelling expenses of the board's staff as well as the fees and travelling expenses of the members of the board and the travelling expenses of members of An Comhlachas Iascaigh Mhara.  The individual items which go to make up the sum included (£43,000) for development works are as follows &mdash; £5,000 is needed for the replacement of certain machinery and the acquisition of lifting equipment to deal with very heavy loads now being handled at the board's boatyards.  Such machinery and equipment is necessary to improve efficiency at the yards and also to avoid the possibility of accidents in the handling of very heavy items of machinery such as marine engines, etc. Local installations for the better handling of fish are being provided as follows &mdash; freezing equipment at Dublin, £3,250; ice plant and cold store at Castletownbere, £5,000; quick freeze department at Schull, £8,100; quick freeze department and ice plant at Cahirciveen, £10,100; ice plant at Killybegs, £5,000; refrigerated transport, £2,100; fish filleting machines at Galway and Killybegs, £4,200; also is included a small sum of £750 to cover <Col N="1229" /> small miscellaneous schemes of development. These works at local centres which I have mentioned form part of a long-term programme of capital works of development upon which the board has embarked with my approval. They are intended to improve the quality of fish marketed and to stabilise supplies as far as possible by making it possible to avoid sending all the fish landed to the markets immediately it is landed without regard to the conditions that exist on the markets.</P>
    <P>The sum that I have mentioned in respect of each work represents only the amount that is being provided from the Exchequer.  These grants do not represent the total cost of these works as it is intended to supplement them by repayable advances from the Central Fund to the total amount of £48,700.  Many of the projects mentioned are to a considerable extent of a pioneering nature and on that account it is not thought reasonable that the board should be asked, to repay the full cost involved.  The projects will, however, return an income to the board in due course and the portion of the cost provided by way of advances represents what is considered a reasonable sum for repayment by the board.  In addition to the items which I have referred to there are three other works which the board are undertaking during the current financial year and which do not involve the payment of any grants from this Vote.  It is intended to provide repayable advances for these works which are &mdash; Office premises on the Dublin Fish Market, £2,400; Storage accommodation for gear and equipment and workshops at Dublin, £9,600, and the provision of a fish processing station at Galway £27,500.  The total cost of this station at Galway is expected to be about £55,000, and the balance of the cost or 50 per cent. is being made available as a grant from the National Development Fund.  This work has been going ahead for some months past. Considerable progress has been made with the construction of the buildings and half of the grant available from the National Development Fund has been already drawn.  The main item among the advances which it is hoped to make to the board during the <Col N="1230" /> current financial year will be, of course, the sum required by them to finance their scheme for the supply of boats and gear on hire purchase to fishermen.  The board have estimated that the total sum they will require in the current year for that purpose will be £157,000.  Forty-five thousand pounds however will become available to the board from cash sales, prepayments on boats issued and certain repayments by the fishermen, thus leaving the sum required as an advance from the Exchequer at £112,000.  Almost all the boats now being issued by the board are of the larger type fitted with the most modern equipment, and the board hope to be able to make available about 12 boats of that type during the year together with keeping up supplies of fishing gear to fishermen who cannot provide the same from their own resources.</P>
    <P>In connection with the figures I have mentioned as advances needed by the board during the current year, I must point out that no firm decision can be made as to the availability of these sums until further provision is made by legislation for advances to the board from the Central Fund.  Under the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, advances to a total of £500,000 were authorised by the Oireachtas.  At the end of the financial year on the 31st March, 1956, the balance remaining unissued out of this sum was £68,388.  This balance would be insufficient to meet the advances I have already referred to and further legislation is required to authorise advances in excess of the £500,000 specified in the Act of 1952. A Bill for this purpose is in course of preparation and will, I hope, be shortly before the House.  If and when the Bill is enacted, final consideration will be given to the question of issuing the advances sought by the board in the current financial year.  To sum up the position as to the financial requirements of the board during the current year, we must take the following items which I have already referred to into consideration &mdash; Grants for administration and development, £71,930 to be provided on this Estimate; advances from the Central Fund for development works, including a sum of £15,000 carried over from last year, £103,200; <Col N="1231" /> and for the provision of boats and gear on hire purchase, £112,000.  Adding the balance of the grant, £13,750, due from the National Development Fund in respect of the Galway premises, we get a final total of £300,870.</P>
    <P>So far I have dealt with the increases of some significance which have taken place on various sub-heads.  The only decrease of any significance is that the sub-head which provided last year under a Supplementary Estimate for the payment of £20,500 as balance of compensation in respect of the onetime several fishery in the tidal waters of the River Erne is this year blank. Taking increases and decreases and allowing for a reduction in Appropriations-in-Aid of £1,047, the net increase in the Estimate is £20,305.</P>
    <P>What I have said so far has been concerned with the finances of the Estimate, but I am sure the House would wish to hear something from me as to the general condition of the fishing industry.  I am glad to be able to say that the quantity and value of fish landed in 1955 show a considerable increase over the corresponding figures for 1954.  The quantity of sea fish, excluding shellfish, landed in 1955 was 303,519 cwt. or 48,805 cwt. more than in 1954.  The value of these landings at £686,195 was £50,393 more than in 1954. As to shellfish, it is not possible to express as a global figure the quantity landed as some classes were dealt with by weight and others by count.  Significant improvement in landings can, however, be recorded as the total value of all shellfish landed in 1955 at £196,103 showed an increase of £41,578. Taking all classes of fish together the total value of landings in 1955 was £882,298 compared with £790,327 in 1954.</P>
    <P>Apart from the satisfaction that there is in the increase in total landings, there are other satisfactory features.  It is Government policy that the fishing industry should be based to the greatest extent possible on the inshore fishermen.  The word &ldquo;inshore&rdquo; I may say very often gives rise to misconception in the mind of the public.  It is often thought that the word implies fishing very close to the <Col N="1232" /> shore and that the outer waters are left untouched by our fishermen.  This is not so as with the type of boat, ranging usually between 56 and 60 ft. overall with first class equipment, now being used by our fishermen, fishing activities are not confined to the grounds close to the shore.  Our fishermen are going quite long distances to sea and it is not uncommon that they stay overnight on fishing grounds some distance from the coast.  In 1955 the total quantity of demersal fish, i.e. the varieties which are usually found at some depth, landed by inshore fishermen reached 185,764 cwt.  This figure shows an increase on the corresponding figure for 1954 and is a continuation of the steady increase in the landings of such fish by our inshore fishermen over several years.  The balance of the landings of demersal fish 8,152 cwt. was made by the three fishing vessels operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>Another important factor in the overall increase in landings in 1955 was the very welcome increase of almost 50 per cent. in the landings of herring.  Mackerel landings which with the herring landings constituted by far the major portion of the fish landed here up to some 20 years ago, again proved disappointing in 1955.  During 1955 only a very small quantity of fresh and frozen fish was imported to meet whatever shortages arose from time to time due to the incidence of bad weather.  The position is that we have now reached the stage that supplies of fish from home landings are adequate to meet the existing demand and from that situation arises the question as to whether with the continued increase in catching power with the issue of further boats to fishermen, the situation will come about that supply will exceed demand and thereby cause marketing difficulties for the fishermen.  This possibility is fully realised and steps are being taken to expand and improve the distribution of fish throughout the country.  I have already mentioned several works which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara intend to carry out with a view to improvement of distribution.  Ice making plants and fish storage premises are being established at several points around <Col N="1233" /> the coast.  A fish processing station is already being operated by the board at Killybegs and another such station is in course of construction at Galway. The board is also considering the possibility of establishing inland distribution centres and one such depot established at Limerick is doing good business.</P>
    <P>These efforts are concerned mainly with distribution of fish for the table. There is another aspect of the question, the disposal of landings of pelagic fish (mainly herring and mackerel) which are made very often in very heavy quantities during a comparatively short season and which cannot be absorbed by what might be termed the week-to-week trade.  The only solution available to us in the absence of a revival on a large scale of the salt curing trade which cleared such heavy landings up to the early thirties, is the provision of reduction plants for the manufacture of fishmeal.  This matter has been under consideration and, as the House will probably remember, Bord Iascaigh Mhara has had a pilot plant in operation at Killybegs for some time.  Much useful information and experience has been gained from the working of this plant and not the least important result has been that it has demonstrated to the local fishermen what an advantage even a small plant of that type can be in providing an outlet for heavy landings of any particular type of fish which could not be disposed of through the ordinary marketing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The pilot plant has served its purpose in Killybegs and I am glad to be able to inform the House that a group of businessmen with experience of fishmeal manufacture on a large scale on the Continent have decided to seek facilities for the establishment of a full commercial size fishmeal factory at Killybegs.  Such a factory would, I need hardly say, be a very welcome step in the further development of the fishing industry not alone at Killybegs but generally along the Donegal and neighbouring coasts.  The need for fishmeal factories on other parts of the coast is also becoming evident, and it is considered that the full expansion of the industry at certain places, particularly <Col N="1234" /> where herring and mackerel are usually available in large quantities, will need such in course of time.  I am not able to say at present the localities in which such development works will be undertaken but I can assure the fishermen whose interests are vitally involved that the whole question of fishmeal manufacture is getting the closest consideration.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the expansion of our fishing fleet and the increased landings which are resulting therefrom from year to year.  Most of the new additional fishing vessels acquired by our fishermen are provided under the scheme of hire purchase operated by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  In this connection the following figures will be of interest.  During the year ended 31st March last 15 fishing boats were provided under the scheme and seven boats were re-engined.  Eleven of the boats supplied were new craft. Nine vessels, each of which was 50 ft. overall were built in the board's own boatyards, two were built in privately-owned yards, one being 45 ft. and the other 55 ft. overall.  Four secondhand boats (one, 63 ft., two, 50 ft. and one, 35 ft.) were acquired by the board and issued to fishermen.  In addition to this work, the four yards operated by the board carried out a considerable amount of repair work for fishermen.</P>
    <P>The demand for boats is well up to the board's capacity to supply and it is a gratifying feature that young men who have acquired training and experience as crew members on the modern type vessels now in use around our coasts are coming forward for boats from which they feel confident of being able to secure a satisfactory livelihood.  The other main activity engaged in by the board is the sale of fish, and it is satisfactory to note that the sales in 1955-56 at 160,762 cwt. showed an increase of 52,779 cwt. over last year.  The value of the sales in the year ended 31st March, 1956, reached a total of £508,236.  These figures do not include business done by the board in the marketing of shellfish and, in this connection, a pleasing feature of the board's activities is the very large increase from 8,234 cwt. in the year 1954-55 to 17,224 cwt. in the year 1955-56 in the quantity of mussels which <Col N="1235" /> was passed through the board's purification tank at Cromane, County Kerry.  This I hope is an indication of the permanent revival of this fishery which has been in a more or less depressed state for many years.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter in connection with the board's activities which I think calls for reference, and that is the record of the three fishing vessels operated by the board.  Last year, I made reference to these vessels when the Estimates were before the House and pointed out that their record up to then had not been satisfactory inasmuch as considerable financial loss had accrued from their operations.  The engines in these vessels have given much trouble and much fishing time has been lost on that account.  These troubles have continued during the past financial year and one of the vessels has had to be fitted with a new engine.  It would seem from the unsatisfactory service being given by the engine in the other two boats that the installation of new engines in these cases also must be considered.  In view of the heavy loss already sustained on these vessels, I am asking the board for a complete survey of the vessels activities to date and for their views as to their future working.  I consider that further losses on the operation of these vessels cannot be tolerated and when I have the views of the board before me, I will make a decision as to their future.</P>
    <P>There is another body in the scheme of fisheries administration as well as the board to which I would like to make some reference on this occasion. The body I refer to is An Comhlachas Iascaigh Mhara, which was set up under the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952.  This body was intended to be an advisory body, and it was designed to be representative of the various sections of the fishing industry.  It has no executive functions and is provided with considerable financial help each year from State funds through the board.  Travelling and subsistence expenses to the members are paid and accommodation for meetings is provided by the board, and furthermore secretarial services can be provided by <Col N="1236" /> the board on terms to be agreed between the two bodies, if the comhlachas so desires.</P>
    <P>During the past four years the board has paid out a sum of about £1,600 towards the expenses of the comhlachas. So far the comhlachas has secured only a very small membership particularly of retailers and fishermen, and cannot properly be said to be fairly representative of the industry as a whole.  Its income from membership recruited directly has been very small, and would have been altogether inadequate to meet expenses.  In addition to the help from State funds the comhlachas has also had the advantage of quite a considerable sum of membership moneys which were transferred to it from the funds of the old Sea Fisheries Association, but despite all the help given to it the position now is that the comhlachas is in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The committee came to me recently and informed me that they must be given further financial assistance by the State as they are unable to carry on.  I informed them that in view of the provisions made to help them by the payment of their travelling expenses, etc., that I could not give any hope that a special grant could be made to them to finance secretarial and such expenses.  I consider that the financial help given to the comhlachas has been fair and reasonable and I maintain that with the proper approach to their duties they should be able to recruit such membership from the various sections of the industry which would provide them, through membership fees, with whatever additional funds they require.</P>
    <P>Apparently the committee of the comhlachas does no look at the matter in that way.  They have established a most expensive secretariat, having regard to the nature of their functions, and it is obvious that they have entered into commitments, without due regard to their financial resources. Their financial position is now difficult and I understand that certain members of the committee are endeavouring to get that body as a whole to resign. They hope to have this development <Col N="1237" /> blazoned forth in the newspapers with material supplied by themselves and carefully composed to give the impression that my Department and the board have driven them to their decision.</P>
    <P>I know that there are on the committee of the association individuals whose dearest wish is the removal of the board from all business in the marketing of fish, purely in their own selfish interest.  If the journal published by the comhlachas can be taken as expressive of the views of the committee as a whole, it can be assumed that all the members of the committee are antagonistic to the board, but I do not believe that the fishermen's representatives could be so.  The journal has, so far as I can recollect, never printed the slightest measure of praise for anything the board has done.  It has, time after time, sought to discredit the board and to create the impression that it is an impost on the industry which prevents progress, rather than promotes it.</P>
    <P>This propaganda may mislead some people but the test to be applied to the services which the board renders is to ascertain the views of the fishermen in the matter.  I have done this as far as possible, and every group of fishermen that I have consulted has been emphatic in the view that the board must be retained.  Not alone do they regard the board's service in the provision of boats and gear as indispensable but they also regard the board's marketing services as being something which is vital to their best interests.</P>
    <P>It has often been stated as Government policy that the interests of the whole-time inshore fishermen whose members, I am glad to say are steadily increasing, are paramount as far as the Fishery Authority is concerned among the various interests in the fishing industry.  That policy remains and will continue, and I tell those people who are hoping to disrupt the comhlachas that if they think by so doing that they will frustrate that policy, that they are greatly mistaken.</P>
    <P>The board was established as a body to help fishermen in every way possible, <Col N="1238" /> and despite the attempts being made to have it removed or its activities curbed by selfish sectional interests in the fishing industry, it will be maintained as long as the fishermen want it.</P>
    <P>I have said that the fishermen's interests are paramount but this is not to say that other interests in the fishing industry, such as wholesale, retail and curing sections are not of very great importance too.  This was realised when the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, was being framed and for the first time in the history of the industry in this country a consultative and advisory body representative of all the sections of the industry was brought into being. I believe, despite our disappointments so far, that such a body could serve a very useful purpose providing that all sections came together in the proper spirit to contribute as best they could to the welfare of the industry as a whole.  So far, I am afraid that purely sectional interests have been pushed too much to the forefront.</P>
    <P>The present committee of the comhlachas have not approached their functions, in my opinion, in the proper way, but I am not without hope that we will eventually have a committee which will realise that they have a serious responsibility and can do valuable work for the industry by spending some time in hard thinking and producing well-considered and detailed proposals and suggestions for the better development of the industry.</P>
    <P>So far I have been dealing with the sea-fishing side of the industry, and I will now give the House some information as to the general position during the year 1955 of the other side of the industry, i.e., inland fisheries.  These fisheries consist of the salmon, sea trout and eel fisheries which are carried on on a commercial scale and, as regards salmon and sea trout, constitute as well a very important sporting and tourist attraction.  In addition, we have extensive brown trout and coarse fish waters which are also a valuable asset both as a source of much pleasure to our own people and as an attraction from abroad.  My Department can only collect statistics, however, in respect of salmon, sea <Col N="1239" /> trout and eels, as these are the only classes of fish taken in our inland waters subject to fishing licences or to any regulations as to furnishing of returns of catch.</P>
    <P>The statistics collected for 1955 reveal that the total catch of salmon by all methods in that year was 1,261,402 lb. valued at £363,788, compared with 1,976,677 lb. valued at £500,243 for the previous year.  The catch of sea trout at 73,201 lb. valued at £10,824, showed a slight improvement on the previous year for which the corresponding figures were 70,854 lb. and £10,800.</P>
    <P>The 1955 season was characterised by fairly heavy rainfall up to the end of June, after which there was a prolonged drought lasting in many areas to the end of the season.  This gave unfavourable conditions for estuarine netting until about the end of June when the major portion of the season had passed.  Runs of all groups of spring fish were not good in 1955. Grilse, as in 1953 and 1954, again turned up much later than hoped for, thus reducing the catch very considerably.</P>
    <P>The total catch of salmon in 1955 was distributed as to the various methods of capture as follows &mdash; draft nets, 48 per cent.; drift nets, 19 per cent; rod and line, 19 per cent.; stake nets, etc., 14 per cent.  The percentage for rod and line has shown a steady increase in recent years, and although the total catch of salmon in 1955 was 37 per cent. less than in 1954, the actual number of salmon taken on the rod was only reduced by about 14 per cent.  The total number of rod licences issued in 1955, excluding endorsements, was 6,604, an increase of 409 licences on those of 1954.  This increase in a continuation of the upper trend in the number of rod licences taken out for several years past.</P>
    <P>As to the eel fisheries, the year 1955 showed a considerable improvement. The catch was 187,177 lb. valued at £19,433 compared with 143,372 lb. valued at £17,993 for 1954.  Water conditions during 1955 were generally favourable for eel fishing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> As to brown trout and what are generally known as coarse fish, the main development that has taken place can I think be attributed to the very fine work that is being done by the Inland Fisheries Trust in co-operation as regards some waters with Bórd Failte.  Local angling clubs and committees are also very active in many places and much valuable work is being done through local enthusiasm and the realisation that local waters cannot be properly developed without a considerable measure of local effort.  The work which has been in progress for some years past is bearing fruit as is evidenced by the fact that we have now frequent reports of attractive fishing being available in many waters which up to a few years ago were in a state of serious neglect and in which the trout population had been reduced to insignificant proportions.</P>
    <P>The trust in the beginning of its career adopted what I think was a very wise policy when they decided that its operations in any particular locality must be in close co-operation with local angling clubs and associations.  The trust is not a body to supplant local effort but rather to supplement it by doing what is outside the capacity of local interests to undertake, and for this reason, if for no other, it deserves the full support of all anglers, throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that the trust was investigating the possible sites for the establishment of a fish farm.  This work had to be done in a very exhaustive manner as a suitable site must have some particular physical characteristics for the successful operation of the farm.  For instance, a minimum flow under the most severe drought conditions must be assured.  The water must be to a great extent spring water with a constant all the year round temperature.  The configuration of the site must give sufficient fall to convey the water to the hatchery and ponds at adequate pressure and again the general character of the site must be such that the ponds, etc., can be easily constructed leaving no danger of water seepage or disappearance.  Some few sites had some of the desired characteristics but one was far ahead of all <Col N="1241" /> others in that respect.  This particularly good site is at Fanure, near Roscrea, and it has been purchased by the trust. Work has already started in measuring up and surveying the ground and it is hoped that the construction work can be commenced in the near future. The cost of the farm is being met by a grant of £25,000 from the National Development Fund.  The farm will be a great asset in the development of our trout waters.  It will enable most of our restocking schemes to be carried out with young fish at the fingerling stage thus saving the enormous losses which are known to take place where stocking depends on the planting out of fry.  The farm will also be a centre of scientific research and in that way help further in collecting data which will be helpful to all concerned with fishery development.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the establishment of the Salmon Research Trust in conjunction with Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Company, Limited. The object of the trust is to conduct scientific research directed towards the general improvement in the public interest of the salmon and trout fisheries. During 1955 the trust commenced its operations and it has established a research station on the Burrishoole Fishery at Newport, County Mayo, with the co-operation of the owner of the fishery.  I am sure that the work of this trust will result in very valuable information being made available which can be applied in the development of our salmon and sea trout fisheries as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have given a brief survey of the present condition of our sea and inland fisheries.  It may be fairly claimed that progress has been made in many directions and that a solid foundation has been made for further progress in the years to come.  If there are any points which I have not touched upon and about which Deputies may wish to have further information, I will do my best to supply it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey by the Parliamentary Secretary of the activities of the section of the Department of Agriculture which comes under his control does not disclose any new or <Col N="1242" /> revolutionary activities in relation to the development of our potential wealth in fisheries.  It does show, however, a continuance of the useful work which was being slowly accomplished, and when I say slowly accomplished I mean that development of our fisheries in any direction is necessarily a slow operation.  When Deputy Bartley was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, one would think, listening to the speeches from this side of the House, that he was supposed to work miracles inside a relatively short period.  There is no such thing possible in fisheries.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are intimate with the problem and have experienced the many difficulties that beset any effort to improve the industry must realise that there is no round-the-corner solution in relation to the complete development of the undoubtedly vast potential wealth which lies around our seashores and in our coastal fisheries. The Parliamentary Secretary's statement reveals that the progress for which the foundation was laid is continuing and that the work is proceeding satisfactorily.  The big question &mdash; it was touched on by the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; now is that of the likelihood of supply outrunning demand. That is the immediate responsibility of any body that will seriously undertake future development and the maintenance of the progress which has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very difficult to visualise the situation which may arise if we continue providing more and more boats without, at the same time, making adequate provision for the distribution of the catch.  The Parliamentary Secretary is able to report increased activity in the quantity and value of catches in every respect, with the exception of inland salmon and inland fisheries.  That is to be expected when we consider that 15 boats were added to the fleet during the year and many more are in the course of construction. There are four boatyards turning out those boats and a continual demand from the fishermen for them on the hire purchase system.  We are rapidly reaching the stage when the value of our supplies will be very much <Col N="1243" /> depreciated because of the glut which inevitably takes place when the fishing is good and when too many boats are operating.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary made reference to one thing in his statement which I have been advocating on this Vote every year since I came to this House, that is, the proposal to erect inland distribution stations in one provincial town at least, which will ease the position.  In addition to the many other things which can be done to ease the position, the organisation of inland distribution centres must be undertaken as soon as possible.  We must get away from the position where this capital is recognised as the only centre from which fish is distributed to the rest of Ireland.  We must get away from the position, which has been pointed out thousands of times, where fish en route from Cork or Donegal flies through the provincial towns into Dublin to be marketed, and those provincial towns and the hotels therein may not have even 1 lb. of fish for the menu next day.</P>
    <P>By remedying that position we will be increasing the demand for fish generally and enlarging the fish-eating public.  The reason fish is not so much in demand in inland towns is that they have not been accustomed to getting regular supplies; perhaps the supplies they got were not in proper condition. That would not make for developing a taste for fish.  To that circumstance we can mainly attribute the fact that, although we are an island people, we are not a fish-eating community.  Some people say it is because we eat fish on Fridays only but, if these centres of distribution are set up and a continuity of supplies maintained to those centres, that situation will be remedied and we will be doing one of the most important things towards overcoming the grave crisis which could arise from excessive supplies and a shrinkage in demand.</P>
    <P>Other things which must go hand in hand with that are the establishment of deep freeze plant and the construction of processing stations, whether for fishmeal or of any other kind.  The <Col N="1244" /> complete collapse of the market which we have experienced on occasions when glut takes place can be overcome by proper cold storage and in the last resort by sending the surplus supplies, even at an uneconomic price, to fishmeal processing plant.  We are glad that somebody is thinking of establishing a full-scale fishmeal station in Donegal.  We have not so far had the privilege of having the site pinpointed on the map.</P>
    <P>When we first heard these people had been looking for sites, I tried to get the Parliamentary Secretary to give consideration to certain sites and he pointed out to me that they were a private concern which he could not bring to any particular point.  I appreciate that difficulty may be there, but I am sure these people coming in to set up the fish processing plant will be very much influenced by the advice they receive from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The first announcement made by the Minister gave us the impression that it would be in or around Killybegs; he said not 100 miles from Killybegs. The Parliamentary Secretary to-day specifically mentioned Killybegs. I take it then that this factory will be somewhere in or around Killybegs.</P>
    <P>Now it would be wrong to give the impression that a fishmeal processing plant is the panacea for all ills attaching to the fishing industry.  It is no harm that fishermen should know that it is, in the last resort, a means of utilising surplus catches to prevent the fish being returned to the sea, as has happened in the past, and to remove from the minds of our fishermen the fear of a repetition of that situation should catches prove excessive of needs.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the public generally, there is another aspect, which is somewhat more encouraging, and that is the potential employment which such a processing plant is likely to create.  Admittedly, the employment may be irregular or haphazard. A skeleton staff will, of course, always be required but the bulk of the workers will be employed only when the fish <Col N="1245" /> harvest is good.  The value of these plants, therefore, in so far as employment is concerned, is not to be deprecated.  Indeed, they are welcomed by all of us who are interested in the grave problem of unemployment along the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary made no reference to what I regard as a still indispensable and important section of the fishing industry, namely, the inshore fisherman. As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the man who is now regarded as an inshore fisherman goes to sea in a much larger boat and he may remain at sea overnight; he very seldom does, but he may.  He is now referred to as the inshore fisherman.  But, in the past, the inshore man was the man who rode a small craft to sea and cast his nets to haul in herrings or used his baskets or lines to catch white fish.  He has not disappeared and, despite all the progress we are making, I would say that he will always be with us.  He is not a whole-time fisherman.  Perhaps that is the most satisfactory thing about him; he is a man who works his land, goes to the bog and does small jobs on land.  It is only when conditions are suitable that he goes to sea to supplement his income by means of fishing, with his neighbours as a crew. I would not like to see him cast aside and afforded no protection in the future</P>
    <P>We had a war in Donegal between the inshore fishermen and the mechanised units.  I suppose the least said about that now the better.  While some of us are interested and deeply concerned in mechanised units, we appreciate the difficulties of the fisherman in the small craft at the same time.  We should like to see the Parliamentary Secretary and those responsible for the fishing industry giving this man consideration and protection to enable him to ply his industry without let or hindrance.  I am afraid he cannot do that at the moment.  He is faced with many hazards, as he has always been.  At best, his calling is a most precarious one and he has now to face the added interference from the men with the larger craft.  He does not expect to have miles of reserved <Col N="1246" /> fishing territory at his disposal because he does not go to sea every day, but surely some arrangement could be made whereby he would suffer the minimum of interference from those who are equipped to fish over wider territory and in deeper waters.  It is only right that a plea should be made on his behalf and, in making that plea, no one is advocating that we should return to more primitive methods.  The more up to date the methods and the more modern the equipment the greater the encouragement will be for men to remain in the industry.  The fact remains, however, that the small-craft man will always be with us and he deserves some consideration.</P>
    <P>In Killybegs at the moment, there are upwards of 20 large boats and undoubtedly the fleet will continue to grow.  There is need there of a slipway where boats can be brought in for repair.  The case has been made on more than one occasion before the powers-that-be for the provision of such a slipway.  The Parliamentary Secretary, however, did not refer to any such development in the list he gave the House.  He referred to lifting equipment in the boatyard, but that has nothing to do with the hauling in of the larger boats for repairs.  Some of the boats &mdash; they were issued many years ago &mdash; are constantly in need of some repair.</P>
    <P>The fishmeal factory at Killybegs was referred to by some people at one time as a toy plant.  I was always satisfied it was both a good and a useful project. As fishmeal plants go, it was small but as a pilot plant it has certainly achieved the purpose of demonstrating the use to which such plants can be put in so far as the fishing industry is concerned.  It also provides a certain amount of valuable employment. The people responsible for operating that plant are worthy of praise from those of us who are only too well aware of the success they have made of the plant.  Any expansion in our fish processing plants will be attributable mainly to those who have so successfully operated the fishmeal processing plant at Killybegs.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to An Comhlachas Iascaigh <Col N="1247" /> Mhara.  This body appears to be very interested in the fishing industry, though I have sometimes felt they are more interested in creating a fish war. I remember reading copies of the gazette in which they literally scarified the late Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bartley.</P>

      <P>I often thought their approach was not calculated to create harmony and co-operation in the industry.  It is very easy to create a &ldquo;cold war&rdquo; between private enterprise and the State bodies which are set up to look after the fishery industry. We often hear the complaints of the private man who points out that he is up against a State-sponsored organisation, which has funds from the Exchequer at its disposal, whereas he has to use private capital.  We hear those arguments made time and again, and I am sure there is a certain amount of substance in them.  At the same time, we all realise that the huge amount of money which must be expended to develop our fisheries could never be laid out by private enterprise, and that some State-sponsored body must undertake the work and see that it is carried out.  For that reason, it is essential that we always have a body, such as An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, to initiate schemes and to develop our fisheries generally.</P>
      <P>This is one of our most productive sources of wealth, in which good edible food may be harvested from the sea. It is a source of wealth to the nation which could not, and must not, be neglected by any Government.  I thought that the board set up by Deputy Bartley during his time as Parliamentary Secretary was a useful board and that it went about its task in the proper way.  It may have been pursuing a long-term policy but, as I said at the outset, any development of our fisheries must move slowly and must be by way of a long-term policy.</P>

      <P>I was sorry that the <Col N="1248" /> Parliamentary Secretary in his opening statement did not see fit to refer to the outgoing board.  In my opinion, it accomplished most useful work.  Now that its statutory period of office has expired, the service of that board is being dispensed with.  So far as I know, there was nothing to prevent their being re-elected, and one would think that, if they were good useful men who understood their work, they would have been re-elected.  In addition to their integrity, one would have thought that the experience they had gained during their initial period of office would have been sufficient to warrant their reappointment.  I am not casting any reflection on those who have been appointed, but the fact that none of the original members has been reappointed and that certain selections have been made on the board seems to give rise to a certain suspicion that political factors are playing a certain part in the important work of conducting our fisheries.  I would like to be convinced that that is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have looked on it in that way, but I certainly could not say that.  I thought, from my experience of the men on it, that they had been selected because of their particular understanding of the problems involved and because these problems required specialised knowledge.  We had on that board a man from Donegal who was not a political friend of mine but he certainly was one of the pioneers of the fishing industry in our country.  When I say that, I cast no reflection on the man who replaces him.  I am sure he will carry on the work well and apply his long experience to the job.  Since Deputy Collins has drawn me out, I felt duty bound to pay a tribute to the man who originally was an appointee <Col N="1249" /> on the outgoing board.  I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary did not pay a passing tribute to the men who were on the board and who, in my opinion, did a good job of work in the past.</P>
      <P>Before making reference to the inland fisheries, I would like to come up the estuary first.  In Ballyshannon we have a specialised problem, and the Parliamentary Secretary will excuse me if I make brief reference to it.  All is not well between the E.S.B. and the fishermen on the estuarian fishery and the salmon fishery generally.  I am not satisfied that proper action is being taken by all concerned in this dispute or by those who could be concerned in the dispute.  The Parliamentary Secretary's Department should be interested in it and the Department of Industry and Commerce should be interested in it.  It is a matter between the E.S.B. and the local fishermen.</P>
      <P>The local fishermen may have exaggerated somewhat when they said, as published in the Press, that the E.S.B. have completely ruined the salmon fisheries on the Erne.  That may be an exaggeration but it is also an exaggeration for the E.S.B. to say that they have done the fishery good rather than injuring it.  The fact remains that the figures are available and will show that there has been a decline in the number of salmon caught on the Erne over the past few years.  The E.S.B. maintain that that is due to the fact that while work on the hydro-electric scheme was in progress the salmon were unable to get up and many were captured in the estuary below the tail-race of the dam. They maintain that, for that reason, catches for those years were naturally higher and it was not only natural that they should decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that that is a complete answer.  The problem should be tackled and studied by experts who are in a position to know whether or not the present arrangement is satisfactory. I think that the fish-pass at Ballyshannon is not suitable.  It is not a complicated fish-pass, but it is a long run comprising about eighty chambers leading from the tail-race right up to the centre of the dam, through which the fish can pass easily.  There is in use there the system, now used in all <Col N="1250" /> countries in the world, by which the fish are counted and weighed as they are passing up.  By that means it is easy to determine the number of fish passing through.  There is one chamber where there is a glass panel through which you can actually see the salmon passing up.</P>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration for me to say that, in the course of passing through that dam last year, upwards of 200 of the salmon have died.  Some of the experts say that that is due to lack of oxygen in the chamber at times when it is overcrowded with the number of fish passing through.  Whatever may be the reason for it, the fact remains that it is a serious position.  It goes to show that the type of pass in use there may not be the most suitable type.  There is a type of pass in use on the Liffey, a pass of a different, uplift type, where salmon have not to labour or strain themselves in order to get from one height to another.  The actual gravity of the water through a vertical cylinder brings the salmon to the surface of the dam at certain intervals. The process is simple and, as a result, there is no strain or exertion. Consequently, the number of fish getting through is greater and the number of casualties fewer.  It is a matter for the experts to study the question.</P>
    <P>One thing in which I am deeply interested is the fact that many families in Ballyshannon have been deprived of a livelihood and have actually left the district.  There are only about ten boats now operating; only about 60 per cent. of the people who were employed in that fishery are now employed there.  The number has dropped by about 75 per cent. at least, because the fishing has not been as remunerative as it was in the past.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on a previous occasion and I would like to mention again one of the things about which fishermen complain.  It is only right that those people who are engaged in the industry should have their grievances brought to the notice of those who may be able to remedy those grievances.  The complaint is that the difference between the price of fish in the Dublin market and that paid on the shore is too great. We all know that there must be a <Col N="1251" /> difference because of transport, handling costs and various other incidentals, but the amount paid for a stone of fish at Killybegs, and the amount paid the following morning for that stone of fish in the Dublin market show such a vast difference that it creates the impression that undue profits are being made somewhere.</P>
    <P>Those prices are announced on the wireless each morning and it is not very encouraging sometimes for fishermen to hear the prices their catch has realised when they themselves on that particular catch have only realised a nominal amount for their hard day's work.  There might be reason for examination of that problem.  Again in that connection, private enterprise can score a point, because as a rule, such an enterprise can bring in fish with less overheads than an organisation like An Bord Iascaigh Mhara incurs in the handling of the fish.  Any State-sponsored or semi-State-sponsored organisation is inclined to levy off against every incidental to make sure that they come out on the right side.  For that reason the State concern is never able to compete with private enterprise.  Therefore, we hope that all undue charges and overheads will be kept to the minimum.  We do not expect that they can do miracles by ruling out distribution and transport and other incidental costs but such charges could be kept to a minimum in order to ensure that the men who do the work get paid for the job.</P>
    <P>The export of shellfish seems to continue satisfactorily and we all hope it will develop to a great industry.  It is one industry in which a certain type of people are engaged and it has a fairly long season.  With the exception of a few months the trade goes on all the year round and provides a handy livelihood to many gatherers, if I may put it that way.  The shell fish industry is the one that is showing some buoyancy in the export market and we would only be glad if our deep sea fisheries could anticipate an export market for pelagic and demersal fish. If that were to happen it would be one of the biggest industries this country could have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> The question about sending fish behind the Iron Curtain has been debated time and again.  Many people accused Deputy Bartley when he was Parliamentary Secretary of not taking advantage of that market and he had to point out that, at best, it was a doubtful market.  While our love for dealing with these people might not be great there were also political considerations and risks involved and, as a market, it could not be anything but a doubtful proposition.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the opinion of the present Parliamentary Secretary is but I remember that he once made a severe attack here when we brought in some timber from behind the Iron Curtain.  What his attitude towards selling cured fish to countries behind the Iron Curtain may be, I cannot say, but I do know there is a strong school of thought here that we should exploit that market fully.</P>

      <P>I am not too hopeful that it would provide the great market that has been represented by some people to be there.  The curing of herrings is a simple process enough but selling them afterwards is not so simple.  I think that if we are to develop the home market to the point where we can ensure continuity of supplies to midland centres and at the same time establish sufficient cold storage to hold over glut catches, with fishmeal processing plants to take up the surplus at a time when it cannot be disposed of otherwise, we would be doing well.  If we could reach that happy position we could proceed to issue more and more boats to the fishermen and possibly look forward to an export trade and to a thing which we all desire&mdash;a really prosperous fishing industry in this island country.</P>

      <P>If at times during the course of this debate I appear highly critical of certain of the methods of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara I would like the Parliamentary Secretary and the House to appreciate that it is because of personal experience gleaned and in the interests of the fishermen's welfare.  The last Bord Iascaigh Mhara certainly deserve a tribute but it is <Col N="1253" /> rather naive of Deputy Brennan to suggest that the selection of that board was not &mdash; as any of these boards are under one Government or another&mdash; greatly influenced by political considerations. That does not in any way detract from their having done in their time a really good job but I feel that we ought to come to grips with the basic problems of this industry.  I do not for a moment accept Deputy Brennan's contention that there are certain facets of this industry in which development cannot be fairly rapid and in which there cannot be a fair amount of expansion.  First of all, I have always contended in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In West Cork in one month we have been able to develop a market that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara would be seeking for the rest of their life and would not get.  We were able to provide distribution points in the local creameries where untied fish landed at County Cork ports can be sold and a market provided for 20 or 30 or 40 barrels every week in the areas adjoining these ports.  Does it not seem extraordinary that this State sponsored body, with experts in market research at their disposal, should leave it to the initiative of the fisherman to find a market for himself?  I shall deal with this problem <i>seriatim</i> because, first of all, I believe even the 50-foot boat is rapidly becoming obsolete; I believe the future of the fishing industry depends on the 65 or 70-foot boat.  I believe even such boats must have the height of technical equipment if they are to compete with the foreigners who appear on our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us first of all face the problem of our fishermen <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Scotch, English and Welsh fishermen.  I cannot understand why we are prepared to give Grants-in-Aid for all classes of projects &mdash; for the building of houses, farm dwellings reconstruction and so on&mdash;<Col N="1254" /> and forget about our fishermen.  Most of the fishermen in this country must scrape along for years to try and collect a deposit for a boat when they could be aided by the State, not alone in the matter of deposits but in repayments as well.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do, and so does his predecessor, Deputy Bartley, that some of the best fishermen on our coasts, through the economic circumstances of having wives and large families, have not been able to get together the large sum necessary for a deposit on a reasonably equipped modern fishing vessel.</P>
    <P>I think that particular slant of the question should be examined immediately. I believe fishermen should be able, through State aid, to equip modern vessels with such devices as echo meters and fish finders.  I speak from the experience of having been out trawling on vessels equipped with such devices.  There is no doubt these modern scientific aids enable the skipper to know what type of bottom he is going to shoot into and enables him to know to a reasonable degree of certainty what quantity of fish he is likely to haul.  One of the big problems of our fishermen is that they have to shoot in wrong areas and often lose nets and equipment which they would not have lost had they had the benefit of modern scientific methods.</P>
    <P>Let nobody be naïve or foolish enough to think we are not running into a highly technically developed enterprise when we start to develop substantially increased landings of edible fish.  The Parliamentary Secretary was in Castletownbere recently and he only had to look out the bay to see some 20 foreign trawlers sheltering there from France, Spain and Belgium.  That is an indication of how fertile and remunerative are the fishing grounds in the Cape Clear area. The provision of proper technical devices would enable our fishermen to save time in the catching of fish.  This would do away with the loss of time involved in the trial and error method used to date.  I would urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary to direct the attention of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to the formation of a plan whereby they would keep up to date with <Col N="1255" /> modern developments in aids to fish finding and ensure that these aids would be made available to the fishermen as rapidly and extensively as possible.</P>
    <P>I want now to get down to what I believe is the real kernel of weakness in our present system.  I refer to the supply of a vital corollary, the supply of ice and cold storage facilities for fish.  There is another thing in which the board have failed miserably&mdash;and I say &ldquo;miserably&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;and that is in the question of marketing of catches.  I will give one classic example.  I was present on the quay in Dunmore last year and I saw herrings going at 35/- or even 30/- a cran.  One of the skippers in a boat fishing in Dunmore, finding himself with a couple of hundred crans aboard, and seeing the price offered on the quay, made contact with Milford-Haven where he discovered he could get £5 10s. a cran.  That skipper, with a little more initiative than the others, battened down his hatches, ran into Milford-Haven and got £5 10s. a cran for his fish.  It seems extraordinary that the initiative of one man can make that difference in his circumstances in one day.  On the same day the lorries of Bord Iascaigh Mhara were lined up along the quay to take on fish for the fishmeal plant at Killybegs.</P>
    <P>The only justification for the sending of good class edible fish to the fishmeal plant would be an abnormal glut on the market.  The whole design and purpose of those plants should be to deal with the gut, the heads, tails and residue of good class fish rather than have first-class prime herrings reduced to fishmeal.  Let us face the fact that there is virtually no distribution of fish, good, bad or indifferent, throughout Ireland.  Let us realise that what Deputy J. Brennan said is pathetically true&mdash;that the fish come up from Cork and down from Donegal and are distributed through Dublin.</P>
    <P>Here is an extraordinary thing on which the Parliamentary Secretary should give an explanation.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara sell fish on the Cork market and the price bears no relation <Col N="1256" /> to the price asked in Dublin for the same type of fish.  The result is that all the fishermen on the south coast avoid the Cork market like the plague, preferring to transport their catches to Dublin.  Every Friday I drive from Dublin to West Cork and, with the exception of hotels, on the whole route down fish is as scarce as could be. In the fishing villages of West Cork itself unless you have a cara sa chúirt on the boats you will not get any fish in the village.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan challenged me as to how that position can be got over. There are multiple ways of getting over it, and there is no need for any cumbersome system of stores in every provincial town.  It may be necessary in two or three cities to have suitable stores in which they would be able to retain highly edible and palatable types of fish such as the quick frozen fillets.  Every town in Ireland has somebody seeking supplies if only people could get an assurance of regular supplies.  The retailers are ready to take on the job if they could get the supplies.  In a country as small as this, with every part of it accessible to other parts within seven, eight or nine hours, there could be a simple routing of fish to the retailers.  What is wrong with us in this country is that we always try to have elaborate schemes of distribution where a simple and straightforward scheme would do.</P>
    <P>I had the experience recently of going with some fishermen in West Cork to explore possibilities of the immediate local market.  We have a highly developed creamery area there and we went and approached the general managers of the creameries about the possibilities of making fish available to them on Fridays.  We were received with open armed enthusiasm.  The initial supplies of good fish to these creameries has proved to anybody who has his eyes open how something could be done about the distribution of fish in this country.  If there is one industry in this country that should be kept out of Dublin and away from the centralisation grasp of Dublin, it is the fishing industry.  We have four or five main ports for the landing of fish.  I <Col N="1257" /> would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the wholesale marketing of fish on the quays where they are landed.</P>
    <P>We all know that the impost of transport charges to the Dublin market is taking a good deal of the cream off the income which the fishermen should have.  I suggest to Bord Iascaigh Mhara that they should try the operation of wholesale markets on the quays and that those who come to buy bear the transport charges after the fisherman has been paid.  You may then find a big improvement in the price the fisherman will get for his fish.  Let us get away from cod grandiose schemes.  I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that if Bord Iascaigh Mhara put an advertisement in the papers to-morrow, saying that they had supplies of reasonable types of white fish, cod and hake available and they asked for agents in provincial towns to handle those supplies, they would get many more applications than a county council would get in reply to an advertisement for a rate collector.</P>
    <P>I saw recently the elegant building which has been opened by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and which, in addition to offices, has central workshops and gear shops.  Maybe I have a wrong concept, but I do think it extraordinary that they are going to drag engines of boats from the ports to Dublin for overhaul and reconditioning. All the indications in that are of a wrong type of approach by officials towards the problem.  Fishermen want their gear and the equipment maintained, but surely it would be better to have it done where it was convenient for them.  One thing that will have to be attended to is the question of having a scheduled time when boats will have to come back for a general engine overhaul.  The engines of all mechanical vehicles have to be overhauled and reconditioned at certain times if they are to work efficiently and this applies particularly to the engines of fishing boats.  Many of these boats have been in service for a long time and if they are to give a proper service they must receive overhauls at the proper time.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Parliamentary <Col N="1258" /> Secretary of an experience I had in the Dublin market recently.  I was getting continuous complaints from the fishermen that there was a substantial difference between the prices paid to independent fish wholesalers and the price that the board was getting for the fish.  I have checked on these matters and I will make available to the Parliamentary Secretary a series of dockets that will show the difference in the prices got in the various ports and the prices got by the independent wholesalers.  The difference was 4/-, 5/- and 6/- a box.  If you take that from the fisherman who lands 40, 50 or 70 boxes of fish, you can see that the difference is very substantial. One of the reasons for that is that there is not enough control by the board in the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>I happened to go to the market very recently with a member of the board and I found that the independent wholesale people in Dublin fish market had all their fish sold and the fish under the control of Bord Iascaigh Mhara had not been sold.  That is another of the difficulties which is being experienced.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to see that an amount equal to the difference between the prices got by independent wholesalers and those acting for the board is given to the fishermen.  I think, further, that if the auctioneers for the board are not prepared to get up early enough to dispose of the supplies, they should change their auctioneers.  As the position is operating at the moment, the fishermen who are tied to the board are getting less for their catches than those independent fishermen with whom they fish side by side in the same area.  The difference very often amounts to £2, £3 or £4 a week for men who are fishing in the same fishing grounds.  It is a chaotic situation. I am prepared to give the board credit for some very substantial advances but, if we are to increase the landings of fish and provide better equipment for fishing, surely the first thing we must do is to get an effective and informed outlook on the whole question on the consumption of fish.  I believe myself that proper supplies and a reasonable approach to the domestic consumer can make our people fish-minded <Col N="1259" /> very rapidly.  There are types of cod and hake and flat fish that would make a very welcome contribution to the diet of many a household in this country already overburdened by high costs.</P>
    <P>Do not start thinking of distribution in this country as if we were some huge scattered nation with a population of millions.  Distribution can be effected very rapidly in this country if the will is there.  It seems extraordinary that now, after all our years of effort, there is no general system of fish distribution in our provincial centres.  There need not be any clash between An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and private enterprise. If the board have good class supplies to furnish to private enterprise they can set up a distributing system very rapidly.</P>
    <P>I want to come back again to the problem of landings.  With increased landings, there is a necessity for port improvements in many areas.  I want to refer specifically to the ports of substantial landings in West Cork, Schull and Berehaven.  In both cases, the piers need substantial additions. I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what progress, if any, has been made with the suggested extension of the pier at Schull in order to make the lee harbour a safe anchorage for boats.  While myself and my colleague, Deputy M.P. Murphy, will have to pay substantial tribute to the board and to the Parliamentary Secretary for the fact that we are going to get ice plant facilities and storage facilities in Schull and Berehaven, that does not obviate the necessity for the provision of another very vital factor in the survival of the fishermen.  That is safe anchorage and good piers.</P>
    <P>We have got to move with the times. Deputy J. Brennan paid tribute to the part-time fisherman who takes out his boat and supplements his income but I feel that our main consideration will have to be for the full-time fisherman who is using, to the full, the technical equipment made available to him and who must keep up the standard of his landings in order to make his avocation <Col N="1260" /> worth while for himself and his crew.</P>
    <P>It is in this spirit that I direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that, where keen advances have been made in commercial fishing, the 50-foot type of boat is disappearing and is being replaced by a boat from 65 to 72 feet.  The experience is there for the board to assess in the case of the few boats in the 65-foot class that have been operating on the coast.  They are able to fish against any type of trawler which is at present invading our waters.  In the ultimate analysis, the fisherman who is going to take on himself the responsibility of delivering to the board will be better served by the type of craft that is in conformity with the day and age in which he has to fish.</P>
    <P>Above all, we want to ensure that we eliminate, as far as possible, the many hazards which the fishermen had to undergo in the past.  I think that can be done if the board provides the latest in technical developments and supplies as rapidly as possible for the fishermen.  I am advocating that that should be done on the basis of giving substantial grants to enable the equipment to be put in as rapidly as possible, because that equipment is going to reduce the loss of nets and gear, and will increase landings of fish. Any money spent in that way will be well-invested.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the question of distribution, let us come to another very necessary avenue of development. Can the Parliamentary Secretary indicate to us what, if any, market research has been done in relation to any possible surplus of fish, either fresh or processed, that may be available under the stimulus of an increased number of boats?  Has any effort been made to investigate the prospect of export markets <i>vis-á-vis</i> the people who are experts in fish exports and who are fishing along the West coast of Ireland &mdash; the French, Norwegians and Belgians?  It seems chaotic to me that, having filled to its potential the domestic market, we cannot get some kind of outlet for our surplus fish.  Has the possibility of the canning of the various types of fish been investigated? <Col N="1261" /> What progress, if any, has been made with market research in relation to the white kipper as distinct from the brown kipper?  What progress, if any, has been made about providing storage arrangements for processed fish here so that it will be available in lacuna periods so as to obviate any imports of fish at all?</P>
    <P>Market research is becoming the most essential part of modern export development.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say what real exploration of the potential has been made? Has any exploration been made of the possibility of the export, for instance, of tinned or bottled shrimps and prawns?  We are in a most fortunate position in the shellfish trade at the moment because of the complete denudation and exhaustion of the Basque shellfish beds, resulting in freely available French and Lowlands markets as well as substantial markets in England. Can we not exploit that situation to make, as permanent adjuncts to shellfishing, the production of either canned, bottled or processed shellfish for these markets?</P>
    <P>I am inclined to wax enthusiastic at times about the fishing industry because, rightly or wrongly, I believe it can be developed into a major national production unit.  With a reasonable approach we can eliminate for all time imports of fish and, with adequate market research, process fish to enable us to compete in an export market. Will anybody tell me that it would not have been practicable and possible to process herrings at 30/- a cran for an export market against anybody?  Of course it would.  As I said when opening my speech, there is nobody more appreciative of what has been done than I am.  There is nobody more appreciative than many of the people whom I represent and who have been able to get boats and enter the fishing industry, but it is to the amount that has not been done, it is to the amount I feel sure should be done, that it is my responsibility to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for refrigerated transport.  With due respect, I think a lot of that is cod. <Col N="1262" /> If there was any kind of an analysis of distribution made in this country it would be found that there is hardly a place in Ireland where fresh fish landed iced could not be delivered in prime condition from any vehicle.  If we start thinking in terms of expensive refrigerated transport here and other types of transport there, in the ultimate analysis it is the fishermen who will pay for it and it is from the earnings of the fishermen that all that money must come.  It is our duty to guard the fishermen as much as possible against that type of filching of what should be their legitimate earnings. It is a sorry return the fisherman is getting for the 7½ per cent. commission he has to pay the board for sales of his fish, fish he could not sell anywhere else if those sales are not in any way comparable to the sales of other wholesalers.  There must be some reason for it.  If there was an occasional differentiation it would be understandable, but I have gone through a series of dockets with fishermen and that differentiation is a repetitive feature of the sales.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a great deal of genuine progress being made by the Parliamentary Secretary's section of the Department.  I know how anxious the Parliamentary Secretary is to safeguard the interests of the fishermen and to reduce the hazards of his livelihood, but we would be failing in our duty if, having accepted the benefits, we did not endeavour to give some constructive criticism as to how things might be improved.  Fish abound around our coasts.  Our fishermen have proved their capacity to catch and kill it but we have not yet been able to tap the domestic market properly for fish. We are still in the position that whether the fish is landed in Killybegs, Galway, Berehaven, Schull or on the east coast of Ireland, into Dublin it goes out and out again.  Rapid investigation is needed into that situation. Remember, the transport charges are a burden on fishermen, particularly the fishermen who have to send the fish long distances, at a cost of from £60 to £70 per lorry, to the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>In relation to inland fishing, it is a matter of regret that in certain areas there is a substantial decline in <Col N="1263" /> salmon catches.  Another thing I would say, whether the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me or not, is that where salmon or salmon-trout fishing is a main feature of the livelihood of the people, as it is in certain of the rivers in my constituency, there has not been sufficient rigidity in dealing with the person who is buying the poached fish from the poacher.  You cannot have a situation of improved fishing for these people whose livelihood depends on it where the incidence of poaching is becoming fairly extensive and where the incidence of political interference with the consequences that they should normally suffer is becoming more prevalent.</P>
    <P>I know well the conservators of my area have been making strong representations to the Parliamentary Secretary in this connection.  I have a great regard for the man who will take the chance, and if he gets away with it, go n-éirigh an t-ádh leis, but if he is caught I feel that, in the normal spirit of thrust and parry, he should take the consequences.  Many of the rivers and of the trout fishing areas of this country are so severly poached that it is impossible for those languid, lazy anglers, whom the Parliamentary Secretary is so anxious to encourage, to catch anything when they go to fish in some of those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a vitally important Estimate because it deals with what is an expansionist industrial potential within the State.  We talk about emigration and the flight from the western and south western sea board and many of us know, in our heart that, with a reasonable development of the fishing industry, we would be able to keep our people at home. Not alone that, but we would be able to bring back those who are now fishing in foreign boats.  We would be able to get experienced skippers for the best boats we could supply.  They would come back into the seaside districts and settle down there with their families.  I and my colleague have seen that development in a somewhat small way in the last five or six years.  We have seen families settling down, crew members planning their routes around our fishing ports in West Cork.  That is particularly the case in Schull and Berehaven.  Where there is availability of equipment and a reasonable hope of earning a good livelihood the fishermen are settling down, skipper and crew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect, which may not be altogether relevant to the present Estimate, but it is one to which, I think, the Parliamentary Secretary can lend a tremendous impetus.  I refer to the provision of vocational training in navigation, engine maintenance and boat repairs in our ports and harbours.  Because of the increase in the size of the boats and the increase in instrumental appliances, the time <Col N="1265" /> has come when it is vitally essential that the crews of these boats should be trained in the elements of navigation, engine maintenance and equipment maintenance.  Young families are growing up in Berehaven and Schull with a fishing tradition behind them and the Parliamentary Secretary should urge on the educational authorities the importance of making available the type of training I suggest.  I predict that in the foreseeable future no man will be able to take a boat to sea, in excess of 50 or 55 feet, without having some kind of mariner's certificate as to his competence to skipper such a craft.  There is an abundance of tradition and a ready intelligence in these people; vocational education on the lines I suggest will make them technically efficient and sufficiently skilled to man the most up-to-date boats we may place at their disposal.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of which side of the House we sit, there is a tremendous amount of respect of the Parliamentary Secretary's anxiety to reach the fishermen and discuss with the fishermen the problems inherent in their trade.  There is an appreciation among those engaged in fishing that the Parliamentary Secretary is of them and with them in their efforts to progress.</P>
    <P>If I appear highly critical of the marketing arrangements of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, I advance my arguments in the hope of giving them a solution to some of their difficulties and, at the same time, ensuring that the industry in which they play such an important part will get every chance to expand.  I hope my criticism is healthy criticism directed towards furthering the progress of a growing, strong and virile industry, an industry which can bring stability and an increase in population to large areas in which the flight from the land and the sea has been so pronounced.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will continue, while he is spared to put his hand to this task, to make every effort towards the advancement of the fishing industry.  If he finds himself baulked by lack of funds it is my firm conviction that he can come in here at any time and find sufficient of us here to ensure that the further advancement <Col N="1266" /> of the fishing industry will not be impeded.  Lean leis an obair agus go n-éirigh an t-ádh leat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess my knowledge of the fishing industry is very elementary.  Consequently my contribution will be very brief and more or less of a local character.  As a member for a constituency which is to some extent interested in the fishing industry, in deep-sea fishing, tidal-water fishing and ordinary fresh-water fishing, there are a few matters to which I would like to refer.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary is or whether he favours what is termed sea fishing, but anglers have been for some time hoping for an alleviation of the restrictions under which they suffer in certain areas where the practice of free fishing was permitted by the farmers who own the lands adjoining the rivers and the fishing rights in the rivers.  In recent years these farmers have leased these rights to wealthy sportsmen who come over here with plenty of money and are prepared to pay any price for the rights.  Unless something is done to stop that practice, angling will soon become the sport of the wealthy only and the poor will be relegated to the canals and the reservoirs to fish for pike and roach.</P>
      <P>In regard to commercial salmon fishing, I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that last year our catches were approximately 1,200,000 lb. and of that only about one-tenth was taken by salmon rods. Now salmon rod fishermen have to pay very substantial licence fees and they contribute heavily to angling clubs for the preservation of our rivers.  They contribute largely to angling groups for the preservation of our rivers.  They are the mainstay of our tackle shops all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in Kerry, Connemara, Donegal and other salmon fishing centres, hotels whose clientele consists mainly of salmon rod fishermen.  These fishermen have to be satisfied with the salmon that are allowed to pass through our weirs during the weekends. That affords very poor fishing. Much greater consideration should be <Col N="1267" /> shown to the interests of our salmon fishermen.  Apart from the monetary aspect of this matter, our salmon and trout fishing are the most fascinating of sports.  Our Irish lakes and rivers are legendary wherever anglers foregather. For that reason, they are an extremely valuable adjunct to the tourist industry.  The task of protecting and managing and preserving our inland fisheries provides employment for a good number of men but that number could be greatly expanded and the number of our fishing visitors could be progressively increased if the means available to us were fully used.  It has always been a great difficulty for our boards of conservators to protect our inland fisheries properly.  The difficulty in that regard was increased last year by the revocation of the export levy on salmon by the Minister for Agriculture, thus seriously curtailing a valuable source of revenue for development and protection purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact to-day that, with salmon fetching such a high price, poaching is big business and very serious damage is being done to our inland fisheries.  In my opinion, long-term imprisonment is the only way out of the difficulty where that type of poaching is concerned.  It is extremely difficult to catch the poachers and the whole problem has been rendered more difficult by the Minister's action in reducing the means of effectively policing our rivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it would be a wise step.  Early last year, the Parliamentary Secretary paid a visit to Waterford.  I am sure he was impressed by the value and importance of the fishing industry in that area.  I hope he was convinced of the necessity to improve and develop the industry there.  While we were grateful to him for his assurance that the scheme for improvement, for the provision of an ice plant and for the repair of the quays at Passage, would have his immediate and careful consideration we feel now that, in view of the chaos that prevailed in the fish business in Dunmore during the past fishing season, some immediate and definite action should be taken to prevent a recurrence of those disastrous conditions in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is apparent that the provision of an ice plant is a very urgent consideration to ensure that the fishermen of Dunmore and the surrounding areas will not have to spend their time kicking their heels on the quays for days before they dispose of their surplus catches.  They should be enabled to return to reap further the harvest that lies waiting for them if only they could dispose of their previous catch rather than have it lying and rotting on the quays.  The conditions that prevail in our southern ports should galvanise the Parliamentary Secretary into some action to prevent a recurrence of that type of thing.  It may be <Col N="1269" /> that, after due consideration, the Parliamentary Secretary may be of the opinion that the provision of an ice plant there would not be economic.  To be quite candid, I am not entirely sure myself that the supplies of fish there would always be such as to keep an ice plant fully occupied or nearly fully occupied.  However, it is very evident that something must be done to take the surplus catches off the hands of the fishermen.</P>

      <P>There is a very practical way in which the Parliamentary Secretary can come to the aid of the fishermen in Dunmore and the surrounding areas.  We have a very substantial fleet making use of that harbour. I understand that their boats require to be overhauled on an average twice per year and that, to have that work done, they are obliged to undertake a long sea voyage to Arklow or Baltimore.  Naturally, they are very reluctant to face this journey, and the proper care of their boats is, therefore, neglected.  Consequently, they deteriorate at a very alarming rate.  The provision of a slipway would be a godsend to those people.  I understand that the cost of the erection of such a slipway would be about £3,000.  Such an expenditure would not be entirely lost.  I understand it would be recovered in a short time and would then show a profit in respect of the fees which the fishermen would pay for its use when their boats would require overhauling.  I hope I am not appealing in vain to the Minister to provide such a slipway for them.</P>

      <P>Dunmore.  As regards our inshore fishing, there are landing places along the Waterford coast where it is impossible to land fish, particularly during bad weather.  I have in mind in particular Ardmore Harbour, where the development of the fishing industry has been greatly impeded through lack of proper landing facilities and for want of the improvement of the harbour generally.  I believe that the former Parliamentary Secretary indicated the willingness of his Government to give a grant for this work but that the county council were unwilling to avail of it because of the steep increase in the rates which it would entail.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the matter with a view to making a bigger grant available for the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand they would.  We have at Checkpoint, too, a dredging problem.  There is an accumulation of silt and sand at the mouth of the river and I understand that certain local fishermen would be prepared to undertake the removal of the sand and silt if financial aid were forthcoming for the purpose.  There are also at this point a number of stakes or piles of an old weir which at high tide are completely covered and are a menace to the fishermen at their work.  The removal of these would enable the fishermen to carry on their work without the danger of having their nets torn to pieces or their boats very severely damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question put down by my colleague, Deputy <Col N="1271" /> Kenneally, last week, in regard to the provision of a boat for the fishermen of Ring and Helvic, under the Fíor-Ghaeltacht scheme, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that no decision had been reached in regard to this matter. To say the least of it, that was very disquieting news.  I was under the impression, and so were the fishermen of that area, that a boat had been earmarked for them.  The need of these fishermen is for a large boat to enable them to fish at some distance from the shore.  Their present boats are too frail and weak to permit them to do anything but inshore fishing and they assure me that inshore fishing at the moment is unproductive.  If they had a larger boat, they could go from 20 to 30 miles out to sea where they could get plenty of fish, herring and mackerel, in which they are especially interested.  Apart from the fishermen in the locality, there are some 20 or more others who could be gainfully employed if supplies of fish were plentiful.  Without fish, these people are dependent on the dole.  They belong to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and in helping them the Parliamentary Secretary will only be pushing on the plans of the Government for the development of the Gaeltacht areas.  I would appeal to him, in view of the urgent need of these people, to provide a boat which would permit them to fish at a distance from the shore.  I would ask him to make the case before An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and ask them to make such a boat available to them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest in conclusion that no effort should be spared to develop our fishing industry to the fullest extent?  A lack of boats, gear and equipment generally is no longer a deterrent to its development since the establishment of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which is empowered to grant essential aid to the fishermen who are responsible for the initial stages of the industry.  The board is also charged with the responsibility of introducing improvements in curing, marketing and transport, and cold storage.  There is no doubt that the establishment of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara with these powers has had a very beneficial effect <Col N="1272" /> on the industry as a whole but it is rather unfortunate that we are not so much alive to the value of fish as a food as other nations.</P>

      <P>I would say that that is why the fishing industry is not developed to a greater extent.  One cannot expect the fishermen to provide, or the distributors to distribute, a highly perishable food which is eaten only one day a week.  I think in the interests of the industry a more vigorous and energetic campaign might be undertaken to educate our people on the value of fish as a food and encourage the wider use of it from the point of view of the effect on the national larder and from the point of view of those who make their livelihood mainly or partly by fishing.  I think such a campaign might well be placed in the hands of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and would have a very beneficial effect.</P>

      <P>I think it would be out of place for me if I did not preface my remarks with a word of thanks to the Parliamentary Secretary for the way in which he has helped us in West Cork since his appointment. He has visited us on two occasions and both of his visits have borne fruit.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that the people appreciate his actions very much indeed.  We are deeply grateful for the provision of the ice plant in Schull which is now in the course of erection and also for the proposed ice plant at Castletownbere which is to be provided from the current Estimate.  While these two items are of great importance and of great advantage to the fishermen in West Cork, there are a few more items to which we would like the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to give attention.  However, as the Minister is present, I shall just leave over these matters for a while and get on to another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a matter I do not understand <Col N="1273" /> and I have failed to get any definite information about it since I came into this House.  That is the question of reserved inland fisheries. We have in this country stretches of rivers and lakes entirely reserved to certain people and on analysis we find that the majority of these people are not Irish at all.  My information is that these fishery rights are held under ancient charters from kings who have been dead for the past 400 to 500 years. Is it not rather peculiar that at this time in 1956, when we in this part of the country describe ourselves as a Republic, that our own Irish people, people of Irish stock and origin, are deprived of fishing in certain portions of our fisheries, and have to keep completely away from certain rivers and certain lakes?</P>
    <P>I think that is a matter to which this Government should address itself immediately because ordinary people down the country cannot understand why some legislation has not been enacted doing away with that undesirable position.  As the Minister is present, I would ask him this question: From information which I have received recently, am I right in saying that the E.S.B. purchased from a lady in Cork private fishery rights held on the River Lee under a charter of King Charles II of England?  If I remember my history correctly, King Charles died in the year 1660, but this lady in Cork was able to sell portion of her fishery rights to a State-sponsored body for some £4,000.  Is that correct or incorrect? If it is correct&mdash;and my information tends to indicate it is&mdash;I think it is a scandal and a shame that public funds to the extent of £4,000 should be paid for the purchase of these private fishery rights held exclusively under charter of King Charles II by this person in Cork.</P>

      <P>The question of an increase in the premium rates for private motor car insurance was first raised by the Accident Offices Association in July, 1955, when the association were informed that any application for such an increase would be the subject of a public inquiry by the Prices Advisory Body.  The formal application for consideration at the public inquiry was made by the association in November, 1955, and copies were circulated to other interested parties in December, 1955.  In order to afford the other interests an opportunity of studying the document and of furnishing their own statements on the application, the advisory body fixed 10th February, 1956, as the date of the public sitting. It was necessary to examine certain matters raised at the public sitting but the submission to me of the recommendation of the advisory body has been delayed by the refusal of the Accident Offices Association to supply certain information which the advisory body considered important and which was readily available to the association. The matter is still receiving consideration by the Prices Advisory Body.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>At my request, the Prices Advisory Body reviewed retail meat prices on a number of occasions during the present year and have furnished a report to me.  The report indicates that, in light of all the circumstances, the advisory body do not recommend the making of an Order controlling the retail prices of meat.</P>
      <P>I have given this matter the most anxious consideration and I am satisfied that intervention by me would not be in the best interests of the consumer. In the circumstances, I have accepted the recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware that in the last six weeks particularly, the price of cattle in the Dublin market, being bought by Dublin butchers, has fallen by as much as 1/6 and 1/8 per lb. and if, in view of that situation, he will not reconsider his decision and insist on the decrease being passed on to the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be most anxious, if it were practicable, to control meat prices and I am quite sure the members of the Prices Advisory Body are likewise anxious.  However, the difficulty is the devising of a system which will not boomerang on the consumer.  I am advised that, in view of the wide variation in the quality of cattle and sheep, the week-to-week fluctuation and the absence of any satisfactory grading of beef and mutton, it would not be possible to establish any reliable basis on which to fix retail prices for control purposes. The Prices Advisory Body have also intimated to me that a survey of 31 butchers' shops in Dublin disclosed that there were differences between the highest and lowest prices extending from 6d. per lb. to 19d. per lb.  The only remedy you could find for it is one which might boomerang on the consumer, possibly resulting in his having to pay the minimum price for an inferior class of meat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the reply, I have no doubt the Minister is aware that the bulk of the meat bought in the Dublin market for Dublin consumption is bought at a price far below the actual published price. I would ask the Minister to consider the formulation of a scheme of price control similar to that adopted in relation to bacon which varies in accordance with fluctuation in the price of pigs.  That scheme is working very satisfactorily and I think the Minister might explain to the House why the same scheme could not operate in the matter of beef and mutton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the grades are different and because of the fact that one is converted by processing while the other is eaten shortly after it is bought.  This is an extremely difficult matter and if the Deputy has any recipe for its solution I would be glad to consider it.  So will the Prices Advisory Body.  I shall be glad to make available to the Deputy the principal difficulties encountered in this matter to see whether her ingenuity will enable her to find a solution to the problem.</P>

When any case of delay is reported to me or the Department the matter is fully investigated and steps are taken to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Deputy's information it should be stated that complaints of delay are sometimes made because it is not understood that, in the case of new claims, benefit is not normally payable in respect of the first three days of illness and that no payment is due <Col N="1280" /> until a second certificate is received.

      <P>I am sorry, Sir, that I have departed from my usual meticulousness in such matters but this is a rather serious matter, particularly coming to the holiday period when parents have to avail of the clinics to have their children's eyesight tested. In the clinics, there are no Irish sight-testing charts and the parents would prefer to have their children tested in the schools.</P>

      <P>Prior to Question Time, I was referring to the matter of reserved fishery rights.  Some <Col N="1283" /> time ago I put a question to the responsible Minister to ascertain information as to the extent of fishery rights exclusively reserved to certain people but I was unable to obtain any information whatsoever.  Apparently the Department of Fisheries in this country, and this goes for the Department of Fisheries under the various Governments, are so unmindful of this particular question that neither Government has ever troubled to ascertain the extent of these private fishery rights.</P>

      <P>No, Sir, but I wish to refer the Minister to this situation.  There is no reference in this Estimate to these fisheries.  They are completely and entirely forgotten. I have been at this question for the past five years and nothing has been done.  We hear my friends Deputy Seán Collins from West Cork, and Deputy Seán Ormonde from Waterford, denouncing in forcible terms people who are guilty of poaching.  Let me say that it is the duty and obligation of every member of this House to stand firmly behind the laws and enactments of the House.  It would be out of place for any Deputy to stand up and condone breaches of any of our laws.  I am not going to do so.  At the same time I have the feeling that we have this poaching in some districts because the people do not regard it as a criminal offence, and, for the same reason, they cannot see why some Earl or Duke in England should have the exclusive fishing rights of the particular piece of river adjoining their district. The tendency is for people here to deny these rights and to trespass on their preserves even though it is a <Col N="1284" /> breach of the law.  I believe that certain breaches of the fishery regulations are being carried out in such a spirit. While that spirit exists, I am quite entitled to come to the Parliamentary Secretary and make representations for a reduction in any fine that may be imposed in view of the existing circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again point out that the reduction of fines is not a function of mine?  I have been asked on occasions to recommend a reduction of such fines but in no instance since my appointment to this office did I recommend a reduction in a fine to the Minister for Justice.  In one particular case, I was asked to recommend a reduction by the Cork Board of Fishery Conservators and I refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not trespassed on the Parliamentary Secretary very much in that direction.  I have not been responsible for getting any fine reduced and I believe that Deputy Seán Collins is in the same position. While on this point I would direct attention to the fact that in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> this week we have the Cork Board of Fishery Conservators up in arms, using strong language and such terms as &ldquo;Cheap-jack politicians geting these fines reduced.&rdquo;  This statement was made in the town of Bantry. The only inference that I could draw from that statement is that people had no trouble but to go along to some politician and get fines, imposed in West Cork for poaching, remitted. Now we find that the real people who are trying to get the fines remitted are some of the conservators themselves.  I hope that when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying that he will touch closely on this matter of the Cork Board of Fishery Conservators who have given people to understand that there is no trouble in getting the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Justice to reduce fines.  The Parliamentary Secretary should deal with that firmly and tell us about the number of applications the Cork Board of Fishery Conservators have made to him to have fines reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He will find that Deputy Collins and myself have troubled him very little in that respect. As he knows, I approached him in only one case.  We want to have that made clear to those people in West Cork and County Cork who have made a number of false statements in this connection.  This question of fines and the Parliamentary Secretary's intervention arose out of my reference to poaching.  We must remember that whatever our views on poaching may be, a number of these poachers are poaching the preserves of foreigners who hold these preserves. I do not wish unduly to take up the time of the House on this question but I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to make a detailed statement on it when replying.  It is a question that seems to be evaded, and surely if this position is to be rectified the natural place to expect a start in that matter is the Fisheries Branch.  It is their duty to initiate legislation which, I feel sure, could be passed easily through this House, to do away with those private rights.</P>
      <P>I do not want to labour that point any further, but I will repeat the question I asked the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago, to give us information, if it can be made available, as to the extent of the fisheries so reserved.  I hope I have indicated clearly not only my own viewpoint but the viewpoint of many people in this country from Cork to Donegal in this respect.  We are long enough a Republic; we had to fight for it for more than 700 years and it is entirely out of place that, in the part of the country in which we have achieved freedom, we should still have people who do not belong to it at all owning certain parts of the country independent of the wishes of the Irish people and apparently with the connivance of successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking, as a Deputy&mdash;and I believe I represent a wide section of opinion&mdash;for the ending of that situation. I hope when the Parliamentary Secretary is introducing his Estimate next year that it will not be necessary for any Deputy to refer to this question and that the necessary legislation, <Col N="1286" /> no matter how complicated it may be&mdash;and I cannot myself see any complications arising&mdash;will be enacted, that the waters of this country will be free to each and every Irishman and that each and every Irishman will have an equal opportunity to fish on them. When that equal opportunity is given and when all our waters are our own property, I believe the Parliamentary Secretary need not comment very much on the question of poaching because we have civic spirit enough not to break our own laws.  As long as you have these foreigners owning these rights you are bound to be confronted with fines for poaching, and so forth!</P>
    <P>The reason I digressed a little at the start was that along with making the position clear to the Parliamentary Secretary I availed of the presence of his senior, the Minister for Agriculture, to make him aware of this position.  Prior to that I had marked my appreciation of the Parliamentary Secretary's two visits to West Cork and the fruit which they bore and I again conveyed to him my deep appreciation and that of the fishermen there for the help he is giving them. Deputy Collins has also indicated the position in that respect.  We are united in our efforts and unanimous in our opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>We would be grateful if some more moneys could be made available through the Department of Agriculture for slips and piers.  I know that the Department is troubled by such applications from all over the country but the difficulty of getting grants for these improvements is so great that you would scarcely think it worth while to apply at all.  There is the preliminary work of examining the slip or pier for which representations have been made.  When this has been done, we must wait for another 12 months before there is any progress.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, whenever representations are made for small improvement works for piers and slips, he should indicate within, say, six months whether that money will be granted.  Many of these schemes remain undone for a number of years and if the opinion of the Parliamentary <Col N="1287" /> Secretary and his advisers is that, having examined the relevant documents, a grant would not be warranted, he should tell us, so that we would know where we stand.  At the present time we are just waiting in some cases for years before knowing whether the work will be approved or not.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention briefly also the question of extending the three-mile limit.  It would be advisable to do so, as many fishermen around the coast complain that their livelihood is taken from them to some extent by poachers from other countries.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is most mindful of the position and would like to help in every way possible.  I understand there is at least one country in Europe which has succeeded in extending its fishery rights.  In Norway, which has a huge mileage of coast, I think the limit is ten miles.  I am led to believe that this matter can be discussed by representatives of the Irish Government at the International Court which is set up in the Hague.  If that is the position I would like the Parliamentary Secretary, if it is possible, to put forward a proposal for extending the three-mile limit to at least six miles.  If we extend the limit to six, foreigners are bound to come inside it but three miles is too close.  This would be a marked advantage and would enable our fishing boats to detect these poaching trawlers which are creating such havoc in our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>We were glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary of the increased catch of fish and of the increased value of that catch.  The Parliamentary Secretary struck a fearful note that these improvements might result in the supply of fish exceeding the demand. Should that position obtain, naturally the price would fall, and fall considerably, and the industry would become an uneconomic one.  The best way to deal with such a problem is to endeavour to get a better distribution of fish.  Almost every Deputy who has spoken has adverted to that.  It may be quite easy to detail plans theoretically for dealing with such a situation and it may be very difficult to put these plans into operation.  At the same <Col N="1288" /> time, Ireland is an island and there is no part of the country more than 60 to 70 miles from the sea.  From that point of view, it should not be too difficult to evolve some scheme whereunder fish would be made available to meet the needs of the population in the inland towns and surrounding districts.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of the fish caught in West Cork is sent to Dublin.  The fishermen have to pay the transport costs from, perhaps, Castletownbere to Dublin City, a distance of more than 250 miles.  We are led to believe that, having paid the cost of transport of that fish to Dublin, some of the fish may be sent down the country again from Dublin.  Surely that is a nonsensical proceeding.  Surely some change should be made.  I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary cannot do in other areas what he has done in Limerick, namely, set up in towns like Clonmel, Port Laoise, and elsewhere, distributing centres to which the fish can be sent in the first instance instead of sending it to Dublin and redistributing it from there.  I am sure that within a comparatively short time the board, acting on behalf of the fishermen, would become conversant with the quantity of fish these distributing centres would require.  All extra costs would, of course, have to be borne by the fishermen, but every effort should be made to do something in that direction because not only would it help the fishermen but it would provide the people living in areas remote from the sea with an opportunity of getting fresh fish daily.</P>
    <P>The question of the transport of fish is an important matter though I admit this would be more relevant perhaps to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Fishermen are complaining that C.I.E. is not at times in a position to cater for them speedily, that there are delays in getting lorries to remove their fish from such centres as Baltimore, Schull, Castletownbere and so forth.  Fish is a perishable commodity and it is advisable, from that point of view, that there should be some relaxation in the licensing laws relating to haulage.  Where C.I.E. cannot transport the fish, <Col N="1289" /> private lorry owners should be allowed to do so.  A delay of three or four hours may render the fish unsaleable.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Parliamentary Secretary to take some steps to improve the distribution of fish.  I was told in Bantry that early on in the season there were huge catches of herrings in Geartries and not one penny profit did the fishermen get for their work.  They were not able to obtain a market.  Supplies exceeded the demand and the result was they had no return.  The Parliamentary Secretary has paid two visits to West Cork.  We hope to see him again.  We will give him a hearty welcome.  We like to see a man come into a district when we know that he will leave some impression behind him.  He has done very good work in Schull and Castletownbere. Perhaps it is not out of place to invite him now to Bantry, Baltimore and some other areas.  If he accepts that invitation he can rest assured that he will get a hearty welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to intervene briefly in the debate on this Vote which is, as the House knows, of the utmost importance to thousands of our inshore fishermen scattered around our rocky coasts, a class of people who, at the best of times, eke out a very precarious existence and a class of people for whom this House should have every consideration and to whom they should, at all times, be prepared to afford the protection they certainly need if they are to continue in their old way of life in that part of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise chiefly to express our surprise and our resentment with the Minister for Agriculture and the Department generally at the recent action they took in revoking a bylaw that had been in existence since June, 1908, a bylaw that afforded a certain amount of protection to our inshore fishermen between Bloody Foreland Point and Dawros Point in North-West Donegal. The House will remember that last year we had a certain amount of trouble in the North-West of Donegal due to the fact that the inshore fishing grounds, that were for centuries the <Col N="1290" /> preserves of the inshore fishermen there, had been entered upon by these up-to-date trawlers equipped with all the modern devices.</P>
    <P>The local fishermen, the inshore fishermen, resented this intrustion and a breach of the peace occurred.  Later on the inshore fishermen were, in the District Court, fined a sum of £50 and had to apologise for their attacks on these trawlers, trawlers which had entered their fishing grounds.  We were surprised, too, that on that occasion the owners of the trawlers, which were responsible in the first instance for the breach of the peace by breaking the laws of the country and by breaking this particular bylaw, were not prosecuted. It seems strange to us that fishermen who were defending their rights, just as any body of workers would defend their rights in factory or elsewhere, should be penalised and that those who were responsible for the trouble and responsible, I might say, for the attack upon themselves, were not prosecuted.  That, in my opinion, is an amazing situation in this country.  Nevertheless, the inshore fishermen were, as I said, fined and had to apologise for their action on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I intervene in this debate to express to the Minister, to the Parliamentary Secretary and to his Department our resentment and our surprise that after the inquiry that had been set up following these disturbances, he should have revoked that bylaw.  We maintain that, on the evidence of the fishermen and on the very strong points put forward, the decision should have been otherwise.  The position now is that the inshore fishing grounds are thrown open to these large trawlers and the result will be that in a few years the inshore fishermen as we know them now will have disappeared from that part of the country.</P>
    <P>In the Gaeltacht and congested areas we have, as has often been pointed out in this House, very few industries. This is one industry that has been the backbone of the people there all down the years and it is a surprising thing that an Irish Minister of State, a Minister for Agriculture, should, in the year 1956, with the recent census <Col N="1291" /> figures and the recent figures of depopulation in that particular area before him, revoke a bylaw that has certainly held the people there and made it possible for them to live in the congested areas and follow their old industry, the fishing industry.  The revocation of this bylaw will mean more unemployment and more emigration from a part of the country that has suffered more than any other that I know of and it will mean the closing-down of scores of houses on our islands and on the mainland.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows and the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are as well aware of this as I am, that the inshore fishermen with their smaller type of boat cannot compete with the up-to-date craft in operation in these waters to-day.  As I have already said, it will eventually mean the end of inshore fishing as we know it.  It is significant that, in opening the debate here to-day, the Parliamentary Secretary went to some trouble to explain just what inshore fishing means.  We always felt that inshore fishing meant fishing near the shore but the Parliamentary Secretary in his opening statement wants us to imagine that inshore fishing does not mean that at all but means fishing well outside the islands and a good distance from the mainland, or a mixture of both.  To our mind in the Gaeltacht, inshore fishing means the type of fishing that has been carried on by the smaller boats for many years.  The fishermen resent this decision because eventually it will have a harrowing effect on the way of life of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of our people along that coast.  I am expressing to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary just what they feel in regard to this recent decision.</P>
    <P>It has often been said in that part of the country that if trawlers are allowed into inshore waters to ring herring it will eventually mean the breaking-up of the shoals and the destruction of the spawning beds and that, after two or three years of the intensive type of fishing we may expect from these trawlers, herring will abandon that part of our shore altogether. <Col N="1292" /> In support of that statement it is pointed out that on various parts of the Donegal coast where this intensive trawling has been permitted, herring have completely disappeared and it is feared that in a few years the same position will have occurred between the points I have already mentioned&mdash;Bloody Foreland Point and Dawros Head in the extreme North-West. This decision will also affect Inver Bay and Donegal Bay.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that last year several meetings were held of the fishermen in the Donegal area to protest against this inshore fishing.  I hope that, even at this late stage, something will be done to protect the way of life of these people.  We are surprised that the Minister for Agriculture should come to this decision because on various occasions in this House he has expressed a completely different opinion. In introducing this Estimate on the 15th July, 1948, as reported at column 634 of the Official Report, Volume 112, the Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will not let anyone start a big commercial trawling company based on this country because I believe it would destroy the livelihood of the inshore fishermen...  It is the policy of the Department to have no trawling company in competition with the inshore fishermen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that statement I agree entirely. In introducing his Estimate to-day, I think the Parliamentary Secretary said something on similar lines.  It is too bad then that, if that is the policy of the Department, they should do something entirely different in that particular part of Donegal.</P>
    <P>So far as the herring industry in North-West Donegal is concerned, the position will be that the trawlers will certainly land very big catches of herring. The inshore fishermen will come along with their 20 or 30 crans in each boat only to find that the market is glutted and that the only outlet they can have for their fish is the fishmeal factory.  It is unfortunate, too, that the price in the fishmeal factory is so low that it would not be economic for the inshore fishermen to continue that type of fishing and to supply that type <Col N="1293" /> of market.  Last year, the trawlers landed considerable quantities of herring. It seemed that they got special priority because their fish was shipped in lorries waiting on the pier to the Dublin market.  However, when the inshore fishermen came along they were informed that the only outlet for their catches would be the fishmeal factory.  That is another pointer to what the smaller craft and the smaller man can expect in the years to come following this decision by the Minister. I feel the Minister should, in order to protect that part of the Gaeltacht and the people there, ensure that these larger boats are kept out of the preserves of the smaller man.  Otherwise, in a few short years, the question of the inshore fishermen as we know it, will not arise in this House at all.  It has been agreed on all sides of the House that every possible help should be given to that part of the country but I am very sorry to see that, at this day and age, steps are being taken to make the position more difficult there than it has ever been before.</P>
    <P>We have often heard mention here of the Congested Districts Board and of the good work they did for the fishing industry in Donegal and elsewhere. The secretary, Mr. Micks, in writing about the fishing industry in Donegal in 1925 mentioned that the Donegal fishermen were in danger from the larger boats worked by Scotsmen.  He pointed out that if these boats were permitted to continue fishing in the inshore waters, it would mean the end of that particular type of fishing in Donegal.  His report stated that it was impossible for the smaller boats to compete with the fast steam drifters, over 200 of which visited Donegal at one time.  &ldquo;The bitter disappointment,&rdquo; he goes on to say, &ldquo;of Donegal fishermen at having to compete with this type of vessel is not too difficult to realise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would say that the inshore fishermen to-day face similar difficulties and that the livelihood of families on that coast is in the melting-pot.  It is indeed small consolation to be informed that, at the present day, trawlers are registered by the State and are allowed to fish at the very doorsteps of the inshore <Col N="1294" /> fishermen.  In a year or two, I take it, the Parliamentary Secretary as a result of this policy will be able to point out to us the increased landings of herring on our coast but if the increased landings of herring is brought about, as I am afraid it will be, by increased unemployment and emigration and the further depopulation of our undeveloped areas, I feel it is too high a price to pay for these increased herring exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a saying at one time that &ldquo;you first catch your fish&rdquo; but I do not think that is correct. Like many of the other old tags it does not work out.  The whole business is to sell your fish first.  If you catch your fish and have no market for it you can do nothing with it but if you have a market for the fish you will make it your business to catch it.  I think, therefore, the whole industry should revolve round concentration on the development of our home market which has been totally neglected.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have mentioned that there should be centres in the various towns for the distribution of fish.  I would again draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to something that I have been told about, a system that is worked in this country in all the country towns in regard to ice-cream.  We have ice-cream cabinets in the shops in these rural towns and the ice-cream can be sent down, held there for several days, and sold there. I think if we had small cabinets in a chain of shops throughout the country they could be supplied by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or by private enterprise with refrigerated fish for retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the line of country traversed by the Parliamentary Secretary and in all the speeches made in this House on this Estimate, but I got the idea at one time that the whole of the East coast and the SouthEast coast of Ireland had eroded and that the fishing ports and fishing boats no longer existed there.  It is, of course, up to each Deputy to fight his corner for his own constituency.  I took some notes of what the Parliamentary Secretary said and we find that 12 boats were made available this year and <Col N="1295" /> that 15 were made available last year. In my constituency, we have Dunmore and Duncannon at the estuary of the River Suir; we have Passage East, Cheekpoint, Helvic and Ardmore.  Ardmore and Helvic are Gaeltacht areas and yet no provision is made to give them boats.  There is no mention of a boat this year for Helvic.  I have heard Deputies here asking that piers be built in various wild portions of the coast and then asking for boats to be supplied to people to fish there; others complain about piers that have been built and boats that have been supplied and say that the fish cannot be sold or that the prices are not good enough.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record here that we have a pier at Dunmore at which anything can be anchored, either large or small trawlers.  We have good shelter, good anchorage and good discharging facilities.  Enormous catches were made there last year and they were dealt with.  It was a Press scare that stopped this because two or three large boats were held up one evening, but no fish went astray.  All the fish was sold and marketed, thanks to a good agent of Bord Iascaigh Mhara down there and thanks to private enterprise and private buyers.  When you have a port such as that, it should get some recognition.  Yet what do we get?</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to any other schemes that are being carried out. Oysters are being developed in Galway Bay, something else at Ballyshannon and Letterkenny, ice for freezing plants at Castletown, Schull, Cahirciveen, Killybegs; a big fish processing station in Galway and a fishmeal factory for Killybegs.  I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that Dunmore East is still within this State; we have not seceded.  I come from a very highly-rated constituency and we pay more than our share of taxes and I think we should get a little of the handouts.  Up to now we have got none.  I have noticed here that the Deputies from constituencies that have got handouts, while they have expressed gratitude for them, have, like Oliver Twist, asked for more. Therefore, I feel that the Parliamentary <Col N="1296" /> Secretary will not take it amiss from me if I ask for something for a start.</P>
    <P>Many speeches are made here calling on the Government to do something or asking the Minister to do something but nobody will say definitely to the Minister what should be done.  In the matter of fisheries, I think there should be a little more local initiative. I would again like to mention to the Parliamentary Secretary that in my area people have come together to put up money, to form a company to establish a fish cannery, an ice plant and fishery plant.  They are prepared to put up a good deal of money and I am sure they will get reasonable assistance. That is all they ask from the Department.</P>
    <P>As regards a market for our fish, the drive to get people to eat more fish started last year to a chorus of sneers from many people.  I think the whole House should be behind this in every way&mdash;that if the Department's drive to eat more fish is proceeded with Deputies in the midland towns will do everything possible to help that drive.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Breslin complain that because they got those big trawlers in Donegal the inshore fishermen will be driven out. I wish we had a complaint like that in West Cork; I wish we got one of these big boats because we would not have any difficulty in finding navigators in any of the places I mention.  The fishermen there are the type who go away and sail the seven seas but like to come back afterwards.  Some of them do a bit of farming but most of them would prefer to take up fishing as a whole-time occupation.  Any of them who came back with a bit of money set themselves up in the fishing industry although they had no State aid to get. Those are the people who should be helped by the State.  I would ask that the present year's programme be amended so that some of these boats could be allotted to my constituency, especially to the Port of Helvic.  Some people come in here and give enormous lip service to the revival of Irish. Helvic is beside Ring and yet suffers more neglect than any other port in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> To conclude, I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the drive he has put into his Department. I know he desires to make a success of it and I know he will not take it amiss of me to bring these matters to his notice.  I hope he will do something about the Port of Helvic in particular. It is in the Gaeltacht area and should be included in his programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a place known as County Dublin.  I heard great compliments being paid to him by a Deputy representing West Cork.  I am sorry I cannot join in those compliments.  We have harbours in North Dublin with very enterprising fishermen in them and while they have succeeded in getting their own boats, they suffer very greatly from silting sands and from lack of accommodation for their boats. Organisations like the Board of Works, the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the Dublin County Council have cleaned those harbours but I think these harbours should be the responsibility of this Department.</P>
      <P>I rose to make a few points on the fishing industry generally, but I should like to say also that I might as well be outside the House as trying to stress the urgent necessity of improving the harbours in North County Dublin.  We have Balbriggan which is becoming silted up.  It is cleaned now and again by the Port and Docks Board.  We have Skerries, which is too small to accommodate the boats.  Then we have Loughshinny where the harbour was repaired last year by the Dublin County Council.  That port is silting up very often and fishermen can come in there only at full tide.  For three months of the year, the Loughshinny fishermen have to leave their homes and bring their boats four or five miles down the coast to Skerries.  That is completely inconvenient for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say to the Parliamentary Secretary, as I said to his predecessor, that the sooner we make these harbours the responsibility of his Department, the sooner we will get something done for them and the sooner <Col N="1298" /> we will improve the industry for those engaged in it.  The harbours are in the care of different bodies and thus nothing is being done about them and the fishermen are consequently suffering. The way the fishermen in North County Dublin are treated is really a disgrace.  If a coal boat comes into Skerries, the fishing boats must get out of the way because the coal boat has the priority.  Discussions are taking place at the moment between the fishermen of Skerries and Loughshinny, in order to get some agreement as to which harbour should be improved.  It is not my business to give a decision one way or another, although I have attended some of these meetings.  In 1948, I was told by the present Minister for Agriculture that there was a lot of money available for the improvement of these harbours.  Then there was a change of Government and the same thing applied to my own Party.  It is the same all over now again, but nothing is being done to improve the harbours.</P>
    <P>We have heard complaints from some Deputies that there is a danger of certain fishing grounds in Donegal being destroyed for the inshore fishermen. We have also complaints from North County Dublin that fish have become very scare in the normal fishing grounds.  The ringing that has gone on there over a long number of years has eliminated a lot of the smaller fish and did not give them a chance to mature. I hope that will not continue.  The only answer to that problem is that we should get larger boats and better harbours and send our fishermen further to sea so that they can improve their lot.  If the inshore fisherman is not to get a return for his labour he will not carry on.</P>
    <P>An old and hackneyed question we have often discussed here is the possibility of sending good fresh fish to our inland towns.  This discussion has gone on in the Dáil since I came into it and for years before I came into it.  Yet we have not made any headway or obtained the improvement in our fishing industry that would enable us to send good fish, handled in a proper way, to our inland towns.  It is not necessary to say anything more on <Col N="1299" /> that as so much has been said over the years.</P>
    <P>One thing that I am rather surprised at is that the Department of Fisheries have not got a cold storage plant themselves. I know that there is a number of private cold storage plants for fish in Dublin but I feel that, if there is a slump on the market, the State should have cold storage plant to deal with the extra glut of fish, so as to be able to supply the market when fish becomes scarce.  It may be said that there is a number of private plants but I am only asking the question.  Such a plant, owned by the State, would be very useful along the north coast or even if it was situated in the centre of Dublin itself.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with that particular point when he is replying later on.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal about the canning factory some time ago and I would like to know what has happened to it.  I also feel that we ought to have succeeded in improving our fishmeal industry.  I do feel that what is responsible for the decline in the fishing industry is the scarcity of grants for boats.  We hear of 12 boats being provided in the coming year and 15 boats being provided last year but that is not much encouragement for what is alleged to be a national industry.  We will not get anywhere if we continue to handle the matter in the way we are doing at the moment.  If you had the greatest wizards of all time in the Department, and I must pay tribute to the gentlemen there for the fine job they are doing, you could not get anywhere with the facilities provided at the moment.</P>
    <P>This country is an island with abundant fisheries and yet we can make only a few hundred thousand pounds out of the fishing industry every year. Our fishing industry is being handled in a haphazard manner.  A great deal more could be done if sufficient money were put into the industry to improve it.</P>
    <P>I understand that next week there will be some national propaganda to get people to eat more fish.  I wish that national propaganda all possible success but we have a long way to go <Col N="1300" /> in our efforts to improve the industry. It should be possible to organise propaganda to convince our people that it is essential that they should eat fish twice a week instead of eating it reluctantly once a week, as at present.  We will have to get the fish served up properly.  It will have to be fresh and not presented, as it sometimes is, in a very bad condition.  The result of presenting it in that condition is that the people prefer to do without it until such time as they can get it in good condition.</P>
    <P>Talking and boasting about what we intend to do is no good.  We will have to, first of all, give the example by our own efficiency in handling the matter before we can encourage our people to eat fish.  We will have to give the fish to the people at a reasonable price, in good condition, and we will have to give it to them regularly. Unless we have machinery at our disposal to do that, all our efforts will be of no use.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a matter which I have already taken up personally with the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have been told that there is a family in Howth that purchased a boat which had already been bought and sold by another fisherman.  I was told that the engine of this boat was in very bad condition.  The party who bought the boat in Howth allege that the engine was very bad, that they had to pay a great deal of money for it, and that the boat was then so bad and they were losing so much money on it that they had to give up making their payments. The result was that, after protracted negotiations with the Parliamentary Secretary and with the manager of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the boat was taken from these people.  I must pay the Parliamentary Secretary and the board the credit that they gave every opportunity to the party concerned.  I do not raise the question to attack anybody but to say that, in fairness to the people who bought that boat, if it is a fact that it was in such a bad state, they should be compensated or get some of their money back.</P>
    <P>We have to be just to the individual if we are to carry on in an honourable way.  People in this House must consider the individual as much <Col N="1301" /> as we consider the community as a whole.  An injustice to the individual is, in my estimation, an injustice to the community.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary should go further into this matter with his able advisers and if it is discovered that an injustice has been done, with the result that this unfortunate person loses £700, £800 or £1,000 which he can ill afford, the State should bear that loss rather than the individual.  If faulty workmanship or any other such cause is responsible, these things should be taken into consideration.  If the Parliamentary Secretary, having gone into this matter, feels that there is justice in the case I am making and that this fisherman has been treated unfairly, I believe this Parliament should do justice and that the Parliamentary Secretary should do all in his power to see that justice is done.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has any further comment to make on this question afterwards, I would be grateful to hear it.</P>
    <P>Another request I would make to the Parliamentary Secretary is that in the coming year he would do something about the harbour improvement.  I do not know whether this Dáil intended to make the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for all the harbours but I am fed up referring to this question year in and year out since I came here and finding that I might as well be at home.  No results are being achieved. I cannot blame the people I have the honour to represent if they say: &ldquo;This fellow is only talking.&rdquo;  I do not know what is the cause but in North County Dublin the harbours to which I have referred are in a very bad way and I want something done about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have spoken already, I feel that it is nothing short of a tragedy that the fishing industry has been neglected for so many years.  If it got the attention it merited, I believe the fishing industry would be almost equal, if not entirely equal, to agriculture as an industry in Ireland.  This industry has been neglected by successive Governments who failed to make adequate financial provision to put this industry <Col N="1302" /> on a sound footing.  It is one of the reasons, in my opinion, why so many people have left the rural areas, why the population has decreased so much. It is a tragic state of affairs and it will be very difficult in the time that lies ahead to pull the situation out of the fire.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to concede that the present Parliamentary Secretary is enthusiastic, as his predecessor, Deputy Bartley, was in his time, but despite their best efforts, we have not got the progress we would like to have had.  In my part of the country, at any rate, we do not see any extraordinary results accruing.  Speaking on a problem of this kind, I hate to introduce parish pump affairs, to bring the question down to county level, but in North Mayo, a very serious position exists.  In olden times, in the days of British rule, it was very easy to procure fish in my part of the country.  In spite of all the talk and all the alleged effort, we find it most difficult now to procure fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one occasion some years ago the Parliamentary Secretary visited Mayo in connection with the fishing industry. I have been told that he carried out inspections of piers and slips in various parts of my constituency.  He promised the people then that he would do his best to relieve the plight of the fishermen. Some little effort has been made at one or two centres, for instance, at Achill and Porturlin, but that is really only nibbling at the problem.  We will not put the fishing industry back on its feet by dealing with the problem in that way.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had plenty of money in his Department, there is much useful work he could do, even at this late hour, but that money is not forthcoming. Many of our people for generations along the western seaboard, have engaged in this work, in this precarious existence, as Deputy Breslin put it. They were obliged to do so because their holdings were uneconomic, but they did it as a part-time job.  Due to the fact that their boats were not suitable, having regard to present-day standards and requirements, and due to the neglect of piers and slips, they were forced out of the business.  They <Col N="1303" /> have now left and gone to England and America and the majority have no intention of ever coming back.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary, as I told his predecessor, that the first essential is to get more money into this Fisheries Branch and to spend more money in the areas in which it is most needed, the areas in which the small and uneconomic holders require it as a supplement to their meagre incomes.  There are some people still with us who are traditionally skilled in this work.  Even these, as Deputy P.J. Burke said, are losing confidence in this House and confidence in successive Governments, because they feel they are in no way sincere about helping them.  Engineers have gone down to these areas. Officials have visited the people from time to time.  They have heard their grievances and, in 99 cases out of 100, nothing is ever done.  It is no wonder the people are losing heart.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to do something to remedy the present situation, particularly the situation in Mayo, Donegal, certain parts of Galway and other counties on the west coast.  It is in these areas that we have the old Gaelic-speaking people.  It is from these areas in the main that the people are emigrating and flying from the land.  It is difficult to solve this problem when the money is not provided.  The Parliamentary Secretary should try to impress upon the Minister for Finance the necessity for making more money available in an effort to put the industry, even at this late hour, on its feet.</P>
    <P>There is another very important aspect of the fishing industry to which sufficient consideration has not been given.  I refer to the problem of marketing fish.  Quite a number of people are still under the wholly erroneous impression that even at the present time one can hand out anything to the consumer.  The day when that could be done has long since passed.  People have become very selective and very particular about what they eat.  I think that applies more in this country than it does in any other country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> Often when one travels around the country and goes into an hotel or café and asks for a particular kind of fish, almost invariably one is told that that particular kind of fish is not available, that they have only got such-and-such. One has to put up with whatever the management cares to offer one.  I have referred to the question of quality.  I am strongly in favour of fish being handled as carefully as possible and marketed under the best possible conditions in order to encourage our people to eat more fish.  In the past, fish was handled in a very slovenly way and, from that point of view, it is no wonder that our people have got out of the habit of eating fish and that the market is practically dead.</P>
    <P>The home market to-day is highly competitive.  Foodstuffs, hygienically packed and attractively presented, are offered to our people in ever-increasing quantities.  Unfortunately, that is not true of the fish which is offered for sale.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take steps to ensure that fish is marketed under the most hygienic conditions.  He will have to devise some means, and that at no far distant date, of making fish available in towns such as Foxford, Crossmolina, Westport and Enniscrone.  Enniscrone was at one time a fishing town.  Now it is impossible to get fish there.  It would look as if the delivery side of the business is falling down in some way.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch suggested that there should be an agent representative of a delivery service resident in every town.  I think such a system is capable of development and if An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which was set up for the purpose of helping to market fish, would undertake that work and check on the towns which are still unable to get supplies, that would go a long way towards enlarging the potential market.  We heard a good deal of talk in the course of this debate about surplus fish with no market readily available to absorb that surplus.  I think it is a pity that no market is available.</P>
    <P>Apropos of catches, the fishermen should be paid immediately for their fish.  There is a good deal of protection <Col N="1305" /> accorded now to people engaged in industry of one kind or another, particularly industry under the roof. There are stipulated hours but, so far as the fishermen are concerned, they have to work all hours and face all kinds of weather.  Yet, when it comes to being paid for their catch, their guess is as good as anybody else's as to what they will get or whether they will be paid at all.  Sometimes they may have to dump quantities of fish back into the sea.</P>
    <P>I do not think fish should ever be returned to the sea.  There are plenty of ways in which it could be utilised. It could be given free of charge to the poorer sections of our community. Remember, it is landed at quite a lot of expense and very often at the risk of life.  We have thousands of poor people here in this City of Dublin who would be glad to get that fish.  We have thousands of deserving cases throughout the country, such as widows with large families, trying to eke out an existence.  There are thousands of people maintained at high cost to the ratepayers and the taxpayers in hospitals and sanatoria because of undernourishment and lack of food.  Fish is a magnificent food, a healthy food.  Yet, it is very often thrown back into the sea.  There is something intrinsically wrong in such a situation.  Indeed, it is wrong that Deputies should have to come in here, in 1956, and admit that that has happened. I do not think it has happened to any great extent in my own constituency; but my view is that it should not happen at all anywhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy referred to fish being caught off West Cork and transported to Dublin.  He said that in some instances that fish is sent back again to inland towns, perhaps 100 or 150 miles overland, with all the overheads and all the extra charges involved. That is a fantastic situation. I hope it does not exist in any big way in the country at the present time.  I am aware that such a situation existed up to a year ago even in our part of the country.  I have not heard much of it in recent times but, if it is still going on, it is time the Parliamentary Secretary took some steps to put an end to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> On the question of the sale of fish, I have been told that some monopolies are in operation in this country.  I have been told that private individuals engage in this business and, because they are the only buyers of fish in the area, are in a position to make their own price.  They take advantage of the situation.  I am satisfied from information supplied to me that that has happened in certain instances.  If we had anything in the nature of guaranteed markets for fish, people would be protected from such racketeers.  The Parliamentary Secretary should see to it that there will be no exploitation of such people.  I can well understand that, human nature being what it is, you will always find people in our community who are prepared to take advantage of any situation in order to fill their own pockets with money. However, I suggest such a situation has very detrimental effects on an industry.</P>
    <P>I referred to the visit of the Parliamentary Secretary to our county.  I should like if, instead of going to West Cork a third time&mdash;which, according to Deputy Murphy, is his intention&mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary would pay a second visit to my constituency and see what progress, if any, has been made there since his last visit.  If progress has been made in my part of North Mayo, I have not seen much evidence of it.  If money has been spent on the development of piers or slips there, I have not seen a lot of evidence of it or heard about it. Indeed, I have heard very little about the activities of this Department in my part of the country at all.  I am now taking this opportunity on this Vote to invite the Parliamentary Secretary down again, to see the position as it exists there.  I would also ask him to bring some of the benefits to my part of the country that he was in a position to bring to some other parts of the country because in our part such benefits are most needed as there has been much neglect there all down the years.  From my knowledge of the country, there are very few places where there has been so much neglect as in North Mayo.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Breslin speak in a critical way to-day about certain <Col N="1307" /> activities of the Fisheries Branch and I must say I was surprised because I think Donegal is one county that has benefited in quite a big way from the fishing industry.  Perhaps there is a lot more to be done, and I am sure there is, in Donegal.  We cannot blame any Deputy for making a case for his constituency.  It is eight or ten years since I first visited Killybegs and saw the activities of the fishermen there.  I was proud to see that that particular town was a hive of industry.  There was money in the pockets of the fishermen and of the business men and things were progressing because an industry was being built up there.  I should like to see more of that type of activity in my part of the country.</P>
    <P>Fishing activity exists only in a small way in two or three centres at the present time.  Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give special consideration to North Mayo where scores of families have locked their doors and gone away to England or America.  Many of their thatched cabins are now in ruins.  The majority of the people of Achill migrate for the greater part of the year.  It is a sea-fishing district.  Due to neglect by successive Governments, the majority of the people there lost heart and went to foreign countries where they were sure of a steady income and where the hazards and the risks were not so great.  I have often said before that surely the descendants of people who stood by our Irish language, by our Irish culture and, above all, by the Catholic faith for hundreds and hundreds of years are entitled to better treatment from a native Government than that which they have so far received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would make a similar speech at the Mayo County Council, it might be extremely helpful to us because that county council is the most difficult county council so far as slips and improvements are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to admit the truth at any time.  That situation appears to exist.  We do not <Col N="1308" /> hear much about it at Mayo County Council meetings but I have noticed that our engineering staff in Mayo are reluctant to undertake maintenance work and to guarantee that they will undertake maintenance work, provided the Department come along and help us out in the matter of building-up or improving piers.  I have seen the county engineer's and the staff's point of view but, to an extent, something like that is hampering progress.  We are dealing with human beings.  If the Parliamentary Secretary tells me here, in his official capacity as head of this Department, that he is not getting cooperation from the county council in this matter then I should be very glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would furnish me with specific instances of this kind.</P>
      <P>Believe me, I can be fairly firm in my stand in matters of this kind and nobody knows that better than the county surveyor in Mayo.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would bring the matter to my notice at any time when work of this nature is being held up or impeded by members of the Mayo County Council staff I should be very glad to give him any help and assistance I can.  Perhaps it is a very good thing that he has mentioned it here. At least it proves that he is interested in what is happening in Mayo when he can tell a Mayoman that that lack of co-operation is there.  I regret it is there.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that, if he tells me that a lot of trouble is there, I will go back to Mayo and try to give them a shaking up.  Then we could come back to the Parliamentary Secretary and be glad of his assistance in that connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>West Cork, I take it. He has paid only one visit to South Kerry.  I heard Deputy O'Hara requesting him to make a second visit to Mayo, but I believe he paid his first visit to South Kerry before he paid a <Col N="1309" /> visit to Mayo so that it would only be right now that South Kerry's turn would come before that of Mayo.  Perhaps, too, the Parliamentary Secretary has some happy memories of his visit to my constituency.  On that occasion we had great hopes of things to come because of the very important statement which he made at Cahirciveen when he was able to say that he had the authority of the Taoiseach to state that a sum of £80,000&mdash;I think it was&mdash; would be allocated for fishing boats of a large type for the Gaeltacht areas&mdash; I do not know whether it was for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>That was nearly two years ago, and the Parliamentary Secretary has informed us that last year 15 boats were allocated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I am not sure whether he stated these were boats of the smaller type or the larger type, but anyhow, none of them came to my constituency. I can only express the hope, therefore, that this year, when 12 boats will be allocated, we shall fare better.  I know that applicants from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht are still awaiting the allocation of these 50 ft., or even 65 ft. boats.  We shall expect at least two this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Murphy refer to poaching.  I remember distinctly the very emphatic pronouncement that was made by the Parliamentary Secretary when introducing his Estimate last year when he vigorously denounced poaching and said that nobody convicted of that offence would receive any help from him.  I would like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary now that there are two types of poaching. There is the type where a man may get a salmon out of the river by means of a strokehaul or some other illegal instrument.  I would not be so much opposed to that or I would not be so hard on anyone caught at that because anyone going along a river, seeing a salmon and being in a position to bring him out would be just lucky to get away with it.  Actually I was born and reared and lived for a long time near the river banks of a very good fishing river and I do not know why it was that I never attempted to pick out a fish.  Perhaps it was a kind of fear instilled into us at the time when the landlords had full control of the <Col N="1310" /> fishing rights.  The remarkable thing is that up to the present, in most areas of my constituency so far as I know, it is the landlords or their descendants or agents who still control river fishing and fishing in the river estuary.</P>
    <P>I know it would require legislation to take over these fishing rights or nationalise such fishing.  These fisheries could be run by the State, or the State could get full control of them and then hand them over to some private enterprise, to people who would be willing to take over the fishing rights on lease, for instance.  I am afraid I am out of order, because I am speaking of things that require legislation, but I shall refer to the matter only very briefly. I am not suggesting that the Government should acquire them without compensation.  The difficulty there I am sure is that it would cost an immense sum of money.</P>

      <P>I hope, as time goes on, and when the financial position becomes such that we can undertake that vast enterprise the Department will eventually acquire them and place them at the disposal of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>The other type of poaching to which I have referred is poisoning a river, a most disgusting and despicable act, because not only are the ordinary fish destroyed but the fry are also destroyed, as is the whole fishing industry in that particular river for years ahead.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that in that case he can be quite sure he will have the approval of all decent people in dealing severely with that type of poaching.  It is not so prevalent now as it once was but it still takes place and the reason given, of course, is that &ldquo;the foreigners own the fish and why should we not do it?&rdquo; If people really only knew I would imagine that the consumption of such fish is dangerous in a sense, or it should be.  Even more despicable still is poaching of salmon during the close season, or poisoning rivers during the close season, because as everyone knows in that particular period salmon are dangerous to eat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that on the whole question <Col N="1311" /> of fishing we must look at it from three or four viewpoints.  First of all, you have to catch the fish, you have to land the fish and you have to distribute or market the fish.  Perhaps I would go a little bit further and include the method of cooking the fish <Col N="1312" /> so that in this country people would be more inclined to buy it and use it.</P>
