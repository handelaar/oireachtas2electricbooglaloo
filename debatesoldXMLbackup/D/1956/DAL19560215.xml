      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of any foreign interests intending to investigate the presence of oil deposits in West Clare, and, if so, if he will give particulars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any foreign interests intend to undertake a special investigation for oil deposits in West Clare but a tentative approach has been made by a foreign group who have indicated that, at a later stage, they might seek prospecting licences for oil and natural gas in some parts of the country.  Any such application, if received, will be considered having regard to the provisions of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, and other relevant circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether a survey has been made to investigate the possibility of the existence of oil deposits in West Clare and, if so, with what result; if not, whether it is proposed to arrange for such a survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of locating oil deposits in the West Clare area was investigated by the Geological Survey in 1955.  The results of this investigation, which are available for inspection by interested parties, would not warrant the carrying out, at State <Col N="336" /> expense, of a special survey for oil in West Clare.</P>
      <P>The undertaking of any further examinations for oil in West Clare, and in other parts of the country, is a matter for private enterprise and I would be prepared to grant any necessary facilities under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, in relation to such examinations to persons or groups who can satisfy the customary conditions as to financial and technical resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether inquiries into the possibility of establishing a newsprint industry in this country have been completed, and, if so, with what result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Inquiries which the Industrial Development Authority have made indicate that there are reasonable prospects that a newsprint industry could be successfully established in this country, provided that sufficient and suitable supplies of native timber were available for the manufacture of mechanical woodpulp.</P>
      <P>The authority is actively pursuing the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that an Irish paper company recently announced its intention to establish an industry to cater for the newsprint needs of the country should experiments which it is conducting into the pulping of Irish timber be successful, and should the timber required be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the present position concerning the proposed industry at Greenore; further, whether if the firm's plans do not <Col N="338" /> materialise, he will ensure that the amenities of Greenore, which include a deep-water port and suitable buildings essential for the export of goods, will be brought to the attention of any industrialists, foreign or native, who are seeking such facilities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy's question about the proposed industry at Greenore relates to the intentions of a private commercial concern, I am not in a position to furnish the information requested.</P>
      <P>The special facilities available at Greenore are on record in my Department and in the Industrial Development Authority, and were on a number of occasions brought to the notice of groups proposing to set up industries, whenever it seemed likely that these facilities would be attractive to them. The Deputy will realise, of course, that the claims of other areas with facilities to offer are also brought to the notice of industrial promoters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. T. Lynch</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the unsatisfactory conditions prevailing during the tourist season on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route, he will consider the advisability of recommending to Bord Fáilte Éireann, C.I.E., British <Col N="339" /> Railways and the Cork Steampacket Company that attention be drawn by advertising to the alternative routes most suitable for persons travelling from the south of England to the south of Ireland, viz. Fishguard to Rosslare, Fishguard to Waterford and Fishguard to Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The interests concerned are already alive to the possibility of relieving pressure on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire services during the tourist season by greater use of the other routes.  Peak travel periods tend to coincide on all the routes but, nevertheless, British Railways are examining the possibility of influencing travellers to southern counties to use the Fishguard services to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>The advertising of particular services to and from this country is, of course, a matter entirely for the shipping companies concerned.  I am aware that the cross-Channel shipping companies jointly issue a brochure, with map, which gives particulars of all the cross-Channel services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (1) who is (a) immediately and (b) ultimately responsible for ensuring that an adequate supply of turf will be made available for the new power station at Screebe, County Galway, (2) when and how the persons or bodies concerned were informed that this responsibility was being placed on them, (3) whether those responsible for ensuring the supply of turf have full authority to take whatever steps they may consider necessary towards that end, and, if not, what limitations have been placed on their authority, and what is the purpose of these limitations, (4) what response has been obtained by the E.S.B. to the advertisements issued in April, 1955, inviting tenders for the supply of turf, and (5) what further action has been taken by the E.S.B. towards the securing of an adequate turf supply for the station since his reply of 26th October, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the <Col N="340" /> Deputy to the terms of the official announcement which was issued on 7th February, 1953, in which it was stated that the Screebe station, when established, would require a minimum quantity of 30,000 tons of turf per annum and would thus provide an assured market for turf surplus to local needs which was produced in the area.  There has been no change in the position since then.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the four small generating stations (including Screebe) was to ensure a market for surplus hand-won turf in the station areas and it was recognised that one or more of the stations might not be in operation in a particular year or years if such a surplus were not available because of weather conditions or because of the existence of a ready alternative market for hand-won turf. Accordingly the provision of supplies for the station is primarily a matter for the producers in the area in conjunction with the E.S.B. and no limitations have been placed on either party.</P>
      <P>In response to the advertisements issued by the board in April, 1955, a total of 1,500 tons of turf was offered but these offers were subsequently withdrawn.  Since then an offer of 300 tons for delivery during March, 1956, has been received by the board.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that posters inviting offers of surplus hand-won turf are at present being prepared for display before this year's cutting season begins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. T.F. O'Higgins) (for the Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the school-going children residing in the townland of Ross, Killala, County Mayo, have to endure serious hardships in order to attend school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before a State grant could be made <Col N="341" /> towards the cost of a school transport service, there should be a sufficient number of children available for conveyance to school to ensure that the daily average number of eligible children conveyed each quarter would reach at least ten.  In order to be eligible for conveyance to school by a transport service, a child should be between six and ten years of age and reside not less than two miles from the nearest suitable national school, or be between ten and 14 years of age and reside not less than three miles from such a school.</P>
    <P>All arrangements for the operation of a transport service are made between the manager of the school and the local interested parties.  If it is proposed to make application for the provision of a transport service for the conveyance of the Ross children to schools in Killala particulars of the children concerned should be furnished through the manager of the schools.  On receipt of these particulars, I will arrange to have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a previous question an increasingly heavy programme of school building, enlargement and improvement is in process of being carried out, and because of the amount of work involved in connection therewith and of the pressure on the architectural staff of the Commissioners of Public Works there is inevitably considerable delay in completing the arrangements which have to be made by the commissioners in the many cases in which grants have been sanctioned by my Department, in order to enable contracts to be placed.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service Regulation Acts apply to all the appointments referred to by the Deputy save as otherwise provided by law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory condition to which the Deputy refers is designed to confine payment of unemployment benefit to persons who mainly engage in work of a kind which is insurable against unemployment and in respect of which insurance contributions at the full rate are payable.  Domestic service is not employment of that category and the provision does not appear to be unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that under the present system a woman, who works as a domestic servant for 20 weeks in the year and signs for the remainder, can draw unemployment benefit for the rest of that year, while the woman who works for 20 weeks at non-domestic employment and 26 weeks at domestic work cannot draw for the other six weeks &mdash; cannot draw at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as the Deputy states it, is not entirely correct. There are other means by which the person the Deputy has in mind can qualify for the payment of unemployment benefits.  There are three ways in which she could qualify even though she has a smaller number of domestic <Col N="355" /> stamps in any one year.  If, say, an insured woman applied for unemployment benefit this year, and on her contributions she had a lesser number of full cost stamps, she could then turn to the two years previous, and if in the two years previous half the number of contributions she had paid were at the full rate she could qualify for the payment of unemployment benefits; if, say, she were not insured in the last two years but she were insured since the 5th July, 1954, and half the contributions paid were stamps at the full rate, she could also qualify for unemployment benefit and if her entry into insurance occurred since the 5th July, 1953, and again if half of her contributions were at the full rate she also would qualify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the present unemployment in the Tuam area is seasonal, and is due largely to the closing down of the normal sugar campaign.  The usual proportionate allocation in respect of the unemployment assistance recipients has already been made for this area and no other proposals have been received by the Minister for Finance towards the relief of unemployment.  As indicated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply to similar questions in respect of other areas the establishment of industries is primarily a matter for private enterprise and local initiative. The Deputy cannot be unaware of the efforts in this respect which are pending in the Tuam area.  It is anticipated that additional employment will shortly become available locally on the Corrib drainage operations, and I am advised that work is also available in connection with the Irish Sugar Company's scheme at Gowla.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 34, to delete &ldquo;Force of the Defence Forces&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Defence Force on full pay&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is purely a drafting point.  It is intended to provide that a servant should be allowed to reckon, as a service day, any day when he is attending or performing his duty as a member of any of the Reserve Forces of the Defence Forces.  The wording that appears in the Bill might be held to exclude such a duty while he is performing his duty for training or the like with the F.C.A. or An Sluagh Muirí.  The new wording will ensure that those services are covered also. It is merely a drafting point.</P>

      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 40 to 45, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" />&ldquo;wages&rdquo; means, subject to Section 46, payments as wages to a servant as such for his own use and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a servant who is suspended or absent on leave and who, as respects the period of suspension or absence, does not receive a part of the payments as wages to him for his own use which he would have received if he had not been suspended or absent on leave, includes that part, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a servant being paid compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1934 to 1955, by a local authority, includes the wages that he would have received if he had not been in receipt of such compensation.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a repetition of the definition of &ldquo;wages&rdquo; in Section 2 of the Bill with the addition of paragraph (b) of the amendment.  A servant can reckon as a service day any day up to one year at a time when he was drawing workmen's compensation.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that should any such day fall into the reckoning for calculation of his pensionable remuneration for the purpose of granting him an allowance or a gratuity his wages on that day will be taken to be what he would have drawn in wages on that day had he not been in receipt of workmen's compensation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to cover two officers of local authorities who had their service with the former National Health Insurance Society which was incorporated in the Civil Service by the Social Welfare Act, 1950.  That Act provides that pensionable service under the society would be reckoned to the same extent as pensionable service in the Civil Service. However, both these officers left the society before 1950.  Had they remained until 1950 and had they then transferred to the Local Government service they would have been under this provision in the Bill, that is, sub-section <Col N="363" /> (1) of Section 11, entitled to reckon their service in full.  The purpose of the amendment is to close this small loophole.</P>

      <P>Under paragraph (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 11, an officer of a local authority may reckon pensionable service with a body approved by the Minister which grants reciprocal rights to officers of local authorities.

      <P>I think there is possibly no difference of opinion between the Minister and ourselves on what he seeks to do in this particular section, but we do think that the manner in which it is stated at the moment leaves it open to abuse in so far as while we think the Minister has in mind only the making of conditions in relation to contributions, by the way it stands at the moment, he could also make other conditions which might be regarded as obnoxious.

      <P>In sub-section (2), lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;and in accordance with regulations made by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think I can be very brief on this.  It has cropped up on other occasions and from other Deputies with regard to other Acts and it embodies our fundamental objection to legislation by regulation.  We feel that if the Minister has certain regulations in mind, which I have no doubt he has, that they should be embodied in the Bill now, so that this House should not find itself in the position of passing the shell of a Bill and leaving the real essence to be filled in by someone in the Custom House.  In the 1948 Act there was the same stipulation and there issued from the Custom House on the 21st May, 1951, a notorious circular known as Circular 5/51.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>It had effect in this way &mdash;that the Act of 1948 said that certain things could be done and the circular issued set down what might or might <Col N="365" /> not be done by local authorities.  I have no doubt now that the Minister has certain things in his mind and these things will be embodied in the regulations.  If that is so, these regulations should find their way into this Bill so that every Deputy would know where he stood and that Deputies could move amendments about the more obnoxious features of such regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate and I appreciate what Deputy Casey and Deputy McGrath have said.  I was opposed to legislation by regulation but the Deputies will recollect that under the Local Government Amendment Act, 1955, all such regulations must now be laid before the House.  However, that does not concern this Bill.  I refer the Deputy to Section 3 of the Bill which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That section provides that regulations made must be laid before the House. The House then has 21 days in which to annul or amend regulations laid before it.</P>

      <P>Apparently the people, or certain people, in the Custom House have their minds made up with regard to certain regulations in connection with the employees of local authorities. They have applied these regulations since 1948 and I can see no reason why they should not now be put into this Bill so as to give Deputies a chance to amend them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether we can discuss the problems of some of the people who, under previous Acts, had certain benefits and will not have these benefits under this Act, such as law clerks and also such people as nurses who will not be given added years of service.  There are advantages being given to certain sections under this Bill which are, what I might call, the professional classes.  If the professional classes are to get certain advantages why should other people, who might be considered technical classes, not be allowed the same advantages?</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that the case of nurses would come under the authority of the Minister for Health. When a nurse qualifies after three years she still, in order to get a position with a local authority, must also have experience, which is of great importance in securing a position of responsibility under a local authority. Why should it be that, whereas, under Section 13, a person who might be classified as technical as against professional will not get the advantages which I believe he should get for the years which he has spent in securing the knowledge which may be considered technical but which is, at the same time, of the utmost importance, and may be far harder to grasp than it is in the case of some of those who are grouped within what is termed the professional category?  In fairness to everyone concerned, particularly those in the nursing profession and others who can be affected in their local authority employment, I think this is a matter in which the Minister should clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, so far as I see it, is that no matter what law clerk enters the service &mdash; I think the Deputy was really referring to law clerks &mdash; he will have at least seven to eight years' experience when he does enter; he will then be only 25 years of age.  Law clerks usually enter solicitors' offices at the age of 16 or 17, <Col N="368" /> or less; at the age of 25 years they are eligible and qualified to take up a position with a local authority and they are entitled to their full pension having completed their full service.  There would, therefore, be no necessity for added years.  I can agree with the Deputy's point of view in the case of a professional man, such as a doctor, who does not qualify until 23 or 24 years of age; he will require experience, such as that to which the Deputy referred, and he will have at least ten years' practical experience before reaching 35.  If he comes into the service of the local authority at 35 years of age he will qualify for a full pension.  I think all classes are equally provided for; the law clerk qualifies much earlier and he will require less practical experience than the professional man.  I think both justice and equity are being done in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the nursing staff is the very same.  A nurse usually qualifies at 21 years of age.  I understand that is the average age at which a nurse qualifies unless she intends to specialise in some particular branch. She is eligible to take up a local appointment immediately she qualifies; most of them, I understand, take up such an appointment within two, three or four years, at the outside, after qualifying; they would, therefore, be in the service of the local authority well before reaching 30 years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, the amendment tabled in the name of the Labour Party has been ruled out of order.  We feel that this paragraph (b) in sub-section (1) is one that might well be omitted.  The section provides that the local authority may award a lump sum and a pension if they are of the opinion that, in general, a servant has served with diligence and fidelity and to their satisfaction.  All of us would encourage all employees of local authorities to serve with diligence and to the best of their ability.  We feel that this particular sub-paragraph gives an opportunity to petty dictators. A city or a county manager may be the best man in the world and very favourably disposed towards employees, but he can get a report of how a man has served only from the head of the particular section in which the man served.  Now, while no one might go out of his way ultimately to deprive a man of his lump sum and his pension, this particular stipulation could be used unjustly and wrongfully as a big stick over the heads of employees.  We find petty dictators in all walks of life, men who try to impress themselves upon the lesser fry over whom they have some authority.  I think the Bill would not lose anything by omitting this particular sub-paragraph.  Section 66 provides that if a man feels aggrieved or does not get his lump sum and pension he may appeal to the Minister.  I have no doubt at all that in such cases, if they did arise, justice would be done; the objection we have is that, while this sub-paragraph remains, it may be used by small-minded and narrow-minded petty dictators in the employment of local authorities.  I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>

      <P>The pattern of this Bill follows the pattern of Civil Service legislation.  A civil servant finding himself in the position quoted by the Deputy must procure a certificate that he has given diligent and faithful service. It has never been alleged at any time that that certificate has been withheld or that the right to give a certificate has been abused.  I think it is a mistake to anticipate that the local authority would in any way abuse the giving of such a certificate. As the Deputy pointed out, there is provision in Section 66 of the Bill and a certain amount of protection.  In view of that, I feel the section should be allowed to stand as it is.</P>

      <P>I had an amendment down, but I understand it has been ruled out of order.  On the section, I would ask the Minister if he would allow officials who have served for 40 years, well and faithfully, to retire before reaching 60 years of age.  There are some employees in our local authority who have the full 40 years' service.  If they hang on for another year or so they will retard promotion, and the prospective promotee may have gone beyond the particular age for promotion when the former retire. I appeal to the Minister to give the benefit of the Bill to officials who have given the requisite 40 years' service. By letting these people out he will be doing a good turn to those in line for promotion, who are approaching the age limit.</P>

      <P>Permitted or forced? With regard to being forced, if he is physically fit, I think the taxpayers should not be asked to superannuate him and put someone else in his place. After all, we should bear in mind that this State does not provide superannuation for any person, other than in exceptional cases, under the age of 60. <Col N="371" /> We have servants in the service of local authorities at the age of 16 and 17 and, were we to accept the proposition put forward by Deputy Alfred Byrne, we would have these people retiring under the age of 60 with full pension rights and the taxpayer would have to pay for some person to replace them in the local authority service. The only case I know where a man may retire at the age of 55 is that of a fireman but we all appreciate that there are exceptional circumstances there.  In the fire service we want young active men and it would be unfair to the ratepayers to ask these men over 55 years to remain on.  I think we would be going beyond all accepted principles of superannuation if we accepted the suggestion of Deputy Alfred Byrne, although I appreciate his point of view.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), lines 14 to 17, to delete &ldquo;but in ascertaining that number of whole years, there shall be deducted, from the pensionable local service referred to in the said sub-section (6), so much (if any) thereof as was service in the Civil Service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Act of 1948 an officer who is pensionable on 1st April, 1948, was entitled to have added to his lump sum on retirement an increased amount calculated at the rate of ½ per cent. per annum for each year of service up to 1st April, 1948.  This was to compensate him for those years before 1948 when he had not been covered by the life assurance of a death gratuity to his dependents should he die in office. However, civil servants who entered the local service before April, 1948, had this cover while they were civil servants and it was inappropriate to give them the benefit in question.  The purpose of the words that it is now proposed to delete was to deprive them of this extra benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further consideration, however, shows that it would be wrong to deprive existing officers of a benefit to which <Col N="372" /> they became statutorily entitled under the Act of 1948, and it is accordingly proposed to delete the words in question.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (a), lines 42 to 44, to delete &ldquo;if the local authority are of opinion that she has served in her office with diligence and fidelity and to their satisfaction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The arguments I would apply in this case are the ones I raised in connection with Section 15 and to repeat them now <i>ad nauseam</i> would not convince the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think there is something to be said in this connection. Section 22 (a) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if the local authority are of opinion that she has served in her office with diligence and fidelity...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; is used in the plural.  The local authority, we know, is the manager.  We may be told that we can ask the manager to do a certain thing, but I believe like my colleague, Deputy Casey, if we are going to leave things as they are it will be a case of whether the manager likes or dislikes it or whether the manager's friends in other quarters may like or dislike it.  We know, from our own experience, that if an officer has reason to complain about a decision of the manager &mdash; and there are very good reasons to complain about some of the decisions of the manager &mdash; if there is an appeal to another quarter in Dublin, the manager will be completely upheld.  I believe the Minister should look at this in a more serious light.  We can be told as members of the local authority that because the filling of vacancies is a function of the manager he can do what he likes, which undoubtedly he will do.  It is up to us in this Bill dealing with superannuation and dealing with local authorities to see that the power of the manager, <Col N="373" /> their association, and the Custom House is not going to strangle the members.  If the Minister does not consider this question between now and the Report Stage more closely than just saying that a note will be taken of what is said, we will have a very serious obstacle confronting the local authorities on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the staff, the managers' association and the Custom House in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  We have all had experience from time to time of officers being transferred from one department to another in the public service allegedly because they have not being carrying on their work to the satisfaction of the manager.  Then in their new department they may be excellent men and it may be held against them subsequently that they have not carried on their work to the satisfaction of their superiors.  The very fact that they are retained in the public service, to my mind, ought to be sufficient to guarantee them the pensions and emoluments to which at the end of their service the law entitles them.  Sometimes a man may be transferred from a department, and made a scapegoat due to the failures of others.</P>
      <P>That feeling very often arises where there is not unanimity between the public representatives and the manager or his senior officials about the particular matter in question.  But the manager has full and final authority on the question and no matter what information the local authorities might have either from their personal knowledge or supplied to them otherwise, as to the grievance under which these particular officers may labour, they have no remedy whatever.  The fact that a man is retained in the public service ought to be sufficient guarantee that he is entitled to whatever pension or rights the law provides for.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy who spoke last has put his finger on the important point.  It is required that the service must be with diligence and fidelity.  Surely if somebody has served with the local authority until <Col N="374" /> such time as to qualify for pension, that is evidence enough that his service has been with diligence and fidelity.  I do know myself of at least one case &mdash; this is something that is apparently being overlooked in this House or being rushed &mdash; where petty spite between the officials has prevented a man from receiving what he was justly entitled to.  I would go further and say that it followed him to the grave because even after he died, his dependents, because of petty spite, did not get what they were entitled to get.  For that reason I would appeal to the Minister to consider this matter again.  I also agree with Deputy Desmond that the term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; should be singular and not plural.  After all it is the county manager we are dealing with.  Whether we say local authority or not it is the manager who is the representative of the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is unfair to suggest that the county manager would act in an arbitrary way in this matter.  It should be borne in mind that paragraph (a) of Section 22 is for the purpose of ensuring that an officer cannot get a full pension unless he serves with diligence and fidelity.  This is the very same provision that has appeared in the Act of 1948 and it derives from the Civil Service Superannuation Act of 1859.</P>
      <P>Since the 1948 Act was enacted it has been invoked only in one case. This section, in my opinion, is a safeguard to the officer.  Take the case of an officer who is not diligent.  He can be retired on full pension or can be sacked there and then without a pension.  That is, if we delete the wording of the section, he can be sacked without a pension.  But, here, we are making provision for the in-between case, namely, for the man who has served diligently and the man who has not served diligently in the opinion of the local authority.</P>

      <P>The point I make is that an officer may be considered to be guilty of an error of judgment.  In discharging his duties with what he considered all diligence and fidelity he might be guilty of an error of judgment and that might, for example, result in a strike, or something like that.  The officer may then be held responsible. He may be degraded and offered another appointment, which he refuses to accept.  He feels that he has a grievance.  In consequence, his whole career is jeopardised.  That has happened to our knowledge.  Deputy Desmond knows that as well as I do.</P>

Remember, the aggrieved party has always the right to appeal to the appropriate Minister and so long as that right remains I do not think it is right that we should anticipate that county managers will victimise their servants or ex-servants.  As I said, it has been invoked only once since the passing of the 1948 Act.</P>

There is no sense in putting in the word &ldquo;their&rdquo; when it really means &ldquo;his&rdquo;&mdash; the county manager's.

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 11, before &ldquo;,but&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and emoluments&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is that <Col N="377" /> an officer must contribute on both his salary and any other emoluments he may have and it will be open to the local authority to make deductions from emoluments as well as from salary, in other words, the deductions may be from the salary and the emoluments and the local authority will have power to deduct from the income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should not make this addition.  The Minister stated some time ago that Section 22 was derived from the Civil Service (Superannuation) Act.  Now, officers appointed since 1st April, 1948, must pay contributions at the rate of 5 per cent. of their salaries for superannuation purposes.  Civil servants need not make such contributions. Recently, a custom has grown up of applying increases in salaries of local authority officers on the same basis as Civil Service awards.  If the Minister introduces this amendment, it means, apart from any other faults that may be found with the section, that local authority officers will receive 5 per cent. less than civil servants.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point and to make sure that anomaly will not arise.  If the provision is left that the local authority officer pays 5 per cent. of his basic salary, he is still making a contribution which those serving the State do not make towards their pensions.  I think that distinction should be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to look at the definition section. There you are given emoluments as meaning, subject to Sections 26 and 46, any apartments, rations, or other perquisites in kind (or, as the case may require, a monetary payment given in lieu of such apartments, rations, or other perquisites) appertaining to an office or employment and all fees, poundage and commission of an officer or servant as such for his own use.  I could imagine the case of a rate collector who would be paid on poundage alone, which would be an emolument. If I accept the Deputy's suggestion that man would be required to contribute. In view of the definition section, I think the Deputy should be satisfied this is necessary.  It is certainly <Col N="378" /> the same as Section 31 of the 1948 Act.</P>

We have some other interpretations which are also to the detriment of local authority officials and I do not think that should prevail.  Local authority officials are sufficiently penalised already by having to pay 5 per cent. on their basic salaries when civil servants have not to make such a contribution and, at the same time, the local authority officials get the Civil Service award on which they must pay a deduction of 5 per cent.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy MacCarthy in the case he has <Col N="379" /> made.  In support of his objection I shall quote a case from Cork.  There are certain officials in the Cork fire brigade who formerly lived in the fire station.  Because of the growth of the brigade, that part of the premises was needed for other purposes and a few of the officials were asked to leave the station.  Now they are getting a rent allowance in lieu of the accommodation they formerly enjoyed as part of their conditions of employment.  It appears they now, because of the Minister's amendment, will have this deduction made from their rent allowance which was nothing but a compensatory allowance.  I think that is an injustice. The rent allowance is being paid to them for the disturbance of their living and I do not think a percentage of it should be deducted.</P>

Deputy Casey has given a specific instance where emoluments given as compensation for a change of conditions or circumstances will be subjected to the 5 per cent. deduction.  I gave an instance of where a Civil Service award is given to local authority officials, coming down as policy from the Department, and while the civil servants get that full award the local authority officials will have to pay 5 per cent. on it.  The civil servant is pensioned without a deduction whereas the local authority official gets a pension towards which he pays 5 per cent. during his career.</P>

      <P>On the section, I should like to ask the Minister to consider the case of a very small group about whom, I think, representations have been made to him.  I refer to people recruited as officers in training before the coming into operation of the 1948 Act.  These people went in as officers in training under the Department of Education.  They had to complete a course and before attending that course they had to undertake that they would serve for five years.  They were given to understand there would be a non-contributory superannuation scheme for them when eventually they became officers of local vocational education bodies.  Unfortunately, when they came out of training and took up their employment, the 1948 Act was in operation with its stipulation as to contributions.  These people now find <Col N="381" /> themselves in the position where they have to make contributions towards their pensions, even though they were in prior to 1948 in so far as they were teachers in training.  Has the Minister considered their case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seriously considered it, but I have come to the conclusion that teachers in training are not teachers.  They are students just the same as any university graduate who becomes a vocational teacher, as many do.  A university graduate could always say that before the 1st April, 1948, he was in training &mdash; he was doing his degree course.  He has spent five years doing that course and he could, in the same way, claim exemption.  If you look at it in that way it would be very unfair to treat students as if they were teachers, just it would be unfair to treat undergraduates as if they were graduates who had entered into an office.</P>

I think he was doing a good thing, particularly in view of the superannuation problem, but does the House not remember the outcry there was here when the two years expired?  There was such an outcry that I had to extend it for a third year.  I am very anxious to see local authorities make permanent appointments if permanent appointments are necessary and do away with makeshift jobs and temporary appointments.

The retiring officers were faced with the situation where they had to make quick decisions.  Some of them would now like to have the option, as I say, of making a decision one way or another still under the provisions which <Col N="384" /> were made in 1948 but which came on them pretty suddenly.

      <P>An existing officer whose name is entered on the register under Section 28, but who wishes to stick to a pension based on sixtieths rather than eightieths plus lump sum or death gratuity may give notice accordingly under sub-section (10), Section 28.  In the normal case, he has a clear 12 months from the commencement of Part II of the Act to give that notice. However, where there is a dispute between him and the local authority as to whether his name should be entered on the register at all and an appeal has been made to the appropriate Minister and determined in his favour, he has six months in which to notify the local authority as to whether he prefers to remain with the benefit of sixtieths. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the six months will reckon from the time he is notified of the decision of the appeal, not from the time the appeal itself is decided.  I think we had a considerable argument on a somewhat similar amendment in the Local Government Act of 1955 and it was agreed that this was a much preferable procedure.</P>

I would like to know from the Minister what would be the position in relation to persons who would have been qualified if permanent in the Civil Service in 1946 but who, because of changed circumstances, entered the local authority service in 1950 or 1951?  Now it seems these years of Civil Service service are not going to be linked with their local authority service and there is no interrelation between the Civil Service and the local authority service.

If a person is in training for a position with the local authority I do not see why he should be treated as permanent until he goes into employment.  A civil servant who goes into a local authority will have acquired certain training while in the Civil Service and if he had not got that training he would not get the position with the local authority.  I do not think it would be fair to treat him in any different way than we would treat the trainee teacher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, provision is made in this section that a man who works for a local authority for a period of less than 200 days will not have these days put to his credit towards his pension.  In other words, a man who might work for 190 days and who has had contributions for that period will get his contributions back and will not get credit for pension purposes. Similarly in a further section a man who works for more than 300 days will not have the additional day accredited to him for pension purposes.  We feel that where a man finds himself on the register of employees of a local authority and has less than 200 days' work, those days should not be just written off.</P>
      <P>We think the fairer way to deal with this matter would be that having got his name on the register all the days that he would subsequently work would be aggregated so that if he worked 190 days in one year and 305 days in the next year the total of these two years would be aggregated and that he would get the benefit of every day on which he worked and for which a deduction had been made from his wages for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole principle in Part III of the Bill is based on the principle that if a man devotes approximately two-thirds of his time to the employment of a local authority he should be entitled to superannuation but that if he gives less &mdash; if he is employed for the remainder of the time somewhere else or is self employed&mdash; that he should not be so entitled.  That is the principle settled in the Bill and we have gone a considerable distance further than was intended under the Act of 1948.  Suppose we said that the limit was 190 days then we would have <Col N="388" /> suggestions that it should be made 180 days.  I think that two-thirds is a reasonable period of service to look for from a permanent employee &mdash; two-thirds of the full 12 months &mdash; and I think the section as it stands is a vast improvement on the 1948 section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In this particular case we have the position that a man who has 40 years' service in the employment of a local authority may have had ten of those years with less than 200 days' work.  He may not have been working elsewhere and may have been unemployed but instead of getting credit for the days he worked in those ten years he simply gets credit for 30 years' service which makes a very big difference in regard to pensionable matters.  I will appeal to the Minister to consider the arguments which are being put up on behalf of the man who, through no fault of his own, has only spent a few months of the year working with a local authority and who is getting no credit for that work.  Our amendment, which we had intended moving, was for the purpose of ensuring that a man would receive credit for all the days on which he works.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a broad, but precise, definition in the definition section.  That says that all an employee will require from now on is 200 service days' employment in the 12 months; and a &ldquo;service day&rdquo; means:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  a day on which the servant worked in a wholetime capacity for one or more than one local authority, the work not being work (other than work in a supervisory capacity or work calling for special experience or skill which is not given to him by reference to the provision of employment for him or the relief of his distress) on any work or scheme of works the <Col N="389" /> expenses of which are in whole or in part met from moneys provided by the Oireachtas for the provision of employment and the relief of distress.</P>
    <P>(b)  a day (other than a Sunday) in respect of which the servant was given paid leave.</P>
    <P>(c)  a day (other than a Sunday) in respect of which the servant was paid compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1934 to 1955 by a local authority, provided that the accident occurred on a day such as is referred to in paragraph (a) of this definition and that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the whole of the period in respect of which the compensation was paid was not more than one year, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  where the whole of the period in respect of which the compensation was paid was more than one year, the day occurred during such portion of the period as was before the expiration of one year from its commencement, or</P>
    <P>(d) a day (other than a Sunday) on which the servant was attending and performing his duty as a member of the Reserve Force of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Now I think we have gone a long distance there.  Nevertheless, Deputy James Tully suggests we should count as a service day a day on which a man is drawing unemployment assistance because he cannot get employment.</P>

We are simply asking that, if a man has 200 days in one year and 100 days in the next year, those 300 days together <Col N="390" /> should constitute one year.  Surely it is reasonable to ask for that when 200 days the year after will again count as a year.  Surely he should be entitled to total the days he works.  Never mind the days he is drawing unemployment assistance or catching rabbits. We simply want such a man to get the credit for the days he works.

      <P>Quite so, but the majority in some counties may be very narrow-minded.  Now, should it happen that there is a close relationship between these elected representatives and the members of the engineering <Col N="391" /> staff, or even with the county manager, it will be quite easy to introduce a system in some counties under which the vast majority of the road workers will find themselves with not even 200 days in any year.  The Minister may not agree with that.  The Minister would not do that; he would not be a party to such a system.  But there are plenty of people on local authorities who would be a party to it.  Let us forget the particular counties we represent ourselves; we have a composite obligation towards protecting the people in every county.  Should it happen that, subsequent to the passage of this measure, a new system is devised whereby none of the employees will secure 200 days' work every year it automatically follows that none of the employees will ever get a pension.  We do not see why the total number of days worked should not be taken into consideration to give the workers a right to at least some part of the pension they may be denied by elected representatives in certain counties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>( )  The Minister shall make regulations prescribing the manner and form in which the legal personal representative of a deceased pensionable servant may claim without legal cost any gratuity in respect of the said servant.</P>
    <P>We have put down this amendment because of experiences we have had when servants of local authorities have died.  When their personal representatives, who are in very poor circumstances in many cases, apply for the pension due to the deceased member, they find that the local authority insists on certain legal formalities being carried out, at considerable cost to the people concerned.  We hope that the Minister will consider adding this amendment to Section 40 so that officials of local authorities will have the right, if necessary, to pay these moneys to the legal personal representative of a deceased pensionable servant without going through the usual legal tangle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain the financial impact on the personal representative: 15/- or, in certain cases, £1. That is all.  The Deputies will agree that were we to permit an official in a local authority to pay over the lump sum to what at first sight appears to be be <i>prima facie</i> the legal personal representatives, and it later turns out that the particular person to whom that money was paid was not the legal personal representative, then the local authority may have to pay a second time an amount similar to what was paid the first time.  To ensure against that situation, if the legal personal representative visits the local officer of <Col N="393" /> customs and excise, for the sum of 15/- or £1 in certain cases, that gentleman is obliged to extract a grant of administration on behalf of the legal personal representative.  Possibly on behalf of some professions I should not advertise that fact to this House but it is proper that the true legal position should be known.</P>

It is true that if a widow of any such employee comes to a member of any political Party or the Independents of this House she will be told, but there are many unfortunate persons who may not be in a position to get that information.  If the Minister will not agree to this amendment will he meet us half way and arrange that, in booklet form or otherwise, people will be in a position to know of the special advantage available to them?  At the present time only a very small percentage of people are aware that that advantage is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider reducing the 4?th to 2 1/12th.  The amount as it stands is based on the assumption that the employee is working for 52 weeks in the year when, as a matter of fact, it is agreed by the Minister that many of the people who would be working slightly over 200 days in the year would <Col N="395" /> have far less than 52 weeks' pay.  The amount of the contribution would be a fairly substantial one to such a man.  It is not fair in our opinion to have a halfpenny in the shilling collected from people who are working for three months perhaps, off for one month, back again for three months, and off again for a fortnight.  That is the way a very large number of local authority employees are employed and we consider that the fact that the stamp deduction is 4?th should not enter into this particular case.  I would ask the Minister to go into this matter and, if at all possible, to reduce the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the arguments put forward by Deputy Tully and his colleagues, but I would like the Deputies to bear in mind that wages and salaries of local authorities in the Twenty-Six Counties at the moment amount to about £17,000,000 and about £9,000,000 of that is accounted for by officers and £8,000,000 by servants.  Not all servants will eventually retire on pension but supposing half or two-thirds of them retire, representing an annual wages bill of £5,000,000, their contributions amount to £208,000 in the year.  If we are going to reduce that by half, as has been suggested, the amount would be £104,000 only.  We must bear in mind the impact which superannuation will have on the rates.  The only source for superannuation is the rates, State grants and the contributions of the servants and officers.  If we reduce the contributions of the servants we must put an additional burden on the rates or State grants.  Let us compare the benefits in this Bill with the benefits which have been afforded elsewhere where the contributions are much higher &mdash; the contributions of local authorities in Great Britain are 6 per cent. and employees 5 per cent. Teachers in Great Britain contribute 6 per cent.  If you compare the position of the ratepayers with C.I.E. I think we are treating ourselves very generously under the Bill and I ask Deputies to bear that in mind.  The Deputy and his colleagues did mention that some local authorities may be <Col N="396" /> hostile to their own, but if we try to load too much on them we might make them more hostile and I would ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Again let me point out that the Minister has in my opinion given us an argument against himself because the local authority employees are people who are working for 52 weeks in the year, are paid for 52 weeks and in most cases are also permanent employees.  There is very little difference between the 4?th and the 5 which the Minister quoted.  The figures which he has given as to the cost do not bear any relation at all to the matter because if you take the cost for the 27 county councils along with the urban councils and break down that cost the amount for each local authority is a relatively small sum.  The Minister will also agree that a number of people will come under this Bill who are not under the present Act.  The result is that the contributions to be paid in each county or for each area will be relatively larger while the amount of pensions being paid out will not show any appreciable change for a long number of years.  If you take the case of a road worker who has £5 a week you find that he has to pay 9/- out of his fortnightly sum of £10 plus 2/4 per week for his stamps.  Small as his wage is the present proposal under this Bill will make it even smaller and he will have very little to live on.  I think special consideration should be given to this type of worker.</P>

      <P>This is a small drafting change to paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 48.  The paragraph as drafted puts absolute obligation on the servant to contribute to the local authority in respect of service newly reckonable under the Bill between the commencement in relation to him of Part III of the Act of 1948 and the commencement of Part III of this Act.  The amendment changes this, merely requiring him to contribute if he wants to reckon that service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading I raised the question of a number of employees in the Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  There are 25 persons who were permanent employees between 1930 and 1948 but who, under some section of the 1948 Act, were and have been forced to pay contributions. I put down an amendment but it was ruled out of order.  I should like to know if the Minister has gone into the question and if he would tell me the reasons why these men have been treated differently from every other permanent employee in the corporation and in the vocational education service.  They are, I understand, the only people who have not parity with corporation and vocational education committee employees.  It seems unreasonable that, when they were permanent and taken off stamps, some as early as 1932 and 1933, which would imply that they were pensionable, they are forced to pay contributions, in contrast to all other pensionable servants. It is very unfair that these men should be treated in this manner.  The Minister promised to look into the case but he has not put down an amendment to cover the point.  Therefore, I should like to know what is the case for the differentiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made by Deputy Colley. The position of these particular employees is anomalous and seems to have been the result of an oversight following upon the enactment of the Vocational Education Act and the taking over of the technical school employees.  It is quite anomalous that this particular group of corporation officials should be put in a different category from other employees of the corporation.  They are a small group and it will remove quite a substantial grievance if the Minister can see his way, on Report Stage, to remedy the position.  I think amendment No. 42, or some such amendment, would cover the position if the Minister felt that he could deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the <Col N="400" /> House knows the facts of this particular case.  Since the beginning of the century, servants of Dublin Corporation have had a pension scheme.  Up to 1930, Dublin Vocational Education Committee never had a pension scheme.  For some reason, which I need not go into now, for one month in the year 1930 the employees of Dublin Vocational Education Committee became employees of Dublin Corporation &mdash;merely for one month&mdash;and, as a result of that employment for a month, they became entitled to pension.  They had that right.  They were employees of Dublin Corporation for a particular period in 1930 and that gave them pension rights which they would never have had were it not for this coincidence.</P>
      <P>Under the 1948 Act, in view of the fact that these employees of the vocational education committee, who were employees of Dublin Corporation for one month in 1930, had acquired pension status, they exempted them from contribution, and I think rightly so, but what is sought here is, in the case of all employees who came into the vocational education committee since 1930 up to 1948, to exempt them also from contributions.</P>
      <P>I think everybody will agree that if any persons were fortunate it was those who were presented with pensions in 1930 through this peculiar coincidence.  It would be unfair now to exempt the others who did not acquire such status until the 1948 Act. I think Deputy Colley and Deputy MacBride will agree that instead of fighting for the class on whose behalf they are now fighting they should rather agree to make the other class contribute.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider a slight change in the provisions?  I would be very glad if he would consider making retrospective provision for the dependents of people who have been debarred from receiving the full gratuity because of the three years' qualification period.  I have in mind a person who was an employee of a local authority for six years and because of the fact that there were three qualifying years his dependents were given the benefit of only three years' service when he died.  The Minister has made regulations under which, retrospectively, the qualifying period has been reduced to one year. Would he consider inserting in this section a clause which would cover people like the person I have in mind? Very few cases would arise under it. These people suffer sufficient hardship as it is without this extra burden of the three years' qualifying period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can devote but a brief period of discussion to this matter. All of the Cork Deputies have discussed this already with the Minister. This section is designed to remove an injustice under which certain employees of the Cork Corporation are labouring since the passing of the 1948 Act.  A dispute arose between the Cork City Manager and the employees as to whether or not certain employees should be liable for contributions towards the superannuation scheme and as the Minister and everybody else know the parties eventually went to the courts and the decision was given for the city manager by a majority in the Supreme Court.  All Ministers between then and now were aware that, while the Cork City Manager got the decision in the court, it was never intended that the people concerned should have to pay contributions towards their pension schemes. Accordingly, all of us welcome this particular section in that it recognised the principle that these people should not have to contribute.  This amendment <Col N="405" /> seeks that these people would be repaid the contributions which were wrongfully taken from them.  That is really the one object of the amendment. There are two amendments down, No. 46 which has become No. 47, and No. 49 is also tied up in it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as it stands, while recognising that these moneys are due to the people involved, makes provision that in the case of the man who resigns or dies in the meantime the moneys will be paid back to him or to his legal personal representatives. We have no quibble with that, but in relation to people who are still serving Cork Corporation, this section provides that these moneys shall not be returned to them until they go on pension at normal retiring age.  There are something like 170 employees involved and the average amount payable to them, I think, would be something in the nature of £100 per man.  In very many cases these people will have to wait years before they would get their £100 back under the terms of the section as it stands.  I think it would be very unfair to say to a man, as we are saying in this section: &ldquo;We agree the deductions should not have been made; we agree we owe you £100, but we are not going to give it to you until 20, 25 or 30 years' time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that at least Cork Corporation will have the option as to when these moneys will be paid back.  Personally, I feel &mdash; and I believe other Deputies also feel&mdash;that the moneys should be paid back forthwith, but this amendment is not going as far as that, particularly in view of what the Minister said on the Second Stage of the Bill&mdash; that he was concerned with the impact on the rates.  I think he was not disposed towards making it obligatory on Cork Corporation to refund the moneys forthwith.  This particular amendment simply asks the Minister to throw it back into the lap of Cork Corporation and the elected representatives of the corporation, representing the ratepayers as well as the corporation employees. <Col N="406" /> Let the decision as regards what is just and equitable in relation to the time these men would have to wait for their money rest on the corporation. I submit it is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be specific and careful in the wording of this amendment because we certainly do not want to see this case going to the Supreme Court again, or going to the courts at all, and because of that I have endeavoured to make it abundantly clear that while the option is being given to Cork Corporation, it is being given to the elected representatives of Cork Corporation and not to the city manager. I know in some legislation a reference to the local authority means in fact a reference to the local county or city manager.  I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment, and I would ask him for his advice as to whether it is water-tight and would do what we want it to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I agree with every word that Deputy Casey has said.  Five city representatives of the corporation met the Minister and he agreed that it was a matter for the Cork Corporation and he felt that if they were satisfied he would readily accept it, but his reason for putting in the paragraph about not paying back until the people were retiring was in order to cushion &mdash; as he described it &mdash; the impact on the ratepayers.  I would like to point out that the contributions made by those men over the last seven or eight years have gone to relieve the rates to the extent of about £3,000 a year.  They were not put into any superannuation fund or anything like that, but just used to relieve rates generally.  I will agree with cushioning the impact on the ratepayers, but, at the same time, I would go a bit further than Deputy Casey.  There are some men with 42 years to go and &mdash; assuming the retiring age to be 70 &mdash; they would be waiting 42 years for the return of their money. Some of these men are rearing families, sending children to school &mdash; perhaps five or six children &mdash; and they are at the most difficult period of their lives. To ask a man to wait 30 or 42 years, <Col N="407" /> as some of them will have to do if the retiring age is 70, is going a bit too far.  I do not see any reason why the local authority could not raise a loan of £23,000 to pay off these men straight away.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the amount was between £23,000 and £30,000, but on questioning the manager he said that £23,000 had been paid up to date.  I do not think there is much more to say on this as Deputy Casey has clearly pointed out that this money was held up due to&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister will accept the term or not&mdash;a legal quibble as to whether these men's names were entered on the register or not, or whether the wages book should be the register.  That was not the fault of the employees; neither was it the fault of the public representatives because they were unaware of anything until this case was brought into the courts in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The manager appealed cases and eventually they went to the Supreme Court and, by a majority of the judges, they decided that the wages book which set out all the people's names was not a register.  We do not want this to be another cause of legal controversy, costing the ratepayers a good deal of money and eventually having the position reversed.  We want to make it quite clear that by local authority we mean the elected representatives of the people.  I would like to ask if the Minister is satisfied that Deputy Casey's amendment makes that quite clear.  Otherwise, it would just mean that there would be quibbling for another couple of years.  The period when workers are in the position of sending their children to school and trying to rear them is the hardest time of their lives.  Even if he should never marry, it is a most ridiculous thing to suggest that a man should have to wait 30 or 40 or 42 years to get back £120.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene only to give evidence of the unanimity of the Cork Deputies in this matter.  The case we make is that this refund is morally due in a shorter period than the Minister suggests in the White <Col N="408" /> Paper.  If the Minister leaves the matter in the hands of the Cork Corporation they will devise a more equitable period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea at the back of the section, of staggering the period, is to ease the burden on the ratepayers. Exemption from contributions now is going to work out at 3d. in the £ on the Cork ratepayers. To repay the £23,000 at once would mean that the rates would be increased by 2/- in the £ next year.  Even spread over 7 years, it would mean 3d. in the £ extra on the rates over that period and spreading the burden in that way would have the immediate effect of increasing the rates by 6d. in the £.</P>
      <P>I am influenced by the fact that Deputies of all political Parties are anxious that the members of Cork Corporation should themselves decide this matter, and I am prepared to leave the matter to the House.  If the House likes to leave the matter to the Cork Corporation, I will agree that the amendments are in order.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall, by virtue of this section, be established immediately after the reconstruction of the Irish Coursing Club as provided in Section 26 of this Act, a board to be styled and known as the Greyhound Industry Board to fulfil the functions assigned to it by this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Minister has considered this amendment and made up his mind to oppose it.  I think he will remember that on the Second Reading there was a considerable amount of discussion on this particular matter; and what this amendment seeks to secure is that the board envisaged in the Bill shall not be set up until such time as the elections take place, i.e., the elections envisaged in the Bill for the future. We discussed this in great detail on the Second Reading.  Reasons were given.  There was some suggestion that there would be difficulty in getting people with sufficient experience to manage the affairs of the board.  I think the Minister had the idea that if some proportion of the present management of the Irish Coursing Club, <Col N="411" /> were to take over, or be put on this for the interregnum period, that would secure the necessary experience for future development, in conjunction with what is described as the subsequent triennial elections.</P>
    <P>Now, we believe that if there is to be a democratically elected board it should be elected right from the beginning and there should not be a period &mdash;the most vital period really because it is during that period that the first appointment of officers and servants of the board will be made &mdash; in which there will not be a properly elected democratic board.  If the first suggestion is adopted, all the officers and servants will be appointed before any properly elected persons come to take control. I merely argue that point for the moment in order to get the Minister's reaction.  I am sure other speakers will have much more to say on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy's gloomy forecast about others having much more to say about it will not materialise because I do not think there is any very great difficulty here. We discussed this matter fully on the Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, the board will be established before the new Irish Coursing Club constitution comes into effect. It was suggested, I think, by certain Deputies that the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club should take effect before the Bill comes into operation and I tried to make it clear that, while I accept the doctrine that we ought to have a new departure, I think we ought at the same time to try to provide continuity so as not have arising conceivably a situation in which the whole management of the greyhound racing business here would undergo an upheaval.  Therefore, I suggested that we should allow the business of the reconstitution of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club to be considered over a period of two and a half years and, if any member of the Greyhound Board failed to secure election to the Control Board of the Irish Coursing Club, he would thereupon cease to be a member of either body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies will agree, on reflection, that no matter how urgently <Col N="412" /> one wants to reconstitute an organisation in being, it is foolish to proceed with such rapidity that one may upset the whole apple cart.  It is much better to proceed in stages.  It will only take two and a half years for the whole of this executive of the Irish Coursing Club to submit itself to the clubs and race tracks under the new constitution for re-election, or rejection, in three stages &mdash; seven retiring six months after the Bill coming into operation and submitting themselves for election, seven 12 months after that and seven 12 months after that again.  If any of the four members from the controlling body of the Irish Coursing Club or the Racing Board fails to secure re-election at the hands of the clubs and tracks he automatically ceases to be a member of the control board.  I would suggest that is the reasonable way to go about it.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to remember that we agreed to set up this tribunal of inquiry for the purpose of putting this industry on a permanent basis. We had a very searching inquiry into the whole set-up and, after protracted discussion, with which Deputy Walsh is familiar a <i>modus vivendi</i> was arrived at which enables us to secure the installation of a new executive of the Irish Coursing Club, and a new board for the purpose of this Bill, when it becomes law, on what are substantially agreed terms and conditions, subject to the overriding condition that over a period of two and a half years all persons eligible to represent the Irish Coursing Club on the control board will have been elected under the new rules at the hands of those engaged in the sport.  I think that is a good plan.  It avoids revolutions while, at the same time, securing reforms.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not think that, in rearranging matters of this kind, such as are dealt with in this Bill, one can ever get satisfactory results by precipitating violent revolutions because, though one may attain, or try to attain, an objective with greater expedition than a process of reform would allow, one will tread upon so many people's susceptibilities and upset so many people that one will create a great deal more annoyance than if one proceeds in gradual stages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> The scheme envisaged in the Bill is that the existing standing committee will retire in three stages over a two-and-a-half-year period.  It is desirable to maintain some degree of continuity and we are going a good deal further in this Bill in regard to the greyhound industry than we went in the Racing Act when we were constituting the new Racing Board.  Deputies will remember in that case we did not impose any obligation on the National Hunt Committee and the Turf Club to reconstitute themselves at all.  We require the executive of the Irish Coursing Club, over a two-and-a-half-year period, to submit themselves to an entirely new form of election which, I think, will guarantee a truly representative character to the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  In so far as the 100 nominated members are concerned, I think their numbers are to be reduced to 50 and their functions, except those in an advisory capacity, will be abolished.  In all the circumstances, I suggest to Deputies that this is a reasonable plan of steady but gradual reform and is best calculated to achieve the purposes that most of us have in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything revolutionary in suggesting that this organisation, which it is intended to set up, be established now before the board is appointed.  It is the intention to reorganise the Irish Coursing Club later on by having clubs and club representatives appointed to the provincial council and from that on to the executive.  What the Minister suggests doing here is that the old Irish Coursing Club, which has been condemned in the report that has been submitted to the Minister and in regard to which the Minister has taken action in introducing this Bill to the House, should be reappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister, having regard to their failure to do their duty by the people who are interested in the industry, to make a complete change. It is not revolutionary.  You are not going to have any outside body coming in to take control of the greyhound industry by doing what is suggested in the amendment.  The people appointed to the new executive are people who <Col N="414" /> have already been connected with the greyhound industry who must be members of clubs; as a matter of fact the co-opted members &mdash; co-opted is the word I choose rather than elected &mdash; are members of coursing clubs.  In order to run dogs at coursing meetings or on a track, they must be members of a recognised club so that they are members already but they are not the elected representatives of that particular club.  They have just been co-opted to the board of the Irish Coursing Club or to the standing committee or to the Irish Coursing Club itself.  Why should the people who are directly responsible, who have been elected in a democratic way not be the people made responsible for the carrying out of the functions in connection with coursing and greyhound racing generally and become members of the board?</P>
    <P>If these people that the Minister has in mind want to become members of the standing committee, want to become members of the board, or to make themselves eligible to become members of the board there is nothing to prevent their doing so.  They can go before their club, get themselves elected, become members of the provincial council and then go on to the executive council.  That is all we are asking, that it should be done in a democratic way.</P>
    <P>The standing committee, as at present constituted, is composed of 16 co-opted members and five members who are representatives of clubs.  I take it, it would be rather significant if some one, or possibly two, are not to be on the board.  Would it not be far better, and would there not be more justification, to have them elected representatives of the people who are engaged in the industry?  At the moment, they cannot say they are.  I know they are members of the clubs.  You might have people who are members not merely of one club but of five or six clubs in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Why is it that these people will not go before the other members of the club and have themselves elected in a proper way?  This does not interfere with the Minister in making his appointments.  All it does mean is that the people who in future will represent <Col N="415" /> the greyhound industry have been democratically elected by the members of the club, by the provincial council and the executive which it is proposed to set up.  There is nothing revolutionary or unreasonable in the amendment. I believe it will strengthen the committee and make it more acceptable to the people in the country if it is accepted.</P>

      <P>I would like to make it clear to the Deputy that there is no question of principle involved here because the ultimate result is going to be the same in that the 21 members of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club will be persons elected under the new constitution.  The real question at issue between us is: should we do that at one jump now or should we do it in three stages so as to preserve some degree of continuity?</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that where you are adjusting yourself to a new situation, where you are carrying into effect by statute a pretty comprehensive code of reform, there are two ways by which you can do it&mdash;that is by uprooting everything that is there and try to build a completely new structure without any guarantee at all of what the nature of the new structure is going to be; or the alternative method, gradually to alter the structure into the form the Legislature thinks it ought to have, with perfect certainty that over a period that continuity may be preserved. There is no issue of principle involved here at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>By lot.  Seven would go out at the first election, seven at the second election and seven at the third election.  In that way you preserve a degree of continuity which is surely desirable, now that a very important industry admittedly has grown out of the scope for which the executive of the Irish Coursing Club was originally designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make this appeal to Deputies? This is a Bill about the principle of which we have got substantial agreement. <Col N="416" /> There is ample scope in the course of the Committee Stage of this Bill for people to say things calculated to give the most bitter personal offence to persons intimately associated with the industry.  I am proceeding on the assumption that we all want to get this whole greyhound business on a satisfactory basis, then let it run itself and let the Legislature get out of it as much as we can.  Would I trespass too far on the indulgence of my colleagues if I asked them, in so far as they can, to refrain from severe animadversion on the status that has obtained up to now? Whatever it was, the greyhound industry is there.  But for many people, it would not be there at all.  We would not want this Bill if certain regulative measures were not required.  I cannot think that Deputies on the far side believe it to be, in general principle, desirable to wipe out the whole existing executive and to bring in an entirely new one.  Surely it is manifest that it is desirable to maintain some continuity of the council provided we have the overriding assurance that, within a limited and definitely ascertained time, there will be a completely new council founded on strictly representative principles.</P>
    <P>I can see that, if you were arguing logic <i>in vacuo</i>, you could make the case: if the present situation is not satisfactory, why not change it now?  I think the only answer is that it is rarely good to tear a building to pieces and to try to put up a brand new one in its place.  It is much better, if you can, to change the thing by degrees provided you are certain that there is a limit to the period in which the complete change must be made.  There is a strict limit in this Bill and I suggest to Deputies that this is a reasonable way to go about it so as to get, in the end, a satisfactory representative body functioning as the executive of the Irish Coursing Club and still preserving the thread of continuity so that there will not be any upheaval which may wreak great disadvantage to the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am not asking Deputies on any side of the House to approve or disapprove of the régime that has gone before but would I trespass too far on the goodwill of Deputies if I asked them to <Col N="417" /> bear in mind that this Bill is designed to create a new departure?  There is a body of men who operated this industry since 1916, when they separated it from the British Coursing Club, and they carried it on down to to-day.  Many of us will approve and many of us will disapprove of some things that were done.  If everything were perfect, this Bill would not be necessary.  But we all know they constituted themselves originally to deal with coursing and, because there was no other body to control greyhound racing, when it became popular after the first World War, this body took over the responsibility for greyhound racing which mushroomed up into something very much larger and more difficult than they anticipated when they first put their hand to its control.</P>
    <P>I wish we could get this Bill through the House with the reasonable goodwill of all the parties associated with this industry so that, without trampling on anybody's susceptibilities unnecessarily, we all could feel that, when this legislation was enacted, we could float all these people off and say to them: &ldquo;You have the machine to run your industry satisfactorily and, if you do not, it is your own funeral.  The Legislature will not do any more about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would suggest to Deputies that, instead of asking for the strict letter of logic in regard to this matter, they would accept that the gradual process of reform is better than the revolutionary one.  I think you can make a case that you ought to have the first 21 members of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club elected as the whole existing executive put to the hazard of election without more ado but a much stronger case can be made, in the interests of the industry itself, in the interests of continuity, for postponing by three stages the change of the entire body from its existing system of choice to that of democratic choice by the race tracks and coursing clubs of the provinces. That is the argument and I would strongly recommend to Deputies not to press the view that the whole existing executive of 21 should be swept aside and a new one appointed <i>in toto</i> at one go.  From the point of view of the industry, it would be <Col N="418" /> infinitely better to do this thing in three stages, so long as we have the assurance in the end that, once the process has been initiated, it must proceed within two and a half years' time to completion.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister does not think for a moment that, if there was a change in the morning, the 21 members of the standing committee would disappear overnight?  I can envisage at least 11 or 12, possibly 13, of them coming back and the continuity that the Minister speaks of will be preserved but, when they do go back, they can say that they represent somebody.  At the moment they represent nobody but themselves.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of trying to make this Bill a Bill that will be of some advantage to the industry.  That is why I have been pressing that this reorganisation scheme should take place before any members are selected to form a new board.  Even the Minister's suggestion on Second Reading was that it is quite possible that some of the co-opted members would be put on the board at present, but they must submit themselves for election within a period of six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no good.  If it were good, I would have accepted it, but it is not any good because they have already laid down the scheme that is to be followed by that board; they have made all the appointments. All the appointments will be made within that six months.  Permits will be issued to coursing clubs; permits will be issued to tracks and the general regulations that will govern greyhound racing, coursing, and the appointments for the future will be made by that board, but the Minister has no means of knowing whether these people are acceptable to the greyhound industry generally until after the first six months, until they have either succeeded in being elected by some coursing club to be their representative or have been defeated.  It is only after the six months that all the damage that could possibly be done will have been done.  That is why I am pressing <Col N="419" /> that reorganisation should take place first.</P>
      <P>There will not be any break in continuity as far as the majority of the present standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club are concerned. There will be members re-elected.  I believe that more than half would go back if they submitted themselves to the various clubs of which they are members for election.  What they do not want to do is to oust somebody else or to put out the man who has been representing that club for years. They do not want to do that at the moment.  They want to be regarded as free lances.  I would put them to the trouble and inconvenience of having their names submitted for election in the democratic way and, when that is done, the Minister can say: &ldquo;We have now a board that is truly representative of the greyhound industry and the people engaged in that industry.&rdquo;  That is why I would like the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I find myself in agreement with Deputy Walsh that probably the majority of the executive committee would be the same people, but I do not think Deputy Walsh is aware of the fact that this is the kind of organisation that lifted itself up by its own bootlaces.  It did all the organising for this sport.  I doubt very much whether all of the clubs mentioned as being in existence throughout the country hold meetings.  I think very many of them exist only on paper.  At any rate, there is no magnificent water-tight organisation in regard to these clubs throughout the country, and frankly I think you would get any kind of a result if you said: &ldquo;Now is the day we are going to make the change.&rdquo;  I have listened to an awful lot about it; I have been a member of the organisation myself, and my conclusion is that you will have the same personalities and the same members now on the Irish Coursing Club as you had in the past.  I am perfectly satisfied about that.  I do not know who the additions will be or from where they will come.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one point in connection with Deputy <Col N="420" /> Barry's statement.  In Section 35, there is provision whereby the members of the executive committee shall be appointed by the provincial committees of the club from among the representative members of the club in their respective provinces.  In that case the paper club people of whom Deputy Barry spoke would not have any right to sit on the executive committee.</P>

      <P>When I used the words &ldquo;paper club&rdquo; I meant that possibly there were clubs which did not hold meetings but which held a coursing meeting in a district each year. Such a club is a sporting organisation. In a parish or district there may be two or three people like Deputy Walsh, Deputy Briscoe and myself who would agree to apply to hold a meeting next year.  They would then apply to the Irish Coursing Club and would hold their meeting.  All this thing has come out of Sunday sport and in country towns, as Deputy MacCarthy is aware, a coursing meeting is held once a year in a friendly informal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Coursing Club was constituted to look after a sport.  It was a number of men who were interested and fond of the sport.  It was easy enough until the entry of this greyhound racing in 1927 and 1928 and the fact of the matter is that the Irish Coursing Club had not the power to regulate, or control or stamp out the wrong-doing which accompanied the advent of this new game.  This Bill is an attempt to give somebody the power which the old Irish Coursing Club lacked of stamping out the wrong-doing. As far as the coursing meetings are concerned, they have been a perfectly clean and good game and are likely to remain so.  But the Irish Coursing Club has been talked about in atmospheres like that which was created here when this Bill was before the House previously when the Irish Coursing Club was labelled as a group of men who had done great wrong in the past.  That is not correct, as people who know the situation are aware. Perforce, wrong things in the greyhound sport were tolerated, because the Irish Coursing Club was not constituted to deal with them.  Such things were thrown on top of them and <Col N="421" /> they attempted foolishly to regulate them.  They had no legal powers and when they did take offenders to courts they were unable to obtain punishments that were deserved.  The whole system of the law in relation to greyhound racing prevented the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps it does to the National Hunt Club.  The Irish Coursing Club was started to control money-less coursing and when the moneyed side of the sport came along with its accompanying wrong-doing they found themselves unable to deal with everything. The value of dogs increased enormously but that was a good thing on the whole.  However, the Irish Coursing Club had no weapons, no rules and no power to deal with the wrong-doing which must have crept into a sport into which so much money of a lurid type flowed.  Whatever we do now I think we shall find ourselves with the same Irish Coursing Club&mdash; the same personalities and the same men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great care to what the Minister said in connection with this amendment to find a substitute for Section 6.  First of all the Minister says that we should try to produce a Bill that will be for the general good of the industry and that we should try to keep away from taxing individuals and groups.  In approaching this amendment I shall look at it in that way.  The Minister talked about the necessity to bring about this change in order to avoid an upheaval.  I cannot see how it is not possible to have a properly democratically elected board of persons with executive control set up in a shorter <Col N="422" /> period than is suggested.  I would have some sympathy if the Minister had in the Bill say, under Section 9, provision for a temporary body of men to care-take while this change is taking place.</P>
      <P>The three stages to which the Minister referred become necessary because of the manner in which the Bill is framed.  Deputy Barry quite rightly said that, though there are ostensibly four areas in which groups of clubs operate, there may be in some areas or part of other areas, from a practical point of view, non-existent clubs, but if there were a caretaker body set up to see that only such clubs existed as would comply with requirements of the Irish Coursing Club rules I would understand it.  It should be provided that only those clubs that are properly qualified would have a right to have elections for the purpose of sending representatives to the top level body.  The Minister said it would be impossible to get proper results from the method of election which he termed revolutionary.  The caretaker body to which I have referred would guard against this.</P>
      <P>The members of every club in every area would then have an opportunity of studying the Act and studying all that is necessary for all concerned and would be better able to choose a member either from their own club or support a member from another club to be the candidate.  If that candidate were elected he would be qualified to carry out the rules and regulations in their interests generally and in ancillary matters which now come into the Bill.  If the Minister were to suggest something of that nature one could understand it but I do not think it is possible&mdash;speaking personally it is not possible&mdash;to compromise the situation. I agree we should not go into a discussion, if you like, on what has happened in the past but Deputy Barry came along and introduced the very thing the Minister says should not be introduced. He has condemned, in his little intervention, the race track owners, those who are concerned with greyhound racing as distinct from coursing. If it is to be done that way how are we to approach it from the proper point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> I believe the Minister himself must have some appreciation of the fact that there has been&mdash;and more so in recent years&mdash;some semblance of control in existence.  Authority has been exercised very thoroughly regarding the licensing of tracks and refusal to licence tracks.  Large numbers of wrongdoers have been warned off and the authority was able to enforce its decision.  The suggestion that no authority exists is not in accordance with the facts.  There may have been great difficulties to overcome in reaching that decision, but it does not get away from the difficulty&mdash;as Deputy Walsh has pointed out&mdash;that the moment the Minister has set up this board, even if it is only for a limited period of one to two-and-a-half-years, they will have established, and by force of law, the rules regarding licensing, appointments and so forth so that when the other body of elected representatives ultimately comes along they will possibly have to take over commitments which they might not have agreed to had they been in authority at the time the decisions were made.</P>
    <P>I come back then to this investigation which has resulted in this Bill.  It has taken quite a few years from the time the investigation was begun until the report was received and until the present Minister decided to act on that report as best he could.  It has taken years to do that: why then is there suddenly the necessity of bringing into being by the methods suggested in the Bill a board which is not what is ultimately required according to the recommendations of the advisory committee and the Bill itself&mdash;an elected body representing the interests of the greyhound business from beginning to end?</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say, if the worst comes to the worst, if it is not imperative for some reasons unknown to me that this board should operate almost simultaneously with the passing of the Bill into law, we can&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is the Minister who appoints the board, who will appoint the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am saying he should not appoint the board <Col N="424" /> until these elections take place.  That is the difference between us.  If the Minister appoints the board before the elections take place, although they may to a great extent be the same people as those who already occupy these positions, I say it should be done on the basis of the choice of the members of each of the clubs in each of the areas.  Both Deputy Walsh and Deputy Barry, who have a great deal more knowledge of what takes place on the coursing side of the industry than I shall ever have, agree it is more than possible that the names of elected representatives from which the Minister will make his selection will be, to a great extent, the same as those already there.  I cannot understand if the Minister does not agree with the immediate election and if he does not agree with some interim body just to supervise the creation of the first election machinery, why he will not postpone it and allow present representatives to continue to operate until after the Bill is passed.  Let us pass the Bill and let the election take place but let the appointed day for the election be a year from now or six months after the passing of the Bill.  It does not follow that you must necessarily wait a year or a year-and-a-half or two years to have these particular elections.</P>
      <P>I am not at all convinced that the Minister's method is the best one or even a good one.  I am convinced that the basis of control of an organisation can only be created at its birth.  If you start off on the basis of this Bill there will always be a hang-over from what was done by those who were in control for a period of years because they would have laid certain foundations without any authority from the individual members of the organisation.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a word about this amendment.  I was not here for the previous stage but I read the debate carefully.  Arising out of this amendment it appears that the scapegoat of the whole business is to be the Irish Coursing Club.  They do not appear to be fit for anything and Deputy Briscoe closed by saying they would be people without authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say that when a group <Col N="425" /> of men came together in 1916 to try to control coursing as it was then, it was time that something was done.  I would like to be able to say a word of tribute to those who came together at that time because those were the days of the gangs.  The group of men who afterwards called themselves the Irish Coursing Club were justified and did great work.  I am not briefed by anybody to come here&mdash;I remember this well.  I remember people near and dear to me being cheated and bested and this group of men came together, a fine lot of decent men, formerly members of this House.  Dinny Gorey was one of them.  There were Tom Morris, Hugh McAlinden and Tom Harte of Kildare.  I could name the most of them.  I do not think that these men's names and fame should have been dragged about in this derogatory way in this House.  I would like to pay that tribute to them.</P>
    <P>I would like to say this about the Irish Coursing Club.  They have endeavoured to bring discipline into the greyhound industry.  When that industry started in Ireland, a great number of undesirable people came into it and some queer things happened on tracks.  The Irish Coursing Club did the best they could and their best was not good enough.  I admit that but at the same time I consider that they should have representation on the board such as this Bill sets out.  I do not know anyone else in this country that would be fit to take that representation from them.</P>

Anybody that sets out to discipline anything will be unpopular, just like the schoolteacher.  That is one of the reasons why the Irish Coursing Club is unpopular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coursing clubs are there throughout the country and when this Bill becomes law&mdash;I know it has the goodwill of nearly everybody in the House <Col N="426" /> who wants to see it passed&mdash;I am convinced that a great number of people who pay their subscriptions to the coursing clubs but will never go to a committee meeting or a general meeting will turn up to these meetings now because this Bill will give them an opportunity of putting people directly on to the board.</P>

      <P>In supporting this amendment, I would point out to the Minister that by having the elections before he appoints the new board he is avoiding the possibility of wasting the valuable time of a member whom he might now appoint.  If to-morrow he decides to appoint the board he will appoint four of the people on that board from the existing standing committee. We will take it that six months after these men have been appointed the Irish Coursing Club commences to reconstitute itself.  It could then happen that the four members chosen by the Minister as representing the existing standing committee would not be elected and we would then have them at the point that they would have debarred themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be elected.  We would have the position that after six months the four men whom the Minister had chosen from the standing committee would not be elected.  It is improbable that the whole four would not be elected but one of them might be defeated.  Surely it is logical to say that the valuable experience gained in those six or 12 months at the foundation of the board is really valuable experience and should not be wasted.  It would be a great hardship to have these men debarred from coming in.  The Minister might say that the same thing could happen under the recommended section but I think it is improbable that it would happen if this section is accepted by the Minister.  The reason I say that is that the Irish Coursing Club would have reconstituted itself under our section before the Minister would have appointed the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a 100 to one on that if a <Col N="427" /> member is put on the executive committee under the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club that he will be elected annually and thereby qualify and you will thus have what the Minister calls valuable continuity.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory notes accompanying the Bill, on the first page, Section 3 refers to the day on which the Greyhound Industry Board will be established under Section 6.  That day will precede the day on which the constitution of the Irish Coursing Club in the Schedule to the Bill will come into operation by virtue of an Order under Section 26 (6) of the Bill.  It will, for example, be necessary to allow time for making preliminary arrangements for the appointment of the first representative members under Article 2 of the constitution and for the preparation of rules for the purpose of Article 16 of the constitution. It appears that there will be quite a delay pending the selection of the establishment day by the Minister. Pending the decision on that establishment day there is quite a percentage of reorganisation work due to be done by the Irish Coursing Club.  If they have to do all that reorganisation work as set out in the Bill, surely the best thing to do would be to reorganise the whole set-up of the Irish Coursing Club as set out in the Schedule of the Act, and then let the Minister select his board from the representatives of the newly constituted club</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1956&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins) (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is intended to remove doubts that have been raised about the powers conferred on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1926 to make statutory regulations, issue licences and collect licence fees in respect of wireless telegraphy apparatus in vehicles.  Deputies will be aware that the High Court recently decided that a district justice was wrong in law in not convicting a man who had been prosecuted for having an unlicensed radio set in a motor car at a particular place.  However, two of the judges expressed the opinion&mdash;and they emphasised that they were giving an <Col N="430" /> opinion; not a court decision&mdash;that the wording of Section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, restricts the issue of licences for wireless telegraphy apparatus to apparatus &ldquo;in a specified place&rdquo; and that accordingly there is no power under the Act to issue licences for wireless apparatus in motor cars.</P>
    <P>On this view of the law every person who has or has had a wireless set in a car outside or away from premises already covered by a wireless licence has been breaking the law, whether or not he has held a separate licence for it.</P>
    <P>The Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1926 was intended to make provision, among other things&mdash;I am now about to quote from the Long Title&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... for the regulation and control of wireless telegraphy on land, at sea and in the air...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Moreover, Section 3 of the Act provides that subject to certain exceptions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person shall keep or have in his possession anywhere in Saorstát Éireann or in any ship or aircraft to which this section applies any apparatus for wireless telegraphy&rdquo;</P>
    <P>without a valid licence from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It seems clear that the Oireachtas intended that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should have the widest powers to issue licences for the keeping and possession of wireless telegraphy apparatus anywhere within our jurisdiction and that the reference to &ldquo;a specified place&rdquo; in Section 5 was not intended to restrict the Minister's powers to issue licences, but rather to ensure that each licence would be related to a particular address or place for the purpose of control.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs since 1927 have taken and acted upon that view which was and is a reasonable interpretation of the law. However, since doubts have been raised that it does not accord with the strict letter of the law, it is considered desirable to remove these doubts and that is the purpose of this Bill.  It is a very short Bill and deals only with the <Col N="431" /> issues raised in the recent High Court case.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that a vehicle shall be deemed to be a place separate and distinct from the premises in which that vehicle is ordinarily kept.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the retrospective operation of Section 2 and for the validation of the statutory regulations previously made, the licences issued and the licence fees collected in respect of wireless telegraphy apparatus in vehicles before the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Although retrospective legislation is objectionable in principle, I do not think that reasonable objection can be taken to it in this instance.  We are not in any event proposing to create a new offence or to impose a new burden retrospectively.  In so far as successive Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs since 1927 may have been assuming powers not conferred on them by the Act&mdash;I say &ldquo;may have been&rdquo; advisedly because the position is not at all free from doubt&mdash;they have been doing so in all good faith. Moreover, if they were wrong in assuming these powers, there has been and is no provision in law for having a wireless set in a vehicle and motorists who use or have used car radios have been committing an offence.  If so, this Act is needed to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, essential for the control of the use of wireless telegraphy that the Minister should have the same general powers of regulation and licensing in regard to vehicles that he undoubtedly has in regard to premises, ships and aircraft.  In other words, the Minister must have the machinery for licensing.  The Minister's power to fix the licence fees (if any) to be charged in particular circumstances by statutory regulations is already conceded in Section 6 of the 1926 Act. I mention this because representations have been received from certain quarters to abolish or reduce licence fees on car radios and this Bill may appear to be a rejection of these representations but that is not so.  It will <Col N="432" /> merely confirm the powers the Minister has been operating and under these powers he will still be free to deal with such representations on their merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, have no objection to this Bill since, as the Minister indicates, it does not prevent any representation we might like to make in the future in relation to the rate of wireless licence, whether in connection with vehicles or premises solely.  The Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, has operated fairly successfully over a long period and it is interesting to recall that when it was introduced the fact that Radio Éireann was constituted in the manner that it is, was due to rather an <i>ad hoc</i> situation.  It could quite easily have been that an independent corporation would have been established at that time.</P>
      <P>All lawyers detest retrospective legislation, and the less of it we have the better.  It would be a wonderful thing for the taxpayer if, every time a mistake of this kind was found, the taxpayer could derive benefit from it by means of some reserve fund established by the Minister for Finance over a period of years so that there would be a little bit of luck in all these matters. That is an entirely frivolous observation and it is obvious that the collection of motor car licences must be validated.  As no other matter can be discussed on this Bill, I understand, except this one question, may I say we have no objection to the Bill?</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining stages now.</P>

    <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> (1) There shall, by virtue of this section, be established immediately after the reconstruction of the Irish Coursing Club as provided in Section 26 of this Act, a board to be styled and known as the greyhound industry board to fulfil the functions assigned to it by this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley pointed out that if the four persons chosen from the executive of the Irish Coursing Club went up for election at the first election six months after the coming into operation of the Act and none of them succeeded in being elected, all four would have to go and I would have to choose four others from the board then consisting of seven elected members and 14 of the old members.  If my choice happened to fall on four of the 14 and four of them came out of the hat to stand for election at the end of 18 months and none of them succeeded they would also have to go.  Now, I understood Deputy Walsh to say that he foresaw that if the whole existing executive went for election to-morrow <i>en bloc</i> it is highly likely the majority of them would be elected back again.  I am trying to proceed on the assumption that we are all agreed in principle that something has to be done.  I am trying to proceed on the assumption that we are all agreed in principle that there are four substantial interests involved in this whole business and that if we were to get a good Act it is highly unlikely that it would please all four interests in all its details.</P>

      <P>I understand the general mind of this House is not to have futile proposals because something had to be done but to try to approach as near as we can to doing the best that could be done.  I feel greatly indebted to Deputy O'Malley who at an early stage in the <Col N="434" /> discussion said that any damn fool could stand up and tell you what not to do but that the most difficult thing is to tell you what should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is a further difficulty if you tell the Minister what should be done and he will not take any notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, this Bill represents a reasonable effort to do what is essential to be done without trying to rub anybody's nose in the mud or without trying to steam-roller anybody and yet ensure that in the long run there will be set up a body truly representative of all the legitimate interests who will have the duty of operating the industry properly.  My object has been to take the Minister clean out of this measure and to provide all sections of the industry with a machine and, if they want to work it properly, they can make a success of the industry and, if they want to run the industry to ruin, it is their own business.</P>
      <P>I think it must be conceded on all sides that whatever differences may have arisen in recent years, the Irish Coursing Club which established itself in 1916 to try to effectively control coursing as it then was, did a very good job.  It then undertook the wholly new problem of greyhound racing, having been originally designed to control coursing.  All are agreed that the problems and difficulties of racing probably became more formidable than the board as constituted was fully equipped to deal with.  Out of that difficulty the present situation has arisen.  The only difference between the proposal in the Bill and the proposal in the amendment is that the proposal in the Bill introduces the principle of gradualness, that instead of tearing everything down and putting something entirely new in its place, we should gradually change over from the old dispensation to the new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Walsh himself says that even if you did abolish the whole existing executive and sought to have a completely new one elected, most of the existing executive would come back.  I do not think I misinterpret him when I say that he says that that <Col N="435" /> is the highly likely result.  All I am trying to do is to guard against the unlikely result of there being a revolutionary change in the personnel of the controlling body of the Irish Coursing Club with the consequential disruption that will ensue.  I am simply seeking to have the change over from an undemocratic procedure of election, which past circumstances possibly rendered necessary, on to a new purely democratic basis in reasonable stages so as to preserve continuity.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies who share my solicitude for the welfare of this industry to remember that, if you want by statute to establish a new framework for an existing institution, if you have any regard for fundamental principles of freedom and liberty you try, in so far as circumstances will allow, to have some regard for the rights of existing persons in respect of whose business you are in fact legislating. I think the preservation of continuity as a general rule is a good thing.  I think revolutions very rarely produce satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>As far as I can understand, the only difference between us on the two sides of the House at the moment is: is the personnel of this body to be changed over a period of two and a half years or over a period of two and a half months?  The end result, in the opinion of Deputy Walsh, will be very probably much the same.  All I want is that we will take things in steps.  I would urge the House to accept my view in this regard so that continuity will be maintained so long as we have the assurance that at the end of two and a half years the board of control of the Irish Coursing Club will be chosen <i>in toto</i> on a strictly democratic basis by the clubs and tracks through their provincial bodies.</P>
    <P>I can, of course, see that there are two points of view about almost any question.  I have submitted this proposal to the House only after a protracted consideration and in the conviction that where you are seeking to reform an existing situation the policy of gradualness is infinitely preferable <Col N="436" /> to that of revolution and, on that basis, I strongly recommend the proposal contained in the Bill for the consideration of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to subscribe to the view that, if change is to come, the more gradual and effective it can be the better.  I am very glad to feel that the Minister will accept the siutation that this Bill will affect four major interests.  I want to tell the Minister that I do not at all subscribe to his belief that it is not possible to arrive at a very effective measure that will give satisfaction to each of the four sections and that will give a goodwill impetus to the success of the measure.  As the Committee Stage proceeds, I hope it will be possible, in the quietude of reasonable debate, to put that point of view to the House.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this Bill has been bedevilled and is now entering the forum in a way which will not serve the best interests of the people whom we are endeavouring to serve. We should be here trying to find the best possible basis for this measure. It is agreed in principle on all sides of the House that such a measure is necessary.  This is a Bill ideally suited to be the subject of a special committee. If it had been referred to a special committee it would have been possible in a non-acrimonious atmosphere to iron out certain differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do feel that if we get down to discussing this Bill now with the common purpose of serving the best interests of this widespread and varied industry, we would be serving the interests of everybody a lot better.  We should leave the thrust and parry of politics out of it.  There is only a matter of tweedledum and tweedledee between the Minister's amendment and the suggestions made from the Front Benches of the Opposition.  It is purely a question of whether it is going to be a sudden change or a gradual change, integrating in its ultimate analysis a slower eventual result.  I want to say before we begin discussing all the various amendments that I hope the Minister will preserve his measure and that my friends on this side and on <Col N="437" /> the other will approach the Bill on the basis of finding within its statutory provisions adequate and reasonable safeguards for all four sections involved &mdash;the Irish Coursing Club, the track owners, the bookmakers and the breeders&mdash;because I know that no matter what we may say in this House a few of us from all sides of the House could get together outside this chamber and have the difficulties ironed out in an hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust there has been no acrimony between the members on the other side of the House because certainly there has not been on this side.  We are not taking an enormous interest in this Bill from the political viewpoint.  We have friends here and outside who are interested in this industry in a very intimate way and I am trying only to ensure that the good prospects held out will not in any way be diminished by anything which we may do while discussing the Bill.  This Bill represents the first opportunity we really have had to try to organise greyhound breeding.  It deals with the breeding and showing of greyhounds, whether at coursing meetings or on tracks, in a way which will enable those interested in the industry to enjoy the utmost benefits.  This is the first chance we have had, particularly since greyhound racing came into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept from the Minister that this sort of change should be achieved by the adoption of the principle of gradualism to which the Minister refers, but the question therefore arises that if a person is going to erect a building, does he begin with the foundation or with the roof?  It seems to me that the question really at issue here in this amendment is that the Minister proposes to begin with the roof and perhaps to try and build the fabric before the foundation is laid.  If I were to try to ascertain what was the guiding principle upon which the Minister has proceeded in developing the provisions of this Bill I should think he would say that the first thing we had to do was to remove the greyhound industry <i>in toto</i> out of the atmosphere to which, unfortunately, it <Col N="438" /> has been tethered and confined hitherto.  He should have said that we have got to break down certain vested interests which, in a perfectly legitimate way, have grown up and asserted undue influence in the management and control of this industry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would expect the Minister to say that we should try to form the Irish Coursing Club into a reorganised body on a representative basis because, if you like, the Irish Coursing Club is a vital element in the sporting side of the industry.  I think that is the issue which is running through everything contained in the Schedule, particularly through Clause 4 of the Schedule.  The Minister is, of course, familiar with the change which provides for the virtual election of the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  But the provincial committees must be composed in such a way as will ensure that the executive committee reflects the general strength and development of the sporting side of the industry throughout the country.</P>
    <P>All we are asking in this amendment is that the Minister's proposal to reorganise and reconstitute the Irish Coursing Club upon a representative basis will be given effect to before the Minister sets up the Racing Board.  I think that an eminently reasonable proposal and I certainly did not think it would involve any undue delay.  At most, I should say the whole business of reorganising the Irish Coursing Club could be completed within 18 months or two years.  We have waited long enough for the Bill and there is no reason why we should be in such a hurry to set up a board that might be inconsistent with the principle which the Minister has chosen to try and make effective through this Bill.  For that reason I would like if the Minister would reconsider the suggestion put forward in our amendment.  I think the public reaction to the acceptance of a proposal of this kind would be very favourable.  It would certainly give those who are engaged in the industry as breeders and owners more confidence in the future than they are likely to have if they find that in fact the Racing Board of the future is dominated by the existing vested interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> I do not want to say anything that would reflect upon the persons who have been in charge of Irish coursing since 1916.  Naturally when people have been in power for a long time the people tend to resent the fact that they have been in power.  They like to put down the mighty from their seats, as we ourselves had good reason to know in 1948.  They would not like, therefore&mdash; I was going to say resent but it might be too strong a word&mdash;to see the existing interests in the Irish Coursing Club dominate the Racing Board as undoubtedly they will do if the Racing Board is set up before the Irish Coursing Club is reorganised.  For that reason I would hope the Minister would consider our amendment sympathetically. I think he will, on reflection, see that, as I have said, it is more consistent with the principle which has guided him in framing the Bill than Section 6 as it stands actually is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear to repeat arguments already submitted but I think it is relevant to point out to Deputy MacEntee the flaws in his argument.  On this board, I have undertaken under the Bill to choose four persons out of the 21 who constitute the executive of the Irish Coursing Club.  Of that 21 persons seven must go for election in the most democratic way at the end of six months.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, if my four chosen representatives on the board happened to be among the first seven out of the hat they have to go for re-election.  If one or all of them fails to return as representative members he ceases to be a member of the board.</P>

It would appear <Col N="440" /> that Deputy Briscoe apprehends that in this first six months irreparable damage might be done which could not be undone.  They can do nothing irrevocable, nothing that cannot be undone by the board at any time. Suppose two or three of the persons I nominate&mdash;remember I choose them out of 21 for nomination to the board&mdash; lose their positions on the executive of the Irish Coursing Club when they go to election and thus drop off the board, I have to put on three persons in their places from the remaining members of the Irish Coursing Club executive, now constituted of 14 surviving and seven elected members.  If those who had lost their position as members of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club had collaborated with the other members of the board to do something of which the people strongly disapproved the four new nominees on the board drawn from the executive of the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;as I think Deputy Walsh himself said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a good principle, that the clubs, in fact, should have the right to nominate 21 from whom four of the governing control board should be drawn by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I have tried to make the case, and I think I have made it, but no proposal for the regulation of an existing institution of this kind is likely to obtain universal assent.  This, I believe, is as near equity as we can reach and it has the guarantee in it that every nominee to this board from this category must ultimately submit himself to the process of popular election. If he does not survive that even though nominated by me he ceases to be a member of the board of control.</P>

I think I have explained my position in regard to every point that has been raised.  I see there are two points of view, but I assure the House that in the interests of continuity and ultimate good working I am convinced that what I propose here is the best plan and I will urge the House to reject the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Ormonde.</P>

      <P>The Minister's suggestions might appear attractive as an idea, but I think when you come down <Col N="442" /> to working them out in practice they would not be practicable.  My view of the matter is that if, after a certain period, seven of the 21 by lot submit themselves for election you must already have the fundamental organisation that is going to elect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>You must have the affiliated or registered clubs listed and then you have the machinery there right away to do the whole job democratically as soon as that state of affairs has been organised.  My view would be that from that point you are in the position immediately to appoint your provincial committees once you have the affiliated clubs registered and listed and give them the opportunity of having either a special meeting or an annual meeting where they will make their selections.  There is nothing then from that stage on to prevent the election of 21 members.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree it would be unwise to embark on that immediately without giving the individual clubs a chance, or time to organise.  I would rather that the present body continue over a period and that this work should go on at the same time in the various districts and provinces.  Then, say this time 12 months, you should be in a position to have the whole organisation set up and the nominations made because regardless of what we may say or do if we have a more or less <i>ad hoc</i> withdrawal of members from the executive, on the law of averages they may be distributed unevenly.  It could be that you would have five members from the one province or district and another province or district might not be in that election at all with the nomination they should have of the men they were going to vote for.  The Minister accepts, I am sure, that the law of averages would prevail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but at the same time I would suggest to the Minister that the idea which he has submitted to us is not going to give us the results we are looking for because <Col N="443" /> in two or in two and a half years we would have to be starting off all over again.  Certain people would have been given certain appointments, certain work would be done and certain permits would have been issued.  This Bill is the constitution and the clubs will form the view that their work should be going on in the meantime unless we give to a body with an elected minority and a nominated majority the power to rule all these things.  It is better to start at the foundation and to build up and to wait until we have the organisation intact before we start setting up the board of control which will make the by-laws and give permits to the clubs and tracks where they think the sport will be properly controlled and organised on a democratic basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that this is an amendment from outside of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's suggestion.  I think that what has just been said is a very potent argument for the Minister's point of view because Deputy MacCarthy is anxious that this new era come into being as soon as possible.  I am going to suggest to him that if, as has been suggested by Deputy MacEntee, there are certain vested interests that had too great control in the past, a continued position of flux before the establishment of the new board would surely allow these vested interests to use whatever powers they have to better advantage than they have ever used them before.  Surely if the Minister is going to bring about the establishment of the board quickly it will lead to an impetus that will get the provincial organisations under way far more quickly.  With the actual establishment of the board you will find that the various bodies who will be able to influence the election of the committee of the Irish Coursing Club will be most anxious to safeguard their own rights and to give effect to whatever powers <Col N="444" /> they have under the Constitution.  It will be their desire, in their own interest, to get the machinery into operation speedily and quickly.</P>
      <P>That is the case that Deputy MacCarthy was really making.  It is a question of approach and of deciding which approach is likely to give the most speedy result.  I feel that once you bring the board into operation you will find that all the various sub-bodies that integrate into the whole will begin to look after their own interests infinitely quicker than if we did not at once constitute the board.  If we leave the position in a state of flux you might find the inordinate delay, which we have already had, extended further and further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has heard a number of reasons why we object to Section 6 as framed and why we deem that democratic election at the beginning of the board is essential. If the Minister looks at sub-section (2) of Section 6 he will understand why some of the arguments are adduced. The Minister's idea is that from the present executive of the Irish Coursing Club he will select four nominees to be the majority of the board that is to come into existence.  Sub-section (2) points out that: &ldquo;The board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and an official seal (which shall be judicially noticed) and power to sue and be sued in its corporate name and to hold land.&rdquo;  In the interregnum period, until the democratic elections take place, so many things can be done which will be binding on the successors who will be the democratically elected representatives of all the clubs.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that this would be tantamount to the handing over to the present Irish Coursing Club complete control of the new board in its infant state and every action they take will be binding on their successors.  It is to avoid the possibility that these people might do something or many things which subsequently could be shown to be not in accordance with the wishes of the properly elected representatives that our amendment is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for Deputy Collins to put his interpretation on what Deputy <Col N="445" /> MacCarthy has said.  I do not agree that that is what Deputy MacCarthy meant.  Deputy MacCarthy was in complete accord with the amendment to Section 6 in the name of Deputy Ormonde.  The Minister has patiently listened to all these arguments and has very reluctantly come down to the points at issue between us.  There is a distinct issue.  It is nonsense to say that if there is to be a delay of six months or 12 months that that is going to end the possibility of saving this industry and of bringing the four interests concerned under the protection of the Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister recognise that there are four interests and that the properly elected representatives of those four interests will ultimately have representation on this board.  We will see that when we come to the section that refers to it but in the meantime there is a fundamental difference between the meaning of Section 6 and the meaning of amendment No. 2.  It must be related to sub-section (2) of Section 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The board could change its mind at any time even under sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the board selects an individual and gives him a job or position does not any successor body, if it wishes to change that appointment, leave itself open to a very substantial claim for compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  It depends on the conditions of the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the conditions are iron-bound, what then?  If the board selects first-class legal brains to draw up a contract which cannot be easily broken by the next group which comes along, is it not nonsense to say that any successor body will have the right to put that contract aside?  That contract will have the official seal of the board, judicially noted.  The contract will be a binding contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I have illustrated one particular facet.  The same argument applies <Col N="446" /> to licences.  There will be greyhound racing track licences.  It is not suggested by the Minister that in the interregnum, as I have described it, this board will refuse to license tracks.  If they so license tracks who can subsequently take away the licences provided the licensees carry out all the rules and regulations and submit to all the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to have another &ldquo;think&rdquo; in relation to this section.  He should recognise that there is an alternative, the alternative I have suggested.  If the Minister feels there must be some group, or body, at the helm for the purpose of ensuring all that Deputy MacCarthy envisages should take place and could take place, why not put in a caretaker, with no power of appointment and no power of committing himself to contracts until all the prerequisite arrangements have been made for election?  I do not think anyone could object to that course.  As the Bill is now framed, the Minister can appoint four members on a body of seven.  The Minister will have the responsibility of appointing the chairman. He will have the further responsibility of appointing the secretary. There will be an appointed board with full powers to lay all the foundation-stones for the running of an organisation which purports in the Bill to be a democratically elected board and which can never escape from whatever will be laid down for it by this elected or appointed board in the beginning.</P>

If it makes an unpropitious contract of the kind envisaged by the Deputy, its successor can revoke the contract, paying the penalty if needs be.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;One of the conditions precedent to introducing this legislation was that there should be incorporated in the Schedule to the Bill and submitted to Dáil Éireann a new constitution for the Irish Coursing Club which placed upon them the obligation for a period of two and a half years to secure an executive for the Irish Coursing Club, every single member of which would be democratically elected by the coursing clubs and racetracks in a fair proportion. Is there any other better way in which you can secure democratic control?</P>
      <P>Mr. Walsh: No. Do not appoint your board until you have that done.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: We are all agreed about that.  I think we are all agreed that if you get such a democratically controlled body it is a good thing that they should exercise a predominant influence.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: Then we are brought down to this point.  When you go to appoint the first board, do not give the undertaking that you will choose four of the seven members from the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  I want to remind the Deputies that Oireachtas Eireann passed the Horse Racing Bill in 1945 and this Oireachtas unanimously accepted the principle that we should give to the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Club an absolute majority on the racing board.&rdquo;</P>

The Minister is putting them in now for debate and we would like to know how far this will go.  I have something to say about some of these gentlemen in a moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The complaint is that it is altogether wrong to choose four members from this list beginning with Rahill and ending with O'Donoghue, with the additional proviso that these nominees must go for election at the hands of the clubs and racetracks within 30 months at the most.  But it was <Col N="452" /> perfectly right to provide under the Racing Act that, as regards the list of names I read out in connection with the Racing Board, the members being chosen by co-option, you should bind yourself for all time.  I am not arguing the merits of the arrangement that was made at the time the Racing Act was passed but I am trying to bring home the fact that my proposal simply is that from the list which I have read out for you of the members of the standing committee of the Coursing Club I will undertake to choose four persons.  I will do the choosing from that list and within 30 months of my choice every single one of them must undergo popular election at the hands of the coursing clubs and the tracks of their particular province.  If any one of them fails to be elected they will cease to be members of the board and I will have to choose somebody else to take his place.  Ultimately at the end of a two and a half year period every one of the four nominees of the Minister for Agriculture from the members of the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club must be persons democratically elected at the hands of those engaged in the sport.</P>
      <P>The only fundamental difference between us is that I believe that it is worth while preserving some continuity. As I interpret Deputy Walsh's intervention and Deputy Briscoe's intervention, they agree with me that if the executive of the Irish Coursing Club is elected it ought to have a majority on the board.</P>

What you did was, put in a provisional Government which would supervise the election to Parliament which would then elect a permanent Government.

There must be somebody to supervise the elections which are envisaged here in the case of the Irish Coursing Club and that body will be the new board.</P>

The <Col N="455" /> Minister read a long list of the membership of the Irish Turf Club.  In doing so he was careful to heap scorn upon these gentlemen because they had inherited, in some cases, British titles, in other cases they had British honours conferred upon them.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are very substantial ratepayers in this country, and have so remained, and have been good citizens, as we know and, despite the fact that some of them may have had British honours conferred on them, they have shown&mdash;not all of them, but some of them&mdash;that they are as good Irishmen as any who sits on either side of this House.  I do object to the manner in which the Minister selected a sample.  He did not give an exhaustive list of the Irish Turf Club.  If he had, he would have had to include in the membership the name of Mr. William T. Cosgrave, the father of his colleague in the cabinet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does it reflect upon him that he is associated in the Turf Club with some of the gentlemen whose names the Minister has bandied about quite unwarrantedly in this House?  He did not say that, at the time at which the Racing Board was constituted, the late Deputy Patrick Joseph Ruttledge was a member of the Irish Turf Club, a member who served <Col N="456" /> this country in arms&mdash;and I never heard that the Minister served this country with anything except his tongue&mdash;a man who was Minister for Justice in this country and who can at least claim to have broken the totalitarian movement with which some of the Ministers were associated.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there was Isidore J. Blake, Mr. J.G. Duggan, who I presume was known to many of us on each side of the House, Mr. J. P. Keane.  What is the use of the Minister getting up here and, because he has a bad case, trying to muddy the waters here and at the same time holding up to odium men who, whatever army they may have served and <Col N="457" /> whatever their occupation may have been, at least are citizens of this country and did not come into this debate one way or another until the Minister dragged them in.</P>
      <P>I do not want to add any acrimony to these discussions but, as a public man, I have a duty to the citizens of this country and I object very strongly to the sort of thing that we have had to listen to here this evening.</P>
      <P>To try to get back to the amendment, I want again to remind the House, through you, Sir, that the amendment under discussion is amendment No. 2, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall, by virtue of this section, be established immediately after the reconstruction of the Irish Coursing Club as provided in Section 26 of this Act, a board to be styled and known as the greyhound industry board to fulfil the functions assigned to it by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The critical phrase in that amendment is &ldquo;after the reconstruction of the Irish Coursing Club&rdquo;, and I would submit that the only thing really relevant is whether or not the Irish Racing Board should be established before or after the reconstruction of the Irish Coursing Club.  That is the only point at issue and that is really what we should be addressing ourselves to.  I do not think Deputy Seán Collins addressed himself to that.  He spoke about gradualism and referred to the fact that the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club was going to be reconstituted in three instalments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed to me that the Minister was labouring under the same misconception that we were debating amendment No. 3 and not amendment No. 2. I want again to stress that we are debating amendment No. 2 and that the only question arising out of that amendment is whether or not the greyhound industry board will be set up before or after the Irish Coursing Club has been reorganised and reconstituted. That is the only question at issue on this amendment.  It seems to me that we are going merely to make the election principle effective in relation to the constitution of the executive committee of the Irish <Col N="458" /> Coursing Club.  Then we should at least defer action in setting up a greyhound industry board until that reconstruction has been made effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the Greyhound Industry Board can do nothing which is irrevocable.  Of course if you want to suggest that a misconceived action can be reversed, if you want to face the consequences of that reversal whatever they may be, then the action is not irrevocable.  But as Deputy Briscoe has pointed out and as the Minister has been constrained to admit, things can be done by virtue of the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 6 and under Section 12 which, if the successors of the first members of the Racing Board attempted to revoke them, might involve the Racing Board in very substantial claims for compensation and for very substantial monetary payments.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister, with all due respect, realised what is involved. Under Section 4, as has been pointed out, the reconstitution of the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club upon a representative basis will not be completed for a period of two and a half years from the date upon which the Minister brings into effect Section 26 of the Bill.  I do not know whether in fact there is anything which binds the Minister to bring Section 26 into operation.  I have tried to get through the Bill but I have not been able to see anything which makes it mandatory upon the Minister to set on foot a reorganisation of the Irish Coursing Club on or from the date upon which he sets up the greyhound industry board and therefore it may be possible&mdash;of course I may be completely in error&mdash;for the Minister so to defer action in relation to Section 26 that the greyhound industry board might continue to exist with its personnel drawn from the council of the existing Irish Coursing Club, unreformed and unreorganised.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in that and if so the argument falls to the ground.  Under Section 12 the racing board or the greyhound industry board is empowered to purchase or take on lease land, to build, equip and maintain offices and other premises.  It is conceivable <Col N="459" /> that some of the buildings or offices or lands which the greyhound industry board might think it advisable to acquire or lease might belong to the Irish Coursing Club as it exists to-day.  I think that is a point to be borne in mind because it is conceivable that a conflict of interests may arise between the members of the greyhound industry board who are members of the Irish Coursing Club as members of the board, and other members of the Irish Coursing Club as members of the latter body.  That is a possibility.  I do not say that it is a probability.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy wait?  I shall read it in order to show the intelligence with which some Deputies studied this Bill and the sort of intelligence they bring into discussions. Sub-section (2) of Section 12 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board may sell or lease any offices or premises held by it which are no longer required for the due performance of its functions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So here is the position: The board, <Col N="460" /> composed of a majority of persons who are representatives of the Irish Coursing Club may acquire leases, <i>bona fide</i>, if the Deputy likes, may acquire some premises or some property belonging, say, to the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;and we know what a mess these properties are in.  They may acquire something and then the Deputy wants to suggest to me that as a safeguard against that we have sub-section (2) which would enable them to do this: first of all, to acquire&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come to the point I was trying to make.  I think I have shown to the House that there are circumstances in which a conflict of interest may arise.  I do not say it will arise but still the possibility is there and this conflict of interest may appear to arise even if it does not in truth arise.  For the first six months, at any rate, the Minister has told us that the members of the Irish Coursing Club would be members of the greyhound industry board and will function, the whole four of them, and they will be irremovable during that period.  The Minister then wants us to proceed on the assumption that because one-third <Col N="461" /> of the members of the executive committee have to retire after six months automatically the whole four of the members of the greyhound racing board&mdash;now, that was the implication and I do not think the Minister expected that we would really accept that position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That the whole four would retire at the end of six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the odds are two to one that not one of the four might retire for two and a half years because the first seven, or one-third, would be chosen by lot and, as I said, the odds on any one of these four being chosen among the first one-third to retire is two to one on.  The odds, strange to say, diminish in the next year and at the end of 12 months they become an even-money chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be paid if I won those bets.  The odds become an even money chance against any one of these four being drawn by lot to retire.  Therefore, as I say, there is a possibility&mdash;and a not insignificant possibility&mdash;that the first four members to be nominated by the Minister may continue in office for at least two and a half years.  During that period, which is the formative period of the board, there are bound to be discussions and negotiations between the greyhound board and the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club, which I think would be much better conducted, or at least would be much less open to the sort of criticism that will be made about what the board does if this amendment were accepted.  As the Minister has said himself, the board cannot satisfy everyone and every person who feels he ought to have benefited by the board's actions and who fails to benefit by the board's actions will go out and undoubtedly ascribe to <Col N="462" /> the board the meanest and least presentable motives.</P>
      <P>I would say that in the interests of the board itself it would be much better if this amendment were to be accepted and if the Minister were to defer setting up the greyhound board until after the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club has been reconstituted upon a truly representative basis.  That is the only question involved in this amendment.  Questions about how the board is to be constituted will arise on other lines but the only amendment before the House now is amendment No. 2, which deals with the simple question of timing, whether we shall set up the board before the Irish Coursing Club has been reorganised and reconstituted upon a properly representative basis or whether we should do as suggested in the Bill.</P>

      <P>That is the proposal that is put to me.  My answer to that is: I can get four honest men out of that list but, even though I choose four honest men, they all voluntarily put themselves on the hazard of popular election at the hands of the coursing clubs and tracks of the provinces from which they come.  That is the measure of my claim&mdash;that out of that 21 I can get four honest men.  But there is the additional safeguard that within two and a half years every one of them will have submitted themselves to popular election by those engaged in the industry, and I am rebuked by a Party which came into this House and laid it down that the majority of the Racing Board was to be chosen from the lists of the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, the names of only some of whose members I have read out&mdash;there are many other names on both lists&mdash;with this additional proviso that they were self-perpetuating and would never have to face defeat which the whole 21 <Col N="463" /> here are bound to face.  I can get four honest men out of that 21; I could get four times four honest men out of that 21.</P>

      <P>If Deputy MacEntee craves or desires acrimony or abusive language it need cause no dismay. Deputy MacEntee is very strong on throwing mud on Monday and banishing the recollection of what he did from his mind within a week.  The mud was thrown on the Second Stage of this Bill and I do not want to refresh Deputy MacEntee's memory about peculiar, hinting, slanderous mud he saw fit to throw.  The followup is to-day.  Now, what in the name of Providence interest has Deputy MacEntee in greyhounds?  The purpose is to come in and throw mud.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee threw <Col N="464" /> plenty of mud on the Second Stage of this Bill but I can say I would find it a damn sight easier to get four honest men from the list beginning with Barney Rahill and ending with P.F. O'Donoghue than I would in either of the other two lists.  If anyone does not like that he can lump it.</P>
      <P>We must bring this business to an end someway.  I have said my say and I stand on the position as I have tried to explain it.  I think Deputy MacEntee has succeeded in bringing a note of acrimony into what was a reasonably sensible discussion until he came in.  I ask the Dáil to reject the amendment and accept the alternative proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We came into the House in an effort to make this Bill work and to make it a Bill which will be in the interests of the industry. When speaking on the Second Stage I overlooked the fact that Deputy Barry was one of the men who signed the report.  The Minister states that he can find honest men on the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club but, according to Deputy Barry, when he signed that report which was presented to the Minister, these people were not capable of doing their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister now wants to regularise the work of these people in the future. That is just what he wants to do. However, if they have failed to do their job, is there now any guarantee that they are going to do better in the future?  We want to give an opportunity to the people who are interested in the greyhound industry to go on the standing committee so that they will be given a chance to sit on the board.  I do not want to be acrimonious in this debate.  I am trying to make the Bill a workable Bill, one that will be accepted by the people engaged in the industry as being the most workable Bill that this House could produce.  I believe that if the Minister accepts the amendment the Bill will be accepted as such by these people.  It is only a matter of giving to these 140 representatives of coursing clubs and tracks an opportunity, through the provincial councils, of electing their representatives to the standing committee and then the Minister <Col N="465" /> can select from that executive his representatives on the board.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister object to doing that?  What is urging him to refuse it?  It is not a question of time.  This can be done next week or in the next two weeks if there is a will to do it.  It is not going to hold up the Bill and if the Minister gets to work on it right now it will be done before the Bill leaves the House.  The clubs are affiliated and their representatives are known and it is only a question of approaching the provincial councils and having the councils appoint the executive.  If the Minister accepts the amendment they will get to work at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the Irish Coursing Club failed to control greyhound racing because they were not designed to control that sport. That is not a failure of character but a failure of organisation and this Bill proposes to set that organisation right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has accused me of throwing mud and of introducing acrimony into the debate. The foundation for that statement is that I reminded the House of what the Advisory Committee, which the Minister set up to investigate the greyhound racing industry, had said about the manner in which racing and coursing in this country had been conducted under the control of the Irish Coursing Club.  I have here a copy of the report which is signed, not only by Deputy Barry, but also by Mr. Peter P. Wilkinson.  He has not an O.B.E. or an M.C. but he has the confidence of the Minister for Agriculture.  We must take it that he is a man of substance and stamp.  On page 83 of that report <Col N="466" /> here is what the members of the Advisory Committee have to say as the final result of their final investigation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have found that no branch of the industry as at present conducted is entirely free from criticism. In connection with breeding and coursing, many well defined existing rules have not been enforced and have gradually come to be ignored, thus giving rise to irregularities and more or less serious abuses.  But it is in connection with greyhound racing that the most serious abuses have been practised with impunity, and it is here that the unsavoury atmosphere has been created, which unfortunately and undeservedly, has come to be associated with the greyhound industry as a whole.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry says that we might apply these words to other organisations.  We are not trying to reform other organisations this evening but we are trying to reform the Irish Coursing Club and to put the Irish greyhound industry and the sports associated with it on a firm and sound foundation.  I think there is no question of throwing mud. The Minister should face up to his responsibilities and give some weight to the words used by the committee which he himself appointed to investigate the industry.  For that reason, we are asking that the board should not be set up until the Irish Coursing Club has reformed itself.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Rural Electrification Charges&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that extra service charges should not have been and should not be imposed on persons availing of the rural electrification scheme, and calls on the Government to introduce the necessary amending legislation to abolish these charges with retrospective effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion which is before the House and which has been before it in connection with the special extra charges levied on those who wish to avail of rural electrification in some <Col N="469" /> outlying areas is a motion with which I find myself in very full agreement.  I know from experience in my own constituency and my own area that this extra burden being imposed on certain of our people is most unfair and unjust.  The Government's attitude to this motion apparently is that the extra charges cannot be evaded because there is no money at the moment and that if we did try to give these services to all and sundry irrespective of where they are situated, we would find others carrying the burden of them.</P>
      <P>Our point of view is that there was a subsidy given to the E.S.B. for the purposes of rural electrification.  That subsidy was originally in the region of £5,000,000.  That £5,000,000 was supposed at that time to represent half the estimated cost of giving rural electrification service to all of our people in rural Ireland.  Since then, as everyone knows, the costs have soared and are continuing to soar and the result some short while back was found to be that instead of £5,000,000 being required, in actual fact it was likely that £10,000,000 would be required for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The last Government, therefore, made provision for giving a further subsidy of £5,000,000 in the years to come to the E.S.B. for the purpose of rural electrification.  The present Government, shortly after assuming office found themselves in straitened circumstances and one of the first things they did was to wipe out the proposed subsidy for future rural electrification.  To really add weight to their argument they then decided that not only would they not pay a subsidy in the future but that the £5,000,000 already paid in the years past by a Fianna Fáil Government and later disbursed by the last Coalition Government, would also be paid back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we are being told here and have been told elsewhere at the time this subsidy was wiped out that it would not make any difference to the consumers of electricity in rural Ireland.  I want to ask the members in the Government to-day whether they can stand up in this House or elsewhere <Col N="470" /> and say that £10,000,000 can be taken from the E.S.B., that they should be deprived of this £10,000,000, and that nobody will feel the draught. The rural consumers and those who are not getting connections at the moment are the people who are feeling the draught and those who are consuming electricity now are paying more for it than they need normally pay if the present Government treated them in a just manner.</P>

For his enlightenment let me repeat that the E.S.B. are being deprived of the £10,000,000 which was being provided by Fianna Fáil, £5,000,000 of which had been paid to E.S.B. and is now being paid back by them.  The consumers of rural Ireland are paying that money back.  That money is being filched from the people of rural Ireland.  It is being stolen from them by the present Government. No matter what this Government or its supporters may say, that £10,000,000 must be found in charges under the rural scheme.  The electrification charges must be met by £10,000,000 extra in order to make up for the lack of subsidy and the paying back of the subsidy already paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies from the rural parts of the country and from the western seaboard in particular are well aware that there are and will be quite a number of their constituents in the different areas left without any connection to <Col N="471" /> the electricity supply.  The direct cause of that is the action of the present Government in wiping out that subsidy that was created in the first instance to help the people in rural Ireland, to make their lives brighter by helping to pay the cost of installing the system of electrification that they themselves were not in a position to bear.  That was Fianna Fáil's idea. The Coalition idea is that if you cannot pay for those services in rural Ireland then you can do without them.</P>
    <P>We want to find out from the Government to-night whether or not they have changed their views from those stated last Wednesday night when some of their spokesmen said that this £10,000,000 subsidy being wiped out will not impose any extra burden on the consumers in rural Ireland.  I want to know where the £10,000,000 to fill that gap will come from.  Is it not from the pockets of the consumers in rural Ireland?  Therefore, is it not logical and quite clear that these people are paying £10,000,000 which they would not have to pay if Fianna Fáil were in office to-day?</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the political capital it is possible to make out of this matter, the plain fact remains that there are people to-day without this service, who will not get the service while the present system of financing the E.S.B. is continued.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Lindsay, from North Mayo, last Wednesday night.  So far as oratory is concerned, Deputy Lindsay did himself full justice but I disagree with him when he says that there are no complaints in North Mayo in regard to availability of supply.  In Deputy Lindsay's home parish, not so many months ago, the people had been trying to get a supply. They did not have Deputy Lindsay there to tell them how to go about it. He has not done anything for these people in his own area.  Yet he told the House last Wednesday that he had no complaints.  It is possible that the reason he has not got complaints is that he is not there very often.  Anybody knowing anything about that particular constituency knows that around the western tip of North Mayo <Col N="472" /> there is no rural electrification and it does not appear that there will be any in the near future.  It looks as if, like the grassmeal factory in that district, it will be forgotten by this Government.</P>

      <P>Let us, once and for all, get from this Government, its henchmen, spokesmen and Cabinet Ministers an admission that, when they were stuck for money, the last time they came into office, the first class they nailed was the rural community; the first thing they did was to take £10,000,000 from the rural community. We want the people of rural Ireland to recognise that this subsidy was paid by the taxpayers, the majority of them city dwellers.  For years they had enjoyed the benefits of electrification. The rural dwellers needed electrification. It was thought fit to ask the taxpayers in the city to pay something towards bringing these benefits to their brothers in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has been used that those getting supply should pay for it. It is true that the taxpayers are helping out local communities in isolated areas.  That was the programme of Fianna Fáil.  The Coalition's programme is, if the community is isolated, let it remain isolated; if it will cost money, do not pay that money; if they do not like it, they can lump it and get out.  They are getting out, and quickly, as every Deputy from the West knows.  This <Col N="473" /> Government, through their niggardly withdrawal of the subsidy of £10,000,000 can lay to their doorstep a very great share of the blame for that new exodus to foreign lands.  People will not return because they see that under this Government there is no hope that their lot in rural localities will improve, as it would have been improved by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be something worse than white elephants if the Deputy visits the constituency.  These matters are not relevant to rural electrification and I shall not oblige Deputies who interrupt by leaving the question at issue.  The motion now before the House can be accepted by the Government and it can be agreed by this House that no special extra charges should be made for the installation of or connection with supply in rural areas.  The way to get the money required to give this service is to replace the subsidy that was promised and to wipe out the commitment the E.S.B. is being asked to undertake of paying back £5,000,000 that they had already got.  It is not asking too much of the Government that professes to be so very careful in looking after the interests of rural Ireland.  This is the eve of a by-election which they are fervently hoping to win, forlorn as that hope may be.  Surely this £10,000,000 that they filched from the rural communities a short time ago might be used, as they used public funds in the not so very distant past, in buying the votes of the community. Possibly it would be a good bargain if they said: &ldquo;Here is the £10,000,000 we took from you.  We will give it to <Col N="474" /> you for these charges now being levied in isolated areas.  The people of Kerry will get the benefit of that.&rdquo;  To do that would be a more honest attempt to win the election than the attempt now being made.</P>
      <P>I would strongly advocate that this motion should be accepted, with the best possible grace by the Government and that it be funded in the way I have suggested, by giving back to the E.S.B. the £10,000,000 provided by Fianna Fáil.  Then let the E.S.B. carry on the job in the way in which Fianna Fáil had outlined to help those least able to help themselves, to give electricity to all and sundry in rural Ireland about whom the Government seem to be so solicitous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have voted on the electric hare and heard the electric Deputy talking about the goodness of Fianna Fáil, we might discuss the motion as it is before us. Deputy McQuillan seeks to secure that these special charges should not be imposed on persons availing of rural electricity.  People availed of it when Deputy Lemass was Minister and they paid the self-same charges as they are now paying.  Furthermore, I cannot see anything in this motion which will help the down-trodden people about whom Deputy Blaney is so anxious. At least in the southern areas with which I am familiar, in the pockets into which the E.S.B. are slowly moving, we have no guarantee from the E.S.B. or from this motion that the E.S.B. will even consider going into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already in parts of South Cork, in relation to rural electrification, the E.S.B. have refused to develop certain pockets irrespective of the question of charges.  They have imposed increases in certain areas but they have refused altogether to go into other areas. While the motion may have a certain amount of justification, in relation to small pockets it is mere wishful thinking as regards rural electrification.  It is fantastic and extraordinary to come in here and talk so much about increases in charges which have occurred within the past 18 months or two years.  I am amazed if Deputy Blaney will say that the E.S.B., in <Col N="475" /> rural electrification, are charging higher now than they were two years ago.  We know it is not true in most cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney, who accuses the Government of negligence in this regard, had the opportunity of discussing this when he was perched on this side of the House supporting Deputy Lemass as Minister.  Of course, he will now go into the Lobby and vote against something that he and Deputy Lemass knew to be in existence when Deputy Lemass was Minister.  Deputy McQuillan wants to get this thing through and I have no intention of tying him to a quarter of an hour for his reply but I should like to say that the motion is a small one and would probably benefit very few people.</P>

It will be up to Deputy Lemass and his henchmen to bring in the big one but I should like to say that, please God, there will be before us before this Government leaves office more important motions in relation to the E.S.B. than that of Deputy McQuillan or of Deputy Lemass.</P>

      <P>Did it increase the outside charges?  No, not by a penny. When Fianna Fáil were in power they were the people who could give away £10,000,000 by one stroke of the pen. Despite their subsidy the charge to the rural consumer for electricity is the very same to-day as it then was.  They cannot have it both ways and it would <Col N="476" /> be better if Deputy Blaney realised that here he is not on a soap box in Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has my sympathy because I know quite well there are always outside areas that would be involved in the extra charge. But that was evident from the moment rural electrification started.  It was also evident from that time that there would be areas which would not be connected up.  More people may be implicated in the extra charges at the moment because rural electrification is now in its winding-up stages.  It is now going into the bad areas, the good areas having been selected first. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce said the other night, something may be done later to bring people in the outside areas into the scheme.  Deputy Blaney spoke about elephants&mdash;white ones and black ones.  When one talks about electricity in this House one must always associate it with the name of elephants because long ago when it was first mooted by the present Attorney-General, then Minister for Finance, the word &ldquo;elephant&rdquo; was a very much used one from the Fianna Fáil Party who are now so anxious to take credit for it all.  Not so long ago I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy saying they were responsible for rural electrification. He never associated it with the initiation of the Shannon Scheme. According to them, it was they, and they alone, who brought about rural electrification.  Yet, very well Deputy Lemass knows that the very first day electricity from the Shannon was mooted rural electrification was also thought of.</P>

As one whose sympathy is with this motion I would remind the House of the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Crotty, on behalf of the Minister here the other night to <Col N="477" /> the effect that, later on, it is the intention if possible to do something so that those so-called outside areas where extra charges are at present in force may be brought in.  But if Fianna Fáil tries to get away with it and say that because of the subsidy we have increased the charges on the people for rural electrification, such is not the case.  Fianna Fáil will not get away with that.  They can make up their minds about it.  Electricity is not to-day any dearer to the rural consumer and there is no extra charge to the man in the outside area other than what existed when the so-called Fianna Fáil Government was paying the subsidy, and applying the same charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is nearly time that we got a factual approach to this motion of mine.  There was nothing political in mind when this motion was thought up and put down, and I am sure Deputies on both sides of the House will agree that no matter what has happened in the course of the debate, it was not put down for any political motive.  If the Deputies care to go back over the Dáil Debates of the last four or five years, they will find questions from the Fine Gael Benches, from the Clann na Talmhan Benches, from Labour and from Fianna Fáil Benches asking the particular Minister for Industry and Commerce to intercede with the E.S.B. in order that the extra service charge imposed for the installation of rural electrification be reduced.  That appeal was made by Deputies from rural areas who were familiar with the problem and the hardships imposed on the people who live in isolated pockets or who are sandwiched between different areas of development initiated under the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only when it came to my notice in my own constituency that a grievous extra service charge, in many cases double the actual fixed charge, was imposed on these unfortunate people that I decided that I would put down a motion calling on whatever Government was in power to remove <Col N="478" /> this special service charge.  I felt at the time that I would have the support of all rural Deputies irrespective of their political Parties because if these Deputies were coming in, asking parliamentary questions and further supplementary questions of the particular Minister concerned, pointing out how unfairly this system has worked, it was not illogical for me to expect that they would support a motion that would prevent these charges from being imposed in future and at the same time ease the position for the rural consumers.</P>
    <P>However, as the debate developed we had cross-fire from both sides, and it amounted precisely to this: that the spokesmen on behalf of the Government, especially the Fine Gael Party, decided their attitude would be that as the special charge was imposed by Fianna Fáil why should they remove it?  That is the sum total of the debate that took place here.  If there is anything more stultifying or nauseating in public life at the moment it is this attitude that is evident in this House every day&mdash;&ldquo;Why did you not do it when in office?&rdquo;  Surely, if there is something that is a burden on the people in rural areas which was put on by any Government, is it not the duty of the incoming Government to remove that burden if possible and not to take up the attitude of criticising the people in opposition by saying: &ldquo;Why did you not do it, you imposed it?&rdquo; I am not holding any brief for the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worried what way Deputy Blaney or the Parliamentary Secretary looks.  What I am worried about is the people of the rural areas when I see Deputies coming into this House to play politics.  Whatever about generating electricity outside I do not want to start generating it here because there would be too many sparks flying, and I do not want to add to the hot air.  I want to get this on a reasonable basis, and I am convinced if this motion is left, as it should be left, to a free vote of the House that rural Deputies from all <Col N="479" /> Parties will support it.  I do not see any reason in the world why that should not be done in view of something which the Attorney-General said in the House the other night when he described this matter &ldquo;as a mere bagatelle.&rdquo;  He spoke at some length on this and as reported in Volume 154, No. 1, column 175, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks I must go on with what I have already remarked, that is, that reduction in the special charges spread over the whole body of electricity consumers would not make any great difference...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, without mentioning the word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; at all, the position is that if the extra charge that has been imposed is removed, it would not be any hardship on the consumers as a whole. That is the statement of the Attorney-General, who was a Minister in this Government from 1948 to 1951.  Surely, the members of his own Party are not going to contradict him.</P>
      <P>When the rural electrification scheme started, there were three points to remember with regard to initial development.  The first was that the E.S.B. should not lose on rural electrification; the second was that as far as the economic element was concerned, that would be met or carried by a State subsidy.  The third point was that where the capital cost of giving a supply in any case exceeded 16 times the fixed charge revenue, the extra service charge would operate. These are the three points to remember about conditions when rural electrification started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened since?  The last two points I have mentioned have disappeared.  The ratio of 16 to 1 has been changed on a number of occasions, in 1951 and again in 1952. That ratio went up from 16 to 1 to 20 to 1 and then to 24 to 1.  If it was found desirable to change that ratio on two occasions in order to ease the burden on rural consumers, surely there is nothing to suggest that these people who have to pay the extra service charge in outside areas should not be facilitated to some extent? <Col N="480" /> That is one point that has gone by the board, the ratio.</P>
    <P>Another point that has gone is the subsidy.  I do not care who likes or dislikes it but I maintain that so far, to my knowledge, the removal of the subsidy has not made any difference with regard to the installation cost in the particular areas of development by the E.S.B. I want to be quite frank about the situation so far as I know it but I am not discussing the areas involved in this case.  That has nothing to do with this motion which has regard to the people who are on the fringe of these areas.  That is what I want the Deputies to remember when it comes to making a decision.  This is a motion to remove a hardship on the people who live on the fringes of development areas.  Deputy McGilligan, the other night, spoke at length on this question and one of the points he put up was that if the motion was accepted the large houses and the big holders would get facilities that they did not deserve.  He even went so far as to suggest that there should be a form of means test imposed if the motion was carried.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody would agree with that but I defy anybody to show me, on the western seaboard, in Galway, Mayo, Kerry, Cork and Donegal, any number of big houses involved.  Those who are affected mostly by the motion are people with valuations of from £3 to £10, who are living at the end of a boreen and who happen to be one, two or three hundred yards from the end of the E.S.B. poles. Because a man is unlucky enough to be living there, does that mean that he should have to pay double the ordinary charge that other people have to pay for getting the facility of light and the other things that go with rural electrification?</P>
    <P>I am not going to enlarge on the question of emigration but the most important amenity that was ever brought to the rural areas is rural electrification.  It has changed the minds of the people for the better and it has given the one hope that I can see that a few people will, in the long run, now remain in the rural areas. <Col N="481" /> Let us ensure that the people who live in the most neglected areas will, as far as we can possibly manage it, continue to remain there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was worried that this motion of mine did not solve certain problems or bring in other matters in the South in which he is interested. I believe that bringing in a very far reaching measure here in the form of a private Deputy's motion would be rather foolhardy.  I would not dream of doing so unless I were able to argue the whole pros and cons of the matter. What I am trying to do, in my own small way, is to remedy a grievance that affects roughly 3 per cent. of the users of rural electrification.  The figure given to me, in the form of replies to questions I have asked, is that of the number who have already had rural electrification installed 3 per cent. are paying the extra service charge.  That figure of 3 per cent. will naturally rise to 6 or 8 per cent. when finality is reached with regard to rural electrification.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donnellan, suggests that I should have patience and do what the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Crotty, suggests&mdash;postpone this motion until rural electrification is complete.  Rural electrification will not be completed for a few years yet.  Is it suggested that when it is finished it is the intention to go back on these pockets, these isolated houses and small villages and give them the benefit of rural electrification without the extra service charge?  Is that the guarantee that is given?</P>

They show very little interest in rural Ireland when they do not send in here a Minister from rural Ireland instead of a city Deputy.</P>
      <P>All I want to say in conclusion is that I would ask the Government to accept this motion.  There is no use waiting until three or four years' time to put into operation what can very simply be done at the present time. This is simply a book-keeping arrangement. Deputy McGilligan described it as a mere bagatelle.  I would ask the Government to reconsider this motion in a more favourable way, so that the people in the areas yet to be developed will avail of rural electrification without delay and so that installations in rural Ireland will be completed in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, with a view to preserving the stock of game birds and to prevent poaching, Dáil Eireann is of opinion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  that the sale or purchase of all game birds and wild fowl <Col N="485" /> should be prohibited for a period of 21 days after the opening day of the appropriate shooting season:</P>
    <P>(b)  that the open season in respect of the following birds should be:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  wild duck, geese or plover &mdash;1st September to 12th February;</P>
    <P>(2)  partridge&mdash;1st November to 30th November;</P>
    <P>(3)  pheasant&mdash;1st November to 31st January;</P>
    <P>(c)  that, in addition to any other penalty which may be imposed, there should attach to a conviction for the offence of shooting or taking any game out of season, an obligatory suspension of the gun licence of the offender for a minimum period of 12 months, the offender to have the right, after the expiration of three months after conviction, to apply to the court for the removal of the suspension, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that, in addition to any other penalty which may be imposed, there should attach to the conviction of the holder of a game dealer's licence for the offence of purchasing any game birds or wild fowl out of season an obligatory suspension of such licence for a minimum period of six months.</P>
    <P>We move this motion not with a view to extending preservation or with a view to giving more encouragement to people to preserve; our view is that there is quite a lot of free shooting in Ireland and, please God, there always will be.  We introduce the motion because we feel the game laws need to be amended and that a discussion in Dáil Eireann is the right way to deal with the question.  We believe that the sale or purchase of game birds or wild fowl should be prohibited for a period of 21 days after the opening day of the shooting season.  Our reason is that it is a well known fact that on the evening of the 12th August or the evening of the first day of the pheasant shooting season or the evening of the opening day of any shooting season, it is possible in hotels <Col N="486" /> all over the country to sit down to a meal for which, of course, one pays rather more than the usual charge, and of which the main dish is a bird which was supposed to be shot that morning.  In fact, in nine cases out of ten that bird was not shot that morning; it was shot many days before or a few days before.</P>
    <P>This gives the poacher in the proper sense&mdash;and I would like to stress that, poacher in the proper sense&mdash;the opportunity to go out, shoot and dispose of the birds.  The professional poacher can dispose of his birds easily because the birds can be in a dealer's premises on the morning of the shooting season.  Particularly in regard to pheasant and partridge and grouse&mdash;I have no experience myself of grouse but I think the same applies&mdash;the first occasion on which the clutch of pheasants or the flock of grouse are shot at is the occasion when most birds can be shot.  Therefore, it is very easy, three, four or five days before the season, for the professional poacher to get up early in the morning, go out and shoot a whole clutch of birds knowing he can get money for them immediately.</P>
    <P>We believe it should not be possible legally for birds to be in a game dealer's premises on the first day of the shooting season nor for 21 days after.  No hotelier should be in a position to serve game birds until well after the start of the shooting season.  During the first days in which birds are shot at they are too easily killed.  It may be said that in the case of large preserves where birds are reared and where there are very heavy expenses, the sale of the birds themselves is part of the revenue which pays the keeper's wages and the general expenses of the shooting.  We believe that in most cases there would be no hardship on the owners of the shoots if this recommendation were carried out because most organised shoots do not take place in the first days of the shooting season.  Pheasants are driven when the leaves have left the trees and when the pheasants have gone into the coverts.  They are not driven in the open cornfields and fields of potatoes where they are found in the early days <Col N="487" /> of the season.  We think that the owners of large shoots would not be embarrassed in any way by not being in a position to sell birds until 21 days after the start of the season.</P>
    <P>With regard to open seasons, we believe that the season for wild duck, geese and plover should start on 1st September and not in mid-August as heretofore.  The plain reason for that is that ducks, particularly, are too easily shot in large numbers by professional poachers on the water or on the ground in the middle of August. We all know that they are called flappers. A person who can dispose of an entire flock of ducks in mid-August&mdash; that can be done at the present time&mdash; when these ducks, very often, are not fully developed, may go out and shoot them on the ground; one shot may kill six or seven birds and he can get his money for them the following morning. We think 1st September is a better date.</P>
    <P>With regard to partridge, we think 15th October, which is the relevant date at the moment, is not late enough. Partridge cannot get off the loose furrows, drills of potatoes and can be wiped out.  We believe that partridge shooting should start on 1st November.</P>
    <P>In all this matter, our aim is to stop the shooting of birds which are not fully developed.  Very often one may see a flock of pheasants in mid-November which are not fully developed.  There are more flocks of pheasants which are not fully developed than flocks which are fully developed. The 1st October was altogether too early.  When birds are not fully developed, they are less wary and can more easily be wiped out on the ground.  The professional poacher can dispose of these birds without difficulty. We want to make it impossible legally to dispose of these birds until they are wary.  We believe that in doing that we will not interrupt the activities of the holder of the large shoot.  There are a few large shoots in the country and we do not think that they are any harm.  They are very good as game sanctuaries.  Most of us cannot enjoy them but we do not begrudge those who can.  A large sanotuary, which is <Col N="488" /> really what a large shoot is, where birds are reared, is a wonderful help. Birds come outside the shoot and breed and intermingle with birds outside and thus create a higher level of bird life than there would be were it not for the large shoot or game sanctuary.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of the motion, reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...that, in addition to any other penalty which may be imposed, there should attach to a conviction for the offence of shooting or taking any game out of season, an obligatory suspension of the gun licence of the offender for a minimum period of 12 months, the offender to have the right, after the expiration of three months after conviction, to apply to the court for the removal of the suspension,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here again we feel that we do not want to touch anybody except the person who deliberately goes out to do the wrong thing.  A person who walks across a field and finds himself on preserved land is committing an ordinary offence.  It could happen to anyone. We are not worried about that.  We do think that the person who shoots game out of season should have a very salutary sentence imposed on him.  The most salutary sentence that can be imposed on a keen shooter is the suspension of his gun licence and the taking of his gun for a period.  We are not being too drastic.  We suggest that after the expiration of three months after conviction he should have the right to apply for the removal of suspension. That seems to be quite a mild way of dealing with such a case.  The fact that he has to apply to the court for the removal of the suspension, which will attract certain publicity, will make the applicant feel very much ashamed and he will hardly repeat the offence.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which I want to deal is the game dealer.  A game dealer seeks to get his livelihood from this sport and should be most concerned to conserve stocks.  Our suggestion, in paragraph (d)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that, in addition to any other penalty which may be imposed, there should attach to the conviction of the holder of a game dealer's <Col N="489" /> licence for the offence of purchasing any game birds or wild fowl out of season an obligatory suspension of such licence for a minimum period of six months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;seems to be the proper way to deal with offences by game dealers.  If a game dealer makes it easy for the man for whom we want to make it hard, namely, the professional poacher, to come to him with an entire flock of pheasants or young ducks and if he buys them from him, he deserves the most salutary sentence that can be imposed. The worst thing that can happen him is the removal of his licence for a period of six months.  Again, a man who seeks to supply hotels with game on the first day of the season, knowing that the hotels are buying the game in the knowledge that it has been shot out of season, deserves to have his licence suspended for a period of six months.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in case anybody should be misled by the motion, that we are not very interested in game preservation.  We regard it as good in places because it provides game sanctuaries but we are not interested in people who have preserves except to the extent of helping them to maintain in their preserves a high level of stock. We are out to make it hard for the professional poacher to ply his trade. There are too many of these people who will shoot pheasants off trees, too many who will shoot young flocks of ducks, having placed a little bit of grain at the edge of a stream; too many people who will go out before the shooting season and shoot birds in the knowledge that they can, even legally, dispose of them on the first morning of the shooting season.  There are too many people who will try to trap birds and shoot birds after the season has ended.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will state, in respect of the periods (i) 31st August, 1954, to 31st August, 1955, and (ii) 1st September, 1955, to 1st February, 1956, the total increased receipts obtained by millers as a result of the increase in the prices of offals following similar increases in the prices of imported offals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To my amazement, this was the reply I got from the Acting-Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While the accounts furnished to me by flour millers show total receipts from sales of offals, they do not distinguish the amounts received from offal sales at different price levels.  I am unable therefore to give the information sought by the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now the reason for that question was that I was anxious to find out what profit was gained by the Exchequer in exchange for the practical wiping out of the pig industry in this country.  Since this Government came in, the number of pigs in this country has been reduced by 153,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy quite definitely this evening, when he intimated his intention of raising this on the Adjournment, that he could raise the subject matter of the question only but that the results or the alleged results might not be discussed on the question as worded. The Deputy may make reference only to the figures asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  I wish to point out that on the 23rd March, 1955, the Minister for Industry and Commerce made the following statement in this House:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" />&ldquo;It was originally calculated that the reduction in flour and bread prices as from the 1st May, 1954, would add approximately £900,000 to the Bill for subsidy for the financial year 1954-55.  In actual fact, the reduction will cost £927,000 against which, however, can be offset items amounting to about £550,000&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is still making an argument in respect of certain alterations.  The Deputy asked specifically for certain figures.  Whatever may happen as a result of certain action by the Government does not arise now on this question.  The Deputy simply asked for figures and anything arising from the production of the figures may not be discussed on this question as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that if the Minister were able to give figures to this House on 23rd March, 1955&mdash;the figures I intend reading out now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not going to get past the Chair by reading out something of which the Chair has no knowledge in advance. He has asked for certain figures.  He says he has not been given these figures correctly or not at all.  All the Deputy is entitled to are certain figures he has asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the reply I got to-day stated that while the accounts furnished to the Minister showed total receipts from sales of offals, they did not distinguish the amounts received from offal sales at different price levels.  I am suggesting that this information for which I looked to-day is in the Minister's possession as I intend proving here now.  The Minister stated here on March 23rd last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Increases in the price of offals, from £20 to £23 per ton in September, 1954, to £24 10s. in December, 1954, and to £26 a ton in January, 1955, account for increased receipts by millers of approximately £170,000.  These increases followed similar increases in the prices of imported offals reflecting changes in the world price.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> If those increased receipts, got by increasing the price of home offals to the level of imported offals as suggested by the Minister, depriving the unfortunate pig feeder of £170,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is proposing to argue alleged results from the figures quoted.  He may simply get what he has asked for in his question and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another day for it, thank God.  If the Minister was able to give those figures showing those increases on March 23rd last, it shows that those figures were definitely given to him by the flour millers, otherwise we would not have been able to get the separate figure of £170,000.  I suggest that I should have got an answer here to the question which I put down for the purpose of getting certain information and I am saying the information has been withheld and wilfully withheld for a very definite purpose. We know that the price of offals now is far over £20 per ton, the price for which they were sold in September, 1954.  Millers are paid £5 or £6 higher to-day despite the fact that the price of wheat has been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is endeavouring to get past the ruling of the Chair.  If he does not confine himself to the subject matter of the question I must ask him to resume his seat.</P>

      <P>I can sympathise with Deputy Corry in this.  I know he wants to make certain statements and possibly to get certain information, and if he had been a little bit more careful in the drafting of the question he possibly would have had a little bit more scope.  Of course, he does not get the sympathy of anybody when he suggests <Col N="493" /> that I, as Acting-Minister, wilfully withheld information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Deputy's suggestions it is obvious that the Deputy does not know what he is talking about.  I propose to read out a statement and when Deputy Corry reflects on the information I shall give he will realise that he has got the wrong end of the stick.  I shall now read out this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In calculating the probable amount of flour subsidy payments in any financial year, account is taken of the probable receipts by flour millers from their sales of wheaten offals. When, as happened in March last, it becomes necessary to present a Supplementary Estimate for flour subsidy, the estimated receipts from offal sales are revised in the light of any price changes which may have occurred during the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Receipts from sales of offals are calculated on an estimated average weekly output of 1,700 tons of offals. By applying to this figure the price increases above £20 per ton which occurred subsequent to September, 1954, for the periods during which the various increases operated, it was calculated that the probable total receipts from offal sales in the financial year 1954-55 would be approximately £170,000 more than was originally estimated, and the supplementary sum required for subsidy payments in that year was abated accordingly.  It must be emphasised, however, that the figure of £170,000 was only an estimate based on the best information available at the time and for the purpose only of calculating the probable amount of payments on account of subsidy <Col N="494" /> likely to fall due in the financial year.</P>
    <P>Particulars of actual receipts by millers from offal sales could be got only by an examination of the millers' accounts.  As indicated in the reply to the Deputy's question, these accounts do not show separately the amounts derived from sales at different price levels, and so it would not be possible to indicate the extent to which increased receipts in any particular period might be due to higher offal prices rather than to a greater volume of sales.</P>
    <P>Adopting the same basis as that used in estimating the probable amount of subsidy payments in the financial year 1954-55 the increased receipts by millers from sales of wheaten offals from September 1954 to August 1955 have been calculated to amount to £431,000; and for the period from September 1955 to the 1st February 1956 to £186,000.</P>
    <P>It must again be pointed out, however, that these figures have been computed and depend for their validity on the following assumptions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  that the output of offals remained constant at 1,700 tons per week over the entire period;</P>
    <P>(2)  that the entire output of offals was sold each week, and;</P>
    <P>(3)  that there was no time lag in giving effect to price changes, and that each week's output was sold at the price ruling for that week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that statement should help Deputy Corry in any further question he wants to frame.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday 16th February, 1956.</P>
