    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he proposes to bring the Factories Act, 1955, into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Factories Act, 1955, can be brought into operation, a considerable number of Orders and Regulations must be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The advisory council set up under Section 127 of the Act has been fully occupied with the preparation of these Orders and Regulations and substantial progress has been made with the work.</P>
      <P>Whilst I cannot, as yet, indicate even an approximate date for the commencement of the Act, I may say that I shall be disappointed if I am not in a position to announce fairly soon that the Act will be brought into operation some time in the autumn.  I fear that one of the biggest obstacles to be overcome is the expeditious printing of the necessary Orders, Regulations, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether the Land Commission have yet prepared a scheme for the division of the Mullen estate, formerly owned by Patrick Kelly, Frenchpark, County Roscommon, and, if so, when it is likely to be put into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  Schemes have been drafted for these lands and are under consideration.  It is not possible to state with certainly when they will be allotted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands when a scheme will be prepared by the Land Commission for the allotment of the lands which were formerly the property of Mr. Thomas Brady, Drinane, Strokestown, County Roscommon, and have been in the hands of the Land Commission for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is in a position to state whether the difficulty that has delayed the acquisition of the Shaw estate, Tallagh, Belmullet, has yet been overcome, and, if so, when it is hoped that a scheme for the division of this estate will be ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Land Commission have obtained possession of these lands, but it is not yet possible to indicate when the lands will be divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will ask the Land Commission to investigate the number of non-residential small farms in the Attymass parish area with a view to their acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether the Land Commission have acquired the Ellison estate, Ballinabarna, Enniscorthy, and, if so, when it will be divided among smallholders in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Possession has been taken of this estate and it will be <Col N="1119" /> allotted as soon as practicable.  The claims of local smallholders will be fully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether the Land Commission have acquired the Brennan estate, Rockspring, Killanne, Enniscorthy, and, if so, when it will be divided among deserving applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the former holdings of Patrick Brennan at Springmount and Knockatober which have been transferred to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It is not yet possible to indicate when these lands will be divided, but there will be no avoidable delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this holding has been let by an auctioneer lately, while the small farmers of that area are waiting for land? It is causing a great grievance in the area that the Land Commission should take over the land and then start letting it in this way.  When they take over the land, they should divide it among the people of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes if the lands that are taken over in a particular area are not sufficient to relieve congestion in the locality, the Land Commission may have proceedings instituted for other lands so as to make a decent scheme in the area.  Pending such a scheme, they let the land they have on hand to the most deserving smallholders in the locality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether, in view of the recent widespread housing developments in the area and the building operations at present in progress, he will state when he proposes to provide a sub-post office in the Ballinlough Road area, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of a sub-post office in the Ballinlough area of Cork was deferred, pending the completion of the building <Col N="1120" /> programme in the district.  This deferment was necessary in order that the most suitable site for the office might be determined.  I am now having the matter re-examined and I shall communicate with the Deputy when my inquiries have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be put in the most suitable area and not too near the present one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are endeavouring to get the most suitable site and building is not proceeding as fast as we thought it would.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether arrangements have yet been made for the installation of an automatic telephone service in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative, though individual exchanges in County Donegal may be selected as suitable for early conversion to automatic working.  Generally speaking, improvements in trunk service must precede plans for automatic working, particularly in areas such as County Donegal where many exchanges are small and isolated and facilities for dialling of local calls would in consequence be of a very limited value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state the rates paid to sub-postmasters in respect of night services extended beyond the normal working hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-Postmasters are paid £18 per annum for providing telephone service between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. in addition to payment for the calls dealt with.  Where all-night service is provided additional payments are made as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>£65 per annum at offices with not more than 50 lines.</P>
      <P>£75 per annum at offices with from 51 to 100 lines.</P>
      <P>£80 per annum at offices with more than 100 lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Calls dealt with between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. are paid for at six times the day-time rate.</P>
    <P>All-night service is given by an &ldquo;on call&rdquo; arrangement and does not involve continuous attendance at the switchboard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that extra remuneration for all-night services does not justify the employment of extra assistance? Would the Minister consider giving a fee commensurate with the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot give any further information.  The amount varies according to the volume of business transacted at the office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any further information.  The organisation of the postmasters are meeting the Department in the course of the next two months to discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that considerable delay is occurring in the <Col N="1122" /> investigation of old age pension applications, and whether this delay has been caused by changes in the system of investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies learned, this morning, with deep regret of the death of Deputy William Davin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin was one of the few members who could claim the distinction of continuous membership of the Dáil from the year 1922.  His passing will be keenly felt by every Deputy in this House, irrespective of Party ties. For all that time he was one of the representatives for the constituency of Leix-Offaly.  His constituents will sadly miss him as well for his personal charm as for the unstinted service he gave to all who needed his help or advice.  For the entire period of 34 years during which he was a Deputy of Dáil Éireann he gave unremitting attention to his parliamentary duties and his colleagues in the Dáil will miss his genial personality and the lively sincerity of his speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From an early age he took a deep interest in the Labour movement and was for several years a delegate to the Irish Trades Union Congress.  He was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee in 1927-28.  An eloquent and forcible speaker, he made many useful contributions in the Dáil not merely on questions touching the interests of the workers but on national affairs and matters of general public concern.  He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government on the 3rd June, 1954.  That position gave him the opportunity which he long <Col N="1127" /> desired of giving very special personal attention to the housing problem, and he brought to his duties a full measure of enthusiasm, a lofty purpose and considerable practical knowledge.  It is the country's loss that he was not spared to see the fulfilment of his hopes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is the consolidation and amendment of various enactments relating to the limitation of legal actions and arbitrations. I propose to give a general survey of the law governing the limitation of actions and to indicate what the Bill sets out to do in the way of amending and tidying up of that law. To facilitate a study of the Bill which is in many respects a very technical one we decided to provide explanatory sidenotes indicating the existing statutory provisions and rules of law being consolidated, amended or repealed. On page 4 of the Bill Deputies will see a legend showing the short method by which each statute is referred to in the sidenotes.  The provision for the first time of explanatory sidenotes is, we hope, an innovation which will be welcomed in Bills of this type where an easy reference to the existing law is very helpful in making up one's mind as to the desirability of the changes being made in the law and the <Col N="1129" /> necessity or otherwise for other changes.  The sidenotes will not, of course, appear in the Act if and when it becomes law.</P>
      <P>The policy of fixing a period of limitation for legal actions has, since the 17th century, been incorporated in the statute law and the rule of equity that people who sleep on their rights should be prevented from enforcing them is of very long standing.  The purpose of prescribing limitation periods has been said to be the prevention of the rearing up of claims at great distances of time when evidence might very often be lost, the quieting of possession so that after a certain fixed period the possessor may know definitely that his title and right cannot be called into question, and, finally, the restriction of interminable litigation.</P>
      <P>In this country reliance must often be placed on the law of limitation in order to vest the legal estate in the owner of land for the time being, particularly as people in many cases do not take out administration on the death of their predecessors in title.  It is now generally considered that, though in some cases a statute of limitation may be used to defeat a perfectly just claim, where, say, a debt is clearly due, a plea of the statute is a meritorious one; and this is because the plaintiff must have been slow to enforce his rights, far slower, indeed, than the prudent man would be.  A plea of the statute is not for this reason thought to be comparable with a plea of the Gaming Acts or even of the Statute of Frauds (which statute, like the Sale of Goods Act, demands evidence in writing in certain transactions). These latter enactments may be used to defeat plaintiffs who are not in default of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;the Statutes of Limitation&rdquo;, or the Statute of Limitations&rdquo;, or, more shortly, &ldquo;the statute&rdquo; is applicable primarily to various general Acts which deal with the limitation of the main classes of action.  The most important of these Acts are, firstly, the Common Law Procedure Amendment Act (Ireland), 1853, which is concerned with what are called common law actions or actions for contract and tort and similar <Col N="1130" /> actions, and, secondly, the Real Property Limitation Acts, 1833 to 1874, which deal with actions relating to land or money charged upon land. It should be noted that, whereas the 1853 Act bars the remedy but leaves the right intact, the Acts of 1833 to 1874 bar both the remedy and the right.  Hence a plaintiff who is owed a statute barred debt is fully entitled to it if he can obtain satisfaction otherwise than by legal proceedings, but where a plaintiff seeks to recover land his title to the land is extinguished after the expiration of the statutory period.</P>
    <P>Where A owed B money on account of a number of debts some of which are statute barred and some not, and pays B money, which is not appropriated to any particular debt, B may appropriate the money to a statute barred debt.  If, however, A is in undisturbed possession of B's land for 12 years B's title to the land is extinguished and he cannot recover it by any means.  The distinction between barring the remedy and the right and barring only the remedy is an important one and has a significant result as regards procedure.  In an action to recover land the defendant need not plead the Statute, it being sufficient to plead that he is in possession by himself; but in claims other than claims to recover land the Statute must be pleaded.  In cases where the statutory period has apparently fully run the plaintiff may, nevertheless, succeed by proving that the right of action has been kept alive by acknowledgment or part payment by the defendant, or that the period must be extended in consequence of the plaintiff's disability by reason of infancy or lunacy or in consequence of concealed fraud on the part of the defendant.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;Statutes of Limitation&rdquo; is also used to cover a great number of enactments scattered over the statute book which deal with special statutory classes of action.  Such enactments are the Fatal Accidents Act, 1846 (now replaced by the Fatal Injuries Act, 1956) which deals with actions for the benefit of relatives of a deceased person killed by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another; the Landlord and Tenant <Col N="1131" /> Law Amendment Act, Ireland, 1860 (known as Deasy's Act), which deals with actions by an ejected tenant for restitution of possession; the Maritime Conventions Act, 1911, which deals with actions to enforce a claim or lien against a ship or the owners thereof; the Industrial and Commercial Property Act, 1927, which deals with actions for infringement of copyright, the Moneylenders Act, 1933, which deals with actions by moneylenders in respect of money lent; the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, which deals with actions by workmen for compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment; the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, which deals with actions against carriers or ships for loss or damage, etc.  One of the best known of these enactments concerned with special classes of action was the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, which was repealed by the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House does not deal with any of the special classes of statutory actions I have mentioned. It is in fact confined to the general Statutes of Limitation which I dealt with at the beginning, the most important being, as I said, the Irish Common Law Procedure Act of 1853 and the Real Property Limitation Acts of 1833 to 1874.</P>
    <P>I now propose to go through the Bill in some detail in order to explain to the House as well as I can the various provisions and the background of these provisions.  The Bill covers a very large number of matters and is in many respects highly technical.  I trust the House will bear with me while I attempt to give some indication of the proposals contained in the different sections and explain certain provisions which at first glance may not be clear to the layman or to a person studying for the first time the law as to the limitation of actions.  Though the Statutes of Limitation impinge very much on the transactions of the general community, the law requires in a number of respects a specialised study in order to become fully conversant with its many ramifications and effects in particular cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> Part I (Sections 1 to 9) is the preliminary and general part.  Under Section 1 the new Act is to be entitled the Statute of Limitations, 1956, and the statute is designed to come into operation on 1st January, 1957.  The expressions &ldquo;Statute of Limitations&rdquo; and &ldquo;pleading the Statute of Limitations&rdquo; have been used for a very long time and we propose that these expressions continue to be used.  It may be necessary if and when we come to the Committee Stage to provide for the postponement of the date of commencement still further.  The reason for allowing a fairly substantial period to intervene between the passing of the limitation legislation and the date of its coming into operation is to ensure that &ldquo;anyone whose period of limitation otherwise might be shortened&rdquo; will be &ldquo;afforded time within which to start his action and safeguard his right&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the interpretation section. &ldquo;Action&rdquo; will include any proceeding in a court of law; the Bill will not apply to criminal proceedings. &ldquo;Conventional rent&rdquo;, &ldquo;rent-charge&rdquo; and &ldquo;rent&rdquo; are being defined. Annuities payable to the Land Commission are rent-charges.  &ldquo;State authority&rdquo; will mean any Minister of State, the Commissioners of Public Works, the Land Commission, etc. Deputies will note that provision is made for foreclosure in sub-section (2). Since the Bill was prepared, however, it has been drawn to our attention that because of a leading case in 1914 a reference to foreclosure is misleading in this country because foreclosure is, according to that decision, unknown in Ireland.  The action here was and is an action claiming the sale of the land. It will accordingly be necessary at a later stage to have sub-section (2) of this section deleted and also to have certain changes made in that portion of the Bill dealing with mortgages.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the application of the Act to State authorities.  At present State authorities are not bound by the ordinary Statutes of Limitation on the old common law doctrine that time does not run against the King. This means that whereas the State may and does in practice plead the Statute, <Col N="1133" /> the Statute may not be pleaded against the State.  We considered that this was an unjust and inequitable principle and all the more so in a country which prides itself on being a democracy.  In the case of land there was an exception to the common law rule provided for in what are known as the Nullum Tempus Acts which began in Ireland with the Crown Claims Limitation (Ireland) Act, 1808.</P>
    <P>Under the Statutes the period of limitation of actions by the Crown (now the State) to recover lands was 60 years.  Since the Crown Lands Act, 1906, the period of 60 years also applies in Ireland to quit rents or other perpetual rents.  Annuities payable to the Land Commission are not, of course, quit rents or perpetual rents and the position in regard to all rents payable to the commission was doubtful until the 1939 Land Act, which in Section 6 provides that moneys payable to the Land Commission shall have, and save as regards tithe-rents, shall be always deemed to have had the like rights, privileges and priorities as are conferred on moneys to which Section 38 (2) of the Finance Act, 1924, applies.  In other words, they have the like rights as moneys payable to the Crown formerly had and, accordingly, the Statutes of Limitation do not apply to them.</P>
    <P>A similar provision is made for moneys payable to the Minister for Defence in Section 311 of the Defence Act, 1954.  The relevant provisions of the Finance Act, 1924, the Land Act, 1939, and the Defence Act, 1954, are being repealed in so far as they are inconsistent with the proposed legislation. The Bill does not apply, however, to proceedings by the Revenue Commissioners for the recovery of taxes and duties or fines, etc., incurred in connection with such taxes or duties. In the case of customs duty there is already a period of limitation of three years laid down in Section 257 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and under the Excise Act, 1848 (Section 3), the period is six months for excise duty.  There is now no period of limitation for income-tax.</P>
    <P>Section 4 excludes proceedings in respect of the forfeiture of a ship. <Col N="1134" /> These proceedings were formerly governed by Section 76 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which did not prescribe any period of limitation, and the law has not been changed under Section 90 of the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955.  Where, for example, a ship unduly assumes Irish character, or conceals Irish or assumes foreign character, or an unqualified person assumes ownership of the ship, the ship or the ownership therein, as the case may be, becomes liable to forfeiture to the State under Sections 13, 14, and 22 of the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 which is a re-enactment of Section 27 of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1833, provides that nothing in the proposed legislation shall affect any equitable jurisdiction of the courts to grant relief on the ground of acquiescence or otherwise.  Acquiescence means conduct from which a waiver of his rights will be attributed to a party or by which he will be estopped from taking proceedings later.  In such a case the party will not be allowed to succeed even though the limitation period has not expired. The old courts of equity always refused aid where the party had slept upon his right and acquiesced for a great length of time.  They also refused aid in a case where, though no period was applicable, it would have been inequitable to give relief after a long period of delay.  This was known as the doctrine of <i>laches.</i>  The provisions in Section 5 simply continue the application of the equitable doctrines in regard to acquiescence and <i>laches</i> to limitation cases.</P>
    <P>Under Section 6 of the Bill, where a set-off or counter-claim is pleaded, the set-off or counter-claim shall be deemed to be a separate action for the purpose of fixing the limits of the limitation period applicable; and the date until which the Statute runs against such set-off or counter-claim will be the date of the beginning of the action in which the set-off or counter-claim is pleaded. At present the position, where the Statute is pleaded to a set-off or counter-claim, is that time runs against the set-off until the beginning of the action in which it is raised, but it runs against the counter-claim until the date <Col N="1135" /> when the counter-claim is pleaded. The section will, therefore, bring the law of limitation as to a counter-claim into line with the law as to set-off.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides a saving for other limitation enactments and thus the periods of limitation prescribed in these enactments (some of which I have already mentioned) are preserved.  The section makes it specifically clear that the proposed legislation will not apply to any action coming within any of these enactments where a State authority is a party.</P>
    <P>Under Section 8 any action barred before the operative date (the 1st January, 1957) will continue to be barred except in so far as it may be revived by acknowledgment or part payment.  The new Act will also not affect any action (or the title to any property involved in any action) commenced before the operative date.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is the repeals section.  The existing statutory enactments, stretching back over 200 years, which govern the general law of limitation and which are listed in the Schedule are being repealed.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill&mdash;Sections 10 to 37 &mdash;sets out the various periods for different classes of action and proposes, as far as is considered desirable, to prescribe uniform periods for all similar classes of action.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that this part of the Bill is to be subject to the later provisions in Part III, relating to the extension of the limitation periods in case of disability, acknowledgment, part payment, fraud and mistake.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with what are called common law actions, namely, contract and tort actions and other similar actions.  Under sub-section (1) the period for all simple contract actions will be six years as at present; for actions on recognisances, and actions to recover any sum (other than a sum by way of penalty or forfeiture) recoverable by virtue of any enactment the period will also be six years whereas it is 20 years at present.  In tort actions, other than personal injuries and slander actions, the period will, under sub-section (2) (a), be six years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> Six years is now the period in all tort actions except actions for assault, menace, battery, wounding, and imprisonment which have a limitation period of four years, and actions for slander <i>per se</i> where the period is two years.  Sub-section (2) (b) provides that personal injuries actions for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty shall have a limitation period of three years only instead of the present four years, not six years, by the way, as is stated in the sidenote.  This is a fairly important change of the law.</P>
    <P>Roughly half of all actions coming for trial are personal injuries actions.  The period of three years will apply whether or not the action is against a State or other public authority, whereas before the repeal of the Public Authorities Act, 1893, the period was six months from the act, neglect or default of the public authority and is at present four years from the date the cause of action arises irrespective of the date of such act, neglect or default. Deputies will have noted that the period in fatal cases arising under the Fatal Injuries Act is also three years.</P>
    <P>All slander actions will have a limitation period of two years whether actionable <i>per se</i> or not&mdash;sub section (2) (c)&mdash;whereas at present in slander other than slander actionable <i>per se</i>, that is, slander which requires proof of special damage, the period is six years. We considered that there should be a uniform period for all types of slander but that it should be a shorter period than that provided for in libel and other torts.  I might mention that in Britain the period for all types of slander is now six years.  We felt, however, that this precedent ought not to be followed.  It must be very seldom, indeed, that slander actions are brought after two years.  Further, a person's recollection of the exact words spoken in a particular instance is likely to be uncertain as time goes on: in the case of libel there is a permanent record.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) deals with actions for an account, and the present period of six years is not being altered.  In an action on an instrument under seal a period of 12 years is proposed instead of the present 20 years&mdash;sub-section (4) <Col N="1137" />&mdash;and 12 years as at present (with six years in the case of interest) is also to be the period in actions upon judgments&mdash;sub-section (5).  Actions for penalties (other than fines) will, under sub-section (6), continue to have a period of two years.  As penalties for the non-payment of duties and taxes under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners do not come within the Bill and as the non-payment of such duties are in reality criminal offences, the only field of operation of sub-section (6) will be penalties recoverable by the person known as the common informer.  Section 11 will not apply to admiralty actions where the jurisdiction of the High Court is enforceable <i>in rem</i> or against the ship, but it will apply to ordinary actions to recover seamen's wages&mdash;sub-section (7).  The section will also not apply to actions claiming equitable relief such as specific performance and injunction, but the court may apply the section by analogy in the same way as Statutes of Limitation are at present applied.</P>
    <P>In former times, the old courts of equity might act in obedience to a Limitation Act in which they were not expressly mentioned, and, when an equitable proceeding was closely analogous to one at common law, the courts of equity held themselves bound by the Act.  Courts of equity might also act by analogy to the Limitation Act, and, in such cases, though the Act did not absolutely bind these courts, they adopted it &ldquo;as a rule to assist their discretion&rdquo;.  Thus, in some cases, where there was a close analogy, the courts of equity acted in express obedience to the Act, whereas, in other cases, where there was merely an analogy, they acted in obedience simply.  The inclusion in the Bill of cases not formerly within any limitation enactment (for example, cases against constructive trustees such as executors and administrators) means that, where a court formerly acted in obedience to a Statute of Limitation, it will in future have to act in express obedience to it.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill deals with the limitation of actions in the case of successive conversions and is a new provision in the law.  The section proposes, <Col N="1138" /> in sub-section (1), to amend the law by providing that, in the case of a further conversion or detention, no action may be brought in respect of such further conversion or detention after the expiration of six years from the accrual of the cause of action in respect of the original wrongful conversion or detention.  At present, when the same chattel is the subject of separate acts of conversion or detention, the fact that the Statute has run in favour of the first wrongdoer does not bar an action against a second or subsequent wrongdoer.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) also amends the law, so that, where the limitation period for bringing an action for conversion or wrongful detention has expired, the title to the chattel concerned shall be extinguished: under the existing law only the right of action is barred. Conversion is an unauthorised act which deprives another of his property permanently or for an indefinite time, and the action is one for damages. Wrongful detention arises where one person detains the property of another, and the action is one for restitution of the property.  The right of action for conversion arises on the doing of the unauthorised act, whereas the right of action for wrongful detention arises when a demand of the owner has been wrongfully refused.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill deals with the limitation periods in actions to recover land by a State authority and by a person other than a State authority. In actions to recover land, except foreshore, the period of limitation for a State authority is to be 40 years instead of 60 years as at present, but in the case of actions by an ordinary person the period will continue to be 12 years.  I might mention here that the period in Britain in the case of the Crown is 30 years since 1940, but there since 1926 a vendor of land on an open contract is obliged to show only 30 years' title, whereas here under Section 1 of the Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874, he must show 40 years' title. Prior to 1874 the period was 60 years in both countries, hence the period of 60 years under the Nullum Tempus Acts in actions by the Crown to recover land.  We now propose to reduce this latter period to 40 years so <Col N="1139" /> as to equate it with the period laid down in the 1874 Act for open contracts of sale of land.</P>
    <P>The effect of sub-section (3) is to allow a person to prescribe (that is, to acquire title by exclusive user) against the State in respect of a period before the 6th December, 1922, or the 29th December, 1937.  Thus, where a person remains in possession of land belonging to the State, as successors to the Crown, from, say, 1910, he may reckon the period from 1910 for the purpose of acquiring title by prescription.  The position in law is somewhat doubtful at present.  We think it only fair, however, that, where a person has been in exclusive and uninterrupted possession of former Crown land for 20 or 30 years before 1922, he should get the benefit of the interest he has acquired up to 1922.  Deputies will remember that a provision in the State Property Bill, 1954, providing that a person could not prescribe against State property for any period before the 6th December, 1922, was deleted by Government amendment in the Seanad and the deletion was subsequently agreed to by this House.  The period in the case of actions by the State to recover foreshore will continue to be 60 years.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 to 17 deal with the date when the right of action to recover land is to be deemed to accrue in various types of cases such as present interests in land, future interests in land, etc.  In other words, the sections lay down what is to be taken as the earliest date in each case when an action may be brought, and it is from this date that time is to run.  The sections consolidate existing statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that time is only to run where there is what is called &ldquo;adverse possession,&rdquo; and the meaning of this term is defined to cover all cases of possession (against the owner) of some person in whose favour the period of limitation can run.  Sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) put existing rules of law into statutory form.  Sub-section (4) (a) makes non-payment of the rent by a person in possession of land subject to a rent-charge adverse possession of <Col N="1140" /> the rent-charge: and under sub-section (4) (b) receipt of rent by a person wrongfully claiming the reversion of land under a lease with an annual rental of not less than £1 shall be deemed to be adverse possession of the land.  Both provisions alter the existing law.</P>
    <P>Section 19, which is a rather technical section, provides for the cure of all defective disentailing assurances, and extends the provisions of Section 6 of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874, which section replaced Section 23 of the Act of 1833.  The existing statutory provisions are confined to cases where the purported disentail fails only to bar the interests of the remaindermen taking effect after the estate tail.</P>
    <P>An example will illustrate what the object of the section in the Bill is. Where land is granted to A (usually designated the Protector of the Settlement) for life, then to B and his issue in tail, with remainder to C and his issue on the failure of B's heirs, B, with the consent of A, may, under the Irish Fines and Recoveries Act, 1834, by a deed enrolled in the High Court bar his own heirs and the remaindermen, C and his issue.  When A dies, B will then get an estate in fee simple, and before A dies he can dispose of his interest to X who, when A dies, will then get the free simple.  If, however, B does not get the consent of A, the deed simply bars B's heirs but not the remaindermen, C and his heirs, so that on failure of B's heirs, C and his heirs will obtain the estate.  In such a case the deed creates what is known as a base fee.  By reason of Section 7 of the 1874 Act, when such a fee is created, if B disposes of his interest in the land to X, and X enters into possession and remains in possession for 12 years after A's death, the title of X becomes absolute against any person claiming the estate as a remainderman. Therefore, after the 12 years, C or his heirs cannot in any circumstances oust X.  But if B does not enrol the deed in the High Court his heirs are not barred, and Section 7 of the 1874 Act does not protect his disposition or assurance of the land to X, as the section only applies where a base fee properly so called has been created.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> At one time it was thought that any defective disentailing assurance was protected, but the courts decided otherwise.  The section of the Bill will apply, however, to any defective disentailing assurance made by a person capable of disentailing, not only where a base fee is created barring the issue but not the remaindermen but also where the assurance is ineffective to bar either the issue or the remaindermen. In other words the section proposes to protect X's interest in all cases where he has been in possession for 12 years after A's death.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that, under Section 42 (2), the operation of Section 19 may be excluded by an acknowledgment. Where X, the person in possession, acknowledges the title of the person to whom the right of action accrues (that is, within 12 years of A's death, admits that B's issue or the remaindermen (C and his issue), as the case may be, are entitled to the land because the disentailing assurance has not barred them) Section 19 does not apply.  Where this happens, the acknowledgment revives the cause of action and the 12-year period runs against the person whose title is acknowledged from the date of the acknowledgment.</P>
    <P>Section 20 which provides that no right of action is to be preserved in respect of formal entry on or continual claim to any land, Section 21 which provides that possession of one joint-tenant, etc., of land is not to be deemed possession of the others, Section 22 which prevents possession of a younger brother, etc., of land being deemed possession of the heir, and Section 23, which provides that administration shall date back to the death of the owner, reproduce existing statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 24, which also reproduces an existing statutory provision, is an important section in that it provides that, in the case of land (which includes a rent-charge on land), the title to the land shall be extinguished after the expiration of the period of limitation. Thus, where land is concerned, the right is extinguished when the remedy is barred.  In other cases, such as in actions to recover ordinary debts, only <Col N="1142" /> the remedy is barred.  I dealt with this matter earlier on, and I mention it again because I want to stress that it is very necessary to keep it in mind in examining the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 25 deals with equitable estates in land and land held in trust. Sub-section (1) applies the provisions of the Bill in regard to legal estates to equitable estates.  The sub-section is, however, to be read subject to Section 37 which prevents any period of limitation applying to an action by a beneficiary to recover trust property or the proceeds thereof in the possession of the trustee.  Trustee in possession, because they hold the property for the benefit of and not adversely to the beneficiaries, cannot plead the Statute against the beneficiaries and we propose to continue that position.  Sub-section (2) deals with the case of a stranger taking possession of land held by a trustee for another person.  The stranger will be entitled to plead the Statute when he has been in possession for 12 years as his possession is adverse possession.  Where the period of limitation for bringing an action by the trustee against such stranger has expired, sub-section (3), which is new to our law, provides that the estate of the trustee shall not be extinguished so long as any action of any beneficiary has not accrued or been barred.  Then sub-section (4), which is also new, goes on to provide that the trustee may bring an action against the stranger on behalf of any beneficiary whose right of action has not been barred, notwithstanding that the ordinary right of action of the trustee himself has been barred.</P>
    <P>The effect of the sub-sections, (3) and (4), is to suspend the operation of Section 24, so long as the right of action of any person entitled to a beneficial interest in the land or the proceeds of sale either has not accrued or has not been barred.  Thus, where one beneficiary (A) is an infact at the time a stranger takes possession of the land, the right of action of such beneficiary does not accrue until he reaches the age of 21 years.  The stranger by that time may have obtained a perfectly good title against the other beneficiaries due to the expiration of the 12-year period.  The trustee <Col N="1143" /> may, however, still recover the land on behalf of A and, when he recovers it, he will hold it upon trust for A and the stranger, because the latter has acquired the interest of the other beneficiaries by lapse of time.</P>
    <P>At present, a stranger obtains the legal estate subject to the interests of the beneficiaries except in the case of a trust for sale where, when the trustee's estate goes, the trust apparently goes also.  We now propose that in all cases the estate remain in the trustee as long as there are any beneficiaries not barred, but this is only for the purpose of allowing the trustee to sue and recover the property on behalf of the beneficiaries who are not barred, but not on behalf of the other beneficiaries who, being barred by lapse of time, lose their title to the stranger.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) prevents any kind of possession of land by one beneficiary under the Settled Land Act, 1882, or under any trust for sale from being adverse to the trustees or to the co-beneficiaries. In other words, a beneficiaries cannot acquire a title against the trustees or against the other beneficiaries by mere lapse of time, no matter whether the possession might under existing law be deemed adverse.  At present, if the beneficiary can prove that he entered adversely to the trustees, time will run in his favour. One of the objects of the Bill is to ensure that a trustee or beneficiary in possession may not successfully plead the Statute against the beneficiaries not in possession in any type of case. The relationship established by a trust is a particular type of relationship and should receive particular treatment.  A trustee or beneficiary has a specialised position which would allow him to take unfair advantage of other persons who have interests in the property if the law did not give those other persons proper protection.</P>
    <P>Section 26 retains in sub-section (1) the existing period of six years in actions to recover arrears of a rent-charge but the term &ldquo;action&rdquo; here does not include proceedings under the Land Act, 1927, which are proceedings by the Land Commission to obtain <Col N="1144" /> from the sheriff possession of a holding which they have put up for sale and not sold.  The Land Commission, as Deputies may be aware, have the powers of sale of a mortgagee and, where they are entitled to sell land or where land which they are entitled to sell has not been sold, they may be put in possession of the land.  Sub-section (2) corresponds to a similar sub-section in Section 25, and its object is to ensure that the right of action of the beneficiary to secure payment of arrears of a rent-charge where the land is vested in the trustee shall be deemed to have first accrued at and not before the date the land is conveyed to a purchaser for valuable consideration and then only against the purchaser. The right of action never accrues against the trustee which means that he cannot ever pelad the Statute.</P>
    <P>Under Section 27 the period for arrears of a conventional rent is also to be six years in every case.  At present, if there is a lease under seal the person to whom the rent is owed can sue on the indenture and recover 20 years' arrears.  Section 28 prevents the Land Commission from recovering more than six years' arrears of annuities on a warrant issued by them under the Land Act, 1933.  This warrant is issued to the county registrar or sheriff.  The warrant will, under the Bill, remain in force for six years and no longer.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with actions to recover arrears of dower or damages in respect thereof and continues the existing period of six years.  The right of dower is the right of the widow, where the husband dies intestate, to a third part of the husband's real estate for her life.  Section 30 to 34 deal with actions in respect of mortgages.</P>
    <P>The intention of Section 30 was to provide that an action claiming foreclosure was to be deemed an action to recover the land and not an action for the recovery of the money which it was at one time thought to be.  As I mentioned earlier when dealing with Section 2, it has now come to our notice that legally there is no such thing as foreclosure in Ireland.  So we propose, when Committee Stage is reached, to have Section 30 deleted <Col N="1145" /> and a new section inserted providing for an action by a mortgagee of land claiming the sale of the land as this is the type of action resorted to in this country.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for a period of 12 years in a redemption action by a mortgagor where the mortgagee has been in possession of the land: at the expiration of the 12 years, the mortgagor's title is extinguished.  This is the existing law under the Real Property Limitation Acts.</P>
    <P>In Section 32 the period is also 12 years in an action to recover a principal sum secured by a mortgage or charge on land or personal property. There is at present no limitation period in the case of personal property.  In the case of interest payable in respect of a principal sum secured by a mortgage or charge the period is six years under Section 33, and this is the period whether the money is charged on land or personal property.  Future interests and insurance policies receive special treatment in both Sections 32 and 33 so that, where a sum is charged on, say, an insurance policy, the period of limitation will not begin to run until the policy matures.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, the mortgagee who lends money on the strength of such a policy would in many cases be forced to realise the policy within the period of limitation or else lose his rights by default.  Very often he would prefer to keep the policy alive until it matures for payment.  Deputies will notice that in the case of mortgages, interest on which is payable into the Church Temporalities Fund, and in the case of charges on land under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts the period for recovery of the principal sum is 40 years instead of 12 years.  This is in line with the policy of the Bill to provide a period of 40 years for the recovery of land or sums charged on land where the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 34 prevents the Agricultural Credit Corporation from recovering more than six years' arrears of interest due on foot of a chattel mortgage and the object of the section is similar to that of Section 28 in regard to the Land Commission.  Sections 35 to 37 deal with actions in respect of trust <Col N="1146" /> property or the personal estate of deceased persons.  Trustees (whether express or constructive) are brought within the Statute by Section 35 (1) and the definition of trustee in Section 2(1).  At present, it is doubtful if constructive trustees are completely within the Trustee Act, 1888, and it has been held that an executor may plead the Statute even if he has retained the property, although an express trustee cannot.  Where a period of limitation is not laid down in any other section, the period for a trustee is to be six years.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides a uniform period of 12 years in all actions to recover personal estate whether under a will or an intestacy, whereas at present the period is 12 years in the case of a legacy and 20 years in the case of an intestacy.  In actions to recover arrears of interest in respect of a legacy, the period will continue to be six years.</P>
    <P>Section 37 prevents any trustee relying on the Statute where the claim is founded on fraud or where, and this is very important, the trust property or the proceeds thereof are still retained by the trustee or previously received by him and converted to his own use.  What the Bill seeks to do is to consolidate the existing relevant provisions of the Trustee Act, 1888, in regard to trustees and to apply them to all trustees.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for the extension of the limitation periods in the case of disability, acknowledgment, part payment, fraud and mistake.  The provisions of the Bill in this respect are very comprehensive.  Chapter I&mdash; Section 38&mdash;contains certain interpretation provisions; Chapter II&mdash;Sections 39 and 40&mdash;deals with disabilities; Chapter III&mdash;Sections 41 to 49&mdash;with acknowledgment; Chapter IV&mdash;Sections 50 to 57&mdash;with part payment; and Chapter V&mdash;Sections 58 and 59&mdash;with fraud and mistake.</P>
    <P>Statutes of Limitation may sometimes cause hardship by preventing a person, entitled to sue, from suing by reason of the fact that during the period of limitation it is impossible or virtually impossible for him to initiate <Col N="1147" /> legal proceedings at the time when the cause of action arises.  For instance, he may be subject to some legal incapacity, such as infancy or insanity, or the defendant may enjoy the benefit of diplomatic privilege, or the defendant may have gone abroad so as to place himself beyond the reach of legal process.  In such cases the plaintiff is said to be under a &ldquo;disability,&rdquo; and the policy of the law is to suspend the operation of the Statute for a fixed period or until the disability ceases.</P>
    <P>The question of &ldquo;disabilities&rdquo; is complicated by the fact that the legal provisions governing the subject are for the most part scattered about in a number of enactments.  Some Statutes of Limitation either contain no provision at all or else provide for disabilities of a special type.  Section 20 of the Common Law Procedure Amendment Act (Ireland), 1853, lays down the periods of limitation applying in the majority of civil actions, and Section 22 of that Act sets out the various disabilities which arise. Those mentioned are: infancy, the position of a married woman, unsoundness of mind, absence of the plaintiff or the defendant beyond the seas.  Coverture (or the position of a married woman under her husband's protection) and absence of the plaintiff beyond the seas ceased to be disabilities as a result of the Married Women's Property Act, 1882, and the Mercantile Law Amendment Act, 1856, respectively.  Imprisonment was also a disability until it was abolished as such by the 1856 Act; but Section 8 of the Forfeiture Act, 1870, disables persons convicted of treason or felony, and sentenced to death or penal servitude, from bringing any action unless they are lawfully at large under licence or unless an administrator or curator of their property has been appointed.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make the law of disability uniform, and the disability of absence of the defendant beyond the seas is being abolished. We were of opinion that this latter type of disability is now of little practical value because defendants may be served with legal process outside the <Col N="1148" /> jurisdiction.  Apart from this, the existence of the disability has given rise to difficulties of legal interpretation. It has, however, been represented to us since the Bill was circulated that we ought to reconsider the matter and this we are willing to do.  By the way, a modern enactment which specifically provides for the disability is the Moneylenders Act, 1933, and the relevant provision in Section 19 of that Act is listed in the Schedule of Repeals to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 39 sets out the three forms of disability which will apply in every case.  These are infancy, insanity and conviction subject to the operation of the Forfeiture Act, 1870, where no curator or administrator has been appointed.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides in sub-section (1) that, where any person is under a disability when a right of action accrues to him, the action may be brought at any time within six years of the date when the disability ceased or the person died, subject to the proviso that no action to recover land shall be brought after the expiration of 30 years from the date on which the right of action accrued.  Under sub-section (2) the period of limitation will not be suspended in the case of personal injuries actions (which must be brought within three years) if the person under the disability is in the custody of a parent at the time the right of action accrued to him: where he is not in the custody of a parent, he may take his action within three years of the ceasing of the disability.  The reason for this provision is that personal injuries actions are actions which should be taken fairly soon after accrual in view of the danger of evidence being lost or becoming vague after a long lapse of time; and, where the person injured is in the custody of a parent, the parent may, after all, sue on his behalf.  A similar rule is being applied in regard to slander actions.</P>
    <P>Chapter III (Sections 41 to 49) of Part III of the Bill is designed to ensure that the law as to acknowledgment will be the same in all types of case.  The doctrine that a right of action upon a simple contract debt might be revived by acknowledgment <Col N="1149" /> was purely judge-made and the decisions of the courts were directed to what has been called &ldquo;the task of decorously disregarding an Act of Parliament&rdquo;. The doctrine first received statutory recognition in the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act, 1828, known as Lord Tenterden's Act, which provided that only an acknowledgment in writing, should take the case out of the Statute.  In 1856, the Mercantile Law Amendment Act made acknowledgment by an agent as effective as one by his principal.  It was judicially decided that an acknowledgment did not revive a debt unless it contained, expressly or impliedly, a fresh promise to pay and this continues to be the material element necessary to take a case out of the Statute where a simple contract debt is involved.  Under Section 23 of the Irish Common Law Procedure Amendment Act, 1853, an action upon a speciality debt may be brought within 20 years after an acknowledgment has been made&mdash;the acknowledgment need not involve a fresh promise to pay and means merely an admission that the debt is due. Under the Bill, this rule in regard to acknowledgment of speciality debts is being adopted for all debts.  Acknowledgment in the case of actions to recover land or money charged thereon is provided for in the Real Property Limitation Acts.  The acknowledgment must be in writing and there is no need to have an express or implied promise to pay.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 to 46 of the Bill more or less consolidate the law as to acknowledgment in the different classes of case where it can arise.  Section 45, however, reverses the rule with which I have already dealt, that acknowledgment is ineffective in the case of simple contract debts unless it involves an express or implied promise to pay. We propose on Committee Stage to delete Section 43 and substitute a new section covering an action by a mortgagee claiming sale.  As I have already explained foreclosure is unknown in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 47 lays down the formal requirements for acknowledgment.  The acknowledgment must be in writing and may be made by an agent or to <Col N="1150" /> an agent.  At present, an acknowledgment by an agent is not effective against the principal in possession or the mortgagee in possession in the case of land or a rent-charge: to be effective it must be given by the principal or mortgagee.  Also, an acknowledgment of a speciality debt made to a third party appears to be sufficient under the existing law.</P>
    <P>Section 48 deals with the effect of acknowledgment on persons other than the acknowledgor or recipient.  Sub-section (1) lays down the general principal that an acknowledgment of title to any land or mortgaged personalty by a person in possession thereof shall bind all other persons in possession during the ensuing period of limitation.  Sub-section (2) provides that an acknowledgment by one of two or more mortgagees shall only bind the acknowledgor and his successors.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3), however, is to the effect that, where there are two or more mortgagors, acknowledgment to one shall be acknowledgment to all. Sub-sections (2) and (3) repeat the relevant provisions of Section 7 of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874, and extend them to all mortgaged property whether land or personality. Sub-section (4) (a) makes the acknowledgment of a debt binding on the acknowledgor and his successor but not on any other person.  This provision will clear up a point which has given rise to some difficulty.  It would appear that under the existing law an acknowledgment of a specialty debt binds the co-debtors, whereas an acknowledgment of a simple contract debt does not.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of sub-section (4) provides for an exception to paragraph (a) in that an acknowledgment made after the period of limitation has expired will not bind any successor of the acknowledgor on whom the liability devolves on the determination of a preceding estate or interest in property under a settlement taking effect before the date of the acknowledgment.  The type of case covered by this exception is as follows: Land, already subject to a mortgage, is settled on A for life, with remainder to B.  Once the period of 12 years has elapsed without an <Col N="1151" /> acknowledgment, an acknowledgment by A will not revive the mortgagee's rights against B.  The exception is already recognised under existing legal decisions, and the Bill will simply give statutory form to the legal rule to be deduced from these decisions.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) also gives statutory form to an existing legal rule which says that acknowledgment by one of several executors or administrators of any claim to the personal estate of a deceased person shall bind the estate, though it will not involve the other executors or administrators in any personal liability.  It is to be noted that an acknowledgment made after the period of limitation has run will only, as at present, be effective where, though the remedy is barred, the right is not extinguished.  In actions to recover land the title is, under Section 24, extinguished after the expiration of the period of limitation, and acknowledgment will, therefore, have no effect in such cases.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of Part III of the Bill provides for part payment.  Part payment is really a form of acknowledgment where the right of action is in respect of a debt, and the law is more or less the same as that of acknowledgment.</P>
    <P>Sections 51 to 54 cover part payment in the various cases in which it can arise.  It will be necessary, of course, to amend Section 51 so as to omit references to foreclosure.  Section 53 reverses as regards simple contract debts the rule that part payment is not effective unless there is an express or implied promise to pay.</P>
    <P>Section 55 lays down the formal provisions as to part payment.  Payment may be made by a principal or agent to a principal or agent.</P>
    <P>Section 56 deals with the effect of part payment on persons other than the maker.  Sub-section (1), which corresponds to sub-section (1) of Section 48 in regard to acknowledgment, provides that a part payment of a mortgage debt by the mortgagor or any person in possession shall bind all persons in possession during the ensuing period of limitation.  Under sub-section (2) (a) a part payment of <Col N="1152" /> a debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim will bind all persons liable in respect thereof.  As I explained when dealing with acknowledgment, an acknowledgment will only bind the acknowledgor and his successors, Section 48 (4) (a).  The ground for this distinction between part payment and acknowledgment is that a part payment operates for the benefit of all persons bound, there being a diminution of the total of the liability of all the co-debtors on part payment by one of them; and if they take the benefit they should take it with its accompanying disadvantages.  No such consideration applies in the case of acknowledgment by one of the persons bound.  At present a part payment does not affect a co-debtor in any case, whereas an acknowledgment of a specialty debt would appear to bind a co-debtor.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) (b) deals with part payments made after the period of limitation has expired, and the effect will be the same as in the case of similarly made acknowledgments, which are provided for in sub-section (4) (b) of Section 48.  A part payment by one of several personal representatives binds the personal estate of the deceased under sub-section (3) in the same way as an acknowledgment.</P>
    <P>Section 57, which repeats existing statutory provisions, provides that no endorsement or memorandum of any payment written upon any bill of exchange or promissory note by or on behalf of the creditor shall be deemed to be evidence of such payment.</P>
    <P>Chapter V of Part III of the Bill, which deals with fraud and mistake, clears up a number of anomalies in the existing law.  The doctrine of fraud is a doctrine of the old courts of equity, and the effect of fraud was to postpone the running of time until the person injured thereby had discovered the fraud or ought to have discovered it. In equity, the cause of action springs from the fraud of the defendant or else the existence of the cause of action may have been concealed from the plaintiff by the fraudulent conduct of the defendant.  In other words, there may either be fraud or what is called &ldquo;concealed fraud&rdquo;.  It is obviously <Col N="1153" /> unjust that a defendant should be permitted to rely upon a lapse of time caused by his own misconduct.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the existing state of the law is far from clear, and it is uncertain in many cases whether a fraudulent defendant may or may not be able successfully to plead the Statute.  The Real Property Limitation Act, 1833, provided in Section 26 that the right to bring a suit in equity for the recovery of land was to be deemed to accrue in the case of concealed fraud only when the fraud was, or could with reasonable diligence have been, discovered.  To come within this provision, concealed fraud has to be fraud by which the claimant or his predecessors were deprived of the land or rent.</P>
    <P>At common law, neither fraud as part of a cause of action nor the fraudulent concealment of a cause of action was a ground for postponing the running of the period of limitation. Though the Irish Judicature Act of 1877 would seem to have put an end to the difference between the rules of the common law and the rules of equity by enacting that the rules of equity should always prevail, these latter rules would not appear to prevail in cases formerly exclusively within the jurisdiction of courts of law, e.g., the common law action of deceit.  A somewhat similar position arises in cases where relief is sought from the consequence of mistake, e.g., when money is paid or property transferred under a mistake.  The equitable rule is that time should only run from the time at which the mistake was, or could with reasonable diligence have been, discovered, but this rule does not apply in cases formerly within the exclusive cognisance of a court of law.  The Bill proposes to resolve the conflict between law and equity as regards fraud and mistake and the equitable doctrines of fraud and mistake are extended to cover all actions.</P>
    <P>Section 58 provides that, where an action, for which a period of limitation is fixed by the Statute, is based on the fraud of the defendant or the right of action is concealed by his fraud, the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered <Col N="1154" /> the fraud or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.  Sub-section (2), which follows the proviso to Section 26 of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1833, makes an exception in favour of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value and, where the property has been purchased by such a person, it will not be affected by fraud or concealed fraud under sub-section (1).</P>
    <P>Section 59 provides, similarly, that, where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is fixed by the Statute, the action is for relief from the consequence of mistake, the period of limitation shall not run until the plaintiff has discovered the mistake or ought with reasonable diligence to have discovered it&mdash;sub-section (1).  Sub-section (2) then goes on to make an exception in favour of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value.</P>
    <P>Part IV (Sections 60 to 67) applies the proposed legislation to arbitrations and simply re-enacts the existing provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1954.  The relevant sections of the 1954 Act (which are being repealed in the Schedule to the Bill) are more proper to a Limitation Act.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in going into the Bill in the detail which I thought to be necessary, there is a danger that Deputies who are not familiar with the subject have found themselves somewhat at sea in trying to keep the general picture in mind.  May I, therefore, state very briefly the main objects of the Bill?</P>
    <P>First of all, the Bill proposes to prescribe general and uniform periods of limitation in the case of actions and arbitrations.  The Bill applies to all actions whether in equity or law, but Section 5 contains a saving for &ldquo;any equitable jurisdiction to refuse relief on the grounds of acquiescence or otherwise&rdquo;.  The Bill will apply to the State and State authorities but will not apply to the recovery of taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Bill sets out the various limitation periods for different classes of actions.  In ordinary common law actions of contract and tort the period will be six years in all cases except (a) actions on documents <Col N="1155" /> under seal, where the period will be 12 years; (b) actions for personal injuries where the period will be three years; and (c) actions for slander where the period will be two years in all cases.  In actions to recover land the period will be 12 years, but in actions by a State authority the period will be 40 years instead of 60 years as at present.  In actions to recover rent arrears, interest on mortgages, etc., the period will be six years.  The Statute will apply to constructive trustees in the same way as it now applies to express trustees.  In every case where the court formerly acted in obedience, though not in express obedience, to the Statute it will now act in express obedience.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Bill provides for the extension of the general periods of limitation in cases of disability, acknowledgment and part payment, and fraud and mistake.  These extensions are common to all actions comprised in Part II with some small exceptions contained in Section 40 in regard to disability.  The provisions are designed to replace by a single code the various and inconsistent provisions in existing Acts.  They apply to cases where under the present law the period of limitation is not subject to any extension at all.  Acknowledgment or part payment need not imply a promise to pay in any type of case. Acknowledgment will not bind co-debtors or co-contractors whereas part payment will.  The differences between the rules of common law and the rules of equity in regard to fraud and mistake are resolved.</P>
    <P>Finally, the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1954, applying the provisions of the Statutes of Limitation to arbitrations are being repealed and re-enacted.</P>
    <P>There has for many years been need for a modern Act to deal with the limitation of legal actions.  As a legal writer has recently remarked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish law concerning the limitation of actions is far from satisfactory.  In some particulars it stands in need of reform, on numerous points it needs to be clarifield, <Col N="1156" /> and it would undoubtedly be a benefit both to the layman and the lawyer if it were codified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Bill is designed to provide the proper remedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I remember, this Bill follows the passing of the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Act.  When that Act was before the House as a Bill, many Deputies were of opinion that some types of action against public authorities should be brought sooner than six years.  Then the limit was six months.  It was agreed that six months was too short, but six years in some types of action was considered too long.  The Taoiseach agreed and said he would bring in an amending Bill on the whole law of limitation.  This is the Bill.</P>
      <P>I must say I liked the side notes in this Bill.  I found them very useful.  I do not pretend for one moment to understand them fully in all cases but in reading the Bill I found them very helpful.  I do not know whether the provision of side notes is an innovation, but it ought to be followed in Bills of this type.  It is certainly very useful, instead of having to look up matters, to have them here to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that three years ought to be sufficient to allow a person to take an action, for personal injuries anyway.  About other matters, I have not much experience but there is one type of case that has come to my notice on more than one occasion.  I daresay other Deputies in rural areas have come up against the same thing. I refer to a case where some person dies intestate, and some relative occupies the land.  A niece or nephew may remain in possession for 20 or 30 years and then another person, with the same relationship, perhaps another niece or nephew, turns up and claims the land from the person who had been in occupation of it for years.  I knew of one case of that type where there were two old ladies involved. Then after some years a cousin they had almost forgotten existed turned up. Many people thought a terrible injustice was done when the court ordered that these people who had been in occupation and had worked the land for 20 <Col N="1157" /> or 30 years&mdash;I do not know exactly how many&mdash;were required to lodge so much in court, being the value of the profits they were supposed to have made out of the land.  I tried to explain to these people that that was the law but it was no use.  They thought it was an injustice, and it did so seem to me, when after a number of years a person who had shown little interest in the land could turn up and claim it.</P>
    <P>Will 12 years be the period in which from this onwards a person in that position will be able to claim the land? Say there are two cousins, one of whom goes to America.  If he is away for 12 years and does not make a claim within that period, under the present Bill does that mean that he has lost his claim?</P>
    <P>I think some provision of that kind is necessary.  The Bill is very complicated. It appears to me to be a matter mostly for legal people and perhaps for members of local authorities.  I should imagine it would be advisable, if it were possible, to have some sort of Select Committee to go into it.  I do not know whether it could get sufficient consideration here in an ordinary Committee Stage.  Certainly it is a Bill to be considered principally on Committee Stage.  There is something to be said for this, and the Minister might consider sending the Bill to a Special Committee.  In any event, a lengthy period should be allowed between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage.  As far as I can see, in the preparatory work a good job has been made of the Bill, and in a very short time, too.  It is only 12 months since we passed the other Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Boland, we are all extremely pleased to see a Bill of this kind coming before the House.  Being essentially a non-Party measure and consequently, in a political sense, not contentious, it is one that can be dealt with calmly and one in which every possible avenue of advantage, both to the lawyer and to the layman, can be dealt with adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, of course, and still is, a great necessity in this country for law reform or law codification.  We lag <Col N="1158" /> behind our neighbours in Great Britain considerably in this respect.  Maybe it is due to the fact that, possibly, the same advantages, both by way of leisure and finance, are not available to legal practitioners and codifiers of the law here as in Great Britain.  However, it is comforting to know in respect to this Bill, the Statute of Limitations Bill now before the House, while we are behind Great Britain, we are at least ahead of our neighbours in the six north-eastern counties.  As yet, I understand, there is no comprehensive Limitation Act in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
    <P>The law of limitations, both in theory and in practice, is an extremely difficult branch of the law and one which has down the years&mdash;and I think this can be said by every legal practitioner&mdash;given headaches and heartaches to practitioners and, of course, given much more substantial pain to litigants. I, in my own short experience, can recall cases of where there was obvious injustice done and where the people, whom it was sought to make liable for the injustice done, were prepared to rely on the technicality of Limitations Acts.  There was the notorious instance which we got rid of here last year&mdash;the Public Authorities (Protection) Act&mdash;and for which we substituted a much more equitable form of legislation.</P>
    <P>As to the provision of this Bill, I think, on Second Stage at any rate, the matter on which I would place most emphasis and to which I would direct the attention of the House is a very new principle which has been creeping in gradually and which is now definitely enshrined in the whole course of this Bill.  That is the vital principle of having the State and State Departments bound like everybody else.  As the Minister explained, the State is only bound at the moment in so far as what used to be known as Crown rents or Crown lands are concerned.  It seems to me undemocratic even now that a State Department can plead the statute against a private citizen, whereas the private citizen is precluded from pleading the statute against the State or any Department of the State. That inhibition, operating against the private citizen and in favour of the <Col N="1159" /> State, has no place in a democracy such as we know it.  It is a relic, a very bad relic and a relic that should not be preserved, of the old doctrine of <i>nullum tempus occurrit ecclesiae.</i>  It all springs from the old doctrine that the king could do no wrong.  I believe this Bill represents another step away from these outmoded ideas.  As I have already mentioned, we got rid last year of the Public Authorities (Protection) Act.  That was certainly a definite advance in getting rid of what I have already described as inequitable and what might in a very large number of cases be described as iniquitous legislation.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that, arising out of the consideration that will be given to this Bill, and following on the consideration given to the Public Authorities (Protection) Act last year, the time is coming, and coming rapidly, when the private citizen will, in all matters of legal relationship, be put into the same position as the State Department.  There is, for instance, still left with us the legal position that the State is not responsible for the torts or wrongdoing of its servants, whereas the ordinary employer is.  That is an anomaly that should be rectified with all speed, particularly having regard to the great number of State employees who are now roaming around the country, whether they move as a result of the putting into operation, say, of the land project or whether they move as the inspectors who were to be tucked into the fields under another régime.  In any case, the number of State employees who move round the country now has greatly increased.  All have been fitted out, or at least have fitted themselves out, for instance, with motor-cars. They are all, therefore, in that position of being potential wrongdoers, of committing wrongful acts with nothing criminal about them, but nevertheless, while they are on State business, the State should be liable for any accident which may place them in a position of legal responsibility for any kind of personal injuries which result.</P>

      <P>What would be the point in making the State responsible? Maybe I misunderstood the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about the necessity for uniformity and saying that on the question of legal relationship and legal responsibility, the State and the individual should be on a par. As to the periods of limitation being prescribed, again I am pleased to see that they are being made more uniform, though it might well be argued that the six years is too long in ordinary contract and tort actions.  At the time these periods of limitations were laid down originally in those actions, when a man moved from one county to another with travelling facilities so difficult and with the legal process much slower than it is now, it might be argued that there was justification for the period laid down; but now with the legal process speeded up and jurisdiction changed considerably, there would, in my opinion, be no need for such a long time.  That particular feature could be brought more into line with the rest of the uniform periods set out in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to note that the period for personal injuries actions is to be three years.  That is a good thing from the point of view of the person who is being made responsible and for the person who is seeking to be compensated for injuries caused to him.  The sooner actions start and the sooner they are got under way, the better chance the person has of being adequately compensated.  If the case is allowed to lag, it might be more or less impossible to convince a jury that a man who had so well recovered in that time had suffered any great injuries at all.  It is difficult when time passes in cases of that kind for a jury to come to a proper assessment of pain and suffering, there being no <Col N="1161" /> objective evidence before them of pain, suffering or disability of any kind.</P>
    <P>It is also admirable that the law relating to the limitation of action in regard to land is being tidied up and codified.  Under the existing law, a great deal of trouble has to be undergone in order to sift out matters of quite simple import.  To know exactly where one is at times cause more trouble than most laymen would be inclined to admit or appreciate.  I might also mention the codification that has been done to the law in relation to trustees.  I think the intention of the 1888 Trustee Act was to bring in all trustees, whether they were express or constructive, and it is right, as it is contemplated here, that constructive trustees like executors and administrators should have the same law applied to them as is applied to express trustees.  They are in trust positions, just the same as the others.</P>
    <P>The law as to acknowledgment and part-payment, fraud and mistake, also needed codification and I am glad to see that the rule as to an implied promise to pay in the case of the acknowledgment of a simple contract is being abolished.  The law of disability has always been mixed up or hotchpotch, and it is to be welcomed that the rule as to disabilities is being extended to cover all types of actions.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Boland, who followed the Minister, I cannot very well draw this hopelessly inadequate contribution of mine to this debate to a close without complimenting the draftsman in this case, and particularly in relation to the side note.  It would, indeed, be a very good thing and would make life a great deal easier for the practitioner, if such side notes became a feature of all Bills, particularly codifying Bills such as this.  These explanatory side notes, so far as I know, are an innovation in a Bill of this type.  They are exceptionally helpful and have proved of considerable assistance to people, even with some knowledge of these matters before going through the Bill. It is for these reasons and many others that I give my support and wholehearted welcome to this Bill.  But again I would say, as has been said already, <Col N="1162" /> this is a Bill essentially for consideration in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a layman I am, to quote the Minister, rather at sea in keeping the general picture in mind. As the Minister is trying to clear up some of the remnants of feudalism, I should like to mention one small problem in my own mind.  In the sale of land by landlords, they sometimes imposed burdens inequitable and incommensurate with the value of the land sold.  These moneys were never paid and no attempt was made at calculating them.  They were imposed, I suppose, in some Micawber-like hopefulness that something might turn up at some time.  When these lands come on the market, there is never any question raised either by buyer or seller as to the payment of these imposed burdens. But when the Minister for Lands purchases land for forestry and possibly for redistribution, he acquires a form of fee simple that nobody else demands.  Not only does he want a clearance of the land annuities, but he also will insist on retaining a sum of money, in the fear that the beneficiaries of the imposed burden might at some time turn up, even though there is no trace of any member of the family who originally sold the land.  I have no sympathy with them because they were generally the landlord class and did very well out of it.</P>
      <P>I do not know if, in dealing with the problems the Minister is trying to deal with in this Bill, you could be specific in clearing up problems of that nature. It would be very difficult for the Minister for Lands because he finds it difficult enough to get land for forestry. These burdens which have never been collected and never will be collected are being imposed by him in the fashion of holding a certain sum of money for their possible but wholly improbable collection.  I wonder is there anything included in this Bill that might remedy that particular problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the Deputies who have spoken, would like, first, to congratulate the Minister and the draftsman on this Bill, not only on its form and drafting but also on its context, because it seems to me that, in the <Col N="1163" /> very short time since this Bill was forecast, on the hearing of the Fatal Injuries Bill, a very comprehensive job, both of codification and of reform, has been done.  With regard to what Deputy Moylan mentioned just now, I think there would be one problem.  If I understand Deputy Moylan correctly, he suggested that these head burdens which exist both in the acquisition of land by the Land Commission and by the Forestry Division&mdash;the superior interests, as they are called&mdash;might be eliminated.  I think we would run into constitutional difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me, sir.  Am I right in saying there is a limitation of 80 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  The Deputy means that the limitation should be shortened.  Yes.  That would not run you into any difficulty, possibly, but it did occur to me that the existence of these superior interests is just a matter of property as well as anything else. You certainly could not eliminate them, but you might alter the period during which they may be recovered. You cannot alter the fact of existence.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill, its most formidable move forward is this question of the application of it to the State and all State authorities.  Like Deputy Lindsay, I should like to express the hope that it is merely a step in that direction.  If there is any branch of our legal system which is quite inapplicable to existing day to day circumstances, it is what may be called the Crown prerogative section of the law in this country.  The exclusion of the State from the statutory limitations, the exclusion of the State from the liability for torts, other than the special cases of workmen's compensation and Road Traffic Act cases&mdash;all that has no possible basis in common sense or in justice at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, when dealing with the Fatal Injuries Bill recently, gave an undertaking to the House that he would extend the liability created under that Act and under the Road Traffic Act of 1933 on the State for accidents caused by motor vehicles to all other tortious <Col N="1164" /> acts on the part of all other servants of the State and would have legislation introduced to that end.  I am glad to see this Bill again applying to the State the same restrictions and the same limitations as are applicable to private persons and I take that as a token of the intention of the Government as soon as possible to bring all branches of this law of the Crown prerogative up to date and into line with common sense.</P>
    <P>If that is the intention behind this Bill&mdash;I do not want to quibble at what it has done&mdash;it does seem to me that an unreasonable and unjustifiable distinction is being made in the law between the State's position with regard to ordinary debts and the State's position with regard to the recovery of land.  As I read the Bill, Section 11 would include debts due to the State created by statute other than the ordinary revenue, which is a separate problem, statutory debts in connection with which up to this there was a 20 years' limitation, statutory debts created possibly between private individuals.  That is being reduced to six years.  As I understand the position, the State has applied to have the ordinary limitations for contracts or for actions of tort six years.</P>
    <P>When we come to the recovery of land by the State, the existing situation is most unsatisfactory&mdash;60 years &mdash;but it is only reduced to 40.  It may be that there is, but I cannot immediately see, any real justification for that.  When you think in practical terms of what an action by the State to recover land and what a limitation of 40 years means, it is this: After the date on which the State first became entitled to recover that land, became entitled to bring an action to put them back into possession of that land, they can lie by for 40 years before they do in fact recover it.  It is not a question of a person being in State lands in some way acknowledging the situation.  It is not a question of a person paying rent for 40 years. Starting from now, if a particular State Department owns land or is concerned with land owned by the State and if, to-morrow, a right of action accrues in that State Department to recover that land, what possible justification <Col N="1165" /> is there for permitting the State to lie by for 40 years and then to bring an action which it should have taken 40 years before to recover the same land?  That is what this section will do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this point.  I appreciate that the application of this Bill at all to the State is a change; it is a reform; it is a move, a move which is not easily made by the State, which does not like creating new burdens or new liabilities for itself.  I also appreciate that the reduction of the time from 60 years to 40 years is a move in the right direction.  But, as a general proposition, I would ask the Minister carefully to consider between this and the later stages of the Bill whether it might not be feasible to reduce it still further and to put the State on the same footing as a private individual with regard to the recovery of land.</P>
      <P>It may be that there are particular problems with regard to the recovery of State lands, or the particular cases as regards ownership of State lands which I have not got under contemplation at present which justify this, but, on the face of it, on first look, it does seem to me that there is a case to be made for putting the State in the same position as the individual with regard to the recovery of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other short aspects of the Bill which, without holding the House up too much at this stage, I should like to mention, because it seems to me, while not wanting to deal with it as if we were in Committee, that there are individual points which, possibly, the Minister would like to know the views of the House on before we get to the Committee Stage.  One is the question of slander.  A lot of our limitation Acts and a lot of our <Col N="1166" /> limitation statutes were created haphazardly and created badly.  One very often finds seemingly peculiar anachronisms. Slander <i>per se</i> is a matter to which that applies.  The distinction here is this: Up to the present there were certain types of slander which were actionable on proof that the words were spoken, such as words defamatory of a man in his trade, or occupation, or business, and in that case, if a man said: &ldquo;You are a thief and that is all about it,&rdquo; that is a slander and is actionable whether or not damages might be recovered; the other type is the slander in which damages are recoverable only if you can prove special damages.  These are the sort which are not the more obvious ones, such as to say that a man is a thief, or a robber, or a drunkard in his job as bus driver.</P>
    <P>The second type of slander to which I refer is the one in which, if a person could establish that he had suffered some special damage or loss as a result of that slander, he could recover damages.  There is the case where a man can prove that he lost his job or his promotion in his job, can establish that he had suffered special damages and recover these special damages.  Up to this, the short limitation of two years has been applied to words actionable <i>per se.</i>  It is now proposed to extend the further period applicable to slander where you have to prove special damage.  I can well see a situation arising in which a slander is spoken to-day about some person and very close to two years, or perhaps more than two years, may follow before any damage really follows from it.  Take the case of a man in a big concern or State service about whom a slander is spoken to-day.  That slander might not hit him until more than two years after it was spoken.  That is probably the foundation of the difference between the two types and I would ask the Minister to consider whether he might not be causing an injustice in this matter.</P>
    <P>There are other cases in the Act which are of interest.  I am not quite clear, and I would ask the Minister to elucidate, possibly on the next stage of the Bill, how the operations of Sections 36 and 37 are going to work.  Section <Col N="1167" /> 37 avoids the application of the statutes of limitations to any type of trustee.  In the words &ldquo;type of trustee&rdquo; is included the personal representative of a deceased person and it excludes from the operation of the Act a trustee who is still in possession of, or has converted to his own use, the trustee property.  Section 36 purports to restrict the right of the next-of-kin claiming on death to 12 years.  I think the two conflict.  It is difficult to see how a claim by a next-of-kin can arise, except against the personal representative who holds, or has converted to his own use, the property of a deceased.  If Section 36 is meant to apply, Section 37 may have to be amended in some way.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter which I would like to mention at this stage, that is the effect of Section 37.  An important question in connection with the ordinary day to day title to land arises on that section.  Up to this, it has been said that the statute of limitations was only avoided in the case of an express trustee and express trustees were, amongst other people, held to include the personal representative of a deceased owner of registered land. That is a very confined class of person. Suppose John Murphy dies and he was the owner of land not registered with the Land Commission.  His personal representative was not an express trustee and the statute of limitations applied to him, and he could go in and occupy the land and acquire the title.  On the other hand, if John Murphy was a registered owner, then his personal representative was not an express trustee and could never acquire the title against the next-of-kin.</P>
    <P>Now, under this section, any person taking out a grant of administration to the estate of a deceased owner of land, whether a tenancy, or registered land, or fee simple, can never acquire a title against the next-of-kin of the deceased owner of that land.  I think that is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides that nothing in it shall enable any action to be brought which was barred before the operative date by any enactment repealed by this Act.  My fear is that <Col N="1168" /> Section 8 and Section 38 combined may not be sufficient to remedy the situation it is sought to remedy.  If a person, taking out a grant of administration in the case of unregistered land, came for advice after three years, he would be told, up to to-day, that he had acquired title to the land and was the full owner.  I feel that, in this instance, there is an introduction into this Bill of an excepting clause which was never an excepting clause before.</P>
    <P>I think it is worth while pointing out that the terms of Section 37 are going to make a very extensive change, or a fairly extensive change, in the devolution of land in this country.  We should make perfectly certain that nothing of that change should become retrospective in its effect.  There would be no justification for this House regulating retrospectively the manner in which land has descended to the people.  The operation of previous Acts may not have been sound, but it would be a very different element if, inadvertently, we, by this Bill, were to have any retrospective alteration in the descent of land.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters I would like to mention in connection with the Bill.  Generally speaking, I should like to come back to congratulate the Minister and the Department on the scope and the drafting of the Bill.  I wonder would it be possible for the Minister having assisted the Deputies by his marginal notes to leave them there afterwards to assist the lawyers.  I do not think there would be anything wrong in that.  I think all the Local Government Acts have explanatory notes but not in the way of this Bill.  Certainly from the point of view of the lawyer looking at this if it is passed into an Act, it would be a tremendous assistance to have opposite the sections the sections which they repeal or re-enact.  These notes need not have the force of law but it would make it much easier for a lawyer working on it later.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and Department on the scope and form of the Bill and I would ask him especially for further extension of the principle of putting the State in <Col N="1169" /> the same position as a private individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a layman, I find myself in much the same sea as Deputy Boland except that if anything the boat is smaller.  I do not even pretend to understand this Bill at all except that it is codifying a piece of law.  I only want to refer to the suggestion by Deputy Boland that this Bill should go to a Special Committee.  If the Second Stage of this Bill were being taken in October, I do not think I would agree because I prefer generally to see a Bill in Committee before the whole House. However, as we are coming into the financial period of the year and the House will no doubt be very busy, if the Bill is not sent to a Special Committee either of two things will happen &mdash;(1) the Bill will be delayed by not being taken in Committee at all until after July or, (2)&mdash;and this is even more probable&mdash;it will be scamped through rather quickly, and it is a very technical Bill.  I am not suggesting that I should attempt to do anything on it at any stage, but as Deputy Finlay has pointed out there are some things in it which seem to be contradictory and if there are things in it which to a lawyer seem contradictory one can imagine what they will look like to a layman.</P>
      <P>I, too, want to congratulate the Minister on the marginal notes.  I think these are a very great improvement in the case of legislation by reference and it is a great advantage to have them so clearly set out.  I do think it would be of great assistance to lawyers to have it in the Act, if that is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say just one thing which struck me?  I am wondering if these marginal notes are not too much directed to lawyers to start with. The third one on Section 2 refer to Deasy's Act.  Every other Act referred to in the notes is referred to by date and chapter but to the layman, <Col N="1170" />&ldquo;Deasy's Act&rdquo; means nothing and I wonder why it alone of all the Acts is picked out in the marginal abbreviations for reference in this way?  It does not even turn up in the notes on page 4 where one might expect it.  That is a very minor quibble and I am only drawing attention to it because, as a layman, it does look rather odd.  I did ask a lawyer myself what was the date of Deasy's Act so that I could look it up and he was 60 years out on the date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The marginal notes are attractive, I suppose, at first sight. Frankly, I doubt their value except in so far as they are an index.  I do not mean that in regard to the Bill here now because what has been done for the Bill is excellent.  I am talking about the proposal that these notes should be in the Bill in its final form. I am wondering if they would be of value to the lawyers.  I suppose in one sense they would be convenient but are they not liable to bring about a certain amount of ambiguity in interpretation later even though you may explicitly provide that they are not part of the law?  It is only a point of view, but certainly, as far as the present proposal is to have them in Bills before the House I think it is a very helpful one, because you have the reference there immediately.</P>
      <P>Before going into the provisions of the Bill I, too, would like to say what other Deputies have said.  This Bill has been a major undertaking, a very difficult and important effort.  We have already had experience in the case of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act but in that case there was more restriction and the field was more confined and even though the preparation of that Act was a big undertaking this is even bigger.  I would say it is one that entails more worry, because, as Deputy Finlay has pointed out, it can inadvertently touch on branches of law and modify branches of our law, modify rights in ways unforeseen all too easily, so that I can well understand the hesitancy of any Minister or his advisers in undertaking a task of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I think it was Deputy Lindsay who pointed out that an assault on this problem was long overdue.  I think it is proper that <Col N="1171" /> tribute should be paid to the Department for the excellent staff work that has apparently been done here.  After all, a Bill in its first draft is a first draft no matter what way you look at it and I think a great deal of credit is due there.  We often have occasion to criticise the way things come to this House but happily on this occasion we can take the other line.  I presume too that the Attorney-General's Department has had a hand in the drafting of this, in the whole of it, and to the people concerned I think the House is indebted.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Bill itself&mdash;as has been pointed out, this is a technical Bill.  It is, on the other hand, a Bill that cannot be dealt with by this House and regarded merely as a technical matter because it is one that will be felt in the community.  There are a number of principles in this Bill which need examination.  As to how to attack them, we can only talk very generally.  I rather feel somewhat as Deputy Sheldon feels, that this Bill will not be handled properly or that it will be skimmed through in the current session with a certain urgency about it.  It is a Bill which will require the expert attention of lawyers and, perhaps&mdash;it is only a personal suggestion&mdash;but perhaps it might be considered whether a Special Committee in the form tried out on a couple of other Bills before, should be given this Bill to deal with, care being taken that the personnel selected to do it would have some qualifications for the task. This proposal could be considered by the Minister.  I do not press him on that by any means, but I think the point raised by Deputy Sheldon is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have to be approached, quite obviously, on the lines developed by Deputy Finlay, in the manner which he has more or less outlined for us here.  It is quite obvious that if there is to be any real Committee debate on this Bill, it will be a question of not only, as in the case of ordinary Bills, a particular matter arising on a particular amendment to a section but it will also be a matter of discussing the correlation of section with those <Col N="1172" /> which have gone before or which follow.</P>
    <P>There are a large number of sections in it which are, of course, very technical and again I doubt whether it can be&mdash;it certainly can be adequately treated in Committee in this House&mdash; but it will certainly be a time-consuming process.  It is no use anticipating that stage here, even to the extent that Deputy Finlay very usefully and helpfully did.</P>
    <P>In regard to the State Departments, that principle is important.  First, I think that, under modern conditions, there is, in general principle anyway, little justification for putting the State in a privileged position in the matter of limitations to actions.  Historically, of course, one can understand how the present situation arose.  There was the natural tendency to preserve the principles of law.  There was also and, perhaps, a more important factor in the situation.  There was the ease in former days with which the Crown, as it then was, in contemplation of law, or the Government or the State, could be fooled or defrauded.</P>
    <P>I think that in days when communications were nothing in comparison with what they are to-day, that was a real danger and difficulty.  On that score alone, one could build a very sound case for the way the law lay. But, in modern times, when, on the one hand, the State's relation to the individual is becoming much more close at very many more points than formerly, where the State organisations are much moret extensive and have ample means of communication, there seems to be little justification for preserving special privileges in the matter of limitations.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the case of the recovery of land, someone in adverse possession of State lands as mentioned by Deputy Finlay.  In a case like that, why should we give a longer period to the State than to an individual?  If anything, it is more likely that the State will have the machinery and the organisation to know precisely what its rights are.  It is much less likely, in fact, that State rights nowadays can be defrauded, owing to lack of knowledge, than that an individual's may.  If <Col N="1173" /> anything, on that basis one could argue that you should give more latitude to the individual than to the State.  Of course, I am not actually proposing that, but on that basis one could even make that case.  Whatever way it is, the position such as the public authorities got in the old Act is now gone and I doubt whether the position of the State in regard to recovering lands now is justifiable.</P>
    <P>It would be a great practical simplification to have the one period of limitation, whether you extend it in the case of the individual or contract it in the case of the State.  This Bill goes a great way&mdash;I am not taking from it&mdash; in simplifying and bringing uniformity. Deputy Finlay is probably right when he says that you could go further and get complete uniformity in this regard in connection with the State, if the thing were examined again.  Of course, as he said, there may be some specific things somewhere to which we have not adverted here.  I am making allowances for that.  I would lend myself to supporting the point of view that he expressed on that and I commend it to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>There is one matter about which I am a little puzzled in regard to the explanation, but that may be attributable to pure obtuseness on my part. Why relate the period in Section 13 to the period for title?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case in respect of the State, why does the individual not get the benefit of the 40 years' limitation?  Does the Deputy see what I mean?  That is why I say I do <Col N="1174" /> not follow the conclusiveness of the argument; in other words, applying your argument uniformly both ways. Again, I do not mind how it is done. That is only by way of reinforcing what was said already.  The State will not in any way suffer over this and I think it would be a great simplification to go the whole way in this matter, particularly as nowadays, with State organisation and machinery, there can be very little opportunity of the State being defrauded in this matter.  That, of course, is said, as Deputy Finlay carefully pointed out, subject to the particular problems that may arise and to which we have not yet adverted.</P>
      <P>If I continue in this vein, I will be going into the Committee Stage of the Bill, so I would, perhaps, content myself with a couple of general points. Deputy Finlay pointed out the danger of radically amending the law.  We want to alter the law in regard to limitations, but at least we do not want to alter the law by actions in regard to devolution.  The Road Traffic Act amendment in regard to making the State liable for torts is very highly desirable.  In fact, I think, I myself attempted to follow up Deputy Finlay's suggestion in that respect in the case of a previous Bill and came into conflict with the rules of the House.  I think we were told that the matter would be attended to.  I do not think that is a matter for this particular Bill, but it should not be lost sight of and I take this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that it should be followed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, by and large, do you want to attempt in a Bill like this?  The Minister gave us at the end of his statement an outline of his general procedures and intention.  As regards this law of limitation, as we have to face it now and cure the defects in the Bill, that law grew up, roughly speaking, from three causes.  You had, first of all, this particular position of the State as a factor; you had, secondly, the whole history of legal development, statutory and in the courts, which naturally had a certain haphazard element in it; and, lastly, you had what was grafted on to the law by the courts in their efforts to keep the law from <Col N="1175" /> working hardship&mdash;in other words, to apply the law equitably.</P>
    <P>As statutes were enacted with one intention, they unwittingly worked hardship or injustice on others.  In many cases, the courts found ways of alleviating such distress.  On the other hand, the courts in applying their equitable jurisdiction, as it was called, used the law as it was defined by Acts of Parliament as a convenient standard or guide where possible.  Now that is what we are trying to change.  We have expressed our opinion on the question of the State.  On the question of the basic approach to this I suppose you cannot completely forget the historical development in the matter, but the essential thing is to look at this from a modern point of view&mdash;from the point of view of the state of society and the state of the law at the present day and to make the amendments which the present day demands and not to be influenced unduly by historical factors.</P>
    <P>That may bring about the doing of some things which may seem revolutionary but it will make for uniformity and for easy administration.  There are two instance in which I would like that particular care would be taken and for which I should like to see a Special Committee set up in order to watch these things.  The first instance is on the question of fraud and fiduciary relationships which are attempted to be dealt with explicitly in this Bill. The point to be borne in mind is that the courts adopted the attitude they did in those matters on the very simple, straightforward principle of seeing that crime did not pay, that fraud and sharp practice or the taking advantage of persons of trust could not be used to defeat the right to remedy any of the things with which we are dealing here.</P>
    <P>There is a certain danger that if these things became explicit, or too explicit, they would become too rigid and actually defeat their own intentions.  I have not examined in detail the sections dealing with that particular point but I think it is appropriate to say at this stage that great care must be <Col N="1176" /> taken to see that the very important principle upon which the courts were able to achieve a great measure of justice as between litigating parties over the years is carefully enshrined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The other point, which is the last one on this question, deals with equity and the jurisdiction in equity.  Jurisdiction in equity is not what is sometimes understood to be a lawful jurisdiction in the courts to do what they think fit although that is, to a certain extent, the principle behind the thing &mdash;that equity jurisdiction is, in principle, to enable the courts to see that justice is done as between litigants and that justice is done generally.  That is crystallised into a very definite code of law and if it is all very technical, there must be, nevertheless, that particular jurisdiction in the courts which has been very effective in keeping the law in line with society.</P>
    <P>No matter what any Legislature does or any court does, conditions in society change, and it is difficult if not impossible to have the written legal system in complete conformity at any particular time with conditions in society outside.  It is obviously desirable that the two should conform as closely as possible.  For that reason I think it is important that the courts would not be tied too rigidly in the matter of limitations.  They are tied. That is perhaps not the right way to put it, but I would like to see that there is no inroad in principle on the equity jurisdiction of the courts at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to see that, where there is necessity for change in the matter of that jurisdiction, it should be very carefully examined and there should be consultation with experts, with practitioners preferably, on that point. I do not think there is much more to be said on this stage, other than to point out that, not having digested the contents of the Bill completely, I find some phrases in it which make me apprehensive of the Minister's opening statement&mdash;such phrases as: &ldquo;In every case where the court formerly acted in obedience, though not in express obedience.&rdquo;  As I say, phrase like that in the Minister's opening statement <Col N="1177" /> made me slightly apprehensive.</P>
    <P>The main point in which I am interested at the moment is the question of trustees and people in fiduciary relationships.  Something might be done to make the law clear on how time might affect equitable actions, but I will say on the sections referred to by Deputy Finlay that we would want to be very careful we did not change the substance of the law here as has happened in other directions. Perhaps my fears in this connection are groundless, but we should be careful about making fundamental alterations in certain jurisdictions. However, these are merely points to be watched later.  This is essentially a technical measure, every part of which will require close attention.  It is a measure that should be dealt with by a number of people round a table, a limited number of people who would be prepared to go into its details and to give the benefit of their practical experience of dealing with these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister realises that the welcome which has been given on all sides of the House to the encroachment made by this Bill on the prerogatives which the State has hitherto enjoyed, is qualified to the extent that we are prepared to see an encroachment of a less gradual shape and I would express the hope that during the passage of the Bill through the House there might be a further encroachment on these prerogatives.  I agree with Deputy Finlay in his references to Section 11 (2) (c) of the Bill. That is the section which refers to slander.  I could never really see the reason for the differentiation between the period of limitation in regard to slander and libel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, I suppose, something to be said for the differentiation between slander <i>per se</i> and libel but not between ordinary slander and libel.  In fact I think that, in the run of things, defamatory words would be much more likely to be damaging when written in the public Press or in a book than when they are spoken among a few people possibly in some public house or in some private home.  There is one <Col N="1178" /> other thing I should like to refer to. It is contained in Section 39 in reference to people under a disability&mdash; infants or persons of unsound mind.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the old Common Law Procedure Act, also in reference to people under a disability, referred to people beyond the seas.  It is quite true that measure was passed in 1853 when the world was a much larger place, and when communications were not at all as effective as they are now. However, I still think it is a matter to which some consideration might be given.  There are pros and cons.  It is true that modern communications have made it much easier for people to find out if they have a cause of action beyond the seas.  In the case of a country which has suffered so much emigration since the State was founded, I think we should take some measures to ensure that people who have been driven from their homeland and are now beyond the seas would have their rights preserved in some fashion.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was wrong when he informed the House that, at the moment, the period of limitation for common law action in the case of negligence&mdash;where one is knocked down by a motor car, for instance&mdash;is four years: so far as I know, it is six years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that during the Second Reading of this Bill what amounted to practically a private discussion took place between Deputy Major de Valera and Deputy Finlay would seem to bear out and support the case that has been made that the Committee Stage of this Bill should be entrusted to a Select Committee of the House.  Like some of the previous speakers, I would support the case that has been made for a Select Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious and it is so stated in the Explanatory Memorandum that this is a very technical Bill.  That being so, many references during the course of the Committee Stage will have to be made to previous enactments, possibly decided case law.  It would be helpful if access could be had to statutes and case law in the course of the Committee Stage here but that is not very <Col N="1179" /> easily done when one is on one's feet here and addressing the House.  As well as that, it is only human that even persons well practised in the law might not wish to have their opinions made the subject of criticism and, possibly, correction in this House.  Therefore, I feel it would be more practical and possibly more useful from the point of view of the final state in which this Bill will appear if the Committee Stage were to take place before a Select Committee rather than before the whole House.</P>
    <P>I am not completely <i>ad idem</i> with Deputies Finlay and Major de Valera, with regard to the legal obligations and rights of the State.  I think there is a case to be made that, in so far as the State is concerned, the time in which its rights may be enforced should be slightly longer than in the case of the individual.  Certainly, with regard to actions against the State, I cannot see any reason why the State should be in any privileged position over and above the individual.  However, with regard to accidents in respect of which the State must enforce its rights against an individual or corporation, I think some case can be made for extending the time somewhat in favour of the State.</P>
    <P>Happily, in this country, we have had a very high standard in public life, both executive and administrative. However, one cannot always rely on that record and be sure that such a happy position will continue for all time.  It may be that from time to time, some unscrupulous official may be given to collusion with some member of the public with regard to some right that that member of the public might be inclined to make against the State.  It may be with regard to the acquisition of property.  An official could possibly turn the blind eye for a sufficiently long period to enable some person to get an adverse right against the State.  Being such a complex corporation as it is at the present time, there may well be a good argument in favour of giving the State a somewhat extended time over and above the individual who is more flexible than the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Some of the points I might have made at this stage have already been made.  I should like to make just one other reference to Section 11.  Deputy Barrett referred to it to some extent. Actions in tort are limited to six years under this Bill, but actions founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, where they consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to any person, shall not be brought after the expiration of three years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.  That is provided under paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 11.  If only for the sake of uniformity, that period of three years should be extended to six. Apart altogether from the uniformity aspect of it, it could well happen that the consequences of a person's injuries as a result of tort, negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, no matter what it is, might not fully manifest themselves for a period beyond three years. Admittedly, it may happen only very rarely but I think no special case can be made for limiting actions where personal injury is caused to some person to three years from the cause of action accruing.  As well as that, it seems that the sub-section limits all actions for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, no matter how small the personal injury aspect might be, to three years.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong that because a person may have been injured in a small way incidentally to some action by a third party which caused injury as well, his action must be brought side by side with his action for damages in respect of injury to his other property within three years of the cause of action accruing.  Take just one example, and it may not be a very recurring example&mdash;subsidence in a house.  If a person is injured because of subsidence, the subsidence may be as a result of excavation by a local contractor or an individual.  The damage may be great and if the person happens to be sitting in a room and gets a crack from a falling brick he must bring his action within three years of the cause of action accruing. It may be that the cause of the accident may have existed for more than <Col N="1181" /> three years prior to his receiving the injury.  In that case, I think there should be no limitation as far as the action for injury to the house is concerned, if he also happens to be injured personally.  That is the only point I want to refer to at this stage.  If for no other reasons than uniformity and the fact that this is a consolidating Bill, I think there is no justification for having a limitation of three years in the one case and six years in the other. In common with other Deputies, I was struck by the obvious amount of effort that went into this Bill and, if for no other reason than the amount of effort it contains, the Minister and his officials, be they in his own Department or in that of the Attorney-General, deserve the highest compliments and the congratulations of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I should like to preface my remarks by saying that it is very clear from this Bill that the Minister, his advisers and the draftsmen have put a great amount of work and effort into the framing of this measure.  There are not many ways in which it could be improved by prolonged debate or discussion here, but there are some matters which, even though of minor importance, are worthy of consideration.  I want to make a few suggestions which the Minister may consider, inasmuch as they may prove helpful eventually to those who will have to follow the contents of this Bill, when it becomes an Act of Parliament, and prevent hardship, perhaps, in cases where people may not realise that there is a more uniform rule and a more uniform limitation with regard to certain actions which appear to me to be similar in character than exists under the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it the object of the Bill is to codify the law of limitations which heretofore has been scattered over various Acts and knowledge of which has been acquired by usage and court decisions, and one thing and another. To a very large extent, this Bill will codify the law of limitations.  At the same time, I should like to address some of my remarks to simplifying <Col N="1182" /> some of the codifications, apart from merely codifying the limitations.</P>
    <P>On page nine of the memorandum, it is stated that heretofore a period of six years was the operative period in all tort actions except assaults, battery, wounding, etc., and these excepted actions will have a limitation period of four years henceforth.  Now, sub-section (2) (b) of Section 11 provides that personal injury actions for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty shall have a limitation period of three years only, instead of the present six years. Furthermore, we find that, under the Fatal Injuries Act, the period is also three years.  I cannot see any reason why there should be a difference in the period of limitation for the bringing of such actions.  There is, too, the danger that heretofore most lay people regarded most debts as being actionable for a period of six years and they felt reasonably safe in not instituting proceedings to protect their rights, while any part of that six-year period had still to run.  I think the Minister should seriously consider simplification as well as codification in this respect. I cannot for the life of me see why there should be a different period of limitation for bringing an action for assault or wounding as distinct from the period for bringing an action for personal injury.  Again, there is a different period for the bringing of an action under the Fatal Injuries Act.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that a three-year period for these actions is too short.  It may be that six years is too long, but one is more likely to create the occasional hardship that can be created by having too short a period rather than too long a period.  It is, I suppose, merely a matter of opinion, but I should be inclined to think that a four-year period would be less likely to create that occasional hardship, particularly for want of knowledge of the various periods.  I would respectfully suggest that the Minister might consider making the period for all these actions the same.  I would also suggest that three years seems to me to be a bit short.</P>
    <P>Everybody who spoke on this Bill seems to agree that the State should not be in any more privileged position <Col N="1183" /> than the private individual.  The private individual has, of course, less resources at his disposal to ascertain what the law is on any given matter as compared with the State, which has at its disposal senior officials and legal departments to act as guides.  I do not see why there should be any difference of any kind either in relation to title to land or in relation to liabilities on contracts, torts, or otherwise, as between the State and the private individual. Deputy Major de Valera pointed out that, in fact, the State is far better off in that respect than is the private individual, inasmuch as the State has a superior way of knowing what its rights are.</P>
    <P>There was a point raised in regard to Sections 36 and 37 in relation to the period of limitation applicable to trustees.  There is one particular type of trustee whose position I would like to mention specifically because he would be affected by the provisions of Section 37.  I refer to the administrator of a deceased person, particularly the administrator holding land who is regarded as a trustee for the next-of-kin, once he takes out the grant of administration.  We have cases regularly where a person is compelled to take out administration, administration which otherwise would not have been taken out, in order to obtain a benefit. The deceased owner of the estate may have, during his lifetime, become entitled to a substantial grant for the building of a new house, reconstruction work or reclamation work.  He dies before the money is paid.  His widow, or one of his children, in order to obtain payment of this grant is compelled to produce authority in the form of letters of administration.  By doing so, the individual immediately puts himself, or herself, as the case may be, in the position of being a trustee for the next-of-kin.  If he were not compelled to take out administration, he would not be a trustee and the 12-year period of limitation would apply, and if no next-of-kin made a claim within that 12-year period, he became the full owner.</P>
    <P>Now he is compelled to take out a grant of administration, not with the <Col N="1184" /> desire of becoming a trustee for the next-of-kin but to avail of grants to improve the property or recover moneys due by the State.  That simple act places him in an entirely different position.  He immediately becomes a trustee; and under Section 37 of this Bill, the period of limitation does not run in his favour.  In fact, no period of limitation runs in his favour, not even the overall 13-year period in another portion of the Bill.  I agree a trustee must be bound to account, and he should not ordinarily be entitled to avail of the statute of limitations in the same way as the ordinary individual, but I think, at the same time, Section 37 should be reconsidered in order to find some solution which will protect everybody.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the position as we know it&mdash;I know it mostly in the country, but other people will have different experiences&mdash;is that there are cases where it might be considered that trustees should not be allowed to avail of the provisions of the statute of limitations to prevent hardship and there are cases where this particular section is going to impose a great hardship.  I might cite as an example the case of a person dying intestate and leaving seven or eight children.  These children, in this modern age, will have received a reasonably good education and some of them may go away, may go to foreign countries, and may spend years and years away.  If I am interpreting Section 37 of the Bill correctly, it makes no difference how long these individuals may enjoy life in some foreign land or how much better off they may be than the unfortunate person at home&mdash;they are entitled to come back and make their claim against that person.  If that person has taken out a grant of administration and put himself in the position of being a trustee, if he wants to avail of the estate, either for improvement of the land or for paying another member of the family or for any of the one hundred and one purposes named, he may have to take out administration to do that and he is immediately placing everybody under his care and protection, so far as their share of the estate is concerned. I do not think it is fair that <Col N="1185" /> that onus should be placed on him indefinitely and permanently.</P>
    <P>There should be some period of limitation.  Whether it is necessary to have a period any longer than the Act itself provides, I am not prepared to say at this stage.  It might be suggested that it would be unfair that the next-of-kin should be protected absolutely and entirely, as is being done by this section, but surely the ordinary laws of limitation protect everybody sufficiently well, whether the person is a trustee and administrator or is not acting in any fiduciary relationship at all.  We have, under the ordinary periods of limitation and under the law as it will stand, as it has heretofore stood and will stand under this Bill without Section 37 at all, a period of 12 years under which any person entitled to claim can make his claim.</P>
    <P>If any person is under a disability, if the person is an infant, that period is extended and that person still has a further period in which to make his claim, or 12 years, whichever is the longer.  If a member of the family is of unsound mind, that person is protected by the statute, so that, in a certain sense, there is no necessity further to protect people who are entitled to an interest in a deceased's estate by placing the unfortunate administrator or trustee in a worse position than any other private individual, as far as the administration of estates is concerned.  I think that anybody who does not make his claim within the time limit set by the Bill, and within the extended period for a person under a disability, does not need that claim and there is no reason why he should be further protected.  A 12-year period is long enough.  You are going to hold up a family indefinitely; you are going to defeat the very thing successive Governments say they are anxious to do&mdash;to secure the keeping of people on the land.</P>
    <P>I am, say, a member of a family of nine and my mother has taken out administration on the death of my father, and I am the second or third eldest son who has stayed at home to help my mother for eight or ten years working this holding.  My mother unfortunately has had to take out a grant <Col N="1186" /> of administration for some purpose, such as I mentioned earlier, to get £100 or £200 lodged in the bank or to get a grant from the Department of Local Government.  I talk to my mother and ask her about settling the place.  I am now 28 or 29 years of age. She tells me she would love to do it, but unfortunately she cannot do it. She is only a trustee by reason of the unfortunate necessity of taking out a grant of administration, and, even if she settles the place on me, I still have no right to it beyond my original share. As there are nine of us in the family and my mother is still living, that is one-ninth of two-thirds, a two-twenty-sevenths share.  I am not going to stay at home.  I may, because of a moral obligation to see that my mother is looked after, that somebody stays with her in her old age, but it is completely unfair that I should be doing this, without any hope of benefit or the security of knowing I will become the owner.  If members of the family abroad refuse to release their claim, and if my mother or whoever takes out administration, the occupier, has never taken out administration, title will be acquired against the absent members of the family.</P>
    <P>I may have dwelt on this subject too long, but I feel it is a subject that the Minister should consider very seriously, because it will be a very great help to large families where the head of the family may not have made provision, either by will or deed of settlement, during his life for the succession afterwards. It will be suggested by the Minister that members of the family should come together and release their claims, but there is always the possibility that some members of the family will not feel that they should do that.  I think they have plenty of time to make a claim in the period of 12 years, without giving them this further period for all time while the administrator lives. If the Minister feels that that particular 12-year period is short, he may extend it a little further, but I do not think there is any necessity for that.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one other matter, that is, the fact that this Bill, if it becomes law, is certain to affect a good many claims and rights of action <Col N="1187" /> of many people in various ways.  It is suggested here that the Bill will come into operation possibly on 1st January, 1957.  It might be considered that that period is somewhat too early to bring into operation the various alterations which will be effected by it and that people should have an opportunity of looking into their position, so that it will not work against their interests and that they will have ample opportunity of seeing what their position will be; in other words, it would be better to put it back a further six or 12 months so that hardship will not be inflicted on anybody.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is some substance in what I say, that an overall period of four years would be far simpler and probably work a lesser hardship and certainly prevent any room for confusion.  I would again suggest a uniform period of four years. As regards slander cases, I think Deputy Finlay has made a strong case for an extension of the period.  Two years is certainly sufficient for the type of slander actionable <i>per se,</i> but there is the type of slander in which special damages must be proved before the person can succeed.  Very often those special damages are difficult to prove and the effect of the slander may not be apparent for a couple of years after the slander has been published. In respect of slander which is not actionable <i>per se,</i> the Minister might consider whether a uniform period of four years, the same as for personal accident, wounding and so on, would be a more proper period for slander not actionable <i>per se.</i></P>

      <P>I would like to express my gratitude for the complimentary remarks passed by the Deputies who spoke on this Bill, on the manner in which my officials have presented this measure.  We know it is a highly technical Bill and that there is a general desire on all sides of the House for its success.  Many of us are not highly skilled in the technical position but I am sure, with the co-operation of the House, we will get a Bill that will meet with everybody's approval.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> Deputy Boland raised a point in relation to people in rural areas.  There are many old people who never have their land registered until perhaps one of them becomes ill.  I am informed that under Section 52 of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, a person can make application to the court to have his title registered.  In any event, let me assure Deputy Boland and Deputy Moylan, who also raised an important point, that their suggestions will receive very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>There were some very valuable suggestions made this evening and, if anyone wishes to do so, I would be glad if they would communicate with one of my officials so that they could discuss all the various points between now and the Committee Stage.  I would welcome all the assistance I can get and I am sure the officials would be only too ready and willing to do what they can to have amendments put down on Committee Stage and have further discussion in connection with them.</P>
    <P>Deputies Finlay, Lindsay and Major de Valera, all legal men, raised questions in regard to certain privileges that the State may have as against the ordinary citizen.  There is a Bill entitled the State Proceedings Bill under consideration at the present time which will deal with the points which the legal Deputies have raised and will ensure the State will not have privileges over the ordinary citizen. We will also consider the points raised by Deputy Glynn in relation to the period of 40 years.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Bill has received the support of the House.  It is only a question then of considering details.  If the House is agreeable we can adjourn consideration of the Committee Stage for a month.  In the meantime my officials are at the disposal of any Deputy or group of Deputies to discuss the Bill and this will, I hope, ensure that we will have a Bill that will meet with the approval of the whole House instead of a Party Bill.  As I say, I will welcome their assistance and I can assure the House that it will be a pleasure for the officials to meet them under the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £34,770 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The details are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Under sub-head E (1)&mdash;£10,000&mdash;provision is made in a new item for the running expenses of a seed production farm at Backweston, Lucan, to extend the facilities for breeding and raising of pedigree strains of seeds of the principal agricultural crops leading up to schemes which have been inaugurated for the production of certified seed.</P>
      <P>Sub-head E (6)&mdash;£25,000&mdash;is a new sub-head and provides for the establishment of a peat land experimental station at Glenamoy, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that last year the Government carried out a full investigation into the plans and prospects of the statutory company entitled Min Fheir Teoranta which had been preparing for the production and sale of grass meal at Glenamoy, County Mayo.  As a result of this investigation the Government came to the conclusion that other measures would prove of more lasting economic and social benefit to Bangor Erris and would contribute towards a solution of the general economic problems of the western region.  The Government accordingly decided that the bog at <Col N="1190" /> Glenamoy should be developed by the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands working in close co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture is now undertaking comprehensive experiments to ascertain how best blanket bog can be reclaimed for agricultural use and applied to the creation of cultivable holdings in the West.  The Forestry Division is carrying out a full-scale experiment in the afforestation of a tract of blanket bog.  As regards cultivation, our object is to learn by properly conducted experiments the best and cheapest methods of drainage and of fertilising and the most suitable crops to be grown.  To achieve this object a peat land experimental station is being established at Glenamoy. The station will include farm buildings, a laboratory and office unit and accommodation for the staff.  The cost of the necessary buildings and certain equipment, estimated at £45,000, will be met from the National Development Fund.  The running expenses of the station (including staff and manual workers) during the current financial year, to which sub-head E (6) of this Supplementary Estimate relates, are estimated at £25,000.  This amount includes a sum of £12,423 8s. which was paid to Min Fheir Teoranta for the company's assets, including machinery and equipment, which were transferred to the Department of Agriculture on 30th August, 1955.  A sum of £70,000 was included in the Industry and Commerce Vote for the current year to provide for grants to Min Fheir Teoranta to defray the capital expenses of the company.</P>
    <P>Only £4,300 of that sum was issued prior to the termination of the Min Fheir activities and the commencement of operations by the Departments of Agriculture and Lands at Glenamoy, and there is thus a substantial saving on the Industry and Commerce Vote to offset the additional expenditure now being provided under this Vote. I should add that Min Fheir is in process of being wound-up and its cash balance on completion of the liquidation will be transferred to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There was no interruption of work at Glenamoy as a result of the transfer <Col N="1191" /> of the interest of Min Fheir Teoranta to the Department and drainage operations and other preparatory work have been continued vigorously in preparation for the large-scale experiments which are being initiated. Eleven workers have been recruited by the Department of Agriculture in addition to the 29 men taken over from Min Fheir Teoranta and I understand that a further 23 men have been recruited by the Forestry Division for afforestation work, bringing the total number at present employed at Glenamoy to 63.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to have buildings erected this year and meanwhile plans are being laid to seek answers to problems connected with moisture, soil amelioration, cropping and the management and utilisation of crops.  Detailed and diverse experiments in drainage, liming and manuring, cultivation, crop varieties, shelter belts, harvesting and crop rotations are being laid down scientifically and will be accurately recorded so that comprehensive information may be obtained on the many and varying problems of bog utilisation.  Experiments are being undertaken with the object of finding an appropriate technique to increase at minimum cost the stock-carrying capacity of uncultivated peat land. Special attention will be paid to the study of fodder conservation for winter feeding in areas of high rainfall, and the cultivation of industrial crops suitable to peat land.  Such information will prove useful in the treatment of other bog and hill lands and will, it is hoped, have wide application over large areas of western counties.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K (4)&mdash;£4,500&mdash;is a new sub-head and arises out of the subsidiary agreement dated 16th January, 1956, with the American authorities in connection with the Grant Counterpart Special Account.  It provides for issues as shown all of which will be ultimately recoverable from Grant Counterpart Funds.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (4)&mdash;£5,000&mdash;is to cover commitments entered into in respect of loans the administration of which has been transferred to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> With regard to sub-head M (8)&mdash; £105,000&mdash;the original £550,000 for the payment of grants under the farm buildings scheme is insufficient to meet payments during the current financial year.  In the period 1st April, 1955, to 31st January, 1956, grants amounting to £521,000 were paid, as against £479,000 in the corresponding period last year.  The average grant in the current year is working out at £34 as compared with £32 in the previous year.  It is expected that the grants which will fall due for payment in the remainder of the year will amount to £149,000 or a total of £670,000.  This is an excess of £120,000 on the original provision, but a saving of £15,000 is expected on the water supplies scheme for which £118,000 was provided.</P>

    <P>The quantity delivered to farmers from 1st March, 1955, to mid-January, 1956, was 824,000 tons as compared with 592,000 tons delivered in the same period of the previous year.  It is, accordingly, estimated that total deliveries in the current financial year will be in excess of 1,000,000 tons, an increase of about 25 per cent. on 1954-55. Expenditure by way of subsidy will, therefore, be greater than was anticipated and is now estimated at £680,000 instead of £600,000 as originally voted. Subsidy paid in 1954-55 amounted to £565,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1)&mdash;£5&mdash;is a new item and is inserted to make provision for the payment of compensation for animals slaughtered on account of Johne's disease.  The actual expenditure is expected to be about £500 but there are ample savings under other items of the sub-head to meet it.</P>
    <P>Johne's disease is a serious infectious disease of cattle and to some extent <Col N="1193" /> also of sheep and goats, and is widespread in many countries, including Britain.  The characteristic symptoms of the disease in cattle are gradual emaciation, reduced milk production and later persistent diarrhoea.  The condition is usually fatal, there being no effective curative treatment.</P>
    <P>So far, the incidence of the disease in Ireland is not as serious as in Britain or other countries abroad.  Cases have, however, been tending to occur in this country in recent years to an extent which makes it necessary that comprehensive control measures for dealing with the disease should be available. To this end an Order entitled &ldquo;Johne's Disease Order&rdquo; was made on 12th May, 1955, under the Diseases of Animals Acts.  Under this Order notices may be served restricting the movement of animals affected or suspected of being affected with Johne's disease.  The Order also enables the Minister to cause to be slaughtered any animals affected or suspected of being affected with Johne's disease and provides for payment of compensation in respect of animals so slaughtered.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head M (2)&mdash; £2,250, the number of animals slaughtered under the Bovine T.B. Order, 1926, was greater than was anticipated.</P>
    <P>The net deficiency in the Appropriations-in-Aid-sub-head R&mdash;is £217,515, details of which are furnished in the printed Estimate.  The individual items hardly call for comment except perhaps 19 (a), the recoupment from American Grant Counterpart Special Account.  In general terms the reduced figures for receipts are due mainly to the fact that expenditure was not incurred sufficiently early to earn the recoupment from the grant in this financial year or expenditure was incurred before the agreements were signed.</P>
    <P>The gross additional sum as shown on page 1 of the printed Estimate is £449,270, but this has been offset to the extent of £414,500 by savings on other sub-heads.  There are two items worthy of comment in these savings (1) £100,000&mdash;Grants for Pasteurisation of Milk, and £42,000&mdash;Bovine T.B. <Col N="1194" /> Eradication Scheme.  The pasteurisation scheme is an important adjunct to the T.B. eradication scheme and money expended under it is recoverable from the American Grant Counterpart. As the scheme is only in its preliminary stages payments have not yet matured.  The saving of £42,000 on the T.B. eradication scheme has occurred in County Clare where the disposal of reactors and the completion of byres have not proceeded as quickly as anticipated.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the T.B. eradication scheme is now in operation throughout the country and provides facilities to farmers or groups of farmers who desire to build up herds free of T.B.  Herd-owners who participate in the scheme are entitled to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Free T.B. testing of their herds by their own veterinary surgeons;</P>
    <P>(2)  Free professional advice on the eradication of T.B. from their herds;</P>
    <P>(3)  Grants at double the rates normally payable under the farm buildings scheme for the erection or improvement of cow byres;</P>
    <P>(4)  Grants for the extension of piped water supplies to farmyards and farms in addition to the grant normally available under the water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>Three areas have been specially selected for the intensive eradication of the disease, namely, County Clare, County Sligo and the Bansha area.  In these areas, the free professional advice at (2) above is provided by departmental veterinary inspectors and in addition herd-owners receive payment at current market value in respect of reactors (i.e., cattle failing to pass the T.B. test) disposed for slaughter at the direction of the Department.</P>
    <P>The scheme is on a voluntary basis at present and each herd-owner who elects to become a participant, after his herd has had the initial T.B. test which is carried out without any obligation on the part of the owner, is required to comply with certain conditions such as convenient assembly of cattle for testing, marking, etc., isolation and removal of reactors, disinfection <Col N="1195" /> of premises, improvement of byres and the keeping of a simple form of herd record.</P>
    <P>Compulsory measures will, in due course, be necessary for the eradication of the disease but fresh legislation will have to be passed before this step can be taken.</P>

      <P>The widespread response to the scheme following its introduction in September, 1954, has been maintained.  Applications received up to the end of January, 1956, covered almost 46,500 herds of which 13,000 were from the three intensive areas. Tests were completed in almost 37,000 herds representing more than 500,000 animals.  These tests disclosed that in north - western counties such as Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Sligo, more than 50 per cent. of the herds tested were free of disease while in the dairying counties in the South, such as Limerick and Cork, the incidence of disease was relatively high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second tests of herds were commenced in October, 1955, but reports on these tests are not so far available <Col N="1196" /> in sufficient numbers to permit the preparation of statistical material.</P>
    <P>The provision of £262,000 under sub-head M (13) is in respect of the administration of the scheme in County Clare and in the rest of the country (other than County Sligo and Bansha area).  The provision covers all expenditure on the scheme in these areas other than grants for the extension of piped water supplies to farmyards and farms in County Clare and the rest of the country and supplementary byre grants in the rest of the country which are being met out of the National Development Fund.  The expenditure provided for under sub-head M (13) will be recouped from the American Grant Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the scheme in County Sligo and Bansha area is also being met out of the National Development Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister one question?  He has mentioned two headings under which he has had savings&mdash;£100,000 for pasteurisation of milk and £42,000 on the T.B. scheme. Where the balance of £414,500 to be found?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get that worked out for the Deputy.  I have not got it by me at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering if we had discovered another accomplishment along with the many accomplishments which the Minister has.  That is the art of cooking.  At the first glance at this Vote, it would appear that there was a bit of cooking done when the Estimates were being prepared last year.  It is very hard to understand how a mistake such as the loss of £6,000 on Athenry agricultural station could take place without the knowledge of the Minister and the Department. There was also a loss of £2,000 on Ballyhaise station and a further loss of £2,000 on the Grange farm station. That is a loss of £10,000 on the three stations.  However, we will deal with that at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister did make provision, by the purchase of a farm, for the extension of seed testing.  It is one of the things that <Col N="1197" /> we need most in this country.  While I was Minister we had started on the wheat scheme and we tried to get a farm to extend that branch of agriculture. The propagation of seeds, grass seeds and cereal seeds, root seeds and all the other seeds is a matter of great importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can now give the Deputy the details he asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right.  I was just wondering where the figure of £414,500 was to be found.</P>
      <P>Again I am glad to see that the farm building scheme and the water supply scheme have made progress.  The farm building scheme, as we all know, has been in operation in the country for a long time and the success of that scheme is dependent on the generosity of the Department by way of the grants that are given.  If the grants are sufficiently high, they will induce people to invest some of their own money in the renovation and reconstruction of their buildings.  That would be a good thing but the grants would require to be made attractive so as to encourage the people to go ahead.  This scheme is very necessary because here in this country, as the Minister knows, not merely are our farm buildings bad, but we also suffer from the very bad condition of our dwellings.  I am glad to see that that scheme has been extended year after year, and that we have been spending more money in this country on the reconstruction of our farm buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad to see that the water supply scheme has had a fairly good measure of support.  That measure of support has not been as good as we should like because it should have been a great boon to the ordinary farmer and the ordinary farmer's wife to have water brought into their houses.  I think that one of the things preventing the expansion of that scheme is that water is not being brought into the farm buildings.  If the Minister included farm buildings in this scheme there would be a general expansion, not merely in the number of people that would take the water into their dwelling houses, but <Col N="1198" /> in the number of people who would take it into their farm buildings.</P>
    <P>There are parts of the country where there are very poor water supplies and where farmers suffer under great disabilities particularly in the summer time when they have to drive cattle long distances to water or to carry water long distances to their cattle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>As the Minister knows there are many people on the waiting list to have their cattle tested.  I know that the applications are being dealt with pretty well and that there is no undue delay, but, at the same time, there are people who will not have their cattle tested for some considerable period.  Then there is the difficulty of getting tradesmen and technicians to put in the water.  No matter how much the Minister is inclined to hurry up the scheme there will be a general delay all over the country if you have not the people to do the work.</P>

      <P>Recent statistics indicated a drop in the number of people <Col N="1199" /> on the land.  I think the Minister for Social Welfare answered this yesterday and revealed that the figures were still dropping notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Agriculture has been out over the past three or four weeks telling the people that the drift from the land has stopped and that the people are coming back on it.  The Minister for Social Welfare says: &ldquo;No, they are still going.&rdquo;  However, I suppose that is for another time.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that we have an expansion of the ground limestone subsidy scheme.  The Minister did give the total tonnage that was put on the land for the past few years.  It is a remarkable thing about the Minister that he can choose the dates which he wants to make a good case and he can also select the ones he wants to make a bad case.  For instance, the Minister has a great habit, when he wants to condemn somebody or some party, of choosing the year 1947, but he omitted to mention the years 1948 or 1949 or 1950 or even 1951 when he was talking about ground limestone.  He must remember that in 1950-51, the last year that the Coalition was in office before, 75,000 tons of ground limestone were distributed over the country.  He did not give us that figure, I think.  He started with something like 240,000 tons, which were spread in the year 1951-52, and he carries on up to 1955-56, which is perfectly right, of course, but the casual listener would imagine that the Coalition and the Minister were responsible for this wonderful expansion that has taken place in the use and distribution of ground limestone. I do not want to detract from the Minister at all.  If I were giving these figures I think I would be more honest and truthful about the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all been telling people that we must use more lime if we are to get more production from the land.  It has been estimated that we need from 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 tons of lime to put the land in condition to give the best results from manurial dressings in order to correct the acidity in the soil.  First of all, we must use the lime and I am glad we have reached the 1,000,000 mark.  We had something over 800,000 tons in 1954 &mdash;nearly 800,000 tons&mdash;and by calculating the amount of lime based on the £80,000 it would appear that about 130,000 to 140,000 tons more were used this year than the Minister estimated when preparing his Estimate.</P>
      <P>There is one complaint I have&mdash; whether this is the proper time to mention it or not I do not know.  It is with regard to the distribution of this lime. There are many complaints at the present time regarding haulage and the difficulty of having lime hauled, difficulties that confront many private producers and prevent them from hiring lorries to haul lime.  In many cases even C.I.E. are not able to provide lorries to haul it.  I think that is a most unfortunate thing.  When people are inclined to use ground limestone, no obstacle should be placed in their way.  Many lime producers have lorries or could hire lorries outside C.I.E. and these lorries would be prepared to go into the farms where C.I.E. will not go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties confronting farmers in many parts of the country to-day is that C.I.E. lorries will not leave the well-surfaced road.  They dump the lime there and the farmer has to get his tractor, or perhaps his <Col N="1201" /> horse and cart and haul it some distance to his land.  There may be no spreader in the district and the lime puts an extra burden on the farmer. It does more than that&mdash;it gives him very little encouragement to use lime.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider that point carefully&mdash;the distribution of lime.  C.I.E. have had a monopoly in the haulage of lime for seven or eight years and in my opinion they have not justified that monopoly.  The time has come when the distribution of lime should be left in the hands of the producers, first of all, if they are in a position or have the capital to get their own lorries.  They should not be prohibited in any way from going out to haul their own limestone just as any ordinary businessman in a wholesale or retail business has the right to put his own lorries on the road to carry his merchandise.  The same should apply to the lime producer.  If the lime producer has not the capital, or is not prepared to go into it in a big way, there should be nothing to prevent him from getting outside tractors or lorries to haul that lime for farmers because it is most necessary that every facility be given if we want to increase agricultural production.  No obstacle should be placed in the way of those who are anxious to do it.</P>
    <P>It is admitted, I think, that the use of ground limestone is one of the great methods by which we can increase agricultural production here.  That has been amply demonstrated wherever it has been used properly.  I am glad to see we have been expanding in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is one item&mdash;K (4), grants to certain rural organisations&mdash;on which I should like to comment.  I understood from the Minister that arrangements had been made for the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre to get an annual subscription&mdash;shall I say&mdash; from the Grant Counterpart Fund.</P>

      <P>That is all right.  Has the Minister any answer to the failure of receipts, under the heading of Appropriations-in-Aid, to come to the figure he estimated he would get last year?  What about Athenry?  Three colleges have lost £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is making a mistake.  If he looks at the original Estimate, he will find there was a provision there for expected Appropriations-in-Aid from Athenry of £22,500.  These appropriations have fallen short of what was anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>By £6,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>By £6,000, but if the Deputy will listen, I will tell him why. As the Deputy knows, we make use of a good deal of live stock for experimental work in these stations.  For <Col N="1203" /> instance, we test the relative advantage of fattening Shorthorn, Aberdeen Angus and Friesian bulls, and various methods of fattening pigs and so forth. Therefore, we buy what we expect will be uneconomic live stock in order to expose them to experimental treatment. Therefore, we sometimes have to sell them at a loss.  A good deal of experimental work is proceeding all the time, the ultimate cost of which is difficult to forecast at the beginning of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the loss might have been due to the abandonment of cattle in order to make room for the white turkey.  I am glad now that it was not.  There seems to be a considerable loss under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, Pigs and Bacon Acts, Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts, etc.  What does the loss of £30,000 indicate?  Does it indicate that the number of carcases going through the factories is less than last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, there has been a decline in the number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That accounts for the loss of £30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For a substantial portion. There are more cattle going out on the hoof and less on the hook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it should be the other way around, having regard to the fact that carcase meat going out is in a more advantageous position than cattle going out on the hoof?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, it is a free trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The advantage lies with the carcase meat rather than with the other.  Yet we have a reduction in the number of cattle going through the factories.  It is very easy to understand that the number of pigs going through the factories diminished over the past six or eight months.  Having regard to the small levies on cattle and pigs, £30,000 is a very considerable sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> The Minister is seeking £34,770 and I have no objection to his getting it, but I should like to see him use it to the best advantage.  I am glad that one or two things are coming along&mdash; the ground limestone and the farm buildings schemes.  There are many other schemes that could well be improved, schemes such as seed testing and the propagating of seeds.  I know very little about this experimental station at Glenamoy, County Mayo, but I expect other speakers will deal with that.  Whether it is of greater benefit to the country than the grass meal factory, I do not know.  However, I do not object to the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his approach to a seed production farm here.  I think such a farm is very necessary.  We have been doing a little in that direction for some years.  It is necessary to have a farm completely set aside for this kind of work.  There is great scope for the production of pedigree seed which was neglected over the years.</P>
      <P>There is in operation for a few years now a scheme in connection with the production of certified wheat seed, and, without doubt, it has been very successful. According as this develops in other branches, I hope the producers will get the necessary protection.  There was a problem this year in that there seemed to be a big amount of imported seed wheat.  To a certain extent, that is upsetting the production of certified seed by people in the business.  They are somewhat worried that they may find it difficult to find a market for the amount produced this year.  It is definitely good seed and has been going very well.  A good amount of it is being produced.</P>
      <P>I hope this farm will go ahead with the production of oats and other seed varieties as well, so that we may find ourselves very shortly able to produce all of our own foundation stock and not have to go outside for any of it. That would be very useful and something for the farmer interested in the production of certified or pedigree seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very encouraging to see the big expansion in the farm building schemes.  There is no doubt that this <Col N="1205" /> scheme has done a tremendous lot of good.  It has been availed of to the fullest extent.  Going through the country, one cannot but be impressed by the number of haysheds erected. These are of great help and assistance to the farmers.  Were it not for the grant and the inducement, the number of sheds erected would be far less. The same remarks apply to the farm building schemes generally.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the lime scheme and the abuse of the lime scheme, and Deputy Walsh referred to the fact that the Minister did not mention the year 1951.  He fully realised that the scheme started in 1948.  Of course it could not get into full production in two years. There were no grinding plants in the country in 1948 and these had to be established before production could begin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The company got going in six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>How would you get a dozen grinding plants up in six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They got going in six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There were only four plants in the whole country that first year.  That was the trouble; the farmers were prepared to use the ground limestone but it was not available. There is still a certain amount of dissatisfaction about the scheme, particularly about the transport.  It seems very unfair that those people concerned with the production of ground limestone are not allowed to use their own transport; they have to go along and employ C.I.E. to do it for them in the case of practically all the ground limestone that is produced. A big number of extra lorries are now available which means that C.I.E. are able to make better arrangements for the transport of ground limestone. Consequently I do not think that the transport problem is now as serious as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think this 40-mile limit attached to the scheme gives rise to a certain amount of overlapping, especially in areas where the grinding plants are not sufficiently far apart; you will have lorries from one area coming into <Col N="1206" /> another district with consequent overlapping and the possibility of a wastage of a grant allowed for transport. I think it would be wise if that question of overlapping were looked into with a view to its elimination.  The amount of money now necessary properly to run this scheme is naturally very big as the scheme expands.  It is very encouraging, of course, to see the expansion that has developed in this scheme.  There is no doubt that such an expansion will add considerably to the country's agricultural output.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the peat land experimental plot in Glenamoy, County Mayo.  It seems that after an exhaustive examination by Min Fheir Teoranta it was proposed to operate a grass meal industry in that area.  From the report, the prospects of success of that proposed industry were very poor indeed. It is my belief that these conclusions were correct.  Some years ago, when offals were very scarce, I stocked a quantity of imported grass meal and I remember distinctly that it was impossible to convince the farmers, particularly in the West of Ireland, that there was any advantage in the use of this commodity.  I felt at the time that, first of all, there was a prejudice against the use of this grass meal in the West of Ireland.  I do not want to condemn its production, but I do feel that it would be very difficult to sell it within the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you are faced with the situation where you are obliged to sell such a commodity on a foreign market you are up against many difficulties, one of which is that you are competing against people engaged in that business for a long number of years and who have considerable experience in that particular field.  In its production here you would incur many additional overheads and it would be almost impossible for the industry to become a success.  I sincerely hope that the development of land which is described as &ldquo;blanket bog&rdquo; will be a success because its operation would involve a part of this country where you have very poor land and where you have vast areas of this blanket bog.  I fully appreciate that such a scheme would <Col N="1207" /> be experimental and for that reason I sincerely hope it will be successful.  I am glad to note from the Minister's statement this evening that, far from the position being that which we were told it was in Mayo during the elections&mdash;that people were becoming unemployed as a result of the change in Government&mdash;the reverse is the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated here this evening that already there has been an increase in the number of people employed in County Mayo and that this number will be substantially increased with the passage of time, due to the change in Government.  That is heartening news to people like Deputy Lindsay and myself who are conversant with the circumstances and who appreciate that so many of our people have to migrate from these areas.  The Forestry Branch of the Minister's Department have recently undertaken certain work and I am hopeful that these operations will be successful.  They cover quite a wide area in a part of the country where up to now very little afforestation work was undertaken.  I believe that at one time this area had large tracts of forests.  With proper treatment and working, I have no doubt that the re-afforestation programmes planned for these areas will meet with the success they deserve.  We have much modern technical advice now and together with that there is a ready market for thinnings and so forth.  All that should ensure that a bigger number of people will be kept in employment than would have been the case under the grass meal proposal.</P>
    <P>On this question of ground limestone, I feel that very little should have been said on the subject by the Opposition Deputies.  I well remember the scheme in operation under the Fianna Fáil Government when local committees of agriculture were subsidising the production of burnt lime.  The supply was wholly inadequate to meet the requirements of the farmers.  We heard Deputy Walsh here this evening&mdash;and I have a lot of respect for the Deputy &mdash;criticising the ground limestone scheme.  It was very foolish to introduce that subject at all because there was not a ground limestone plant, <Col N="1208" /> good, bad or indifferent, until the first inter-Party Government took office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no ground limestone in this country, good, bad or indifferent.  The people who were engaged in this in the early stages carried on under great difficulties. They told me they had to carry on with very substantial overdraft accommodation.  In fact, they were almost facing bankruptcy.  At that time, our present Minister, Deputy Dillon, was shouting himself hoarse all over the country, appealing to the people to use ground limestone.  It is not easy to sell these new projects to Irish people.  There were no ground limestone <Col N="1209" /> plants in this country.  They were new and it was no easy job to sell that article at the time.  That is the true position and, whether Deputy Walsh likes it or not, he cannot get away from the facts.</P>
      <P>We all have had lime kilns on our small holdings of land.  There were lime kilns scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Some of them were hundreds of years old.  They were there in the corners of the fields. People had no other means of producing lime.  I have often seen people working at them.  First, they had to get the stones and then they had to start breaking them.  After that, the stones were put in the kiln and burned. If Deputy Walsh suggests that that was the type of lime scheme that was capable of meeting the needs of the Irish farmers, he is fooling himself and nobody else.  The Irish people appreciate that fact.</P>
      <P>The present Minister for Agriculture initiated this scheme in 1948.  Now, as a result of his efforts, he can come here and tell us that we are around the 1,000,000-ton figure at the present time. That is heartening news.  Personally, I am very glad to hear it.  There was no reliable source from which lime could be produced, except by way of the crushing system.</P>
      <P>On the question of transport, no doubt there was some overlapping in areas: I have seen some of it myself. I suppose that is inevitable in a big business, such as the lime business is at present.  Generally speaking, I am convinced that the scheme is working very well and very satisfactorily. To-day, as you travel along the road, you can see lorry loads of ground limestone being hauled into the country areas and mountainous districts where it is most needed, where they are trying to rear young stores and where the demand is greatest for it.  They are sure that the supplies are there.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by some Deputy about allowing people to use their own form of transport, I think there is no objection to that.  If they own their own tractors and trailers, I think there is no objection to their taking limestone from the plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Walsh's speech this evening was a very poor attempt on the part of a man who held office as Minister for Agriculture for a few years.  He picked on a few trivial items.  Any young Deputy new to the House would have made a better case against the present Minister on that particular item than Deputy Walsh did. He was very foolish to introduce it at all.  If flexibility in the matter of transport could be brought about, it would be quite desirable.  If some people feel they have suitable means of transporting limestone themselves, it would be no harm, in my opinion, to allow them to transport their own needs.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear about the seed-testing station which has been established somewhere in the vicinity of Lucan.  It is most desirable and important that we should know everything that is to be known about seed which is intended to produce a crop.  It is important that we should know whether or not it is a healthy seed and also the percentage of germination.  I fear we are coming a little bit late with that scheme, but it is better late than never.  If we can establish a position in this country whereby we shall be able to procure good reliable seed for our farmers, then it is a step in the right direction, and a very important step indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the farm buildings scheme.  I would urge on the Minister the importance of increasing the grants for this purpose.  In my view, the time has come when these grants should be increased.  I am aware that a lot of good work has been done under this scheme and no doubt the more wealthy farmers, at least, will be able to continue to do useful and important work under it.  However, we have a large number of small <Col N="1211" /> farmers in our community who have not sufficient capital of their own to provide these buildings for themselves. I have in mind in particular the small farmers in the congested areas.  It is very necessary that the Minister should make increased grants available to the poorer farmers.  The cost of materials has gone up in recent times, as also has the cost of labour, to a certain extent.  The Minister should give some increases in these grants, particularly in the congested areas.</P>
    <P>The bringing of water to outhouses on our farms&mdash;outhouses such as byres &mdash;is very important.  If, with the passing of time, we want to attain the high standard which has been reached by countries, such as Denmark and Holland, we shall have to have the water laid on in our farm buildings. There again, the Minister should consider the advisability of further increasing the grants where water is being provided for such buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin by congratulating the Minister on the amount of information that is given on the face of the Supplementary Estimate.  Only too often, Supplementary Estimates seem to be designed to give the minimum of information.  In this case, at least a fairly clear picture can be obtained on the face of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I were both Chairmen of Public Accounts Committees for a considerable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that the Minister remembers that.  Sometimes when people become Ministers, they are inclined to forget such things.</P>
      <P>I shall just take the details as they appear.  The first one deals with the additional amount for seed-testing propagation by the bringing in of this new farm.  That is a very welcome development.  The only thing I should like to urge on the Minister in that connection is that I do not think enough is done by the Department with relation to potato oats.  Potato oats are of particular importance to the three Ulster counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that these other varieties <Col N="1212" /> in the South do undoubtedly yield very highly tends, in my opinion, to have the great advantages of potato oats overlooked.  In the North of Ireland, a considerable amount of development has taken place.  They have bred strains there which are very important and which, furthermore, are a great improvement on those which were there before.  I think we might do something ourselves in that regard. There is this to be remembered: the potato oat has the great advantage that it gives a very high percentage in milling because of its thin coat and, as far as County Donegal is concerned, I do not think the other varieties are really very useful because they are already over-husked to begin with and, in our northern climate, the percentage seems to get worse.  That has been our experience, anyway.  I do not know if it is the general experience but, from that point of view, I think some further benefit might be given to pedigree potato oats.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Grants-in-Aid to these three bodies from the American Grant Counterpart Special Account, I take it that the sums here are largely dictated by the fact that we are coming towards the end of the financial year and the Minister and his Department are naturally cautious in handing out large sums under Grants-in-Aid, which cannot be re-surrendered.  I think that is wise and I do not at all want to suggest that any of these very estimable bodies would show any slackness in their accounting system, but they are, shall we say, a bit out-of-the-run as compared with the type of body which has formerly been in receipt of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a matter that the American authorities decided to give each of these bodies £10,000. These bodies, for their own good reason, wanted to spend a bit of that before the formalities were completed and they asked us would we advance them £1,000 or so, and we simply obliged them.  So far as I know, that is the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing this is an express wish on the part of the donors, I take it that the ordinary precautions <Col N="1213" /> which are taken with regard to a Grant-in-Aid do not necessarily apply in these particular cases: that is to say, the accounts, of course, are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, but some check is usually made on their system of accountancy to make sure the Grants-in-Aid are, in fact, properly applied.  But I think this is a very special case and that might not arise at all.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head M (8), other Deputies have already mentioned this business of water supplies and the Minister has indicated, of course, that where the eradication of bovine T.B. comes in, the scheme for supplying water to cow byres is open to all applicants. I would suggest that is not going far enough.  I cannot see any good reason why the scheme should not be open to everyone who wishes to put water into a byre.  I believe that, in advance of the eradication scheme, it would do a great deal to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not think it is a good thing that one should want to participate in the bovine T.B. eradication scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but there are other people with byres for other than cows.  I think it is a very good development.  Actually, I have water, so I am not at cross-purposes with the Minister, but, it has been such a success, I think the Department would be doing great good if they encouraged everybody to install a water supply in the byres, even where it was not for just cows; water can do a bullock an awful lot of good, too.  Apart from that, I think the scheme can help towards a better system of agriculture because it makes for a good deal of ease in work.  One of the causes of the flight from the land as far as farm work is concerned, is the prospect of week-end working, and nothing makes week-end working so simple as water laid on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special grant should be given for silos.  As far as I know, at the moment, the grant is calculated on the basis of the superficial area, or something like that, of concrete.  The basis of calculation is a bit out of date to begin with, but, apart from that, I think a <Col N="1214" /> special effort might very well be made to encourage the use of silage.  That has been done in other parts of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these grants are available for pit or trench silos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think they are at the ordinary rate of calculation for concrete work.  I should like to see a special grant made over and above that to encourage the making of silage. That has been done in another part of this island and it is having most remarkable results.  It has been taken up with great enthusiasm.  I think it would be a very useful development here, too.</P>
      <P>On the ground limestone subsidy, I think people are sometimes inclined to forget that this is a payment for transport and not a subsidy for ground limestone, as such.  One difficulty crops up in regard to this, and that is that there is a rush period&mdash;in fact, there are two rush periods in the year&mdash;and transport is inclined to break down.  My area is not open to the beneficent efforts of C.I.E&mdash;they have not yet stretched up there&mdash;and I cannot say that I am very sorry because we have a reasonably good transport system in relation to lime; but there is the difficulty that, especially in the light of very recent legislation, there may be a shortage of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally, each year steps are taken at harvest to permit the carriage of wheat to the mills and exemptions are given to enable that to be done swiftly.  I think there is a good case with regard to ground limestone in respect of certain limited periods in the year.  It is a great advantage, when sowing out hay or pasture, to have the ground limestone applied at the same time as the seeds are sown.  That is the sort of thing everyone is keen to do.  But it is not always possible to get the lime quickly enough because everybody wants it within the same two to three weeks roughly.  It does quite well to wait until the autumn, but on very sour land, where ground limestone is most needed, one may get a bad take of clover seed and by the time you put on the ground limestone <Col N="1215" /> in the autumn, the clover seed has germinated and died.  It is very important, therefore, to get it on in the spring, and, where there is difficulty in getting enough ground limestone out, the transport question should be reconsidered, with a view to giving exemptions to permit the hiring of lorries which would not ordinarily be permitted.</P>
    <P>I think there is something to be said, too, for tightening up on distribution in the sense that lorries seem to cross from different plants.  How far the Department can clamp down on that, I am not quite sure.  I think there has been an improvement as far as my own area is concerned and one will not now see lorries coming long distances, but it is not so very long since they did come long distances; it was an obvious loss to the State that this should happen and I hope the Minister and his Department will pursue that and ensure that no ground limestone is taken one mile further than it need be.  There should be no question of ground limestone from one plant passing ground limestone from another plant, or coming into its effective area, where that can be avoided.</P>

      <P>With regard to No. 17 of the Appropriations-in-Aid, in reference to revenue from agricultural loans, there is a reference to sub-head M (4), whereas in this the reference is to M (3).  It is on the back page of the Supplementary Estimate.  I take it that M (3) is correct and that M (4) was a misprint?  The Minister will see on the last page of the Supplementary Estimate: &ldquo;Additional Receipts under No. 17&rdquo;, and the reference to sub-head M (3), whereas, in the original instrument, the reference is to M (4).  I think M (4) is a mistake.  I should like to be clear on that.  Those are the only points I wanted to raise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say on this Estimate here is not in criticism of the Minister as such.  I am calling attention here to this Estimate of £80,000 for ground limestone, and if I might elaborate a little on what Deputy Sheldon said a while ago, I would suggest to the Minister that it is not competition exactly.  It is the lack of machinery, spreading machinery mainly, that causes the Irish Sugar Company to deliver limestone down as far as Ballycotton and down around Aghada and to pass two other limestone works on the road down.  Farmers are anxious to get their lime out and spread, if possible, by the one machine, so that it will not be heeled on the side of the road, left there for a couple of days, shovelled into the machine, taken away and spread afterwards. The Minister knows how the old farmer feels when, in the month of March, he comes to the last bunch of hay.  I feel that way about this lime subsidy at the present moment.  I feel we are coming to the last bunch of hay and that we should be more careful.  I got figures from the Minister here in reply to questions that I asked yesterday and I admit they have me nearly beaten.  I will have to ask you for more next week to find out where exactly I stand.  But I would suggest to the Minister that C.I.E. should be paid at the same rate as that at which the ordinary haulier is prepared to draw and should not be paid more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on those figures, the ordinary haulier in 1955-56 drew 302,500 tons of lime.  The ordinary haulier is the man owning a limestone plant and having a couple of lorries of his own.  We want the competition and I think the Minister should recommend a little bit of competition also, even if that competition is with the C.I.E.  I do not think I would be very far wrong in saying&mdash;although the Minister states here that the amounts paid to the haulier by C.I.E. are not available in his Department&mdash;that, of the £199,910 paid last year to C.I.E. in respect of hauling done, not by C.I.E. but by the <Col N="1218" /> owners of ground limestone plants in their own lorries, £30,000 was collared by C.I.E., and that the limestone hauliers only got £169,000.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, for good or ill, when they got this grant&mdash;this grant from the American Government to help the farmers out with lime&mdash;to put it into transport, that it should be devoted to transporting entirely.  The farmer pays for the lime, pays for the spreading, and the haulier hauls, and I suggest to the Minister that that is money of which we should be very careful.  That money was given, not to subsidise C.I.E., but for the benefit of the farmers and, if C.I.E. are collecting from 12½ to 20 per cent. at present on 302,500 tons of ground limestone, I think it should stop.  I will be quite frank about it.  I think the owner of a ground limestone plant should be paid directly by the Government, the same as the Irish Sugar Company are paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember the arguments we had here about the Irish Sugar Company on this matter before &mdash;the spreading of ground limestone. The Irish Sugar Company seem to have hauled a very considerable amount of lime since-practically 1,000,000 tons of it&mdash;and on that 1,000,000 tons, I suggest to the Minister that they saved this lime fund, as we will call it, £200,000. There is £200,000 more in it to-day than there would be, if they had to haul it and be paid through C.I.E.  I suggest that the farmers cannot afford to lose money in that manner and, on the figures I got, C.I.E. have hauled altogether 2,356,000 tons of lime.  Anybody who is mathematically minded can make up 12½ per cent. of that, and he can add to that 564,910 tons hauled by the owners of ground limestone plants in 1953-54, 1954-55 and 1955-56.  Between those years they hauled 564,910 tons of lime.  Apparently it paid them to haul that lime and deliver it at the price they got finally from C.I.E. for that haulage.</P>
    <P>Why should C.I.E. get anything from 12½ per cent. to 20 per cent. on the haulage of that lime, lime that they did not even see and which the owner of the limestone plant put into his lorry and delivered in the farmer's yard?  Is <Col N="1219" /> it not a deliberate robbery of this fund, which was put there for the farmers, for the purpose of subsidising a State subsidised industry, because that is what C.I.E. is.</P>
    <P>It is not by way of criticism of the Minister that I say that, because when Deputy Walsh was Minister the same game was going on.  It is high time to end it.  The Minister will be telling us next week how much is left in that fund and he knows as well as I do that we are on the last bunch of hay. I do not want to bandy words in this House: &ldquo;It was we started this, that or the other.&rdquo;  Nevertheless, the Minister knows that the Ballybeg quarry was purchased by the Irish Sugar Company in 1947, that the ground limestone works there were started before he got that seat over there.  I do not know what kudos he expects to get out of an argument that he was sitting there when it started.  In fact, I can claim to be the pioneer of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very largely dealt with a while ago by Deputy O'Hara and we had any amount of &ldquo;Hear, hears!&rdquo; from the Minister when Deputy O'Hara mentioned it.  We all know the difficulty of inducing farmers to do something new.  For instance, within the boundaries of Deputy O'Hara's county there was plenty of lime being produced by the Irish Sugar Company.  The people would not take it, not even in Galway.  We put up a proposition to General Costello at the suggestion of the Galwaymen that if he dried it and put it in bags they would take it then.  He had it dried at the cost of £1 a ton and when Deputy Lehane, myself and others went up to General Costello four or five months afterwards, he eat the face off us, saying <Col N="1220" /> there were so many bags of this lime lying around and no one to take it.  We took an order for it, brought it down to Cork and paid for it.  I was accused by the Minister afterwards of getting it for nothing.  There were nine acres of this stuff, about seven feet high spread out there in one big field and nobody to take it.  I saw them afterwards scraping that field and taking away what was left of it when they got to know its value.  We all know the land of the country does require this commodity and that we will never be in a position to afford to put out enough of it.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give me any sane reason why he should pay 20/3 plus 5 per cent. to C.I.E., and 19/5 to the Irish Sugar Company for doing the one job, 1/4 a ton of a difference.  The Minister has the figures there and if he will follow down the list for transport from 46 to 50 miles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the average amount per ton spent by C.I.E.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into average amounts because I know what happens in those cases.  Let me put it this way.  If my man down in Carrig-twohill was allowed purchase a lorry spreader, the Minister would escape a whole lot of that 46 to 50 mile game and I know he would also escape the 41 to 45 miles that I have down here in my list.  The only reason you have the Irish Sugar Company coming down from Ballybeg, passing down to the ground limestone plants in Carrigtwohill and going down below Midleton with the lime is that the farmer wants it.  Why not let the lorry pull into the field and spread the lime in one operation instead of having the lime hauled to the side of the road, shovelled in and delivered afterwards?  If we had a little bit of common sense between the Department, C.I.E. and the owners of the ground limestone plants we would save a lot of money.  It does not say that because we get a present of money that it should be squandered in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fortnight ago one of those ground limestone plant owners came up here and we went over to General Costello to discuss that particular matter.  We were convinced that if we got a lorry <Col N="1221" /> spreader all the areas within, say, ten miles of the ground limestone plant could be done with that spreader, thus saving a lot of money in transportation. General Costello was prepared to sell one or two of them to that ground limestone plant owner but, when it came as far as C.I.E. and the Minister's Department, it was knocked on the head.  I do not know why and I suggest that the public are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that there is about enough left in the fund to last another 12 months and that is why I said we are on the last bunch of hay. Judging by the manoeuvring I saw here of diving into other funds here and there, wherever they can collar something, I think I can say you will find the Government very slow to continue a subsidy out of State funds.  Whatever Government is in, there is difficulty in getting money and I suggest that we should be more careful of it. There is no justification in the world for having down here 20/9 a ton for C.I.E.  That is plus 5 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no justification for having that sum or for having C.I.E. hauling lime distances of 40 to 60 miles.  There is a ground limestone plant in the Bandon area.  That plant should supply the whole of West Cork. That ground limestone plant was in operation when the American grant money came and they were in the same difficulty as the Irish Sugar Company were in.  Because the Irish Sugar Company fought it out, they are being paid direct but the Aherlow man is being paid through C.I.E. and C.I.E. extract 12½ per cent. of the money for signing the cheque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are facts.  It is not C.I.E.'s money.  It is not money of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is money that is the property of the Irish farmers, given to them by the American Government.  No Government is justified in using that money to subsidise any Government-owned concern.  The money is not theirs.  It is the farmers' money.  As far as I can gather from the figures, C.I.E. have <Col N="1222" /> drawn about £300,000 of that money in the 12½ per cent.  That is what they got over what others are prepared to do it for.</P>

      <P>Facts.  The Irish Sugar Company collected, in 1953-54, £157,000; in 1954-55, £208,000; in 1955-56, £199,910 for lime they did not draw, for lime they did not see, and they paid out of that money the owner of the limestone plant who hauled that lime in his own lorry to the farmer who ordered it and then they made their deduction.  I asked the Minister for the amount paid to the Sugar Company.  The last figure, I was told, was not available in his Department. Surely C.I.E. would give him that figure, or were they ashamed to give it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the things I am anxious to know.  I do not think any Government is justified in expending money, which is the property of the agricultural community, in subsidising anybody else. I do not wish at this stage to carry that any further.  When I get the answers to all the questions I have put down to the Minister, I will know where we are.  I got two pages of figures.  I did not go to the university and one would need to be a master of mathematics to poke anything out of those figures by the time the Department had finished with them.  I suppose <Col N="1223" /> that is in the game.  I take it that way.</P>

The dairying counties&mdash;there are only seven or eight in the Twenty-Six&mdash;should have first claim on the scheme.  The dairying counties, where calves are produced and where there is the highest number of dairy cows, should have the first of that scheme. What is happening at present is that the pioneer is going ahead.  He comes in and has his cattle tested.  He finds that he has six reactors.  They go into the salesyard at the next fair and are passed on to somebody else.  A farmer runs the risk, if he buys cattle, of getting these cast animals.  They are legally sold.  That is why I would urge the Minister to extend the scheme at least to the dairying counties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate because running right through it is what has been characteristic of the Minister's work in both his terms of office, namely, the injection of capital into the land of Ireland.  Every item of this Estimate is calculated to develop agriculture. That is very essential after 700 years of oppression, after the Civil War, after the economic war and after a war in which advancement in agriculture was necessarily retarded.  I think the fact that there is a Supplementary Estimate before the House to-day is due to the man who now sits in the Minister's chair.  Deputy Corry asked why do we say: &ldquo;Who started what?&rdquo;  He has only to go through the Supplementary <Col N="1224" /> Estimate to see who started what.  The Minister who sits with us to-night is the man who started the ground limestone scheme.  As well as that, the Minister is the man who started the farm building scheme; the man who started soil testing; the man who started the bovine T.B. eradication scheme; and the man who made arrangements whereby any farmer in Ireland to-day, for the payment of 1/- per acre, can get his land totally fertilised.  That is our answer to the economic war and to all the troubles that came before and after it.</P>

Deputy Corry gave us a long list of figures with regard to payments made to C.I.E. and goods handled by the Irish Sugar Company, and when the Minister asked him a fair question as to what was the average payment per ton to C.I.E., he said he did not want to hear it.  I hope Deputy Corry will sit with us for a long time, but if he left us to-morrow, he would prefer to come back to this House as a poltergeist and turn up chairs and tables rather than go to Heaven.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the day in question is or what the Deputy means.  My interest in this Supplementary Estimate is to deal with the sub-head concerning the peatland experimental station at Glenamoy. I think this is the first intimation that has been given to this House as to what is to replace the activities of Min Fheir Teoranta in Glenamoy.  It is timely; it is about time it happened, because we, at any rate, felt it was only the Minister's opposition to the Grass Meal Act that caused the close down of activities there.</P>
      <P>In so far as the ultimate object of the original scheme is being carried out, I raise no objection to the change. The Minister has said that it is now to be known as the peatland reclamation scheme and that certain liming and manuring is being carried out, that afforestation is also being associated with the scheme, that 29 men were employed for agricultural purposes and 23 for forestry, and that some others will be employed.  That is really the immediate object of the scheme, but not the ultimate one.  The ultimate one is, of course, to see to what extent it will be possible to reclaim peatland and bogland, and so make it economic, make it of some value to the people in the West of Ireland, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas between the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the scheme has been altered, because I feel that, as originally envisaged, it would have proved a success.  Deputy O'Hara, in referring to it some time ago, said that as he as a merchant in the West of Ireland could not sell grass meal to the farmers, <Col N="1229" /> he felt the sale of grass meal to the farmers in the West of Ireland would not be possible; but, in the next breath, he complimented the Minister for Agriculture for persevering with the ground limestone scheme, even though we could not induce farmers to use ground limestone originally. Surely the same argument could have applied to the grass meal as apparently applied to the ground limestone? But that is not the main point.  The scheme is now being run under the Department of Agriculture, and I feel that the board as set up, Min Fheir, Teoranta, would perhaps be the better organisation to carry out this bog reclamation, development and experiment. The Department of Agriculture, naturally, is diffused into certain sections and each section has its own responsibilities, but, as one approaches the top, there is a necessary bottleneck of administration.  I am not criticising the set-up of the Department of Agriculture in any way&mdash;that is as it must be&mdash;but I feel if an autonomous board were given a particular job to do that it would have a greater degree of flexibility, and, because of that flexibility, would be able to bend its mind to the task in hand and would not be concerned with too many other ones and could ultimately produce better results.</P>
    <P>Possibly, too, it would be better for other reasons.  This is an experimental station.  I have no doubt that the scheme in its present form will prove successful because there has been sufficient precedence of such successful schemes, but the problem will then arise&mdash;what next?  The Department of Agriculture has entered into the bog and will they prove in other areas bogland can be successfully reclaimed for agricultural and afforestation purposes? I felt myself when Min Fheir, Teoranta, was set up that they, having first of all proved that bogland could be reclaimed and made to grow grass, could be made to produce crops and feed beasts, could go to other areas and immediately operate there.  But in this case would the Minister tell us what, in the event&mdash;and I am sure it is in the certain event&mdash;of this scheme proving a success, is it proposed to do then? Will facilities be given to small farmers in the West of Ireland to reclaim <Col N="1230" /> small portions of bog, using the experience gained in this field?</P>
    <P>I am not going into the merits of grass meal, but let me say again that, as a result of experience gained in Gowla and because Bord na Móna had acquired an immense tract of bogland in County Mayo, much of which they did not intend to use&mdash;it was because of these things, apart altogether from the economic necessity, that it was decided to take some of this bog from Bord na Móna, set up Min Fheir Teoranta and produce grass meal for sale.  I was advised at the time that there was a good market for it at the price it was intended, or hoped it could be produced at from the bog at Glenamoy, but my real interest in the scheme was, because of my short experience of the West of Ireland, I felt that any rehabilitation of the people there must come from the land, in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Good arable land, of course, is in such short supply that something of a bold nature would have to be done to make this land available to these people and there are many parts of the West of Ireland, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas where there are rather marginal bogs, neither good turf nor good land, and I felt if it could be proved that such land could be put into production for ordinary agricultural purposes and for afforestation purposes &mdash;to some extent, possibly&mdash;we would be going a good way towards solving the problem of uneconomic areas in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The other criticism I have of the change&mdash;apart altogether from the fact that the Department of Agriculture is inflexible, that the Department of itself may not be able to give the same attention to the purposes of the scheme as an independent board would&mdash;is that perhaps it might prove more costly under the Department.  I do not know whether it will or not.  I feel that it would because, again, these things are apt to take much longer when run by a huge Department such as the Department of Agriculture rather than by a small compact board of men whose one objective is the business in hand, to prove this peatland <Col N="1231" /> can be properly reclaimed and properly utilised for economic purposes later.  I am glad that the scheme in its original objective is being pursued as the Minister said it would be.  Except for the few minor misgivings mentioned, I am confident it will be successful and will be applied with profit to the uneconomic areas throughout the West.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Vote because I feel that by reason of the expansion shown in the Department and the consequent necessity for a Supplementary Estimate to meet that expansion, business is being done, work is being done, and more extensive plans are being conceived, designed and put into execution.  It is for that reason primarily that I rise to support the Estimate and to congratulate the Minister and his Department officials, both in Dublin and in the various fields of activity throughout the country, on the broad scope of their work and the success attending that work which shows that this Supplementary Estimate was required.</P>
      <P>Permit me to join with Deputies Sheldon and O'Hara in advocating that the grants for the farm building schemes should be increased.  I would not worry so much about the high cost of labour as they did, because most people are able to supply their own labour, but certainly to meet the increasing cost of materials some increase would be desirable, if, of course, such an increase were consistent with the fiscal state of the Department and the country generally. One has to cut the cloth according to the measure.  However, I have no doubt that, if such increase were possible, the Minister for Agriculture and his advisers would give the possibility of granting increases every sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A complaint was made by Deputy Corry about the non-application so far of the bovine T.B. scheme to County Cork, while he said, it applied to Clare. I cannot lay claim to be an expert in these matters and I do not know whether I am right or wrong when I say that these areas were selected because in them there is the least movement of cattle.  Accordingly, <Col N="1232" /> there is a greater chance of a successful scheme where you have not that in-and-out movement of cattle which would be detrimental to the scheme's progress and the stabilisation of the cattle population upon which experiments could be made.</P>
    <P>On the question of transport, the recommendations made by Deputy Sheldon certainly commend themselves to me&mdash;a relaxation of the stringent regulations which establish a monopoly of C.I.E. during the season when large numbers of people want ground limestone almost at the same time.  Of course, there was an opportunity last week to have this aspect of the matter debated.  An amendment could very easily have been brought in on the Road Transport Act if the people advocating this had either thought of it or thought it would work. In speeches by every Deputy, one invariably finds a particular local reason for his rising at all in support of a Supplementary Estimate, instead of waiting for the annual Estimate.</P>
    <P>I feel I cannot allow this occasion to pass without comment, it being the first occasion upon which reference was made in any Estimate to the peatland experimental station at Glenamoy, in my constituency.  I support this Estimate on that account and in rising to support that experiment, I have 34 excellent reasons for doing so.  Last June, when it was announced that the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Branch of the Department of Lands, were going in on a joint effort to take over the lands acquired for the purpose of producing grass meal, there were 29 people employed there and it had been in operation for almost three years.  In the words of a Fianna Fáil Deputy for the constituency on that day it was described, amongst other things, as a deserving project for a deserving people.  Over three years it could employ 29 people.</P>
    <P>Making full allowance for the transition period from last June and for the difficulties of such a change-over, there are now employed, between forestry and agriculture, at Glenamoy, 63 persons&mdash;34 more.  I feel that our project is giving more benefits and conferring more advantages in a considerably lesser time to a deserving people whose <Col N="1233" /> plight cannot be exaggerated from the point of view of the shortage of land and the necessity to give them assistance and advice.</P>
    <P>In June of last year, when it was first mooted that Min Fheir, Teoranta, Grass Meal, Limited, was to be wound up, and that the two Departments of Lands and Agriculture were to pool their efforts, an arrangement which has now resulted in the peatland experimental station, a wail of woe started with Fianna Fáil county council candidates right up along the line through their Deputies and ended in editorial keening in the <i>Sunday Press.</i> I am very proud that here to-night I can say, through the medium of this House, to the people of my constituency who were affected by this that they were right to support us when we made it an issue in the election, because, as against 29 employed, after three years, there are now 63 employed, with considerable expansion in the offing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jack Lynch has made the point that an autonomous board would be more flexible than either the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Lands, or both.  I concede straight away the flexibility of such a board, but I cannot see, as a national or local advantage, the desirability of that flexibility in the channel of partiality for the employment of supporters and friends of the board only.  If there was not a single person employed in Glenamoy other than the 29, the change-over would have been justified because there is now fair play for all sections, and, when anybody comes to look for work, his application is considered on the lines set out by the Department of Social Welfare as to whether he is married with a family, married without a family, single with dependents or single without dependents; he does not have to come now with letters of recommendation from the members of this autonomous board in order to get employment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that particular part of Mayo, we know that bogland can be reclaimed, and we now have the advantage of <Col N="1234" /> being able to get the extra advisory service from the Department of Agriculture, on the one hand, and the necessary help that the Forestry Branch can give to the Department of Lands, on the other.  I know several families in my constituency&mdash;and I know this will come as good news to the Minister for Lands&mdash;who would be quite content to have put at their disposal farms, portion of which were reclaimed bog.  They would much prefer that than to have to go to Meath, Kildare or elsewhere.  They want to be kept in their own environment.  I am doing the best I can for Deputy Giles and the Minister for Lands.  For those reasons I support this Vote, and, in doing so, I look forward to ever-increasing expansion of the peatland industry in Glenamoy; I look forward to its expansion under the impartial administration of the Departments interested.  Once you have impartiality, you must succeed in having a drive that can be considered national and not sectional.</P>

The experimental station at Glenamoy about which we heard so much from Deputy Lindsay was an alternative to the grass meal industry <Col N="1236" /> in the same place and Deputy Lindsay might have adverted to the fact that Deputy Jack Lynch, then Parliamentary Secretary, made available to that industry a considerable amount of State money.  So much so, in fact, that, at the time it was taken over some 15 months ago by this impartial Minister for Agriculture, it had been brought up to a certain standard of fertility and it was ready for further development.  It was only under absolute pressure from all sides of the House&mdash;from the Deputies sitting behind him also&mdash;that it was agreed to go on with some other development.  If my memory serves me correctly, there were considerable amounts of State funds spent on the drainage and development of that bogland in Glenamoy before it was taken over as an experimental station, and, if there are a few more employed now, it was because of the pioneer work done by the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>

There were grants made to certain important rural organisations &mdash;the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre.

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>So he does.  Deputy Donegan spoke about all the new money that was injected into this work. Sub-head M (4) deals with cattle and sheep, farm implements, milking machines, fodder and advances to the co-operative society in Dungarvan. Deputy Walsh could claim credit, as could Deputy Smith, for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next sub-head is farm buildings scheme and water supplies.  I think <Col N="1237" /> that that could be divided evenly both between Deputy Smith and the present Minister for Agriculture.  The present Minister will admit that for two years after he became Minister for Agriculture he held up a very desirable scheme &mdash;the farm buildings scheme&mdash;and refused to provide any money or staff in his Department to allow it to be administered.  We remember all these things but we give the present Minister credit for half that scheme.  Deputy Donegan may not know that; he is an infant Deputy in this House.  However, he will know it after a while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-heads M (9) and M (10) now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>M (10)&mdash;ground limestone subsidy.  If you wish, we will give Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, all possible credit for having been lucky enough to be Minister for Agriculture at the time the American Counterpart Fund became available to this country.  The Americans insisted &mdash;insisted&mdash;and forced the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, to devote portion of that money to the subsidisation of ground limestone.  The Minister's memory is not so short and he should inform his colleagues that that happened.  He is fully aware of it. It was not until his hand was forced that he made any of that money available for the subsidisation of ground limestone.</P>
      <P>We will go down a bit further on the list.  Diseases of Animals Acts&mdash;that is dated 1894.  I am sure the Minister does not claim that he initiated that scheme.  Further down again there is Bovine T.B. Order, 1926.  We can take it that he does not claim that either. I think these are all the new sub-heads on the list.  Sub-head E (6) was a substitute scheme for a better scheme and a more desirable scheme that was abandoned by the Coalition Government. I refer to the grass meal scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We give the Minister all possible credit so far as the water supplies scheme and the ground limestone scheme are concerned.  We shall say what we think about the different projects on the list.  A sum of £105,000 extra is required for the farm buildings <Col N="1238" /> scheme.  I should like the Minister to speed up the payments of these grants. There are numerous complaints down the country in respect of delay in the payment of grants under the farm buildings scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>Did the Deputy write to me about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister some facts that have recently come to my notice.  With regard to ground limestone subsidy, I thoroughly agree with Deputy Corry that there is a very big waste so far as this fund is concerned. I am sure the Minister must be concerned about it.  Within a few short years it will become a direct charge on the Exchequer again.  If the Minister knew its full operation and if he knew that those engaged in the haulage of lime are concerned with long hauls rather than with short hauls, it is questionable whether he would allow things to remain as they are at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In commerce, people try to earn all they can from every source.  I believe that the scheme is wasteful.  County Wexford is probably the only area in the country where there is a scarcity of ground limestone.  As a matter of fact, there is none at all in it.  We have some limestone but it was found to be uneconomic to develop it.  It is the only area in the country where it is necessary to haul the full distance.  I suggest the Minister should have a further investigation into this matter now and zone the whole country.  I suggest he should not permit cross hauls to take place in order to get the <Col N="1239" /> long mileage in different parts of the country.  If he does so, money will be saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware, no doubt, that there is a 40-mile limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I think the Minister's predecessor imposed that limit.  Before that, they were hauling as far as 130 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, of course, we had not as many lime grinding plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They were hauling lime from North County Dublin to Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And were you not glad to get it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We had lime nearer to us in Carlow and in South Kilkenny than North County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did you not get it from there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not as good as the North County Dublin lime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise now. If the Minister or I owned a lorry and if we could get a long haul of 120 or 130 miles, would we not take it in preference to a 15-mile haul?  If the regulations allowed it, no blame could be attached to the lorry-owner for taking a long haul.  There are areas in the country where there is still room for improvement.  These areas should be zoned within an area around particular lime fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why C.I.E. can collect between 7½ and 12 per cent. merely for paying out cheques is beyond me.  I cannot understand it.  There is a lot of dissatisfaction generally about the way a good part of that subsidy is spent.  It it not Fianna Fáil influence but some other type of influence that is responsible for this situation.  Some people can get a haul while others are refused. I do not like to use a very strong word but it is frequently said down the country that there is not straight dealing where this is concerned. One person can get a haulier's plate to haul ground limestone while another person in similar circumstances <Col N="1240" /> is refused.  The Minister has been made aware of that situation on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is need to exercise the utmost care because, ultimately, the Minister is responsible to this House for the administration of that fund.  I believe it was he who decided, when he first became Minister, to hand over the administration of that fund to C.I.E. and to take no responsibility afterwards for anything they did. Nevertheless, the Minister has to come to this House with the Estimate for his Department and, in the ultimate analysis, the Minister himself is actually responsible for the honest administration of that fund.  When I say &ldquo;honest&rdquo; I mean honest as between the different citizens of this country.  If I can get three lorries on the road and my next-door neighbour can get none&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Walsh, sitting on my left, has just drawn my attention to the fact that C.I.E. have notified quarry owners that they will not allow them to haul any lime after seven o'clock in the evening.  That is it in a nutshell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should inquire into that.  The lime subsidy has also been paid out of the American grant.  Now the American grant is not <Col N="1241" /> unlimited and, if this continues for the next ten years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am sure it will be required for the next 40 years or the next 100 years&mdash;the Minister should ensure that no portion of that fund is wasted.  I suggest it is time to have a check-up on the whole thing.</P>
      <P>With regard to diseases of animals, I see there is provision for compensation in the case of jaundice.  I suggest to the Minister there is another disease in relation to which compensation ought also to be paid.  I refer to anthrax.  There is no provision for compensation for loss of animals through anthrax.  It is, of course, a very serious disease.  I do not know why compensation should not be paid. Anthrax could be even more serious than foot and mouth because it can be transmitted to the human.  I know a farmer in my constituency who lost seven cattle this year through anthrax. He received no compensation, even though his whole activity was held up for six or eight weeks.  There is always the danger of further outbreaks.  I appeal to the Minister to look into that matter and to make some kind of provision for compensation in the case of cattle which have to be slaughtered or destroyed because of anthrax.</P>
      <P>With regard to bovine T.B., there is a flaw in the case of farmers who voluntarily have their herds tested and where reactors are found.  These reactors are put on the market and some other farmer takes them up. They are passed off, on the basis of being sound animals, whereas they are really taking the disease into some other herd.  I suggest something should be done about that.  I do not know what the percentage of reactors is. Probably it is about 5 per cent.  It should be possible to have those reactors taken over and disposed of otherwise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only speaking from my own personal knowledge.  I know one particular herd where the percentage was 90.  I know two or three others in the same area where it was only 5 or 6 per cent.  In the case of the 90 per cent., carriers had been brought into the farm over a number of years and that was the reason for the very high percentage.  I do not believe at all that it is as high as 50.  A considerable number of animals have been found to be suffering from avian T.B. The Minister is well aware of that.  I think some differentiation should be made, if that is possible.  I am told the avian T.B. is nothing like as serious as the bovine, but the animals are all classed as if they were suffering from bovine T.B.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Appropriations-in-Aid, the Minister has not given any details of his losses, where they occurred or how it was there was such a sharp reduction.</P>

      <P>We would like to have some more information on that.  There is a sum of £278,000 in the Appropriations-in-Aid. I suppose the Minister will spend that in some other direction. It is not unusual, of course, to have a Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture, but I want to assure the Deputy from Louth that there are no new sub-heads injected into agriculture for the first time.  With the exception of one sub-head, every one was either introduced by the Minister's predecessor or is as old as the Department of Agriculture itself.  Some of them were there before the Deputy or I was born.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to see Glenamoy included in this Estimate, and to hear that the number of labourers engaged during the last year had been substantially increased.  In this area, Glenamoy, we have one of the largest tracts of waste land in this <Col N="1244" /> country and I, who visit the area at least every two months, am delighted to see the good work being carried on there.  I congratulate the Minister upon that good work.  I do not want to give him too many bouquets.  Rumour has it that in this area, we are going to fall back on the experiments in grass meal and I would like the Minister, in concluding the debate, to tell us if that is so.  I am sorry the grass meal scheme was dropped because I believe there is a future in the country for the grass meal and that grass meal could be produced and sold at a cheaper rate here.  I believe it would have been useful to have a grass meal factory; it would help to reduce the amount we are spending in importing maize and other foodstuffs necessary to maintain our live stock.</P>
      <P>I regret that a Deputy has again used this House to give expression to vile, foul and slanderous lies.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that the manager of the grass meal company was a personal friend of one of the Parliamentary Secretaries in this House.  That manager was a capable man.  That manager had assured the House that neither I nor any of the directors of the grass meal company did introduce politics into that scheme. I stand over that statement, and if the present Minister thinks that is not correct, he can find out easily by making inquiries from the manager of the company who has now got a well-deserved job.  I realise that the grass meal company was closed down for 12 months after the Coalition came into office.  Surely it could not be expected, when they had been told to go slow, that they could increase the number of labourers employed.  I also know that the Deputy who made the foul statements here this evening did appear in North Mayo and made contentious remarks about the grass meal scheme, and said that he saw that the circus from Duleek had now extended to Glenamoy.  I am quite capable of meeting the Deputy any time in North Mayo.  The people of North Mayo <Col N="1245" /> realise that this great experiment was due to the foresight of Deputy Jack Lynch.  I am glad that the Minister has carried it on.  I know the Minister is a Mayo man and I know he will do what he can to help County Mayo, and to ease the burden in this area.  I am certain that he will do everything in his power to make this scheme a great success.</P>

      <P>I do not know really if, in the discussion of these Supplementary Estimates, there is any need for people to get cross and really, when listening to Deputy Lynch, I was surprised, because I do not think anybody said anything to justify his intense indignation.  It would be a pity if we abstracted from the normal debate that degree of trenchancy which makes debate tolerable, for fear of hurting the feelings of over-sensitive participants in our proceedings.</P>
      <P>Sometimes, when I listen to the Opposition, they are so concerned to establish the fact that the present incumbent of the Ministry of Agriculture has done nothing that I begin to wonder is it possibly true that I have done nothing; and yet the evidence of the facts suggests to me that the inter-Party Government has authorised me to do a great deal as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The sub-head E (1) which is provided here, is for the purpose of Backweston farm, where it is proposed to propagate certified seed, with a view to distributing it for the production of adequate supplies from our own land of certified seed wheat, seed oats and seed barley and such other agricultural seeds as may advantageously be propagated in our climate for use by our own farmers and for export to the farmers of the world.  It may interest Deputies to know that we are already receiving inquiries from abroad for Irish certified seed wheat bearing the label under the certification scheme for which, so far as I know, the Department of Agriculture became responsible since I returned to office in 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sometimes begin to feel that there is a duty on me to apologise for doing these things, for doing them seems to drive the Fianna Fáil Party into <Col N="1246" /> frenzies of indignation.  But surely that is what a Minister for Agriculture ought to be doing, and the very element in our certified seed scheme that I consider to be the most satisfactory is, not that we are going to provide our own domestic farmers with their seed, but that we are producing seed wheat of a quality which the foreigner is most anxious to buy because he cannot get anything any better anywhere else in the world.  If the foreigner, who can purchase in any market he cares to go to, is inquiring for our certified seed wheat, is that not the highest recommendation that our certified seed wheat could have for our own farmers; but if our farmers do not want it, is it not a very satisfactory thing to know that there are discerning farmers in other countries only too eager to buy it and to pay us for it?</P>

      <P>Deputy Walsh says 28/- per ton ex Carlow or Kilkenny.  But what I am talking about is the commodity which is delivered, carriage paid, to any farmer's gate in any part of Ireland at a cost of from 11/- to 16/- per ton.  The commodity that is delivered to the farmer's gate at that price is what I call ground limestone. When I am talking about ground limestone, I am not talking about any commodity that was offered to the farmers at 28/- per ton ex Carlow or Kilkenny. That was a Fianna Fáil product. The inter-Party product was that which was delivered carriage paid to the farmer's gate, and of that commodity there was not enough in the Twenty-Six Counties of the Irish Republic in February, 1948, to fill one common eggcup out of Woolworth's. That is an undeniable fact and I am happy at last to have brought Deputy Walsh to the point of confirming&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A special problem which was raised in relation to ground limestone was the system of the transport subsidy.  I do not want to make any smart-alec replies to these remonstrances but the scheme of subsidy was established by me in 1951 when the ground limestone scheme was inaugurated. Deputy Walsh took over the Department of Agriculture in that year and he remained as Minister for Agriculture until the summer of 1954.  If Deputy Walsh thought that the transport subsidy system which I had established was unsatisfactory, inequitable or wasteful, as Deputy Allen and Deputy Corry suggest, am I unreasonable if I inquire why Deputy Walsh did not change it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and in certain parts of the congested areas, and the reason is that you cannot get enough limestone deposits within 40 miles of some of the places in those areas.  Some people will argue that farmers in those areas ought to be penalised.  I think Deputy Walsh was right in saying that where there is limestone available within 40 miles of the land there should not be a subsidy on transport, but where it is not available within 40 miles then we will allow the subsidy to be paid on the extra mileage.  I have not changed that, and why the whole Fianna Fáil Party, led by Deputy Walsh, Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen, should be thumping a tub here to-day about the highly unsatisfactory system of transport subsidy for ground limestone, is a mystery to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The plain truth is connected with the fundamental question whether you are going to have a transport monopoly or not.  Oireachtas Éireann decided, for good or evil, years ago that C.I.E., for the common good, would be granted a monopoly in regard to the transport services.  When we were evolving this lime transport subsidy scheme we succeeded in getting the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to some qualification of that general principle laid down by Oireachtas Éireann.  The plain fact is that the Oireachtas has determined that C.I.E. is to have a transport monopoly in the country.  If you want to change that, change it, but so long as that is the fundamental decision of Oireachtas Éireann it is natural that where there is a large transport job to be done which is being subsidised out of Government funds, the transport monopoly will be the principal agent for its administration.</P>

The moment he is no longer in a position to change the law he is rearing for revolutionary upheavals.  I sympathise with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much obliged to the Deputy, but I have got plenty <Col N="1252" /> of material and I have got a great deal of work to do.  I am not pretending that the basis of the lime transport subsidy is the perfection of equity and justice for all, but I think there is pretty good evidence that the scheme that Deputy Walsh and myself in our respective times as Minister for Agriculture found was as near perfection as we could get in practice, is as good as we can do.  I think Deputy Walsh will agree that, fundamentally, the real issue at stake is, will the transport monopoly be maintained or will it not?  I do not deny that the system is under constant review to see if improvements can be made in it and it will be kept under constant review but I think I am bound to add, in honesty to the House, that so long as the principle is maintained by Oireachtas Éireann that C.I.E. is to be the transport monopoly of the country, the prospect of any radical change in the present system is remote.  That is the plain truth.</P>
      <P>I do not think the figures quoted by Deputy Corry ought to be left uncorrected on the record.  Deputy Corry asked me a parliamentary question, in reply to which he got certain statistical material.  Deputy Corry is not always scrupulous in the way he uses statistical material.  Deputy Corry kept referring to C.I.E. getting 20/3 per ton on the cartage of limestone and I said to him: &ldquo;What is the average?&rdquo;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not worrying with averages.  They are getting 20/3 for the cartage of ground limestone.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but he did not tell us that it was for the very exceptional case of over 46 and under 50 miles, of which I do not suppose there is 1 per cent. of the haulage used in the country. I am not trying to defend the existing system as the acme of perfection. I think it is just a practical working method as near perfection as we can get at this stage but, in fairness to C.I.E., it must be remembered that they have to take every haul that is offered to them, short or long, simple or difficult.  They are bound to take ground limestone from any pit to any consignee on a hard road and the <Col N="1253" /> average per ton that they have received to date for the cartage of ground limestone is, in the year 1955-56, about 12/10. per ton.  That is taking the short with the long haul.  I think the average paid to private hauliers and owners of ground limestone plants works out at about 13/6 a ton and I think the average paid to Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann is in the order of 12/7 a ton.  I want to warn Deputies that you cannot compare these rates with one another as being identical or perfect comparisons, because regard must be had to all the circumstances surrounding the way in which each person is doing the hauling, and it must be borne in mind that the man who owns the lime pit or quarry can always opt to use his own transport, or send for C.I.E.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is to say, if the quarry owner sought service and could not get it, he would complain to the Department and the Department would at once take it up with C.I.E. Therefore, the man who has the quarry always has the option of doing the haul himself or getting C.I.E. to do it. Regard must be had to all these special circumstances that obtain.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in conclusion on this matter, I would say this: This system is by no means perfect but it is as good as I or my predecessor have been able to make it to date.  It has been, and continues to be, under constant review.  I cannot foresee any radical or revolutionary change in it, but I would not at all exclude the possibility of improvements being made from time to time as opportunity offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned that Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann was doing a very good job in the distribution of ground limestone.  I am glad to pay tribute to the efficiency and the excellence of the work that Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann has done in promoting the <Col N="1254" /> ground limestone scheme through its quarries, through the use it has made of its waste lime and through the propaganda which it has most helpfully conducted in supplement of the Department's own efforts to popularise the use of lime.  Nobody knows better than I or, I believe, Deputy Walsh, both of us having had responsibility for the Department of Agriculture, how warmly welcome the work of Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann has been in helping us to bring home to the farmers of this country the value of ground limestone and the other fertilisers which Deputy Walsh and I so earnestly sought to persuade farmers to use in greater quantities than they have done heretofore.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon spoke of the advantage of potato oats.  I confidently anticipate that, at Backweston, our purpose will be to propagate new varieties of oats and, of course, Backweston will be primarily concerned with producing the mother seed which will be dispatched for propagation under the certified seeds scheme.  I shall certainly undertake to direct the attention of those responsible for Backweston to his representations in regard to potato oats, with which I have a good deal of sympathy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also suggested that the farm buildings scheme should be extended to silos.  That is already, at least in part, being done and whether I would be inclined at this stage to go beyond pit silos is something about which I am not sure.  It is a matter on which I value advice from Deputies. I would not wish to prevent a farmer building any silo he wants, but I think we are entitled, in allocating grants, to give a slant in favour of what appears to us to be the most suitable form of silo in our conditions and, from the point of view of economy of labour, if it is mainly grass silage you have in contemplation, probably the pit silo, properly constructed and filled with the Pattison-Buckrake and tractor is the most economical form of conserved fodder which is available in silage form.  You have to be careful not to impose on your neighbour your own preconceived convictions.  I would be obliged if Deputies would consider the question as to whether we ought to go <Col N="1255" /> beyond pit silos and apron silos&mdash;that is really a concrete square on which to build the silo stack.</P>
    <P>We have got to face the fact that we cannot build Rome in a day and I cannot undertake to provide unlimited sums under the farm building scheme for each financial year.  We will have to put some annual limit to the annual sum available for this particular scheme, and agree amongst ourselves that, if the demands exceed that sum, they will have to get into the queue and be provided for as money is available. You cannot undo, in one or two years, the wear and tear of a century. There is no doubt that our farm buildings did fall into culpable disrepair. We are now trying to repair them as quickly as we can.  However, if we try to do them all together, we will simply break down.  They will have to be done on a programme basis, year by year, and if we are prepared to vote the sum that I will have in my Estimate this year, I think the House will agree with me that it is a generous contribution.</P>
    <P>I cannot proceed on the same scale as in Northern Ireland where there is not only a bounty provided for the construction of silos, but also an annual bounty for each footage of silage put into the silo.  If you are a wealthy industrial country you can do that kind of thing for your agricultural industry, but, where we are dependent on agriculture for our national income, there is no use pretending that we can subsidise the silos and also give an annual subsidy for their contents.</P>
    <P>I share the hope expressed by Deputies from all sides of the House that Glenamoy will be a success, but I should like to say that I will not regard it as a success, unless we succeed in establishing on it the best peat land research station in Europe.  I think that anything less than that would be a failure.  This development in itself is going to involve the expenditure of considerable sums of money and the employment of considerable numbers of people, both technicians and labourers, but in view of the fact that in the whole West of Ireland, from the north to the extreme south, we have areas of blanket bog as great as any <Col N="1256" /> country in Europe, I think the money will be well spent.</P>
    <P>Our purpose in Glenamoy is to set up a research station, the lessons from which would be applied as extensively as experience teaches us it is expedient to do so.  I feel bound to say that I have no reason to change my view that the proposal to grow grass for conversion into grass meal in Glenamoy was as daft as a sixpenny watch.  If you want to make grass meal, you want to do so as cheaply as you can, so that you can sell it to the farming community at the lowest possible rate.  If you want to grow grass and to convert it into grass meal, I think you should do that on the most fertile grass land in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do remember that, shortly after Deputy Lynch was appointed Parliamentary Secretary, he mentioned that he was about to embark on this project for growing grass meal.  I wrote to him myself and said that, while I realised that he was activated by the best possible motives, I implored him to take competent technical advice on the issue, that, if you want to grow grass for conversion into grass meal, it would be better to grow it on highly fertile land because the cost of growing it on virgin bog would fall on those who had to use grass meal in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister how he is going to reconcile that statement with the work on Gowla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not believe, from the technical point of view, that the Gowla project is well conceived.  When the proposal was put up by Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann in 1950, it was referred to me.  My advice to the Government was that I did not believe in it, but that I did believe in General Costello. I believe that he is a competent man and I did not exclude the possibility that we might be wrong.  If a man with General Costello's energy has furnished himself with the best technical advice and comes to the Government and says: &ldquo;Here is something I think worth developing,&rdquo; I am prepared to advise the Government that he ought to be given assistance.  There <Col N="1257" /> is always the possibility that he is right and that we are wrong.  I think that if you are going to give a man who has the energy and zeal to attempt a project such as the reclamation of Gowla the opportunity of putting his theory to the test, you have no right to be hanging on to his coat-tails all the time he is trying to make the proposition work.  I think he is entitled to the opportunity of trying his theory out.  I have not the slightest apprehension that he will waste one single shilling on the project.  If he comes to the conclusion that the project is misconceived, I am sure he will be the first to come and tell us.  If not, I am prepared to back him with whatever facilities he needs, so long as he is convinced that the project or his theory can be made to work.</P>
      <P>I do not think I am wrong in that. I think you have to be clear in your minds that the proposition you are prepared to back is on a sensible and reasonable basis.  I am not saying that I would give the same facilities to everybody who came and put up a theory to me.  I have never concealed that, so far as I was concerned, my belief is that the basis of the Gowla scheme is misconceived.  We know that Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann and its technical advisers disagree with that and we may be wrong.  So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to advise the Government to back Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann until the project is tested out to a conclusion.  I make no apology for having given that advice to the Government and Deputy Walsh gave similar advice when the responsibility became his.</P>

      <P>Deputy Walsh queried the reduction in the Appropriation-in-Aid in respect of fresh meat and I think that was possibly owing to a misunderstanding.  The figure, the reduction is in the Estimate but if you compare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you compare the actual receipts in 1954-55 with the revised estimate of receipts this year, you will find the deficiency is not as substantial at it would appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is, of what we expect to get this year, allowing for a reduction in the Appropriation-in-Aid. In 1954-55, we actually collected £15,705.  In this year we had hoped to collect £32,000, but the expansion we had hoped for has not taken place and, in fact, we will make about £12,500, so that the reduction in the actual receipts will be in the order of £3,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would particularly ask Deputies not to be misled by what was manifestly a misunderstanding.  The reductions in the Appropriation-in-Aid in respect of the departmental schools are not losses but they represent the difference between what it looks like we will actually get from the schools <Col N="1259" /> and what we anticipated we would get. That simply arises from the extent to which you undertake experimental work in the schools or simply proceed more or less on a purely commercial basis.  In a year when there is relatively little experimental work proceeding you may expect the Appropriation-in-Aid in respect of the schools to be high as most of the stuff will be turned out in accordance with good husbandry, but if you put in cattle for comparative feeding tests&mdash;and there are tests proceeding to determine the relative value of Shorthorn crosses and crosses with Herefords and crosses with Aberdeen-Angus, which, I think, we were all agreed it was desirable to have&mdash;if you put in this type of test you must expect to some extent a reduction in the commercial return on the operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>I assure the Deputy that that is so, and so far as I am concerned I have no apology to make for it. Whenever it is necessary in the interests of scientific investigation to avail of the resources of the Department I propose to do so.  I do not say it does happen&mdash;but it could happen&mdash;that the extent of the difference in the Appropriation-in-Aid could be the true measure of the value of the scientific investigation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These imports will be in competition with the homegrown seed.  The price is the determining factor. The price of certified seed this year is £5 16s. credit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>So we may be, but the price here is going to determine the price of certified seed sold, the price of the homegrown product against the price of the imported seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually, we are getting inquiries to export it and I think those of us who are producing certified seed are in a position to say to those who do not want to buy it: &ldquo;If you do not want it, there are plenty others who do&rdquo;, but it is not intended that large quantities of pedigree seed wheat, or high seed wheat, will be admitted. Some will be admitted in the same way as certain limited quantities of top-grade seed oats will be admitted and we have no reason to apprehend such quantities as are admitted are likely to any degree to interfere with sales of our certified seed.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Hughes probably heard my reference to farm buildings. I am glad that service is appreciated but I must say that we must set a limit to the annual charge that will come in course of payment and do the best we can with the resources at our disposal.  I think that covers every point that was raised.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House are anxious to see progress made in the development of our agricultural industry.  Now that we have all returned from the hustings I shall look forward confidently to a somewhat more objective approach to the problems which beset the industry.  I have noticed the miscellaneous distribution of posters by the Opposition in the course of the North Kerry by-election which seems to suggest that some slight trace of lack of objectivity exists in their approach to the problems that are besetting the industry.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister two questions?  As regards the question of the Appropriations-in-Aid in the agricultural colleges, I believe that probably different results can be obtained according to how the accounts are presented, but if the reason for the deficiency is that experimental work is being carried on, might I suggest to the Minister that definite provision should be made for the particular experiment so that as far as possible the Dáil and the country would see the working of the agricultural station as distinct from whatever experimental or research work is being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question I should like to <Col N="1262" /> ask the Minister is whether in regard to sub-head E (6) the peatland experimental station, an account will be kept of the cost for the liming and preparation of the peatland in question and a report issued from time to time and that we will see what the costs are?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first query, as Deputy Walsh knows, the practice in regard to the schools has not changed at any time.  No restrictions are being placed on the teaching staffs as to the nature of the experiments they carry out but, sometimes, in addition to the experiments associated with the ordinary programme of instruction, they are asked to carry out special investigations on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture.  I am not sure that I could give an unqualified undertaking that the costings of all these operations would be segregated.  I do not think it would be practicable to do so and I am not sure it is a task which the superintendent of these schools, who has a good deal to do, should be asked to undertake.  We fill up too many forms and we ought not to smother these men with costing and so forth.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second question, I can assure the Deputy that the whole purpose of the station is to continue on with the experiments under the most vigorous scientific conditions, with a view to preparing reports upon them of a standard suitable for learned journals of the highest order. I should imagine that most papers founded on the work there will appear either in the journal of the Department or in learned journals which will accept publications of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate last time, I talked about some schemes we had put before the Government some of which were approved before the change of Government in June, 1954.  Moneys were allocated for them but there is no expenditure upon them.  Many of them have been placed in abeyance.  These schemes were designed for the purpose of trying to get better production from <Col N="1263" /> the land.  We had, for instance, a credit scheme for fertilisers.  That was on our list and I am sure it is in the possession of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In that scheme it was suggested that interest free loans would be issued to farmers, or loans at 2 per cent. interest at the most.  The purpose behind these credit schemes for farmers is well worthy of consideration.  Fertilisers should be used in this country as we use seeds.  They should be applied each spring for the purpose of growing one crop.</P>
      <P>If we were to adopt that policy and have our people educated to do this there would not be much difficulty in making the money available.  As a matter of fact, fertilisers would be available more cheaply to the farmers than they are at present.  Credit should be made available early in the year, in October or November, immediately after the harvest.  Farmers should be encouraged to buy in store at that time, avail of the rebatements given by manufacturers, the discounts given by distributors and retail merchants and cover the storage charges which are incidental expenses charged by the manufacturers and retailers.  This money should be made available to the farmers for 12 months and in the case of dairying counties repayable by the 15th October and in the case of tillage areas by the 1st November.  If it were properly managed and worked that would have been of inestimable value to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the House and the country that that is one method by which we can build up agriculture. It is a method by which we can increase agricultural production here.  Between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 are expended on fertilisers annually in <Col N="1264" /> this country, and one of the greatest burdens placed on the user of these fertilisers is the amount of money lost in interest rates and storage charges. If that were made available for the purpose of reducing the price of fertilisers, the amount of fertilisers that would be used would be far greater and in 12 months, or at most in two years, would show their value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is relevant in this case, because it is one of the schemes put forward originally for grants out of the National Development Fund.  I think it is a matter that should interest the Minister for Finance.  I am not asking the Minister for Finance to help farmers as farmers, but if he wants to help the country as an agricultural State and to build up prosperity, he must interest himself in these matters.  The Minister should know that, since lime was used with such effect in the country, there has been greater production of grass, cereals and roots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be argued that we have better seeds and so forth and that all the value may not be attributable to fertilisers alone.  Be that as it may, I think this scheme is well worth consideration. Under it, we had a special veterinary research scheme.  A recommendation was made to the Government for a sum of money which was approved, but no money has been spent on that scheme.  In fact, it was only to-night that the Minister for Agriculture talked about diseases and the losses the country was suffering from them.  He painted a sad picture about the effects of bovine T.B. and pointed out that in parts of the country a little less than 50 per cent. of our cattle were reactors.  Here was a necessary scheme under which the veterinarians we have in the country could go out and do research work. There is only one at the moment devoting himself to pigs in Thorndale and such diseases as oedema.  Then there is aphosphorosis and several other diseases about which we know very little.  In 1952 an experiment was carried out in West Limerick on a <Col N="1265" /> disease costing this country 70,000 calves annually.</P>

How many have been taken off this list and are now included in the Estimate for Agriculture?  Is it not purposeless asking us to go on discussing these things, and was it not purposeless for the Minister for Agriculture to give the reply he did to Deputy Aiken yesterday when he asked about these schemes?  On the other side, we have a list of schemes <Col N="1266" /> approved since 1954.  You have the cow and byres and water supply schemes.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the Minister very long.  I say some provision should be made to increase the grants for farm dwelling reconstruction and special provision should be made under the National Development Fund for the purpose of improving farm dwellings, particularly on smaller farms.  We all know the great difficulty small farmers have in trying to find money to do reconstruction work on their own houses.  The grant for a two-roomed house is £80, that for a three-roomed house is £100 and the four-roomed structure gets the maximum grant of £120.  It is quite obvious that, with £120 now, very little work can be done in the building line, particularly because farmers are now unable to help out the grant due to the lack of capital.  The Minister should do all in his power to see that the houses of this particular class are made habitable. This type of person is crying out for some help in the direction to which I have pointed.  He is the one type who is not given the same consideration as, for instance, his opposite&mdash;the person with an income in the urban areas.  I do not know how the Minister would assess the income of a 30-acre farmer but in my opinion he is no better off than an urban dweller who earns £300 a year.  What help is the State giving at the present time to the person with a £300 a year income and what help is it giving to the farmer with 30 acres?  Is there any comparison between the two? None.  The State and the local authorities come to the assistance of the £300 a year earner but the valuation of the 30-acre farmer is over £20 and consequently he gets no supplementary grant from the local authority. The advances made to him in respect of a four-roomed house total £120.  I submit that that is of very little use at the present time in view of the high cost of building materials, labour, and <Col N="1268" /> so forth.  I urge the Minister to make some of this £3,000,000 available for the purpose of increasing grants for rural dwellings for small farmers.</P>
      <P>Another matter which is retarding progress in the country is the fact that no work is being done in the matter of the widening and surfacing of culs-de-sac. I think the mileage of culs-de-sac which we have in the country is something like 22,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy attacked me last night because money was being spent on roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking now of main roads.  You are spending all your State moneys on them.  The ratepayers are making a contribution to the county roads.  Who is looking after the culs-de-sac?  Who is looking after the small farmers who are living in small villages comprising two, three and four houses, villages which have bad approaches?  The people there are unable to get even antiquated machinery into their haggards or farmyards. Under no circumstances could one get in modern machinery there.  These old laneways are about nine or ten feet wide and there is no hope of getting any of the modern machinery up through a nine-foot laneway.</P>
      <P>The Minister must realise there are many farmers living along these culs-de-sac who are badly handicapped and who are unable to pull their weight even though they are very anxious to do so because of the difficulty of getting machinery and equipping themselves with up-to-date machinery. If the money is available for a road to a coal mine at Gubaveeny, County Cavan, for the drainage of the River Rye, for improvements to Dún Laoghaire railway station or for local Authorities (Works) Act projects that very few counties want at the present time surely some money should be made available for the very necessary work of improving our culs-de-sac.  I said that very few counties want Local Authorities (Works) Act projects at the present time because the men do not want to go into the rivers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything more I have to say, having regard to the fact that I am debarred from discussing some of the things I should like to discuss. Because of their inclusion in the Estimates for other Departments, I am debarred from discussing them now. However, I will content myself by waiting until the Estimates for these Departments come along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When this scheme was first brought out it was sent down to the county councils and local authorities for suggestions and proposals.  I am concerned with one proposal that was sent up from the Cork County Council, through the Department of Local Government, close on 18 months ago.  Right along from Ballymacoda to Ballycotton, there is a large stretch of land which requires drainage and which is severely affected by erosion. The rivers there need to be cleaned out and drained.  I inquired from the Minister for Local Government about this 12 months ago.  It was submitted for the National Development Fund. I was informed that it had been sent to the Department of Finance and that the Minister was waiting to see what the Department of Finance had to say about it.  I then came down and raised the matter with our own local authority, the Cork County Council.  Some 600 acres of land, in all, were affected. The poor law valuation per statute acre was somewhere between 30/- and 35/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing we got from the Department of Local Government was a suggestion that portion of the scheme could be brought in under the Local <Col N="1270" /> Authorities (Works) Act.  It was sent up to the Department of Local Government this year&mdash;portion of it&mdash;under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and there was no money forthcoming for it.  Unfortunately, the position we are faced with is that a lot of those farmers have to apply for relief of rates because the land is now derelict through flooding.  That will mean a severe loss to the county council funds. In the spring of last year the farmers concerned found they could not plough. You have the same condition of affairs right through the year.  The land is all the time in a water-logged state.</P>

      <P>I am putting the case to the Minister as I know it.  There are some 600 acres of land down there, water-logged, and the complete scheme for the reclamation of that land and the saving of that coast from erosion was lodged with the Department of Local Government for transmission to the Minister's Department a year and a half ago.  That scheme took care of the outfall.  It was prepared by the late Mr. Coffee, the county engineer for Cork.  He went to a considerable amount of trouble and spent a good deal of time in preparing that scheme. When we go to the expense of holding county council meetings in order to consider schemes to be put forward to the Minister in relation to the National Development Fund, we expect to get some result.  One cannot summon men in from all parts of County Cork for one day to consider proposals and one cannot ask county engineers, who are highly-paid officials and who have plenty of work to do, to go to all the expense of preparing these proposals for submission in order to have them ignored by the Minister's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; he can take it.  I would suggest to the Minister that his time would be a little better occupied in looking after those schemes which are sent in, since he wishes to have it that way, at the expense of the ratepayers and the expense of time and labour and annoyance on the part of officials of local authorities.</P>
      <P>In relation to that scheme, we got a letter from the Minister for Local Government telling us to do portion of it under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We proceeded to send a portion of the scheme forward, a portion that would undoubtedly relieve the pressure, at least for the present; I do not believe it would relieve it for good, but it would relieve it to such an extent that the people could continue to till their land, land which is heavily rated and land on which most of those people have between, roughly, 30 and 40 acres per head.  The Minister comes along here then, and we are told by the Local Government Department: &ldquo;Oh, turned down.&rdquo;  After being invited to do the scheme, it is then turned down.  There are so many Departments now looking after the one job that we do not know on which Department or on whom to place the responsibility.  We are anxious to know which Department is responsible.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to say that his Department got that scheme and considered it?  Or is such a thing as land, or the welfare of the agricultural community and the tillage farmers in Cork no longer of any importance? Apparently it is not of such importance as Dún Laoghaire, or other proposals that are sent in.  I am quite serious when I tell the Minister that I require an answer as to whether or not this scheme will be done by his Department? I require an answer to that.  I also require an answer as to why, when we are asked to send a scheme for consideration, and we are referred then to another Minister and another Department, and that Minister and that Department ask us to send up a portion of the scheme under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, the scheme is turned down under the Local Authorities (Works) Act?</P>

      <P>The scheme was sent, as I have said, to the Minister for Finance, through the Minister for Local Government, to be included in these development schemes.  If we have £3,000,000 to spend, I think it would be far better to spend it in endeavouring to get some production to make up for all the farmers who have been driven out of production during the past 12 months.  It would be better spent in that way than spent in the manner in which it is being spent here.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to hold up the time of the House, but I have been asked very definitely to get some decision on this scheme, so that those farmers will know whether or not they will have to apply to the rates department of the Cork County Council and to the relevant Departments up here to have their land classified as derelict and thereby freed from rates.  That is an important matter where those farmers are concerned, farmers who are endeavouring to earn a livelihood there.  Those are the matters with which I am concerned and, since the Minister has accepted full responsibility, I should like to know what he has got to say about it.</P>

      <P>If one reads through Volume 148 of the Official Report, one can refresh one's memory on the discussion which took place on the last occasion when this Vote came before the House.  On that occasion, the discussion, of course, was related mainly to the proceedings of the House when the National Development Fund was first introduced.  I am glad to see now that the present Government has changed its attitude of mind in relation to this method of providing money for particular purposes as compared with the attitude it had when in opposition.</P>

    <P>I, of course, can only speak in so far as this concerns the local authority with which I happen to be connected, namely, Dublin Corporation.  I have no complaint to make, although I did utter fears on the last occasion.  I want frankly to acknowledge now that <Col N="1274" /> as far as Dublin City is concerned the provision of money to the City of Dublin has been&mdash;I will not say overgenerous, but certainly not less generous than it was in the previous year. Very important work has been achieved of great value to the city, particularly in relation to the opportunity made available to us to provide employment for those of our people who had been unemployed for long periods and who had outlived their unemployment insurance and were on public assistance.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that the approach made by the Dublin Corporation in this matter was completely in accord and in line with the outlook of the Fianna Fáil Government when this scheme was first mooted and introduced.  Unemployment was expected.  Fianna Fáil recognised that there was a position developing&mdash;a post-war position, if you like&mdash;and that provision should be made to help those of our people who could not find work and who had not gone abroad as emigrants.  But it was felt that the fund should be used to the best advantage for the purpose of producing something of value to the nation&mdash;not in a reproductive manner, not something that you could sell, but some capital construction work.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that, while we have had roughly between 300 and 400 men constantly employed in Dublin as a result of the moneys made available under this scheme, we look with great apprehension to the immediate future, and we believe that there will be very large-scale increases in unemployment in the near future, and I would ask the Minister to indicate that, if such a situation should develop, greater consideration will be given in the shape of increased grants to the Dublin Corporation in order that greater numbers of our people can be employed without delay.</P>
    <P>The present position is that we receive something like £450,000 in a financial year from this sum of £3,000,000.  We have estimated accordingly for plans already approved by the Department to whom we have to send them for approval.  As I say, we have no grievance because the principle <Col N="1275" /> has now been accepted of what was once described as a mythical fund. I think it was the Minister for Finance himself, when over here, who described it as a mythical fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is mythical, in so far as no money was left behind to feed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a mythical fund, in so far as the City of Dublin was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very good that we had to spend it.  It is far better to vote money for a specific purpose and to spend it for that specific purpose, rather than vote money and not spend it at all, and leave it in the fund. There is nothing of a human approach in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to leave money for the commitments, you know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had to change his mind about it.  A colleague of his, the Minister for Agriculture, referred to it as a &ldquo;slush&rdquo; fund.  It has now become a respectable fund and is no longer mythical.</P>
      <P>When this fund was first created, a special works department was set up in the Dublin Corporation, first of all, to design different types of work and it was sought to have these approved, even in advance, so that we could have in pigeon holes approved schemes which could be embarked on if a critical unemployment situation were suddenly to confront us.  And I now say to the Minister that that sudden critical unemployment situation is about to confront us in the City of Dublin, and I press him to consider seriously a recommendation to the Minister for Local Government that, in that event, we should be allowed to build up the employment content of this department as originally envisaged, carrying up to 1,200 men per week in full employment, if they are found to be available and if they are in need of work and if they are on assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> We heard, when the Minister and his colleague were over here, that some of the works that we had engaged in or indulged in were stupid and wasteful. I am glad that there is now complete accord between the Dublin Corporation, the Department concerned, and the Department of Finance that the works we are doing are useful, not only from the point of view of the employment they give, but also from the point of view that they are improving the amenities of the city and are doing what I would call useful practical work on which moneys of this nature should be spent.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have approval for a certain amount.  We have a number of schemes.  Call them, if you like, long-term schemes&mdash;schemes that will take a rather bigger amount of money, schemes and plans which took longer to prepare.  I want the Minister to take the line, in approaching this matter under the circumstances as they are now developing, that this National Development Fund&mdash;I see the Parliamentary Secretary is nodding his head in, apparently, complete disapproval of my prognostications.  All I can say is I know the Parliamentary Secretary will be very tragically disappointed when he discovers that what I am saying is a correct appreciation of the circumstances which will confront us in the immediate future.  I know what I am talking about in Dublin.  If the Parliamentary Secretary knew a little bit more about Dublin, he probably would find that his own colleagues&mdash;his own colleagues in his own immediate Party and his colleagues of the Coalition who are actively concerned about this matter in the Dublin Corporation&mdash; would agree with me and would accept me as their spokesman as the chairman of the Public Works Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I would say that the first essential proof that should convince any sensible man is that, when it came to the election of the chairman of this committee after the recent corporation elections, there was only one choice, and a unanimous choice at that.  I believe that should <Col N="1277" /> be some proof to the Minister of what I am saying, and I am putting on record here something that can be challenged before the discussion on this Vote is completed.  Perhaps the Minister might contact some of his colleagues to whom I have referred and ask them if they are prepared to come in here or to authorise him to come in here and refute what I am saying.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, Sir, about another aspect, and it is a pity that the Minister for Local Government is not here. Perhaps I will not have developed my point before I move the Adjournment and, when I next raise it, he might be apprised of the fact that I am going to make some references, and not of a satisfactory nature, to certain attitudes by the Minister for Local Government. Will I move the Adjournment now, Sir?</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister for Finance if he would be good enough to indicate to the Minister for Local Government that he might honour us with his presence here on the next occasion when this Vote is being discussed, as I have some references to make which strictly concern local government and for which the Minister for Finance is not responsible and cannot be held blameworthy.  I am concerned about the attitude the Minister for Local Government is adopting to our employment of staff for which the corporation pays in full and for which there is no contribution from this fund in the shape of salaries or wages; and in our selection of persons to appoint to this special works department, we find great difficulty in getting an understanding of even their temporary employment, and in addition, there are questions of the remuneration attaching to senior officers of this department in connection with whose remuneration promises were actually made and have not been kept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Finance:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If, with reference to the item <Col N="1278" />&lsquo;Other Borrowings&rsquo;, amounting to £5,000,000, in the statement of receipts into and issues out of the Exchequer published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 21st February, 1956, he will state in detail the sources from which this amount was borrowed, the rates of interest and the dates of borrowing and repayment in each case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The information sought by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I indicated immediately that if the information appeared to me not to be satisfactory, to the extent that it required further discussion, I would raise it on the Adjournment, and you have permitted me to do so.</P>
    <P>It is rather a surprise because these sources of borrowing are quite novel. As far as I know, there has been no precedent for the State borrowing either from C.I.E. or from the E.S.B. I was, therefore, interested, when I heard rumours to the effect that the State had borrowed from the E.S.B., in ascertaining to what extent this was based on fact, and the terms and conditions attaching thereto.  When I got the answer which the Minister promised would be accurate, I must say it was more than accurate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that. It was more than accurate because it gave me a further surprise.  I was not aware that the State had resorted to borrowing short-term from C.I.E.  It was only last May, I think, that C.I.E. went for a public loan and the terms and conditions of that loan were that it cost C.I.E. certainly not less than 4½ per cent. per annum on the money it borrowed.  While C.I.E., in borrowing and in the issue of its prospectus, made no reference to the fact that it would indulge in discounting Government Bills or accommodation loans, I find nevertheless that this institution has lent all the money it borrowed at 4½ per cent., £2,250,000, at 3? per cent. <Col N="1279" /> To add to the peculiar situation, if I remember correctly, the loan for C.I.E. was not fully subscribed and the Minister for Finance himself was one of the parties to the underwriting, together with the banks, of the unsubscribed part.  Here we have the Minister underwriting a loan for a company from whom he was going to borrow immediately they got this money and at a rate of interest which produced a loss for them over the period the money was lent.</P>
      <P>I do not think that C.I.E. should be treated in that way.  If the Government found that it was not convenient to go for a public loan at the particular time it needed money to fund its own debts or to secure money for other capital purposes, at least it might have said to this subsidiary institution which in my opinion has very little free choice when called upon for transactions of this kind: &ldquo;We will see that you have no loss to your institution on the moneys you lend to us.&rdquo;  It does seem strange that the Minister for Finance, who purports in a prospectus to be the underwriter for the issuance of a loan by C.I.E., should, at the same time, be a borrower from the company whose loan he is underwriting.</P>
      <P>Is it fair that the loss in this case, whether it is big or small, should fall on the backs of possibly the users of the buses or of other transport, or is it going to be another instance of an item to be discussed when wages and employment conditions are being discussed? As far as C.I.E. is concerned, this was a surprise to me and I believe it is without precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy believes wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can tell us when it was done before.  I have no knowledge that C.I.E. had done this before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have consulted my predecessor before he started this hare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of telling us the position. As long as I know anything <Col N="1280" /> about C.I.E., certainly up to comparatively recently, it had a deficit every year and the State had to make up that deficit, partly by grant and, to a certain extent, by loans for capital development. I have yet to know when C.I.E., before the advent of its public issue, had a substantial amount of money of this nature in its coffers to lend to the Government for a period of from six to eight months.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the E.S.B.  I wonder has this a precedent?  Has this been done before?  The loan to the Government by the E.S.B. coincides with its public issue, again an issue the prospectus of which had on it the words: &ldquo;Underwritten jointly by the Minister for Finance and the banks.&rdquo; When this matter comes to be examined, I think it will be looked upon as a kind of farce.  It will reduce the dignity and the value attaching to the underwriting commitments of the State and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As I said, such a subsidiary institution of the State can have very little choice because of the provisions in Acts of this House.  Every new operation is dependent upon, if you like, a sanction from the Minister, who controls it.  When they go to the Government and, in the words of the chairman of that institution, agree to pay a realistic rate of interest, it becomes 5 per cent., the rate which the Minister for Agriculture described as the interest that would be payable only by a banana republic.</P>
      <P>Again, we borrowed from them at 3½ per cent.  I do not know anything about the Hospitals' Trust Board and I do not even know at this moment whether this is the hospitals' money that is invested with the Minister, or given to the Minister, or whether this is a private concern, and I, therefore, do not wish to discuss it.  In any event, the amount involved is considerably smaller and it is within the right, I would say, of an outside body, an independent body, if it has surplus money, to advance it on short term or long term to the State, as it sees fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quarrelling with the principle of the Government discounting bills at home or borrowing on short term at home.  I would prefer that they should do that, even if they gave <Col N="1281" /> a lower rate of interest to the people concerned, than that they should go to London and borrow there at short term rates at either a lower or a higher rate of interest, although these people would have to invest their money at, say, 4 per cent. across the channel.</P>
    <P>I have said, Sir, that I should like the Minister to indicate when this procedure was adopted before, to what extent it was done and what the terms and conditions were, the rate of interest, and whether the moneys that these institutions had were in the coffers to their credit or whether they were, in fact, while carrying out that transaction, in overdraft with their bankers.  The Minister might give as much detail as he can in regard to this matter.  If he likes to satisfy me, he should answer the points that it is of importance should be understood and appreciated.</P>
    <P>I intend to give the Minister longer than the usual ten minutes in which to reply.  In conclusion, I want to say that it was not publicly known that these transactions took place, but, as in everything, the rumour began to trickle out and to spread.  Sometimes rumour magnifies.  I was, for instance, misled to the extent that I understood the borrowing from the E.S.B. was to the extent of £3,000,000.  I now see that it is to the extent of £2,250,000. The Minister ought to clarify this matter as much as possible in order that the public will understand what this is all about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>One might understand and accept a person who is innocent in financial matters making the speech we have just heard from Deputy Briscoe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody, however, could accept that Deputy Briscoe was such an innocent in relation to public finance.  Of course, what occurred in this case, and what occurred during my predecessor's time before that, was a perfectly obvious and proper transaction. Deputy Briscoe asked, first of all, whether this ever happened before. <Col N="1282" /> It did.  On 30th January, 1954, when Deputy Seán MacEntee was Minister for Finance, the sum of £1,000,000 was borrowed from C.I.E.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to learn a little sense.  The fact is that, on 30th January, 1954, the Minister for Finance of the day, Deputy Seán MacEntee, borrowed £1,000,000 from C.I.E., repayable as to £500,000 on demand, repayable as to the balance of £500,000 on 31st August, 1954.  The difference between the transaction then and the transaction now is that, in respect of the first £500,000, Deputy MacEntee agreed to pay C.I.E. 1¾ per cent. and, in respect of the second £500,000 he agreed to pay C.I.E. 2 per cent. but, in respect of this transaction, the rate is 3? per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No difference!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the transaction that was carried out by my predecessor and, let me say, perfectly clearly and categorically, that it was an entirely correct thing for my predecessor to do.  I stand over it as being a correct thing in every possible degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in respect of the incident to which Deputy Briscoe has directed attention in his question?  He asked a question.  He got all the information he asked for.  Now, apparently, he thinks&mdash;as I have said, incorrectly &mdash;that it never happened before and, because he thinks he knows everything about the affairs of C.I.E., he does not even accept my word.  I can tell him <Col N="1283" /> that the transaction did happen before. It did, of course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We will let Deputy MacEntee answer that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened, of course, was that after the previous issue C.I.E., having got the funds on their issue, had money available that they did not require for the moment. What happened in respect of this transaction?  If Deputy Briscoe looks it up, he will find the Minister for Finance in respect of the issue concerned did not contribute to that issue of C.I.E., that it was underwritten by the banks.  I am talking off the record in that respect but I think he will find I am right.  What happened in respect of the E.S.B. issue was exactly the same.  The two bodies concerned went to the public for their issue.  They wanted that issue to carry them over on a planned development over a period.  That planned development over a period meant that they would be expending the moneys subscribed to the two issues&mdash;by C.I.E. and the E.S.B. respectively&mdash;over a period of months and that over a period of months from the date of their issues they would have, following the success of their issues, funds that they did not immediately require.</P>
      <P>What were they to do with these funds?  Leave them in the bank earning no interest?  Put them in the bank on deposit rate at a lesser rate than this, as the rate was at the time?  If that were done, the bank would have the pleasure of lending it back to the Government and getting a profit, the difference between the two funds, on the transaction.  Take the E.S.B. issue at 3½ per cent.  If that £2,250,000 had been put on deposit by E.S.B. with the bank they would have got 2½ per cent. from the bank and the commercial banks would have then lent back the same moneys to the Minister for Finance at the same rate of 3½ per cent. and, on Deputy Briscoe's method of carrying out the finance, 1 per cent. would have inured to the benefit of the commercial banks and would have been lost to the E.S.B.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There was another alternative open to them.  Perhaps Deputy Briscoe would have wished that the E.S.B., instead of putting it on deposit in the banks here, should send it to London and put it in Treasury bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that they should not do that.  I said that you should pay the same interest as they paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That was another possibility.  I gather that Deputy Briscoe leaves that out of account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was perfectly simple.  The E.S.B. on the one hand, C.I.E. on the other hand, the Hospitals' Trust Board, for the third, all had two perfectly simple and perfectly free alternatives open to them.  One alternative was to put the money on deposit and draw the deposit rate.  If they had done that, the banks, having received the money, would have re-lent it to the Government at the higher rate of interest.</P>
      <P>The second alternative was that the bodies concerned would have lent the money to the Government at the exchequer bill rate which is higher than the deposit rate.  In the case of the E.S.B. issue, it is 1 per cent.  The Government lost nothing, because it is paying to these bodies the same rate of interest as it would have to pay to the banks on exchequer bills, but the bodies themselves gained 1 per cent. in the case of the last two of them and a fractional amount in the case of the first one.</P>
      <P>One per cent., even for a broken period, on £2,250,000, is a very substantial sum, and I am not prepared, even though Deputy Briscoe requests, invites and demands, supported by the <i>Irish Press</i>, to lose that 1 per cent. for the E.S.B. when we can get it for them by way of a method started by my predecessor and of which I fully approve.</P>
