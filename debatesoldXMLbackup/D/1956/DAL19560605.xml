    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is now in a position to furnish detailed information in regard to the labour content of expenditure on public works, including, in particular, road work, forestry work and drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that for the financial year ended 31st March, 1955, the total wages and salaries paid for road work carried out directly by local authorities was 63 per cent. of the total cost, that the corresponding percentage in the case of forestry work carried out by the Department of Lands was 77 per cent., and in respect of the arterial drainage work carried out on the Brosna, Feale, Glyde and Corrib schemes by the Board of Works, it was 56 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures have been derived from different source material and, while they have as far as possible been adjusted to render them comparable, certain differences in concept may still exist.  The remuneration included is that arising directly out of the works in question (including salaries of professional and technical staff) and paid by the authorities doing the work. Thus in the case of local authorities, besides road labourers, etc., persons engaged in quarries operated by local authorities for their road works, and also persons employed in repairing plant, etc., are included.  In the case of the Board of Works allowance has been made for the labour content of repair and servicing work, carried out in the central engineering workshop, on plant and machinery in use on <Col N="1294" /> the drainage work.  The figures quoted do not include the labour content of purchased materials and services or of work done on contract.  It has been possible to estimate roughly that if allowance is made for this element in respect of the materials purchased by local authorities for road works the domestic wage and salary content of the final cost is of the order of 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>Because of the adjustments made to ensure comparability the figures given differ from those previously furnished separately in replies to the Deputy by the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Lands on 17th May, 1955.</P>

      <P>The Gramophone Records (Maximum Prices) Order, 1956, was made by me on the 20th March, 1956, in order to protect the public against the action of traders who attempted to charge increased prices for gramophone records which had not been subjected to the special import levy.  I informed the principal firms of gramophone distributors that I would be prepared to consider the revocation of the Order if they each gave an undertaking that they would sell at the old prices their stocks of records which have not borne the special import levy.  In the case of one of the firms concerned, I still await the guarantee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether Shannon Airport will be fully capable of handling the DC-8 and Boeing 707 commercial jet airliners when they go into world service, and, if not, whether it is proposed to undertake an improvement programme at the airport <Col N="1295" /> in order to render it capable of handling such aircraft.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy to keep abreast of any developments which are likely to affect the position of Shannon as a major international airport and I have naturally had regard to the latest information available about the proposed new commercial jet aircraft.  I am examining the likely effects on, and the needs at, Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of the spokesmen for the various airline services at the moment have made it quite clear that Shannon is now looked upon purely as a diversionary airport?  In view of that outlook, or opinion, it is quite possible that when jet airliners come into operation Shannon will be bypassed altogether.  Does the Minister not consider that now is the time to make the necessary arrangements to improve or extend the runways so that large jet liners in the transatlantic service will be facilitated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the expenditure of £500,000 on a jet runway in Baldonnel for the sake of three jet planes for the Air Force would have been better spent on extending the runways in Shannon for commercial purposes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether any recent investigation has been made by <Col N="1296" /> his Department into the possibility of finding oil in Ireland, and, if so, with what results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are technical considerations which place oil investigation in a very special category. While some investigations have already been made in my Department I am not in a position to make any statement in the matter pending the outcome of consideration which is being given to the possibility of enlisting the cooperation of private enterprise and the feasibility of making certain provisions without which the participation of private enterprise in the necessary exploratory work may be difficult to obtain.  I do not wish the Deputy to assume from this answer that the present indications are either favourable or unfavourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's answer that the Geological Survey Branch of his Department is capable of handling this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a considerable amount of information on the matter.  In addition, a private group has undertaken a reconnaissance survey of this field and their report, together with the whole background of the problem, is at present being examined.  I would like to emphasise again that the Deputy is not to take it that all that examination either indicates a favourable or unfavourable outlook until we get further into this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want the House to remember that they must not expect any early announcement on this because a considerable amount of survey work is necessary before we can even pronounce on what the future prospects are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that C.I.E. placed an order last week for 12,000 wagon buffers with a <Col N="1297" /> foreign firm, and, if so, whether having regard to his statement in reply to a question on 24th May, 1956, that coach buffers in cast steel could not be made in Ireland, but that wagon buffers which have a cast iron body are made at Inchicore and are not imported, although some were imported for a very short period, he will state (a) whether he was informed by the company that this order was about to be placed abroad, (b) whether these wagon buffers could not have been made and/or finished at Inchicore, and (c) whether any inquiries were made or tenders invited from Irish firms for the manufacture and/or finishing of the buffers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has received representations from the people of Bray requesting the provision of an adequate train service to Bray during the month of June, and whether he has asked C.I.E. to give favourable consideration to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the grave dissatisfaction of the public in Dublin and Bray at the decision of C.I.E. not to run a train service to Bray on Sundays in June, and if he will bring this matter to the attention of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for providing adequate transport services rests with the Board of C.I.E.  Any representations which the Deputies may wish to make regarding train services to Bray should therefore be made direct to C.I.E.  Representations have been made to me in the matter and I have had them conveyed to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I have already made representations to C.I.E. and I have received a reply since putting down this question. <Col N="1298" /> The reply is not a very favourable one as far as the people of Bray are concerned. This is an important matter and I am sure the Minister is only too well aware that every organised group in Bray has protested against the attitude of C.I.E. in withdrawing services during the month of June.  I would ask the Minister to approach C.I.E. again with a view to getting them to reopen their services, for the last fortnight in June anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy knows the disability from which I suffer in this respect.  The Transport Act of 1950 provides that it should be the particular duty of the Board of C.I.E. to exercise their powers under the Act to provide an efficient, economical, convenient and properly integrated system of public transport.  This is not one of the matters in which I can intervene; it is a matter of administration by the Board of C.I.E. The Deputy will, therefore, have to endeavour to bring his persuasive powers and those of the local authorities concerned to bear on the Board of C.I.E. to accept their point of view in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the Minister's reply, does the Minister consider that the Board of C.I.E. are providing an efficient train service to Bray on Sundays by not providing one at all?  Is not that part of their function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the provision of a train service to Bray on Sundays.  The Minister's reply, as I understand it, is that that is not part of his function.  That it is the duty of C.I.E. to provide&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether the Minister had received representations concerning an adequate service.  The Deputy did not ask for the Minister's opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I asked; that is what Deputy Brennan asked.  I asked the Minister whether <Col N="1299" /> he was aware of the grave public dissatisfaction that exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask this question: will the Minister say, in view of the grave dissatisfaction that exists among the Dublin public and among the public in Bray at the failure to provide a service to Bray in the month of June, whether he considers that that is in compliance with C.I.E.'s duty to provide an efficient service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the same question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that the Minister will not make any further representations to C.I.E. in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submitted the representations, which were made to me, to C.I.E. for the sympathetic consideration of the board; but the board is the body which is entitled to operate a service to Bray.  It is not required to do so under my direction and I have no power to give them any direction. The board must be convinced of the merits of the case before it can move in the matter.  I understand that the board's plea is that during the past two years, when there were train services to Bray in the month of June, there was a loss in respect of each month of June.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the closing down by the Tralee and Fenit Harbour Commissioners of the lock gate bridge over the canal near Blennerville has resulted in great inconvenience to the residents of the district, and if he will make representations to the commissioners <Col N="1300" /> to hand over the bridge to the Tralee Urban District Council, or to the Kerry County Council, with a view to having it repaired and reopened for the benefit of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the closing down by the Tralee and Fenit Harbour Commissioners of the lock gate bridge over the canal at Blennerville has resulted in great inconvenience to residents of the district.</P>
      <P>In 1953 the harbour commissioners informed my Department that this bridge had become unsafe for heavy traffic; that having regard to the improvements carried out at the port, there was no likelihood of the canal being used at any time in the future for shipping, and that they were not in a financial position to repair the bridge.  They requested that an Order should be made to relieve them of the obligation to maintain the bridge and that it should be transferred to the Kerry County Council, who are the authority responsible for the roads which are connected by the bridge. The harbour commissioners were informed of the relevant statutory provisions and it was suggested to them that they should consult with the Kerry County Council.  No further approach in the matter has been made to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in authorising County Donegal Vocational Education Committee to proceed with the building of a new technical school at Carndonagh is concerned with the limited funds which can be made available in the current financial year for the purpose of providing such schools.  As I see the position at the moment, the Carndonagh project cannot be fitted into the capital programme earlier than April, 1957.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation has nothing to do with any promise given. I am concerned with quite a large problem that arises in connection with going ahead with a number of schools because of the limitation that I find imposed upon me in regard to capital, which is imposed generally.

      <P>The site on which it is proposed to erect a new national <Col N="1303" /> school at Brittas, County Dublin, was offered by the reverend manager in June, 1953.  The Commissioners of Public Works reported in February, 1954, that they had carried out an inspection of the plot, and that it was suitable for the purposes of the new school.</P>
      <P>A grant towards the cost of the erection of the new school was sanctioned by my Department in April, 1955.  The Commissioners of Public Works have prepared the working drawings and specification for the scheme and I understand that they hope soon to be in a position to invite tenders.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the entrance fee for the secondary schools' leaving certificate examination has been increased from £2 10s. to £4, and if he will state the reasons which necessitated this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>The entrance fee referred to is not that payable by the ordinary candidates, who have followed an approved leaving certificate course for two years and who are eligible for the award of the leaving certificate.  The fee payable by such candidates is 15/- and it is for these candidates that the leaving certificate examination is intended to cater.</P>
      <P>In 1941, a rule was introduced under which candidates who were not following an approved leaving certificate course or who were otherwise ineligible for the award of the leaving certificate were specially admitted to the examination. This concession was intended to apply mainly to students who, though not eligible to take the examination under the ordinary regulations, wished to use the leaving certificate examination as an avenue for entrance to professional schools which accept that examination in lieu of their own entrance examination.</P>
      <P>It has been the Department's policy that the entrance fee charged in the case of such students should cover the cost of examination.  Accordingly, to meet the increasing cost, the amount of the fee payable has been raised to £1 for each subject presented or an inclusive fee of £4, whichever is the less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of candidates who were <Col N="1305" /> specially admitted to the leaving certificate examination, 1955, under this provision was 811, as against 6,098 candidates who were admitted to the examination under the ordinary regulations.</P>

They may want this farm or they may think it is not suitable.

      <P>The answers are as follow:&mdash;(a)  The loss on the telegraph service for the year ended 31st March, 1955, was £378,000 odd.  During the year ended 31st March last, telegraph revenue increased by an estimated £110,000 which increase was, however, offset by an increase in expenditure estimated at £40,000 owing mainly to increased wage rates.  The net result was a reduced estimated loss of £308,000 in 1955-56.</P>

The other provincial teleprinter centres will be connected to the automatic system as soon as certain line equipment which is on order is installed within the next year.  Conversion from morse to telephone transmission is still awaited at 24 post offices and two sub-post offices.  A new telex service has been introduced which enables subscribers to exchange teleprinted messages with one another, with telegraph offices and with other telex subscribers abroad.</P>

      <P>There has so far been no curtailment of telephone capital expenditure or of engineering branch staff.  As regards the future, I shall make a full statement shortly&mdash;probably in connection with a new Telephone Capital Bill which is required to provide further moneys for telephone development.  On the final part of the question, the position is that permanent staff are recruited by way of competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commission and serve a probationary period during which their fitness for retention is tested.  Temporary and quasi-permanent staff are selected departmentally and are not retained unless they are found satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill, as the House is aware, is to put into legislative form the proposals I submitted to this House in my Budget speech on 8th May and which were passed that day in the various Financial Resolutions. Before I give a summary of the provisions of the Bill, I should like, briefly, to refer to one matter which I mentioned on the concluding stage of the Budget debate.  I indicated then that I hoped to have available for the members of the House and for the public the printed report of the Committee of Inquiry into Taxation on Industry before this debate would commence.  I am glad that that report has now become available.  It is a valuable document and one that goes at some length into many points that were raised.</P>
      <P>I have in mind in particular a point that was made by more than one speaker from the Opposition Front Bench that there should be a special remission of taxation for export industries. As Deputies can now see in paragraphs 171 and 172, on pages 64 and 65, the report deals specifically with this matter.  The House can see from those paragraphs that the committee, for the excellent reasons they have quoted there, refrain from making any recommendation for direct taxation benefits for exporters, as such.  The House will also see that the committee indeed went further and suggested that aids to the development of industrial exports should be the function of some Department, other than that of the Revenue Department.</P>
      <P>The committee has made certain suggestions which, as I have already said, are being examined.  One of these suggestions is incorporated in this Bill, namely that in relation to initial allowances. In their report, the committee also suggested in paragraph 212 on page 80 that basic wear and tear rates should be published by the Revenue Commissioners.  The basic wear and tear rates in existence are, in fact, published in the committee's report at pages 130 to 133.  These rates are, therefore, now public property.  However, I can say that if in the future any variation in or any extension of these basic rates is made or becomes necessary, we shall most certainly follow the committee's recommendation and make public any such new rates which may be fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that any worth while <Col N="1329" /> increase in exports can only flow from an expansion of production and that the problem which we are facing is to broaden our production base and to secure an all-round improvement in efficiency and productivity.  Any means within our capacity that will help to achieve these ends must be adopted. It was for that reason, as I have mentioned, that I accept the committee's recommendation for a 20 per cent. initial allowance for wear and tear on new machinery or plant for use in a trade, but exclusive of vehicles.</P>
    <P>I think everyone will agree now that, having had an opportunity of seeing this report, it is a document which will require very considerable study.  We propose to give it that study in the period ahead.  The results of our examination will hardly be made available until next year's Budget.  Meanwhile, however, I would repeat what I have said already.  When we have concluded our examination of the recommendations and implications of this report, we shall consider in greater detail whether a more general review of our code of direct taxation is desirable.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill itself is perhaps to some degree more a Committee Bill than one for general Second Reading debate, in so far as the actual text is concerned.  For the convenience of the House, I propose just shortly to outline the purport and the effect of each section.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the customary section which fixes and imposes income-tax and surtax for the current financial year, 1956-57.  It continues the previous enactments and corresponds roughly to Financial Resolution No. 1 passed on Budget day.</P>
    <P>Section 2 gives effect to the proposal which I made in the Budget speech to modify in the case of persons whose health is impaired the existing restriction of income-tax relief in respect of life insurance premiums.  At present this restriction is measured by reference to 7 per cent. of the actual capital sum payable on death.  In future it will be calculated by reference to 7 per cent. of the capital sum which would be payable on death if the person's insurance were not, by reason of <Col N="1330" /> his health, subject to special provisions in relation to the capital sum payable.</P>
    <P>This section will operate as from the year of assessment 1956-57 onwards, irrespective of when the policy of insurance was entered into.</P>
    <P>Section 3 exempts from tax the first £25 of the total interest otherwise assessable on an individual taxpayer arising from deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank, with a trustee savings bank or with any of the commercial banks.  In the case of a married couple where each spouse has deposit interest, and the total of such interest arising to the couple is in excess of £25, there will be but one £25 exemption and this will be apportioned by reference to the respective amounts of their interest.  This provision, as the House is aware, has been introduced for the purpose of assisting saving.</P>
    <P>Section 4 increases from £300 to £310 the income-tax deduction allowed in respect of a married couple.</P>
    <P>Section 5 enables the income-tax deduction for a child to be granted for the year of birth, in the case of a child adopted during that year.  I might, perhaps, mention that the income-tax allowance has always been available in the case of an adopted child, whether legally or informally adopted.  The existing law, however, provides that, in order that an allowance may be given for a particular assessment year, the adopted child must be alive at the commencement of that year.  In relation to natural born children, since 1949, the law has been that the allowance may be granted for a year, if the child is alive at any time during that year.  It is now proposed, under this section, to put adopted children on the same footing as natural born children for the year of birth.</P>
    <P>Section 6 increases from £50 to £60 the income-tax deduction allowed in respect of a dependent relative.</P>
    <P>Section 7 extends the 20 per cent. income-tax relief available under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, as amended by Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1935, in respect of certain public issues by providing that &ldquo;rights&rdquo; or bonus shares, to the extent that they <Col N="1331" /> relate to shares already carrying relief under that section, may be deemed to be issued for public subscription and may, accordingly, themselves qualify for relief, if, in regard to them, the terms of the original section are otherwise complied with.  The purpose of this section is to enable consolidation of certain of these issues in so far as the past is concerned and to prevent subdivision in the future.  If shares are consolidated in that way, there will be a better market in them.  I might mention that Deputy Lemass, when he was speaking on the Budget, suggested that the only way in which this relief could be obtained was by way of refund.  That is not so.  It is dealt with by way of offset and not necessarily in the way the Deputy suggested, that the tax should be paid and claimed back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax is deducted from the dividend warrant.  You must get a refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is not dealt with by way of refund but by way of offset in respect of other assessments. I have often met such a case.</P>
      <P>Section 8 and the First Schedule increase the rates of customs and excise duties on tobacco.  The main rate of customs duty on unmanufactured leaf is raised by 7/11 per lb. from £1 14s. 10d. to £2 2s. 9d. per lb. and the various other rates of duty are increased correspondingly.  The section also provides for an increase in the rate of rebate allowed on hard-pressed tobacco, namely, plug, roll, twist coil and bar, from 9/8 per lb. to 12/4 per lb.</P>
      <P>Section 9 imposes a special excise duty of 7/11 per lb. on duty-paid stocks of tobacco held by tobacco manufacturers at 5 p.m. on 8th May, 1956, and provides for the deferment of payment of the duty to a date not later than 1st January, 1957.</P>
      <P>Section 10 increases the rate of customs duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oil (petrol) from 1/9½d. to 2/3¼d. per gallon and correspondingly increases the rate of excise duty from 1/7½d. to 2/1¼d. per gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> Section 11 provides that the rate of customs rebate allowed on diesel and other heavy oils, when the oil is used for any purpose other than combustion in the engine of a motor vehicle, shall be reduced from 1/8 to 1/7 per gallon. The rate of excise rebate on oils is similarly reduced.  These reductions, in effect, make the oils in question dutiable at the rate of 1d. per gallon. Tractor vaporising oil is excluded from the proposals and will, therefore, continue to be free of duty.</P>
    <P>Section 12 and the Second Schedule deal with the rates of customs and excise duties on matches.  The main rate, which is the excise rate applicable to the gross of standard sized boxes is increased from 5/9 to 10/3, that is, by three-eighths pence per box.  Section 13 increases the rate of excise duty on bets made off the course from 7½ per cent. to 10 per cent. of the amount of the bet.  Section 14 deals with the rates of customs and excise duties on table waters.  The main rate which is the rate applicable to homemade sweetened table waters is raised from 4d. to 1/- per gallon, which is now the over-all rate for sweetened and unsweetened waters.</P>
    <P>Section 15 restores the dance hall tax.  Two scales of duty are provided&mdash; a general scale applicable to dances held in or within three miles of the cities and larger towns and a lower scale applicable to dances held in places not in or within three miles of towns having populations exceeding 2,000.  Under the general entertainments duty law, dances held in places not in or within three miles of towns having populations exceeding 1,000 will be free of duty.  The various statutory reliefs from entertainments duty provided for entertainments promoted for charitable objects, and so on, will apply automatically to the dance tax.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides an exemption from entertainments duty for any entertainment consisting wholly of an Irish language film show.  Section 17 imposes an excise duty on gaming licences for funfairs and amusement halls issued under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  The rate of duty is to be £10 when the period for which <Col N="1333" /> the licence is to be issued does not exceed three months, £20 when the period exceeds three months but not six months, £30 when the period exceeds six months but not nine months and £40 when the period exceeds nine months.</P>
    <P>Section 18 amends Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1933, as amended by Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1935, which provides partial relief from entertainments duty for greyhound racing held in places not within 20 miles of a town with population more than 20,000, subject to the condition that greyhound racing was held in such place before 31st October, 1933.  By deleting the latter condition and thus bringing within the scope of the relief a number of greyhound tracks established since October, 1933, this section gives effect to a recommendation included in the 1952 Report of the Advisory Committee on the Greyhound Industry.  The relief takes the form of a repayment, subject to a maximum of £100 in any year commencing 1st November.</P>
    <P>Section 19 terminates the customs duty on fillers and flats for egg-boxes imposed by Section 1 of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 4) Act, 1932, and reference No. 9 in the First Schedule to that Act, the reason being that these are no longer made here.</P>
    <P>Section 20 confirms in force the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Orders relating to the Special Import Levy and in relation to which I made a full statement on the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>Section 21 gives effect to the Budget speech proposal to grant a relief from estate duty, similar to that granted by Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, in the domain of income-tax, for new public issues made for the promotion of Irish industry.  This section of the Bill provides that one-third of the value of any stocks, shares or securities issued after the passing of the Bill, and coming within the ambit of the section, will, in the case of an individual dying domiciled in the State, be excluded from account in the assessment of estate duty, provided the deceased person was the beneficial owner of the stocks, shares or securities continuously from the date of their original issue, or for a period of not <Col N="1334" /> less than three years immediately preceding the date of his death.</P>
    <P>Section 22 extends for a further period of three years the temporary exemption from corporation profits tax hitherto afforded to certain public utility concerns, such as railways, to building societies and to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Section 23 provides for the granting of initial allowances of 20 per cent. on capital expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1950, on the provision of new machinery or new plant, other than road vehicles, for the purpose of a trade, and to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Section 24 ensures that the initial allowance will be taken into account in computing the annual deductions allowable in respect of wear and tear, while Section 25 defines the &ldquo;basis period&rdquo; by reference to which the initial allowance is to be granted.</P>
    <P>Section 26 makes similar initial allowances to capital expenditure by professional men, assessable in respect of their professional incomes under Case II of Schedule D, and also by nurserymen and market gardeners, assessable under Rule 8 of Schedule B, who, unlike ordinary farmers, are chargeable on their full profits every year.  Section 27 enables a company to obtain an initial allowance for the purpose of corporation profits tax where it would be eligible for such in computing income-tax liability.  Section 28 is a mere construction section.</P>
    <P>Section 29 levies the stamp duty of £140,000 on the Racing Board in respect of the year ending 31st March, 1957.  This section requires a fresh Financial Resolution to be moved before the Committee Stage of the Bill, and takes the place of the provisions contained in Financial Resolution No. 9 passed on Budget day.  I would emphasise that the section is brought in in this form because the Racing Board feel it can be done better in this way.  However, there is no question of any diminution or any change in the amount that I was proposing to raise in this manner in the Budget proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides that the 25 per cent. rate of stamp duty shall no longer <Col N="1335" /> apply in the case of conveyances or transfers of property acquired for private residential purposes, so long as any land attached to the house does not exceed five acres in extent, and also property acquired exclusively for the purposes of an industry other than agriculture.</P>
    <P>Section 31 makes exactly the same provision in regard to leases.  Section 32 provides for the transfer, as announced in the Budget, of the sum of £500,000 in the Road Fund to the Capital Fund set up under a Schedule of the Central Fund Act of 1956.  I would stress in this respect that it is a transfer to the Capital Fund and not to ordinary current revenues.  Section 33 makes the usual arrangements in respect of borrowing for voted capital services.</P>
    <P>Section 34 enables the payment of interest on certain stocks of the E.S.B., of C.I.E., of local authorities to be paid without taxation.  The section provides that such stocks may be issued with either, or both, of the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that neither the capital nor the interest shall be liable to any taxation so long as it is shown that the stocks are in the beneficial ownership of persons who are neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the interest shall not be liable to income-tax so long as it is shown that the stocks are in the beneficial ownership of persons who, wherever their domicile, are not ordinarily resident here.</P>
    <P>Section 36 is the ordinary section which places the care and management of these taxes in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners, while Section 37 is the normal construction section.</P>

      <P>Since the Dáil debated the Budget proposals, Deputies on both sides of the House have had an opportunity of ascertaining the public reaction to them.  I think there are few who disagree with me when I say that the public were conditioned to expect tax increases.  The various <Col N="1336" /> statements which had been made by Ministers during the course of the year prior to the Budget had created a great deal of apprehension concerning the financial position and there were very few taxpayers who did not anticipate some increases in their burden following on the Budget.</P>
      <P>The public reaction to the proposals was directed far less, I think, to the actual tax increases themselves than to the circumstances surrounding the whole of the Budget position.  Indeed, the impression which I formed following discussions with representatives of various economic interests was that the public in the circumstances would have accepted the need for increasing taxes, if they could have discovered that there was any clear line of policy in the Government's actions, any idea in the mind of the Government concerning the steps required to repair the defects in the position, any expectation that effective action would be taken, or that in the course of time, because of the pursuit of definite plans, the national income could be expanded to meet the rising demands on it.</P>
      <P>The adverse public reaction to the whole of the Budget proposals was due, in my view, far more to the absence of an indication of policy on the Government's part than to the prospects of having to pay higher taxes. The slump which is developing in trade at the present time and the slump in public morale which, from a long term point of view, is even more serious, is less attributable to the actual Budget proposals themselves than to statements which were made by Ministers in connection with them.  I have in mind particularly the speech of the Taoiseach in the Budget debate and to the concluding speech of the Minister for Finance.  In neither speech was there any indication of policy, any clear indication that the Government are accepting their responsibilities and preparing to face up to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, and indeed most of the Deputies from the opposite benches who have spoken, appear to be entirely preoccupied with Party politics.  Their concern was to score petty debating <Col N="1337" /> points, to misrepresent the views of their opponents, to talk themselves out of the political penalties which their mismanagement of the country's business may involve for them, certainly not to give any leadership to the country or to those who control economic factors as to how they could cooperate in getting the country out of the jam into which the Government's incompetence has put it.</P>
    <P>The failure of our production to expand as the production of every European country is expanding, the recent recorded increase in unemployment notwithstanding the appalling situation revealed by the latest census report, the widening gap, which shows no sign yet of being rectified, in the country's balance of payments, all indicate that this country faces a crisis. It is a situation which calls for exceptional measures.  It is a situation which requires not merely an imaginative approach but dynamic action.  There is no sign that the country is likely to get them from the Government and the whole of the public reaction to the Budget derives from that fact.  The Minister for Finance was boasting in his Budget speech that the Government could be tough.  They are being tough in the wrong direction.  In so far as the problems of the country are concerned, the Government have shown an appalling weakness, a weakness which is itself contributing to the dimensions of these problems.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance spent a large part of their time trying to controvert some Press statements as to who was running the Government, whether it was the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party.  Nobody knows who is running the Government and the only indication anyone has is that the Government is just drifting along without any motive power whatever behind it.  Indeed, it would be a good thing for the country if either Fine Gael or the Labour Party decided to run the Government, because the Government might then get somewhere.</P>

That is a simple test which any Deputy can apply to himself.  I challenged any member of the Government and any supporter of the Government in the House to repeat here this year the speech he made last year.  I renew that challenge now and I say that, if any Deputy does that, he will appreciate at once the extraordinary deterioration in national conditions which has been brought about in a single year.</P>

      <P>The situation in this country at the present time requires that the people should be encouraged by a statement of policy or programme which may ultimately lead the country out of its present difficulties.  They need a programme which appears to them to have within it the possibilities of an improvement in national circumstances. A large part of the difficulties which are arising now, and are likely to become more acute this year, are due to psychological causes, to that feeling amongst the people that there is no leadership, that the Government of the day has no plan, that there is no conception of a programme which can result in an improvement of the situation.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputies opposite have had any recent contacts with their constituents but, if they had, I am sure they will have found that the prevailing mood amongst the people is, not despondency because difficulties have arisen, not despair because additional taxation is necessary, but gloom because there is no likelihood in prospect of an improvement of the position in the foreseeable future through any action of the Governemnt.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances prevailing now we can, with benefit to the country, modify our Party controversies. This is a situation in which, from a purely Party point of view, we might exult.  The Government which replaced us have proved to be incompetent and have made a mess of public affairs.  We might expect that to bring votes to our Party at some time.  But that is not good enough.  For some time to come the management of the nation's business will repose in the hands of the men who now constitute the Government.  Even if they have, in their short time, done a great deal of damage, in the time immediately ahead of us they can do a great deal more&mdash; far more than any subsequent Government, no matter how competent, may be able to repair for many years.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, our duty as we see it, Deputies in Opposition, to urge upon the Government that they should do something now to prevent any further deterioration in the situation. We ask them even to tell us what they think can be done, to give some revelation of their minds, some indication of the possibilities which they are discussing between themselves.  As I say, the speeches which we got on the Budget debate reveal one thing only&mdash; an excessive preoccupation with Party politics and no realisation of the responsibilities which attach legally and morally to those who form the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is at least a suggestion. I go further and I say that, if the Government can bring before the <Col N="1342" /> Dáil any practical proposal for an improvement of the situation now prevailing or even a proposal which would be effective in preventing a further deterioration in that situation, we will examine it on its merits without regard to political considerations and support it fully if it appears to us to be sound. All we ask from the Government is that, irrespective of whether they do it in a partisan way or in a constructive way, they will bring to the Dáil some series of proposals to arrest the decline which is now going on in our national circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance promised, when concluding the debate on the Budget, that the report of the Committee on the Taxation of Industry would be circulated before the Finance Bill.  He fulfilled that undertaking by a short head.  The report came to members of the Dáil some hours before the text of the Finance Bill, and no Deputy has yet had the opportunity of considering it in detail, much less of arriving at conclusions on many of their observations and recommendations. At first sight, the report reveals one of the extraordinary weaknesses affecting the administration of Government here&mdash;the inadequacy of the statistical data available to those who have the responsibility for the formulation of policy or for making recommendations regarding policy.  Even where statistical data is procurable, it is published very belatedly.  No doubt, there is in that report information which was not previously available, but it is information relating to the year 1954 and earlier years.  The Central Statistics Office is probably doing as good a job as possible with the resources available to it, but it certainly would make the business of Government a great deal easier, and the results of Government more beneficial, if the statistical services could be expanded so that the information which is available to us in respect of periods three, four or five years ago could be furnished for more recent periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people who will read that report and the recommendations contained in it, will, I think, feel that <Col N="1343" /> they are totally inadequate in relation to our present position.  In the minority report, signed by Lord Glenavy, that comment is made: that the recommendations in the report and the observations of the committee underestimate the present need for stimulating productive energies.  I think the most interesting and stimulating part of the whole document is Lord Glenavy's minority report, and even if Deputies do not feel like ploughing through the mass of statistics contained in the main document, I would urge them to read that part of the document.  One does not have to agree with all the views expressed by Lord Glenavy in order to benefit from the reading of it.  It is a useful thing that that report of Lord Glenavy on the situation was published.  He certainly showed an ability to approach the requirements of the present situation comprehensively which appears to be lacking in the main report.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps unfair to criticise the committee because of the nature of their report.  They were set up in 1953, to consider the extent to which taxation in 1953 was a deterrent to the modernisation and extension of industry. They based their examination of that question upon the statistical data available to them, which related in the main to 1953 and earlier years.  It is very probable that they had completed their work on the preparation of the report and decided upon their recommendations before the present crisis in our national affairs had developed. The committee were not obliged by their terms of reference to consider or make recommendations on the exceptional measures which are now needed to break the production deadlock and to get our national output expanding at the rate we need to survive as an economic entity.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Budget, I expressed my view that the issue at stake in these debates in the Dáil now is the survival of this business organisation which we call the Irish State.  Deputies opposite scoffed at that suggestion, but I think nobody who studies the facts, and who notices the various indications of the trend of events which <Col N="1344" /> are available to us, can fail to recognise that we are indeed approaching a stage at which exceptional measures will be needed in order to ensure our survival; and if that is so, then we have got to be thinking in terms of exceptional measures and not of merely patching up the tax code in the manner recommended or considered by the committee.</P>
    <P>The duty of the Government at the present time is to examine the stimuli needed in order to get that very great expansion of our production which, from every aspect of our national position, is needed.  I recognise that the main prospect of a rapid and substantial increase in production lies in agriculture and the House has recently been debating the administration of the Department of Agriculture, on the Estimates.  As usual in the case of agriculture, there was a variety of views as to how the problem of expanding agricultural production should be approached.  Wherever wisdom lies, we must recognise the fact that the measures now being tried have failed. We are the only country in the world, as far as I can discover, which has failed to record an increase in agricultural output in 1955.  It is clear, therefore, that there is something wrong in the present approach to the problem of expanding agricultural production, and if the Government will start off from that basis and re-examine their policies in the light of the fact that they have proved ineffective, then they may approach nearer to a workable programme affecting that aspect of our problem.</P>
    <P>I have, perhaps, more experience in relation to industry, and indeed latterly, I have had the opportunity of debating with the management of a number of industrial firms, which, in my view had within them export possibilities, as to the reasons why these possibilities were not being explored or acted upon.  I found that the main deterrents operating in the minds of those who control these firms to embarking upon the exploration of export markets were threefold: one was the difficulty in securing the necessary capital for the expansion of their operations; secondly, there was fear of <Col N="1345" /> the very considerable risks involved in any substantial participation in export trade&mdash;risks to which Irish industrial managements are not very accustomed &mdash;and thirdly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The risk of investing a considerable amount of money in developing an export trade and then not getting the trade&mdash;the ordinary commercial risk that anybody going into business must face which is obviously far greater in competitive international markets than it is in the protected home market.  Thirdly, there was the fact that the profit to be earned in the export market, in relation to the capital required for the development of export trade, was substantially smaller than was needed to attract them.</P>
      <P>Some of these problems are, I admit, more the immediate concern of the Minister for Industry and Commerce than of the Minister for Finance, and I may perhaps elaborate my views on them when the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce is under consideration here.  But it seems to me that if there is to be an organised effort to expand our meagre exports of manufactured goods the reality of these problems has got to be faced: the difficulty of Irish manufacturers in securing capital for the expansion of their activities, their reluctance to face the considerable risks involved in export trade and, thirdly, their inability to earn, in export trade, profits which appear attractive to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report of the Committee on Industrial Taxation shows in a very definite way the capital problems to which I have referred.  Only a minority <Col N="1346" /> of our manufacturers have got access to the very limited capital market we have in this country, and there are very few Deputies here who would think that an industrial concern proposing to embark into export trade and requiring additional capital for that purpose would be successful in securing public subscription of the capital required.  Indeed, even a new firm proposing to engage in production for the protected home market or an existing firm proposing to expand its activities in the protected home market would have difficulty in getting capital by public subscription at the present time.  The difficulty is obviously much greater when the capital expansion is designed to finance more speculative export business.  Whether it is done by an adjustment of taxation arrangements or whether it requires an extension of the resources and the powers of the Industrial Credit Company, or whether there is some other method, I do not think it is possible to get any substantial expansion in industrial production for export without making capital for that purpose more readily available than it is at present to industrial companies.</P>
    <P>So far as the risks are concerned, the difficulties may not, in the event, prove to be as great as the management of these firms now think they are. Most of our newer industries have grown up in the protected home market and they have planned their expansions in the past only when they could see the certainty of the market for the additional goods they proposed to produce and the possibility of selling them at a profit.  The Commission on Emigration made a recommendation that there should be set up a co-operative exporting organisation designed to give assistance to private firms entering or wishing to enter the export market and to combine the productive strength of these firms so that they could enter the export market with a sufficient impact to secure permanency there.</P>
    <P>That recommendation of the Commission on Emigration has been accepted in principle by the Party on this side of the House.  Indeed we ourselves at one time had contemplated <Col N="1347" /> the establishment of an organisation of that kind and the Government sanction for the necessary legislation had been secured.  It was not proceeded with then because the need was not particularly acute, but few will deny the acuteness of our present need, the urgent need for action to secure this expansion of production and expansion of exports.</P>
    <P>So far as the third factor affecting the attitude of our manufacturers to export is concerned, namely, the rather meagre profits that can be earned in export business, I can see no way of meeting that point except along the lines suggested by the Irish Exporters' Association to this commission, that is, by a preferential remission of taxation on profits earned in export business. The Minister for Finance referred to that part of the commission's report where they dealt with that point.  The astonishing thing is that the commission did not really deal with it at all. They got this recommendation from the Irish Exporters' Association and in their report they did nothing except print an extract from a memorandum which they got from the Revenue Commissioners regarding it.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the members of the committee may have considered the proposal but they have not in their report done more than endorse a very superficial comment on the proposal submitted to the committee by the Revenue Commissioners. Apparently the Revenue Commissioners said the proposal would violate the basic principles of income taxation.</P>
    <P>What are the basic principles of income taxation?  Is it that there should be no discrimination, with economic objectives in view, between particular forms of income, that all income, no matter how derived, should be subject to the same taxation and that economic objectives are not sufficient to justify discrimination in taxation between different citizens or different forms of revenue?  It would be strange if these basic principles of income taxation were relied upon by the Government to justify the rejection of that proposal in a year in which the Minister for Finance himself <Col N="1348" /> brought in here a proposal to provide for discriminatory taxation in favour of certain mining companies.  When that Bill was presented to this House I made it quite clear that, so far as we were concerned, we did not object to the principle of the discriminatory use of taxation in special circumstances to achieve economic aims.</P>
    <P>I criticised the particular proposals in the Bill but there was no opposition to those proposals on the issue of the basic principles of income taxation.  I think the Government is fully justified in adjusting its taxation measures so as to induce economic objectives which will serve the national welfare, and in circumstances like those now existing, in which the survival of this State as a business organisation is at issue, then the use of taxation, if it will help to that end, cannot be questioned.  But what are the arguments put forward by the Revenue Commissioners?  They say that a company set up here to make goods previously imported is making the same contribution to a reduction of the gap in the balance of payments as a company set up to make goods for export.  A company which is set up here to make goods previously imported in 99 cases out of 100 has the assistance of protection.  It is getting from the community a far more effective form of help, a far more effective assurance that they will be permitted to make profits than is involved in any taxation changes.</P>
    <P>Often in the past, I have had to defend that policy of protection here and admit that under it the public were being asked to subsidise in prices industrial projects in the earlier stages of their development, believing that in the long-term the community as a whole would benefit.  If we had not the power to protect our industries, if we were in the same situation as they are in Belfast of having to try to promote industrial development without the power of protecting it then we might resort to taxation relief or outright subsidy, but here we have not had to use those devices except in the specific matter of encouraging industrial development in the West and therefore that question does not arise in this connection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> But we have need to expand production for export.  Indeed, the Committee on Industrial Taxation itself recognised that we are nearing the end of industrial expansion based upon the home market and that if there is to be a further and significant increase of industrial output and of employment given in the manufacturing industries it has to be through the development of industries for export, and if there is any prospect that we can stimulate that development by a suitable adjustment of taxation on profits earned in the export trade, then it is worth considering. Other countries have tried it.  I think it is true to say that the majority of countries in Western Europe have in operation at the present time, discriminatory tax arrangements designed to benefit exports, and they do not consider they are violating basic principles of income taxation in so doing.  They approach the problem as a practical one to be solved by practical methods, and our much more acute problem must be approached in the same way.</P>
    <P>There is a further argument that as we have an item on the credit side of our international balance of payments, in our receipts for tourism, that hoteliers might look for the same concession. I do not know whether tourists come here because of our hotels or, as has been said, in spite of them.  That is a question we have argued in the past, but it is certainly not the hotels alone that bring them here and to that extent the argument is fallacious.  But I think the hoteliers have a legitimate complaint against the operation of the present tax code. There is no doubt that tourism is a most important item on the credit side of our balance of payments.  I think it is the second largest economic activity carried on in this country and we could expand it, I am sure, a great deal more and make it of greater importance than it is.  But why does the hotelier not qualify for a depreciation allowance on his hotel just as the owner of industrial buildings is now being recommended for a depreciation allowance?  Is not the wear and tear on furniture in a hotel just as important an item in the accounts of the hotel proprietor as the wear and tear <Col N="1350" /> of machinery in the manufacturing industry?  Far be it from me to argue that the volume of the tourist trade cannot be stimulated by a suitable adjustment of taxation also.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the Committee on Industrial Taxation failed in the task that they were given to do in so far as they did not tell us their own views upon this proposal advocated by the Irish Exporters' Association and advocated from this side of the House during the course of the Budget debate that there should be an inducement held out to firms in this country to enter into export business, through a reduction in the income-tax on the profits earned on that business.  We can parade our principles of taxation as a justification for doing nothing: we can rely on various excuses to justify inactivity, but something has to be done whether through one method or another.  This country has got to bring about in the near future a very substantial increase in production and an equally substantial increase in exports.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for commissions, committees or Ministers to come and tell us what cannot be done if they will not tell us in their view what can be done.  In my experience&mdash;and I have checked that experience, as I said, recently by contact with the people in charge of industrial projects that are capable of doing export business in the sense that they are producing goods of a quality and at a price which appear to me to be comparable with goods on sale in foreign countries&mdash;I found that there were three main factors holding them back: in some cases inability to get the capital required for the expansion of their activities; hesitation about embarking upon that new capital liability because of the greater risks involved in the export trade and thirdly, the lack of inducement such as this tax concession would give.  I feel quite certain, knowing the mentality of many of these people, that if there was held out a prospect of relief of tax in accordance with some sliding scale on profits earned on exports that it would have a very considerable influence upon their decisions in that connection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> The committee say in their report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are doubtful, however, if income taxation provides the most suitable channel for concessions of this nature and we agree that aids to the development of industrial exports should be the function of some Department other than the Revenue Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For myself I have little doubt that an adjustment of income taxation would be a very effective stimulus to industrial producers to go into exports and if the Government do not agree with that, then it is for some other Department to come forward and say what alternative measures they are proposing to take.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any adjustment of taxation to secure economic results need necessarily be permanent. Economic conditions change from time to time and the taxation system must change with them, and the proposals which I am advocating now here, the point of view I am urging, relate solely to the circumstances existing now and particularly to the urgency of our need to get an increase in production and increase in exports.</P>
    <P>However, let us take the recommendations made by the committee as they stand.  They recommend that there should be an increase in basic wear and tear allowances of 25 per cent. on industrial plant and equipment and that there should be introduced an initial allowance of 20 per cent., and that so far as industrial buildings are concerned there should be a depreciation allowance in their case also, with a 10 per cent. initial allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adopted in advance of the publication of the committee's report and embodied in this Bill, a recommendation for the introduction of an initial allowance on plant and machinery.  I think that he would help considerably to secure amongst those who are in charge of the industries of the country an attitude of mind which will encourage them to expand if he will say now that the other recommendations of the committee will also be adopted, even if they are not implemented <Col N="1352" /> until the 1957 Finance Act. If he is not prepared to say it now, he should think of the desirability of saying it soon because the mere announcement of the Government's intention to give effect to the whole of the recommendations of the committee would itself have a stimulating effect. Certainly, I urge that the decision on these recommendations should not be postponed until the Budget of next year.  There is no question of any cost involved.  Even the adoption of the one recommendation concerning the introduction of an initial allowance on machinery involves no cost to the Exchequer in this year.</P>
    <P>I see that the Local Government Officials' Trade Union has urged that the recommendation be not adopted at all until the whole tax code has been submitted to examination.  I hope the Minister will tell the Local Government Officials' Union or any other officials' union that the ability of this community to keep on paying the salaries of officials in their present number will depend entirely upon the effectiveness of the measures that may be adopted this year to secure the expansion of production required to rectify our balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one aspect of the proposal as set out in Section 23 of the Bill to which I want to refer.  The section provides that the initial allowance will be one-fifth of the expenditure incurred after the 6th April, 1956, by any person upon plant and machinery and for the purposes of the section the expenditure is deemed to be incurred on the day when the sum in question becomes payable.</P>
    <P>I do not know why that particular form was adopted in the section.  It is a departure from all the principles upon which the calculation of wear and tear allowance was based in the past. Under the existing regulations of the Revenue Commissioners, the wear and tear allowance begins to be calculated only from the day on which the plant or machine goes into productive use. It does not matter when it is paid for or if it is never paid for or how long <Col N="1353" /> the plant may have been lying idle although installed in the workshop, it is from the day it goes into productive use that the wear and tear allowance is calculated and this introduction of the day upon which the plant is paid for as the critical date seems to me to be an important innovation in our tax code and a very undesirable innovation. I do not know what the Minister has in mind in that regard.  What does he mean by the term, &ldquo;the day upon which the sum in question becomes payable&rdquo;?  Will there not be innumerable legal cases taken to the law courts to determine the meaning of that phrase?  When does the sum due in respect of a new machine purchased by a manufacturer become payable?  Is it payable on the date on which he orders the machine or is it payable on the date on which he completes the payment for it?</P>
    <P>In the great majority of cases that I know of any substantial outlay on industrial plant involves payments spread over a period of time.  It is not unusual that an instalment has to be paid on the placing of the order, a further instalment paid on the completion of the plant in the manufacturer's workshop and a further instalment after the plant has been erected or perhaps even after it has been in use for some months in the factory of the purchaser.  When is the sum payable? From what date will the initial allowance be calculated?</P>
    <P>A number of firms who are interested in this proposal have been bringing their difficulties to me.  I am sure some have been brought to the Department of Finance also.  I have personal knowledge of one case where a contract has been made for the purchase of a substantial amount of plant for a new factory on terms which will not involve payment for that plant for three years. The plant will be in use, however, and the ordinary wear and tear allowance will be made in respect of that plant from the day it comes into use.  Will the initial allowance in this case not be made until the final payment for that plant is made, long after it has gone into use, or is it to be made on the day on which the plant is introduced?</P>

      <P>The supplier agreed that he would accept payment for the plant three years after it has been installed&mdash;or some period.  There is another case where an important firm that I know of has incurred very substantial expenditure upon new plant. It incurred that expenditure in the first quarter of this year but, in fact, the plant, although erected in the factory, did not commence to operate until a date after the 6th April and, so far as I read this provision, there is therefore no prospect that that firm can ever get the initial allowance at all even though the plant did not begin to operate before 6th April and even though the ordinary wear and tear allowance was not due until a date after the 6th April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Accelerated.  The assistance that that gives to industry <Col N="1355" /> is that it makes available during the first year liquid resources that can be used for capital purposes.  That is the advantage of the initial allowance, that it improves the liquid position of an industry that is expanding and it is the industries that are expanding that we want to help.  I do not know what the Minister had in mind.  That was the argument used for the allowance in the British Royal Commission's Report and it seems to me the only solid ground for giving it.  The advantage to the firm is solely that it gets in the first year, the year in which it is incurring the expenditure, an accession of funds it would not otherwise have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the purpose of that?  Is it not to provide in that way an incentive to get new machinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is when a firm is expanding its activity that it runs into the difficulty of having available funds to finance the expansion and in many cases, as indeed in the particular case I mentioned, the rate of expansion is determined by the rate at which funds become available.  In the particular case which I have in mind, the acquisition of the plant in question was only one part of a development plan which involves considerable expenditure over years to come, expenditure which will be undertaken as resources become available for the purpose and one of the advantages of giving them the initial allowance is that it makes resources available earlier.  It does not cost the Exchequer a penny in the long run.</P>
      <P>I will admit that, if the Minister has brought in this proposal in a form which means there will be no charge on the Exchequer this year and if he makes the application retrospective in any way, it may involve a charge in this year but I think he should understand that it is these firms that are prepared to take the chance of expanding, of incurring heavy capital outlay in modernising their plant, that are striving to get on to that basis of cost which will enable them to export, that require encouragement and help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point of view which <Col N="1356" /> I would ask the Minister to consider. This problem has been emphasised more by those who are concerned in the presentation of accounts to the Revenue Commissioners than by those concerned in the actual operation of industry.  The phrase in the Bill is: &ldquo;Where on or after the 6th April expenditure is incurred on new plant&rdquo;. The Minister should at least make that: &ldquo;Where expenditure is incurred in an accounting period ending after the 6th April&rdquo;.  Otherwise there will be interminable arguments between firms of auditors and the Revenue Commissioners as to when expenditure on the purchase of machinery was undertaken. Surely, from the Minister's point of view, it is just the same to have the simple provision that where expenditure was incurred in an accounting period ended after the 6th April the initial allowance will be paid?  It will cost nothing in this year so far as financial results are concerned.  One arrangement is exactly the same as the other in that respect.  It is better to give that wider significance to the terms of the Bill than to create this prospect of continuous and fruitless argument with the Revenue Commissioners on the issue as to whether expenditure on a machine was undertaken on the 4th or the 7th of April.  In the long run, it is just the same to the Minister and it would be far better for those who have responsibility for managing the accounts of industrial firms.</P>
    <P>In his Budget speech the Minister announced&mdash;and this Bill implements the announcement&mdash;that, as an inducement to saving, the first £25 income from certain forms of saving will be free of income-tax.  The person who saves in a particular way by depositing his money in a trustee savings bank or in the Post Office Savings Bank or with a commercial bank gets that concession. Why is saving in that way picked out for that benefit when savings in other forms are denied it?  Has the Minister any objection to people investing their money in Government loans?  Is it not just as important to encourage people to save their money by investing in Government loans as it is to encourage them to save their money by way of deposit at a bank?  I <Col N="1357" /> cannot understand why that tax concession, small as it is, is not extended to all forms of saving that the State may desire to encourage such as investing in Government loans or in a building society.  I cannot understand why a person who puts his money on deposit with a building society should not be regarded as contributing as much to the total of national savings as a person who puts money on deposit in a trustee savings bank.  I urge the Minister to extend that concession to cover at least investment in Government loans and deposits with a building society.  If he is not prepared to do that he should make a statement to the House giving his reasons as it is very difficult to understand what they might be.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the proposal relating to Section 7 of the 1932 Act. I suppose he is technically right that the relief is not given by way of a refund of tax.  It is done by way of offsetting in respect of the total tax payable by an individual but the individual has to make an individual application to get that offset.  I do not understand why it is that the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners do not adopt my suggestion and provide that the relief should be given in the form of a reduction in the amount of tax payable so that the investor in the shares of an Irish company will get his dividend less the reduced amount of tax, not the full amount.  I suspect that the reason why there might be opposition from the Revenue Commissioners to that proposal might be that everybody would get that relief which the 1932 Act intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the reason, the section has been ineffective.  The statistics I gave on the Report Stage&mdash; the statistics which are, in fact, supplemented and reinforced by certain statistics which appear in this committee's report&mdash;show that only a proportion of the companies qualified for relief sought certification and of the shareholders of these companies not more than 10 per cent. can have made application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy forgets that it is the individual taxpayer and not corporate entities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My calculation is that if everybody availed of the provision in the 1932 Act it would cost the Exchequer £20,000 a year.  In fact this cost £7,500.  Somebody must explain why it is not costing more.  The only explanation is that the people are not getting the relief.  The only difficulty I see in doing it my way is that the section of the 1932 Act confines the relief to companies so constituted that they can operate without a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act and the relief is not available to anybody not resident in this country.  Why these limitations should be maintained, I do not know.  We know that at present Government policy is very largely based upon inducing foreign companies to operate industries here.  If that is to be the policy, it is logical that this tax concession should apply to all investment in Irish industry from this date onwards.  The whole process could be simplified.  It needs merely to provide that the standard rate of tax deductible from the dividends paid by these companies will be reduced by 20 per cent. in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the effect of that not be that the corporate holders would get the benefit whereas individual holders get it now?  If the company <Col N="1359" /> owns the shares, and not individuals, it is not at present entitled to relief.  That is where the discrepancy between the two figures arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the policy of the Government to induce people to invest in Irish industrial concerns in preference to foreign industrial concerns, then this inducement must be something they will know of and it must be sufficient to influence their decisions.  Indeed, I was astonished to find the high proportion of people actually engaged in stock market operations in this country who never knew of that section of the 1932 Act.  The Minister now proposes that, after this date, shares that may be issued by these companies will count only two-thirds of their value when being assessed for death duty purposes.  Why bring in this complication?  Why complicate that by confining the concession to shares issued after this date? It means that every company in the country which issues shares in the future has in some way to designate them so as to distinguish between them and shares issued before this date.  I am quite certain that its application in that form will mean that that section of this Finance Act will become almost as ineffective as the corresponding section of the 1932 Act.  If these are intended to be inducements to people to invest in Irish productive enterprises, then could not these inducements have been framed in a form which will be clearly recognised and involve little difficulty to those who have to take the supplementary steps to make them real?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister to take out of that section the limitation that that concession will only apply in respect of shares issued after this date. Take, for instance, a company which has an authorised capital of £200,000, £175,000 of which has been issued, the other £25,000 to be issued as additional capital is required on the extension of the business.  That company in the ordinary course would offer the £25,000 to the existing shareholders to be taken up by them but now the company has to go through some process <Col N="1360" /> that will enable that additional £25,000 shares to be segregated and distinguished from the original shares. As a concession, it is very slight, and the Minister should have gone on to say that so far as people who in the past invested in Irish industries are concerned&mdash;and they are the people who have to be mainly relied on to get capital for industrial expansion in the future&mdash;that they will get the benefit of that section equally with those who may come in now in respect of future issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, no doubt, received many representations concerning the dance tax.  I have, at any rate.  But I presume there is no possibility of getting the Minister to drop this stupid proposal altogether, because I regard it solely as a political decision and certainly of little significance in relation to the Budget.  That tax is going to cost him more to collect and to prevent evasion than he will get from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised in the Budget debate the question of exemption of dances held for charitable purposes. The Minister assured me that dances for charitable purposes would be excluded, but the exclusions are granted under regulations which often prevent them from becoming effective.  One of the regulations is that the expenses of the dance must not exceed 50 per cent. of the takings.  If they exceed 50 per cent., then the duty becomes payable. Perhaps if I read an extract from a letter, it will indicate part of the problem in this regard:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All the functions in our hall are in aid of the parish church and the school building fund and this regulation will apply to our dances, but our big difficulty is that we are limited to 12 o'clock dances.  Indeed, most charitable dances are very likely to be in the same position, as they are invariably sponsored by bodies or priests who must observe the Bishop's wishes in regard to 12 o'clock dances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to explain that dance bands will insist on getting the same fee for dances running from 8 to 12 as from 10 to 2, and that if they have to <Col N="1361" /> restrict the amount they will pay the band in order to keep within the 50 per cent. regulation, they will not get good bands.  The good bands will go to competing halls, six miles outside the town, which are exempt from tax and also apparently from observing the Bishop's wishes in regard to the hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not go into that aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is urged that that condition should be removed, that is, that so long as the Minister is satisfied that the whole of the proceeds are bona fide going to the prescribed charities, and the function is organised for the purpose of charity&mdash;that particular society whose letter I read is a very well known society and nobody can question the bona fides of the promoters of these dances&mdash;the exemption should operate.  If the Minister is not prepared to remove this condition entirely, and merely prescribe that the whole net proceeds must go to charity, he should consider, in the circumstances now prevailing, the question of raising the limit from 50 to 60 or 75 per cent.  It seems fairly clear from the information given to me that those societies and organisations running dances under these limitations for charitable purposes will not be able to compete with the commercial dance halls, and may have to cease their operations.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he was modifying his proposal with regard to the levy on race course betting, but that the alteration in his proposal did not involve any reduction in the revenue which he anticipated from that source.  I want to be clear about this. The Minister stated in the Budget speech that in respect of the tax upon bets by the stamp duty on race course bets and increases in the charges on bets in betting shops, he would get in £290,000, but he is now talking about £140,000 from the Racing Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Starting price bets will bring in £150,000?  Again I want to urge that even though the Racing <Col N="1362" /> Board may have accepted the Minister's decision subject to the modification of the arrangement he has announced, this is a foolish step to take. I do not know if the Minister saw the comment on it in the <i>Financial Times.</i> It was a very striking comment.  The writer described this tax as the equivalent of an industrialist selling his tools to provide working expenses. While there were times when that business could have supported a higher levy, because conditions were very good in the business, those times have passed now, and indeed, it is almost certain that there would have been a very considerable contraction in the Racing Board's income this year anyhow.</P>

      <P>I am not going to try to persuade the Minister further except to say that this proposal is imposed contrary to the assurance, if not expressed, at least implied, in the statement by the Government of the day that the organised machinery of the Racing Board would never be used for the purpose of raising revenue for this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill the Dáil is being asked to confirm the special import levies announced by the Minister in March last.  I do not know if there is any prospect of getting the Minister to reconsider the incidence of many of these levies having regard to experience of them in their short operation, but I think the Minister and the Government as a whole made a very serious mistake at that time in implementing those decisions in regard to the special levies and restrictions on hire purchase facilities without consulting with the business interests concerned. If the aim of these special levies was to reduce imports, and not to bring in revenue, if the primary purpose <Col N="1363" /> was to bring about a contraction in the volume of imports so that the balance of payments gap would be narrowed, the Minister could have got that result in a way which would have involved far less difficulty for the traders concerned and far less unemployment in their workshops.  I am certain, for example, that if the Minister had called together the assemblers of motor vehicles, and said to them that, in the interests of reducing the adverse trade gap, it was desirable to cut down motor-car imports this year by 20 per cent. or by 25 per cent., he would have got their wholehearted co-operation. The primary aim of the Government would have been secured in a way which would have involved far less difficulty for the traders concerned. I do not know if the Minister fully appreciates the effect of imposing a tax upon goods and making at the time it is imposed an announcement that the tax is temporary and will come off at the discretion of the Government at any time.  The effect is to keep trade in these goods to the very minimum.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening in the case of motor vehicles.  It is not the additional levy which is the main cause of the difficulty nor is it the rise in prices which the levy involves, but it is the expectation in the public mind that that levy will come off some time and, consequently, there are many individual decisions to wait until next year to buy the new car instead of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently published a statement to the effect that the levy will not come off in the immediate future.  That was of some help but it was not definite enough to eradicate from the public mind the idea that there is some advantage in postponing the purchase until later.  If the Minister had sought the voluntary co-operation of the importers in the reduction of imports or had imposed quantitative restrictions to the same effect the public attitude would have been completely different and the effect on trade and employment would have been a great deal less serious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I see that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has modified the more stupid provisions of the Order relating to restrictions on hire purchase facilities.  There was some sense in imposing restrictions upon hire purchase facilities when these facilities were used for the importation of manufactured goods from abroad.  What sense was in applying these restrictions to goods such as clothing that are almost entirely home manufactured, I could never see.  Not merely were the restrictions applied to home produced clothing but imposed far more severely on these articles than on the articles imported completely manufactured from abroad.  That has been rectified to some extent.  There were other mistakes made that time which are now becoming apparent.  I hope the Minister will avail of the Committee Stage of this Bill on the appropriate section to state that the effect of these special levies will be considered and that the necessary alterations to minimise their more undesirable consequences will be made.</P>
    <P>We are also asked in this Bill to confirm the decision to take £500,000 from the Road Fund.  There are some Deputies here who remember the uproarious debates which took place in 1953 when the previous Government came to the House with a Bill to alter the road vehicle taxes in order to expand the Road Fund revenue and even though it was impossible to deny that the maintenance of the normal volume of work on the roads involved a considerable increase in expenditure, Deputies now in the Government or supporting the Government opposed that measure and explicitly undertook to revoke it when they got the power and reduce the road taxes upon motor vehicles to the pre-1953 levels.</P>
    <P>They have not done so.  Indeed, last year they took to themselves the credit, such credit as they could gather, because expenditure on road maintenance work was greater than it had been in previous years by reason of the higher revenue which these additional taxes brought in but it is rubbing salt into the public wounds when the Government decides to keep these taxes in force and devote the <Col N="1365" /> money intended for the improvement of the roads, to the purposes of the Exchequer.  Is it intended that any part of the National Development Fund this year will be used on the roads?  A substantial proportion&mdash;far the greater part of the total expenditure in the past&mdash;went on the roads.  It would be the height of folly to take that £500,000 out of the Road Fund into the Exchequer and then take it out of the Exchequer to spend it on the roads through the National Development Fund.  That is what I think the Government intends to do.</P>

We recognise there must be a Finance Bill, but we are opposed to almost every section of it and we will make that opposition abundantly clear when we get to the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech we have just heard from Deputy Lemass dealing with the matters included in this Finance Bill has been somewhat astounding.  I must confess that there are times when I find it difficult to understand how Deputy Lemass can take the line that everything everybody else does is political, the Deputy being the person who, perhaps more than anybody else, has utilised the time of this House for Party political purposes at one time or another.  I do not propose to follow him down the Party line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Finance Bill is to implement the proposals that were put to the House and the country in the Budget.  The purpose of those proposals and the theme on which they were based are ones of which Deputy Lemass, as he has shown in his <Col N="1366" /> remarks, makes no criticism.  It is essential that in our present circumstances we should make certain, in so far as we can, there will be no deficit on current account.  This Budget and this Finance Bill ensure that that will be so.  If Deputy Lemass wants to accept the proposal&mdash;to be fair to him, I think he does&mdash;that there should not be a deficit on current account, then, when he is opposing any section of this Bill on Committee Stage, it will be equally incumbent on him to ensure that his opposition will provide other means of balancing on current account the expenditure requirements of the State.</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  Either we ensure that we do balance our current account or we do not.  The proposals the Government have brought in in this Bill for the purpose of ensuring that we do balance are based primarily on the theme that less essential forms of spending and imports should be first to take the charge.  I do not think, no matter what Deputy Lemass may say, there has been any criticism of that theme throughout the country.  The country as a whole has accepted that it was correct for the Government to look to those two sources for the necessary funds to balance our accounts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass to-day also made references to the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Taxation on Industry and to other aspects of production, particularly for export.  I think the Deputy is wrong when he endeavours to stress the need of production solely for export.  What we want to do here is to increase our total production. If we increased total production, that of itself would provide the additional productive capacity for export. I think it is far better to go for an increase in total production, with the inevitable resultant exports, rather than concentrate on production for export alone to the exclusion of incentives for production for home purposes as well.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the introduction of an initial allowance this year is to provide an incentive to those engaged in industry to install new machinery.  With the installation of new machinery, it will be possible for those engaged in <Col N="1367" /> industry to produce more and to pro duce it more efficiently.  If they are able to produce it more efficiently, that will enable, them better to compete in the export market.  It will enable them also to assist in the matter of home costs.  Our aim and our object should be to improve total over-all production in the knowledge that, so far as home consumption is concerned, that is likely to be more or less static.  Therefore, the more production we have, the more we will have to export.  If we can produce more efficiently, as new machinery will enable us to do, then we will have commodities available for export at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I found some difficulty in deciding the point at which the allowance for new machinery should be introduced.  I went back to what I have just said&mdash;that the primary purpose of it was to provide the incentive. If that is so, then it does not seem that one is providing that incentive by going back and giving the allowance retrospectively.  It is towards the future we should look in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the date at which the machinery starts to work and not the date on which it was installed that is the important thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the important thing is that we should endeavour to induce as many of our manufacturers as possible in the future to order, to bring in, to install and to pay for as much new machinery as they can.  I think the Deputy will agree with me that anyone who brought in new machinery heretofore did not bring it in with the idea in their minds that they were going to get an initial allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that no additions to the machinery in any factory will be made this year which had not been decided on before this Bill was introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy interrupted me in one point I was about to make.  I was about to pay a tribute to the industrialists who have already ordered new machinery.  The fact that <Col N="1368" /> they did so, that they were go-ahead in placing that order in 1948, 1949, 1953 or in any other year is a good thing for the country.  What I want to do by this initial allowance is to provide an incentive to ensure that more people will put in more new machinery in the future.  The way in which that incentive can operate is in the manner in which the Bill has been drafted as now before the House.  I can, as I have said, sympathise with a certain feeling of hard luck, if one likes to use the phrase in the case of those who have already put in machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>

I think the Deputy will agree with me, if he knows anything about wear and tear allowances&mdash;I feel quite certain he does&mdash;that this is such a complicated matter it cannot adequately be dealt with by means of question and answer across the floor of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is not altogether accurate in his interpretation of the regulations in that respect.  He has suggested that the British, following their Royal Commission, provided what he is recommending. That is not so.  I have been telling the Deputy what the effective action in this respect should be.  I admit it must be a matter of opinion, in the final analysis.  I do not accept the Deputy's view that there will be great difficulty about the date on which the expenditure is payable.  I certainly <Col N="1369" /> am prepared to consider the drafting of amendments, if there is any doubt on that score.  We all want to ensure that, in all legislation, particularly under the revenue code, there is as much certainty as possible in the actual words used in the Bill.  I do not think there is the doubt here that the Deputy suggests.  However, I promise to have the matter looked into.  As I said earlier, this is more a Committee than a Second Stage Bill and Deputy Lemass said the Opposition agreed with that analysis.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to me that there is any point in my elucidating further any details on specific points to which the Deputy referred.  We will have another opportunity of dealing with the Bill in that respect.  I want, however, to stress this: Deputy Lemass has always been a person who believes in announcing grandiose plans which may never come to fruition and suggesting that they, in themselves, will do the job.  They do not.  The effect of many of the announcements of the grandiose nature, for which the Deputy has a penchant, has been to retard rather than intensify production.  I believe that methods designed at really doing the task, such as the Mining Bill to which the Deputy referred&mdash;incidentally, I did not think the Deputy would be very anxious to refer to that debate considering the prophecies he made then, which have since been shown to be incorrect, in regard to the prices of certain metals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They will go up again. That is another prophecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>My views were more correct than the Deputy's in that respect. It is in relation to the actual things that are done, like the Mining Bill to assist new mining operations here, and it is in relation to doing things, like introducing the initial allowance, that real aid can be given to production.  It is in respect of doing things, like introducing the provision for freeing the first £25 of certain interest for savings purposes, that new savings can be assisted.  That is much better than grandiose propaganda in relation to which I could not hope to compete with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who are members of local bodies who rise to speak on this Estimate must bear in mind the implications that lie behind the withdrawal of the grant in respect of the improvement of main roads. How will that affect local authorities? The main impact of that withdrawal will not be felt until local authorities come to strike their rates next year. I wonder if the Labour Deputies who have spoken on this Estimate so far have considered the possibility of local bodies having to supplement the funds at their disposal in order to keep their road workers in employment.</P>
      <P>We have had some Labour Deputies stressing their desire to have more moneys placed at the disposal of local authorities for the upkeep of the ordinary county roads; they would prefer to have the moneys spent in that direction rather than on major improvements on main roads.  I am one of those who have always maintained that we should give more attention to the ordinary county roads used for the most part by the ordinary people.  When Labour Deputies, especially Deputy Desmond, say that it is better to spend more money on county roads rather than on the major improvement of main roads, it strikes me that they have not considered the fact that the withdrawal of £500,000 from works on our main roads has not effected a corresponding increase in the amount of money available for county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> How will local bodies react to the withdrawal of these moneys from our main roads?  How do Labour Deputies propose that county councils will find the necessary moneys to keep the road workers in employment?  Do they suggest that the local authority must strike a higher rate next year or will they have to close down on such work for a month or two months to the detriment of the workers concerned?  The Labour Deputies, who should, indeed, be most concerned about this matter, should give a full explanation of their attitude now.  It is no good saying they prefer to have more money spent on county roads rather than on main road improvements when the money is not there for either the one or the other.</P>
    <P>While I agree that more money should be made available for the ordinary county roads, I think certain major improvements are vitally necessary on our main roads both in the interests of the public generally and in the interests of safety.  We must cater for our growing motor traffic.  If we do not do that, then the local bodies which withhold these moneys from such works must bear their share of the responsibility when major accidents occur.  Nobody will deny that a good many of our main roads are still in need of major improvements&mdash;the removal of dangerous bends and dangerous corners, and so forth.  These are works upon which large numbers are employed in my county at any rate, and we will find ourselves faced with the responsibility of providing alternative employment for these workers if road works close down.  It will be interesting to see how those who support the withdrawal of these funds will react when the time comes in the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which has been referred to by a number of Deputies on both sides of the House.  I commend it now to the attention of the Minister. I refer to the giving of driving licences to any applicant who applies. There is no restriction whatever on the granting of such licences.  To my knowledge, a person may send in his neighbour for his driving licence and <Col N="1372" /> so obtain it.  The time has come when somebody in authority must insist that the issue of a driver's licence must always be by test.  In my opinion, an applicant should submit himself or herself to a test in order to qualify for a licence.  There are too many road accidents these days, and I think it would go a long way towards remedying that situation, if there were some form of test before the issue of a driver's licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very helpful contribution.  On this Estimate, year after year, I have stated that I am not satisfied with the way money is being spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I have referred to the fact that a good deal of money is spent on the improvement of drains and rivers at a period of the year when these drains and rivers are overflowing their banks.  I admit a good deal of useful work has been done under the Act, but I do say that a good deal of money has been wasted, because these works begin some time in October and must be finished by the end of March.  Very often, the work is going on around Christmas time when the rivers are flooded.  I have seen gangs of men at work myself. They can wade in as far as the banks of the river all right, but they cannot see the main river; they can only feel it.  They can cut down the overhanging banks of the drain or river with a knife, but that is as far as they can go.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that money spent at that time of the year on work of that kind is quite useless.  If a quarter of the money made available for such work were spent on such drains during the dry period, it would do five times more valuable work than when it is spent at the time of the year when there are floods.  I suggest that the Minister might give this matter his attention.  The time has come when every halfpenny must be saved, and this is one way that money could be saved and put into more useful work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also draw the Minister's attention to a matter that is causing <Col N="1373" /> concern to certain people using the roads.  I do not know whether or not it comes within the ambit of the Minister's Department, but it is a matter that affects road traffic.  If a bad accident, involving a number of vehicles, occurs, the vehicles must not be moved from their position.  In the past year or so, I had the experience of coming across such an accident.  One of the cars involved was that of a cross-Channel tourist and it had a trailer caravan attached.  Luckily enough, nobody was hurt, but the result of the accident was that all traffic was held up for two hours.  There was a queue at each side of the scene of the accident, and the accident occurred within less than 200 yards of a Garda barracks; but because the spot was not within the area of that barracks, the authorities there could not deal with the accident.  They delayed the whole volume of traffic for two hours in order to get in touch with another barracks eight miles away.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> For some time past, in nearly all local authorities, there have been applications for labourers' cottages.  The local authority&mdash;in many cases, the county council&mdash;will inspect the site for a county council cottage.  When it has been inspected by their engineers and health authorities, they have to refer the matter to the Department's inspector, who will also have to come down and inspect.  In the case of small rural areas and small towns that need these cottages, I suggest that it would expedite the building of such cottages if the Minister would give full authority to the responsible officers in the local authority to sanction on their own the sites for such cottages and not have the delay involved in referring to the Department. Surely, when a small village requires a couple of cottages, it should not be necessary to refer to the Local Government Department, who will have to send down an inspector&mdash;who comes after the local authority inspectors&mdash;to accept or reject such sites?  There is a lot of delay and expense there which could be avoided if the engineering staff and health authorities of the local authority could themselves decide what would be a good site for a cottage and what would not.  I suggest to the Minister that he give this matter consideration, because I think it would expedite the building of rural cottages for workers.</P>
    <P>In the granting of what are known as tourist grants, I notice that a lot of the money is being spent for the purpose of developing areas which, in my opinion, are already overdeveloped and overpopulated.  A lot of this money is being spent to attract more and more people into certain areas, which will, of themselves, attract the tourist, anyway.  I suggest that the Minister might consider, instead of sending a lot of this money into certain areas and creating artificial beauty there, sending it out the country, opening up the countryside and opening up the natural beauties of the countryside. Much of the natural beauty of the country is obscured from the view of the tourist by unsightly hedges along country roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertLahiffe" hpid="Mr. Lahiffe Mr. Lahiffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Prosecute farmers?  I object strongly, and here is where I differ from the Minister.  You may prosecute a farmer for not cutting his hedges, but the farmer can comply with the law and still obscure the view from the roadside, because the farmer is within the law, if he cuts the hedge straight up from the wall.  My point is that the Minister could send some of the money that is being spent in the concentrated areas out into the rural areas to keep the hedges in trim, so that ordinary tourists passing along the road can see the naked beauty of the countryside.  I refer especially to a couple of roads, one leading from my own town of Gort into Killaloe, where you have the finest and the most beautiful scenery in the country obscured completely by unsightly hedges, and the other, in the South of Ireland, the road between Newcastle West and Castleisland which is also completely obscured in the same manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is useless to say you will prosecute the farmers.  If the local authorities carry out an instruction to prosecute farmers who will not trim their hedges, that does not solve the problem. The main purpose of cutting the hedges should be to obtain a view, but the farmer can comply with the regulations without giving a view.  That is why I suggest to the Minister that he might, through the local authority, devote some money to keeping these hedges in trim.  If the hedges have been cut down once, they can be kept in trim by mechanical means.  You have tractors available nowadays that can cut miles and miles of these hedges in a couple of hours and so open up the countryside to tourists who want to see the countryside and not the towns and cities which have been overdeveloped. As time goes on and when these improvements have been made, you might have wayside inns provided for them where they can get refreshments <Col N="1376" /> rather than have to rush back to the nearest town miles away.</P>
    <P>I referred to the delay in the sanctioning of sites for county council cottages, and I would include in that also sewerage schemes for small villages. That is a matter in which there is also a good deal of delay.  The local authority engineers and the health authority officials carry out an inspection and are satisfied that the work should be done in a certain manner. Nevertheless, the Department, of Local Government are not satisfied without sending down another host of officials to inspect again.  A great deal of money and useful time could be spared by allowing the local authority officials, who are highly competent on these problems, to deal with this matter, as well as that of the county council cottage. I commend to the Minister these few suggestions I have made which, I believe, would improve the situation generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of economy, we should have a central roads authority.  At the moment, we have corporations, county and urban councils, the Board of Works, the Department of Agriculture and various other bodies all working on roads schemes.  By having such a central roads authority we would cut out much of this unnecessary expenditure on the employment of engineers and clerical staffs.  This is a matter which should be given immediate and full consideration because there is too much overlapping in this respect.  An example I would quote is that enormous amounts of machinery are at times idle in one part of a county, and, within a few hundred yards across the border, other schemes are being held up for the want of such machinery.  It costs quite a lot to bring machinery from one part of a county to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder if our county engineers or their assistants ever know or care anything about the proper grading of road bends.  I believe that many accidents are due to the improper grading of road bends, and that is another matter to which I would draw the Minister's attention. There is also the question of road <Col N="1377" /> signs.  Tourists, and of course foreign tourists, complain a lot of the lack of road signs in some of our counties on roads that can be described only as death traps.  There is also need for the standardisation of danger signs on roads.  In one county, you have a road sign which may indicate an autobahn, whereas in another county it might be a sign of danger ahead.  There is too much differentiation between one county and another.</P>
    <P>While we are on the question of road signs, may I suggest that, in the interest of economy, we should have co-operation from, say, the E.S.B. and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in allowing their telephone or lamp standards to be used for the purpose of the erection of bus stop, parking and danger signs, as the case may be?  It would also save a great deal of unnecessary expenditure.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been the cause of grave concern throughout the country is the number of disused, waterlogged quarry holes which have been claiming yearly a number of young victims.  Provision should be made to enable the local authority to deal with this situation which is causing much concern to the people.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a town in rural Ireland that has not got its share of derelict sites.  Fortunately, that cannot be said for Dublin, but we have it throughout the whole country.  Local authorities should be given power to acquire these sites for the purpose of industry, building social clubs, handball or other amenities.</P>
    <P>Another matter, which may be one for the Department or the Department of Justice, is the number of tinker encampments along our main roads, especially around our towns. They give a very bad impression to our tourists.  When leaving an area, they leave it in a disgraceful condition, and filth and litter strewn around on the outskirts of towns are anything but an addition to them.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like to mention is the design of local authority houses.  Do our architects ever visit the houses they design?  I think that, <Col N="1378" /> if they did, some of them would give up, or rather they would get some food for thought.  I hold they should be made live in them for a while, and then we might get houses fit for architects to live in.</P>
    <P>A point I should like to mention and a matter that is very pertinent in our country concerns what is a grave abuse at election times.  It is the number of road gangers we have acting in any capacity&mdash;I do not mind what it is&mdash; in election booths.  It is a known fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, if the road workers are paid out of public funds, they should attend to their public duties.  It is a known fact that the road workers have to come in and vote, and have to vote openly, and they might not turn up for a few days afterwards, or until the following morning at their work.  So much for democracy.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to thank the Minister for his introduction of the Local Government (Amendment) Act, 1955.  As a result, we were, I think, one of the only counties, if not the only county, in Ireland which was able to reduce the rates&mdash;or, rather, Galway City was able to reduce its rates this year.  I thank the Minister on behalf of the citizens of Galway for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter which I think is of most pressing importance in rural constituencies, so far as this Estimate is concerned, is one which is very much uppermost in the minds of all of us, the question of roads and providing money for roads.  I have heard it said on several occasions&mdash;I think the Minister himself will scarcely deny that he himself has said it and that it has been said on his behalf as <Col N="1379" /> well&mdash;that, in the County of Donegal, since he became Minister, he has been the Minister responsible for giving more money towards roads than was ever given before.  That would be quite a fine achievement in respect of Donegal or any other county if the facts which I have since elicited by parliamentary question bore out those statements.</P>
      <P>On 2nd May last, I had a parliamentary question down in this House asking for the total amount of moneys paid to various local authorities throughout the State in respect of certain years, so far as these road grants are concerned.  With the exception of five local authorities, the figures given in this House show that, over the years 1953 to 1956, there has been a decline in the total amount of money provided through the Department of Local Government for the repair, upkeep and maintenance of roads.  That, as I say, is bad enough, but when you couple it with the statements to which I have already referred, the situation really assumes rather fearsome proportions.  We, in our county, and in other counties for that matter, have been told persistently and repeatedly that we are getting more money now for roads than we ever got before under the present Government, but at the same time we find, from the figures given by the very Department that administers these moneys, those figures do not bear out the statements to which we have listened over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, we find that, in 1952-53, Deputy Smith, who was then Minister for Local Government, did one job at that time in doing an unpleasant task.  He certainly did one job that every member of every local authority felt would pay dividends in the future when it was his unpleasant duty to bring in legislation here effecting an increase in road taxes for vehicles and driving licences.  At that time, he gave his pledge, as Minister for Local Government, that all moneys in future coming into the Road Fund would be disbursed to the different counties throughout the land, and he held out the prospect to the motoring <Col N="1380" /> fraternity, and to those who must use road transport, that, although these taxes were being increased, they were being increased solely for the benefit of the road system, and those who had to pay the increased burdens which they have since been paying would in return get better roads and get them more quickly.  They could be sure that all the moneys put into the Road Fund would come back to their benefit in the future.</P>
    <P>Not only was that so, but in the time when Deputy Smith was Minister and when Fianna Fáil were the Government, in addition to the amounts that came into the Road Fund by way of taxation, we also had added very considerable sums from the National Development Fund in order to supplement the Road Fund created by taxes collected from users of the roads.  We can find that in the year 1954-55, basing the calculation on the moneys collected in the previous year, that, in addition to the allocations that could be made from the total Road Fund, the Government not only gave back to the roads of the country and to the local authorities the entire amount of money in the Road Fund, but that they also gave £790,000 from the National Development Fund.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the second year of office of the present Government and what do we find?  We find that the undertaking given by Deputy Smith as Minister for Local Government three years ago in connection with the Road Fund is now being broken and we are no longer to get from the Road Fund as then promised the entire amount of money paid into it by the people paying road taxes.  Not only that, but we find we are to give a gift of £500,000 to some other cause within the Government.  Not only are we not getting our roads done or money to do them, but we find ourselves in the position that the Road Fund is to be depleted to the tune of £500,000 and at the same time, grants from the National Development Fund are not forthcoming and apparently will not be forthcoming in the future.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the situation so far as my own county is concerned, in our <Col N="1381" /> county council this year, during the estimates meeting, we found that, in order to do as much work this year as we did last year, we required an additional £47,000 from the rates.  That was something which none of us could face up to providing from rates already too high, and the result was that we went as far as we possibly could and added to our own contribution from the rates a total sum of £16,000, or 13.6 pence in the £, increase in our rates this year in order to bolster up the funds for improving and maintaining our roads.  Those funds are now less, as I say, by £31,000.  There will be £31,000 less work done on Donegal roads this year than was done last year.  Despite that, the ratepayers will pay in their rates 13.6d. more this year than they did last year for roads.</P>
    <P>If that is not typical of what is going on throughout the country, then the figures I got from the Minister must be wrong.  I would say that, if they were wrong, they would be wrong to his advantage because, as they read at the moment, they show a very sorry picture.  Anybody who wants to look them up will find in the Official Report for the 2nd May a tabular statement showing the grants for the three financial years 1953-54, 1954-55 and 1955-56. Only five counties have gained anything in those three years.  In the other counties, the amount received from the Road Fund for road maintenance has decreased and, according to these figures, whereas Donegal received an allocation of £400,460 from the Fianna Fáil Government in their last year in office, under the present Government, in the following financial year, the allocation was reduced to £384,000.  The most glaring example of all is County Clare, for which the figures show an allocation of £90,000 less from the Road Fund and in the various moneys for the upkeep of roads than was received from the Fianna Fáil Government.  That goes ill with the statements we have been hearing, particularly when it is considered that the ratepayers are being asked to pay more in order to get less.</P>
    <P>In 1953-54 the total rates collected in this country were £15,986,794.  That was the last year that Fianna Fáil were in office.  For the year 1956-57 the <Col N="1382" /> estimated collection&mdash;which is easily made up; it is really not an estimate &mdash;the amount that will be taken from the ratepayers, if they are able to pay, will have jumped from £15,000,000-odd to £19,400,000.  In other words, in the space of two years there has been an increase of over £4,000,000 laid on the backs of the ratepayers and, as I have pointed out, in regard to roads, they will get less service for that extra money.  In spite of that, I am sure we will have people going down the country, telling the people that they are getting more money for roads and getting roads done more quickly now than ever before.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of the story that was told just at the same juncture in the history of the last Coalition when, after coming into office they reduced the grant in Donegal by £90,000, in 1949.  Yet, in 1950, the same people came back and told the people of Donegal, in face of the figures that were in black and white, that what we had been told or had seen happening in 1949 was fiction, not fact.  Unfortunately, the people who live in rural Ireland, have to traverse the roads in the backward areas.  They know the facts.  They know that the roads are not being done and will not be done under the present system.  I say, straightforwardly, to the Minister for Local Government that he has let down the people whom he should uphold, the people who are paying motor taxation and for driving licences.  He has not stood by them as his predecessor promised to do and did until he left office.</P>
    <P>I know the pressure must have been very great indeed when the Minister for Local Government or his departmental officials or advisers agreed that the Road Fund should be raided to the extent of £500,000 in these days when costs are rising and roads are disimproving and when everyone who knows anything about the rural community and their way of life realises that we must try to find the money for roads in order to improve the position in regard to these people, as a first step.</P>
    <P>There is no use in building good houses, putting water into them and laying on sewerage if, when all that is <Col N="1383" /> done, the people have not a way to go in and out.  It is too true that many homes in rural Ireland to-day have not got anything resembling a road into them and, under the present system, there is no hope that in their lifetime they will have anything resembling a road.</P>
    <P>We cannot reconcile the Minister's attitude and his giving away of £500,000 from this fund with his attitude when he first became a Minister, when it was his idea and his ideal that the roads should be improved and that the people living in backward areas should be provided with this very necessary service.  He has not kept faith with those expressed ideals.  In fact, he has allowed himself to be bludgeoned into giving away the money that rightfully belongs to the local authorities for the maintenance of roads.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, apart from the situation that exists in Dublin and to some degree in Cork, there is an unique situation in the rest of the country, not so much in regard to the loans that are very much in the news at the moment as with regard to grants that are non-existent.  Since 31st March last, there have been no housing grants of any description available to anybody for the purpose of building a dwelling.  What is more disturbing, there has been no comment from the Minister concerned or from any of his colleagues.  No helpful hints have been thrown out that if the people go on with the job at the moment they will be in no worse position when the new legislation is introduced. The only thing that has been given to this House to understand is that some time during this session new legislation in regard to housing and housing grants will be introduced.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister what the people are supposed to do in the meantime. What are the people who have been saving for the last four to 15 years in order to build a house this year to do?  Are they supposed to go ahead with the house in anticipation of getting as good a grant as they would have got last year?  Are they to go ahead on the assumption that if <Col N="1384" /> they build their house they will be entitled to a grant from the county council?  On the other hand, are they to take the risk that, if they commence to build at the moment, they may get no grant or a reduced grant?</P>
    <P>Are we to go out from this debate with as little knowledge in regard to housing grants as we had when we came in?  The Minister&mdash;I am sure he is well aware of it&mdash;is not playing the game in regard to housing grants if he does not put his foot down with the Cabinet of which he is a member and get from them an immediate decision, to be relayed to the people, as to whether or not the grants will be increased, retained as they were, reduced or wiped out.  The people are entitled to know and certainly those people who have commitments possibly already made are entitled to know and, in fairness and justice to them, must know the position.  On the Minister's head will it rest if, in a few months' time, any of these people come to any loss.</P>
    <P>There may be people who will decide the risk is too great, who, in the absence of any encouragement from the Government in regard to what grants they may get in the future, will not build this year and, maybe, not having started this summer and this year, some circumstances may occur or intervene which will mean that they may never build because they did not start this year.  The responsibility for all that will rest on the shoulders of to-day's Minister for Local Government.  I do not want to see it resting there because I believe the Minister is fully alive to the situation and that he has been strangled in regard to this matter by his colleagues in the Cabinet.  As they whipped £500,000 from the Road Fund, so also are they throttling his efforts to keep going the building drive, which has been in evidence for some years past.</P>
    <P>We know there are still many houses needed despite the fact that it may be said that in some areas the housing programme is nearing completion. While that may be true, it is also a fact that many people are still wretchedly housed.  These grants were going some part of the way and the local authorities <Col N="1385" /> were going the rest of it.  Now we have no grants whatever.  We have not even an encouraging smile from the Minister to indicate that all will be well in the next few months when this housing legislation comes before us.  I would ask the Minister to give us some indication, when closing this debate, and to give the people throughout the country an indication of what is to happen in regard to these grants. Many people are anxiously awaiting that information.  Will the grants remain?  Will the grants be increased, as they should be under existing increased costs?  Will the grants be reduced or will they be wiped out?  I would ask the Minister to tell us the answer to these questions and, in doing so, to remember that he is being only fair to the people throughout the country in need of houses and who are depending on these grants.</P>
    <P>I said we have a rare and unique situation in regard to grants.  The situation is just as rare and unique in regard to loans.  While it is true that to-day the problem is the problem of Dublin to a very large extent and the problem of Cork to a lesser extent, there is no guarantee that that same problem will not be the problem of all of us in every local authority throughout the country in the near future. Apart altogether from the possibility of a position arising in which no money would be available for housing loans, we are facing the problem in every local authority at the moment that we must charge an increased interest on the loans we are making available now and will make available in the future.</P>
    <P>That position has arisen under a Government&mdash;and a Department whose Minister belongs to the main Party in this Coalition Government&mdash;that promised cheaper money and cheaper housing.  There is no money in Dublin for anything so far as housing is concerned. In Cork, they are trying to struggle through.  In the country there are no grants available of any kind. Money on loan&mdash;and it is pretty difficult to get it&mdash;must be paid for at an increased rate of interest.  That, in a nutshell, is the black future that faces us in regard to the housing drive of <Col N="1386" /> which people were boasting that it was almost finished without remembering that there are still people throughout the country who are very badly housed and who must be properly housed by someone in the near future.</P>
    <P>Nothing whatever can excuse the present Government and the present Minister for dealing with housing in the manner in which they have dealt with it.  The slick answers and explanations that have been given on different occasions over the past three or four months, both in relation to the loan arrangements in Dublin and in regard to the provision of grants and of cheap money for housing down the country, are not going to stick.  Undoubtedly, they will get a Minister or a Cabinet or a Government out of a hole for a day, two days, a week or a month but, in the long run&mdash;and it will not be a very long run in this case&mdash;these tactics will not pay.  The people are heartily sick of the manner in which they are being dealt with by this Coalition Government who increase the price of an item to-day and to-morrow try to convince the people that it did not go up in price at all, that they are imagining the increase and that they are suffering from some sort of delusion.  These tactics will not pay and are getting is nowhere.</P>
    <P>We are getting nowhere so far as housing and roads are concerned and we shall get nowhere over the whole field of local government so long as this Coalition Government persists in these tactics.  The Minister for Local Government&mdash;whether it is the Government that is at fault or not&mdash;is the individual who must take the biggest rap of all when the time comes.  I am asking that the Minister will go into this matter of housing grants.  I am asking him to consider the inability of people down the country to pay the new increased rates of interest on loans for houses and to do something about it.</P>
    <P>In addition, while it is somewhat out of my field of activity, I should like to submit to the Minister that this new arrangement in regard to Dublin City whereby loans will not be <Col N="1387" /> given to anybody with more than £10 per week is surely the death knell of private building in Dublin City.  How many people will be eligible to get a loan who have not got £10 a week?  Is it not a fact that, in the recent past, the attitude within the Department was that only people with £10 a week are loan-worthy?  Now, the same Department come along and say that if a man in Dublin has over £10 a week he cannot and will not be entitled to get a loan.  Although this is out of my territory altogether, I would ask the Minister if this is not the end of private building by way of loan.  Is this the end of private building by way of loan in Dublin City?  If it is, then far better would it be to get up here and say so rather than try to choke the cat with butter.  That is about what this amounts to so far as I can see and so far as I have heard in this House to-day from those who know the situation.</P>
    <P>I should like also to draw the Minister's attention to some of the things that we expected from him during the past year.  We find the Minister, during the past few months, going up and down the country and stating that the main cause of the increases in rates in recent years was the Health Act which was steamrolled through this House by Fianna Fáil.  These were the Minister's own words at a Fine Gael Convention in Waterford on 11th March, 1956.  The Minister for Local Government blames the Health Act of Fianna Fáil for the increase in rates in recent years but his colleague, the Minister for Health, came along and proved clearly and beyond doubt that this was not so and that, in fact, the amount of increase on the rates due to the operation of the Health Act represented a very small part of the increases in recent years.  Those two Ministers, not only from the same Government and the same Cabinet, but out of the same Party, made two contradictory statements about the same thing publicly within one week of each other.  Both of them, I am quite sure, knew what they were talking about when they made these statements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> That is a typical example of Government by Coalition.  Even within the Parties, you find this frequent trouble creeping in of two people talking about the same thing and saying exactly the opposite to different audiences within a few hours of each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing the best I can to show that the tactics I mentioned, adopted and practised by the present Minister for Local Government in saying one thing and doing another, are not unique in so far as the rest of the Cabinet is concerned.  In so far as the increase in rates is concerned, the statement he made that the Health Act is responsible was flatly contradicted by his colleague, the Minister for Health.  The two of them cannot be right, and I think it is about time somebody found out who was wrong.</P>
      <P>There is the matter of grants and loans.  We have also the situation in regard to the grants already allocated last year by the Department of Local Government.  It is a situation which I believe at the moment has not accidentally happened.  There is a slowing up in inspections throughout my county in relation to the payment of these grants.  Has there, or has there not, been some minute passed down the line to the various people dealing with Government grants that the money is slack at the moment and that there should be no rush?  Is there any wilful slowing up through the Department in order that money should not be asked for?  Is that so or is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do the figures in respect of inspections and payments in the past three months bear out what I say or prove me wrong?  I shall accept the figures if they prove that the grants have been going out as quickly as they did for the past 12 months.  On the other hand, if it is found that the figures show that fewer grants are being paid out, then I ask the Minister to look into the matter.  It has been put to me that this is so and from the few cases I know of, I am inclined to believe that there is a slowing up which may have been a wilful act done <Col N="1389" /> in order to conserve moneys already dwindling to a low level.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which came before the Minister and his Department recently&mdash;a matter affecting Donegal.  So far as the instance in question is concerned, it will have far reaching effects throughout the country in regard to the power of local authorities.  Some few months ago&mdash;I think it was in the month of January &mdash;we found that under the powers granted by the last City and County Management Act, we, as a council in Donegal, could direct that the moneys already provided for rounding off corners on a particular road could be employed, if we thought fit, in going straight through in order to achieve the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Such a position arose last January, when we as a county council&mdash;and a mixed council at that&mdash;by unanimous decision decided that, instead of doing the Moville-Culdaff road, as the engineers indicated it should be done, it should be done another way.  The resolution, under Section 4 of the City and County Management Act, 1955, was sent forward to the Local Government Department. After some time, one of the councillors whose name was on the original motion was notified that it had been turned down.  I was the main mover of the motion and was not notified at all.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, the main point is that, under Section 4, we exercised our right as a local authority, and, on an unanimous decision, sent this resolution to the Minister in connection with the road in Moville.  After six weeks or two months, we got a reply from the Minister that he was not prepared to sanction the work.  We know from our investigations, from the estimates made out by engineers competent to do the job, outside of our own county staff, and who were employed by the local people of Moville, such was the interest they had in the job, that the way we wanted to do the job was feasible.</P>
    <P>In spite of that, we find the Minister for Local Government throwing out our resolution and at the same time trampling under foot the City and County Management Act, 1955, which <Col N="1390" /> the Minister when introducing it in this House, described as an emancipating measure.  Yet, when a total of 28 members send up a resolution their own Minister for Local Government throws it out.  The first shot for emancipation had been fired under Section 4 and the Minister who brought in that section to emancipate the local authorities and give them powers which they did not have before was the first man to shoot it down.  So much for our emancipation.</P>
    <P>We are still being dictated to in the same way as we were before, except that we were under the illusion that we had some power under Section 4. We were assured by the Minister that we had the power.  I well remember the Committee debate on that section. I pointed out all the flaws and holes in the section that rendered it such that it could not possibly give us the powers the Minister maintained it would.  Now we know from sad experience and by the Minister's own action that what we then said from this side of the House was only too true and that Section 4 is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention concerns his undying devotion to the cause of providing a piped water supply for the Gaeltacht of Donegal as expressed by him no later than 20th June, 1955, in Letterkenny, a few days before the local elections.  He said he hoped that the Donegal Gaeltacht would soon be fully served with a piped water supply.  To that, I would say &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo;  Actually, I was not far away from where the Minister spoke and I then said &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; but, unfortunately, the Minister's intentions were not carried out.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister himself could be blamed in at least one instance in so far as a piped water supply for a Gaeltacht area is concerned. Over a year ago, the Minister will recall if other members of the House do not, I had occasion to raise on the Adjournment a question in respect of a piped water supply for Fanad West in County Donegal.  The Minister then made it appear that the reason the water supply scheme for <Col N="1391" /> Fanad West was being held up was because I obstructed it in the Donegal County Council.  The Minister knows that was untrue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that and will continue with the discussion.  In so far as it is unparliamentary to refer to the Minister as a liar, I withdraw it wholly.  I am sorry the Minister is not in the House for this item.  I was blamed, and given wide publicity by the newspapers, for my alleged obstruction of this scheme.  I was blamed by a Minister who was misusing his position to charge me with obstruction. I am working to-day and I have been working since then to get that scheme through.  Who constitutes the greatest obstruction I am meeting in my efforts?  No one other than the Minister for Local Government himself. When we in the Donegal County Council a few months ago found we were not being given, and apparently would not be given, the 68? per cent.  State grant for a water supply scheme for Fanad West&mdash;part of a regional scheme for the Fanad peninsula&mdash;we sent up a resolution, which the council passed unanimously, pointing out that Fanad West was a Fíor-Ghaeltacht district of the Fanad peninsula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told me in the House at that time that he could not do anything about it without amending legislation. I pointed out to him that he had drafted the schedule by Ministerial Order and that, if he could do that in one instance, he could do it in a second instance and that legislation was not required.  He then used the tactics of saying that if it were not for me the scheme would have gone through.  He has got hamstrung on this matter.  He knows in his heart that this is a Fíor-Ghaeltacht area, entitled to this 68? per cent. grant.  But what do we find now?  We find that the Minister <Col N="1392" /> has now passed the buck to the non-existent Minister for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The history of this matter goes back further.  After this Government took office, we in Donegal got a circular, as did the councils of other counties, asking us to send in for approval a programme of water supply schemes and sewerage schemes for every Gaeltacht area we could find.  The circular told us the schemes would be carried out under grants from the National Development Fund or from some other such fund.  They could not even wait for us to draw up our programme.  They sent us a second circular asking us to send in our schemes more quickly. They gave us eight months, up to March, 1955, in which to send them in. It is now the middle of 1956 and we still have not got 2d. in State grants for any of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Fanad West, as a Fíor-Ghaeltacht area, is entitled to the 68? per cent. grant but the Minister has now passed the buck to a Minister who does not exist and who is not likely to exist.  We are in the position of looking for money from a Department which does not exist and we cannot lay the responsibility on anyone for the reason that the Minister does not exist either. The scheme about which I have been talking is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and his passing of the buck in the manner in which I have described will not give water to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht area of Donegal, as the Minister so glibly promised to do on the eve of the local government election in Letterkenny on June 21st.  There is no use in that type of bluff.  That is not the way to give the promised services more quickly to the people in rural Ireland. In fact any services we do get from the present Government are given with very poor grace.</P>
    <P>When the Minister took office we had the promise that red tape would be abolished.  We were told it would be deported or transported or exported; we were to be rid of it.  We are not rid of it; we are being strangled by it.  The Minister is not carrying out the promises he made when he became Minister.  He is not <Col N="1393" /> cutting out the red tape; he is not expediting the work of the local authorities.  If he bent himself to it, the Minister could expedite those things.  Whether it is that he has not the wish or is being prevented lest he spends too much money, the sum total is that after two years we find now that the promises made were just promises that have not been fulfilled and are not likely to be fulfilled.  Now that the Minister has returned to the House I should like to mention again the Fanad West water supply scheme about which I have been talking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy I was listening to everything he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister was listening.  Now that he is here I would ask him to see to it that the local authority, his Department and himself are not held up to ridicule for holding up this scheme on the pretext that it is not a Gaeltacht scheme. Fanad West is absolutely Fíor-Ghaeltacht. The Minister is not inclined to schedule it as such.  He prefers to pass the matter on to somebody who is to come at some future date&mdash;some saviour who will appear in the near future to relieve him of the responsibility of throwing out this scheme. As I have said.  Fanad West is Fíor-Ghaeltacht. The Department of Education know that from their inspectors, from school reports, from the teachers and from the receipt of moneys they pay out under the Gaeltacht scheme each year.  Every proof possible is there and the proof is in a Department of State to which, I presume, the Minister for Local Government has access.</P>
      <P>I would ask him to make himself familiar with this proof and to allow us to proceed with this scheme on the 68? per cent. grant.  If he did that, and no more, for Donegal while he is Minister, he will be able to say when he no longer is Minister: &ldquo;There is one Fíor-Ghaeltacht of Donegal that now has a piped water supply, thanks to my effort&rdquo;.  I will make him a present of any efforts I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other items might be raised on this Estimate.  I feel sure <Col N="1394" /> they have been referred to already.  I have heard discussion about the removal of fences and the cutting of hedges that obstruct scenery or that obstruct the view at corners and make corners dangerous.  Instead of asking local authorities to prosecute farmers for not cutting their hedges, the Minister might get his Department to start an all-out campaign to get good will and co-operation from the farmers residing along roadsides and from other roadside dwellers as well.  If such co-operation and good will existed, there would be less bother and more work done than there is under the present system of bringing prosecutions to make farmers cut down hedges.  As Deputy Lahiffe has already said, you can compel a man to cut the hedge, but, if he does not want to do it with any good grace, he can trim the face of the hedge level with the bank or wall and need not cut the top. That, so far as I understand it, is the position as the moment, and that is where goodwill and co-operation are missing, and where they could do a good job for us in the future.  If there is any way in which the Department of Local Government and the Minister can get our farmers' goodwill in this matter much more work will be done than by bringing them to court and prosecuting.</P>
    <P>Now that I have mentioned the roads and the question of clearing bends and making them less dangerous, might I add my voice to the very many raised here and there down through the years, and more so in recent years, in regard to the question of traffic congestion and the manner in which our roads have become dangerous?  The Department is, through the local authorities, doing a fair part of their work in making roads more safe, but there is still a lot to be done in that direction, and I feel, as many others do, that it is not a matter that can be dealt with under existing laws or regulations, that some new amending legislation is required to bring things up to date and ensure that in future the people who must travel the roads, whether they like it or not, will be able to do so in some safety.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department, in conjunction with the Department of <Col N="1395" /> Justice and the Garda authorities, would all be implicated in new legislation that would go to make the roads safer than they are to-day.  Knowing what the Minister for Local Government can do in that direction, I ask that he use his good offices in trying to bring to a head any such legislation that may be required, because there is no question whatever that, despite the fact that we are trying to improve the road surfaces, cut the bends, reduce the inclines and all the rest, it is no exaggeration to say that for every 100 miles any person drives in a car or vehicle to-day, on the average he escapes with his life by mere chance at least once, on any of our main roads. That is not only my own experience, but the experience of a good many who have to travel the roads very frequently. They have two or three escapes, thanks to God and nothing else, on an average three or four times a week.</P>
    <P>That is a condition that should not be allowed to continue.  It need not continue, but, as this matter is something which I feel is not entirely appropriate to the Department of Local Government, I do not want to go into the details of some of the things that I feel are wrong with our present road regulations, or, should I say, lack of road regulations.  I will just leave it at that by appealing to the Minister, as the Minister responsible for making our roads and keeping them, to use his good offices to ensure that those of us who have to travel these roads will live to tell the tale when the roads are improving in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister to consider the position in regard to the ratepayers.  It is true that in every county to-day our ratepayers are being asked to carry more than they are able to bear.  That is true now, and it will become more of a burden on them as the months go by, because, while a few years ago the farmer's lot was such that, in the live stock end of his business, at any rate, there was an upwards surge in the market, a boom in the trade and as a result his rates did not fall so heavily on him, to-day and in the near future, the prospects <Col N="1396" /> are that this boom is no longer there and our farmers will be feeling then, as they have already started to feel, the draught, and will find it difficult this year to pay their rates.</P>
    <P>I would ask from the Minister one thing which I have mentioned before, and it is this: if increases of any kind are to be placed on the ratepayers of any county, those increases should be left to the discretion of the respective county councils, and no negotiations should be carried out between the Minister and any organisation which will mean more expenditure from local rates, without first consulting the county councils.  One of the things that we find weighs very heavily and comes very often at awkward times is the question of increasing wages and salaries, and creating new appointments. The new appointment matter has been dealt with, but what we find is this: an organisation representing either a profession or a union will approach the Minister to have their conditions or wages improved or something else.  The net result is that at those negotiations the Minister, on the one hand, representing all the local authorities, makes a bargain that he is prepared to sanction so much of an increase or a change in the conditions or regulations.  The next thing is that the local authorities are faced with a demand from the association, union or organisations concerned at the next meeting, for the increase the Minister said he was prepared to sanction, if we would give it.  As soon as the Minister agrees to sanction up to a certain figure, we have been committed, because, whether it is recognised or not, the Minister is regarded by those organisations as a representative of all local authorities, and once the Minister, whether it be the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Health, says to any organisation: &ldquo;We are prepared to sanction an increase of £1 a week, or 15/-, or 10/- a week,&rdquo; then the county councils are really in duty bound to pay that.</P>
    <P>That happens, and has been happening in the past.  I am not blaming the present Minister any more than any other for that situation, but I ask, as I have asked his colleague in the <Col N="1397" /> Department of Health, that in future where money will fall on the rates or an increase will result from any negotiations that take place, he should consult first of all with the county councils, get their agreement, and if they are agreeable to the increase or to pay more through the rates, then it is quite all right for the Minister to go along and agree with anybody who comes to him.  But without consulting the county councils in advance, it is a very wrong thing to do, and something that should not be done, and a practice that should be broken.  The practice has been of long standing, but I believe it can be broken, and I ask the Minister to make a stand himself on this matter and see that it is broken.</P>
    <P>There were a number of small items which I wanted to raise in this debate, but, in order to get across what I really think should be emphasised, I will conclude by pointing out that our position to-day under the present Government in relation to local government and local authorities generally is that we are giving the people in our respective counties less services while charging more.  A great deal of the blame for that situation can be laid at the door of the present Government and, in particular at the door of the present Minister.  He has given away a gift of £5,000,000, which should have gone to roads badly in need of repair, without consulting the people and in direct contravention of the promise made by his predecessor that all moneys in the Road Fund would go back to the roads.  That promise has been violated.  I do not know whether the Minister has been pushed into this, pulled into it, or walked into it voluntarily, but he will certainly be held responsible and the matter must be given full publicity because this making and breaking of promises is something which is becoming the hallmark of Coalition Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I said £5,000,000 I read the figure incorrectly.  But it is not a question as to whether it is £5,000,000 or £500,000 or just £5.  There is a principle involved.  The Minister's <Col N="1398" /> predecessor said no money would be taken from the Road Fund for any other purpose and all of it would go back to the road users who are paying taxation on their cars and licences. That principle has been violated.  That promise has been broken.  Irrespective of whether the amount is large or small, the principle has ceased to exist and that is the objectionable feature in this.  The Minister is responsible and he must take the blame.  I appeal to him in the coming 12 months to make up that £500,000 in some way.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by repeating that our housing grants, housing loans and road moneys are not what they should be. It is up to the Minister to mend his hand even at this late stage and thereby help to give better housing and better roads to the people in rural Ireland.  I appeal to him, too, to see that the people in the Fior-Ghaeltacht get a piped water supply.  That is something he himself advocated but he has not been quite so vociferous in his advocacy since becoming a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call the attention of the Minister to some very unwelcome news received by many hundreds of Dublin citizens when they opened their morning paper, namely, that it had been recommended to our city manager to publish an advertisement informing applicants for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts that there was no more money available.  The very small sum of approximately £15,000 still on hands will be exhausted very shortly and, as far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, there will not be a penny available to advance to applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure this news did not make pleasant reading for the Minister, but it was particularly unpleasant reading for the hundreds of families still desirous of providing, and anxious to provide, their own homes within the city area.  It is true that proposals to which the Minister referred elsewhere will be considered next Monday by the Dublin Corporation.  Whether these proposals are good or bad, one thing is certain: some considerable time will elapse before any change in the existing arrangement will ensure that applicants will once more receive <Col N="1399" /> moneys for the purpose of building their own homes.</P>
    <P>The general change contemplated is one that should be examined very carefully because it conflicts with the principle of the Acts and with the purposes for which these Acts were framed.  These Acts were introduced in order to permit persons with a certain income to provide houses for themselves in the belief that thereby the responsibilities of the Central Government to assist local authorities in providing houses would be substantially eased.  One glance at the figures will demonstrate quite clearly that these Acts have been availed of to a considerable extent in recent years.  In the period 1948-1949 to 1952-1953 advances totalling something over £2,000,000 were made.  In 1953-1954 advances totalling £2,200,000 were made.  In the year 1954-1955, the advances totalled £1,700,000 and in 1955-1956, £1,790,000 The total came came to nearly £8,000,000 over the years and that £8,000,000 was handled by the Dublin Corporation, whose only function in the matter was to administer the advancing of these moneys. In the years 1954, 1955 and 1956 the average monthly advance was round about £140,000 to £150,000.  In February of this year £156,000 was advanced. The question now before us and before the Minister is: how much will be advanced in February, 1957?</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind a number of factors.  One of those is that the rates of interest under the Small Dwellings Acts, whether operated by county councils or by corporations, have always been below the interest rates charged by building societies.  Even the present rate of 5¾ per cent. varies from 1¼ to 1¾ per cent. less than that charged by building societies.  Is it conceivable that the operations of the Act can be continued by a complete change of the system?</P>
    <P>Members of this House will be aware that under the Small Dwellings Acts at present there are a number of qualifications.  One of those, which applies to those who do not qualify for a house under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, is that, if their <Col N="1400" /> income is in excess of £520 a year, they will not get the supplementary grant in full.  I wonder how many applicants to a building society or insurance society, whose annual income is less than £520 a year, would be given an advance to build or buy their own homes?  I think it would not be too many.  But whether they be many or few, the operations of the proposed alternative would take time.  Therefore, I would like to appeal to the Minister to consider the position of those who are anxious to build their own homes but are not yet in a position to raise the money through their own resources, and, as far as he can, at least to let applicants for such loans receive support from the Local Loans Fund or make moneys available to the corporation from that fund in order that operations may continue while the position is being examined.</P>
    <P>There was a somewhat more serious position referred to in this morning's paper also, and that was a recommendation from one of the Dublin Corporation sub-committees that the city manager should not issue contracts for building houses in the Coolock-Raheny area&mdash;sanction for which had already been received from the Minister and his Department&mdash;until further discussions had taken place in the city council.  It immediately becomes apparent that, if there is any delay in issuing contracts or withholding sanction, the work of providing houses in Dublin will receive a very serious setback.  While I am dealing with this matter might I mention that I understand the housing department is waiting since February of this year for sanction to proceed with development at East Finglas&mdash;development work which is absolutely essential if any building is to take place on the outskirts of Dublin during the next two years.</P>
    <P>Our difficulties in the corporation are difficulties that have arisen mainly or solely through lank of finance.  With the exception of the delay in sanctioning the development work at East Finglas, I think it only fair to say that in the last year or so there has been no undue delay in approving plans submitted. But it is little use to receive <Col N="1401" /> official sanction to carry out the essential work of building houses for our people if the situation has reached the point where a local authority indicates that it seeks a specific undertaking from the Minister that finance will be forthcoming before it issues out a contract. I regret to say that this is the position that has developed in Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>It is a development of only very recent times.  It arises mainly, I think, from the difficulties the corporation were faced with in the autumn of last year, when, having received sanction to borrow by way of overdraft from the Bank of Ireland up to the sum of £6,000,000, the Bank of Ireland refused point-blank to make that sum available by way of overdraft and subsequently indicated that it would be prepared only to provide overdraft accommodation for housing and capital purposes up to £3,800,000, subject to the corporation indicating what its future proposals were in connection with the raising of capital moneys. Within a few months of that decision the corporation's bankers took a much bigger step and in recent weeks refused an overdraft of any amount for housing or capital purposes.</P>
    <P>The corporation is faced with this difficulty and it is a difficulty that I am afraid cannot be overcome by the corporation itself because at no stage since any real effort was made to provide for houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Act has the corporation been able or has it been expected to raise this money from its own resources.  Other Deputies may be critical of the approach of the Dublin Deputies to these problems, but Deputies from the rural areas, as well as facing a somewhat smaller problem as regards housing, have always had a fairly clear issue.  They either got the money through the Local Loans Fund or they did not get it and, excepting our sister City of Cork, any local authority, whether a corporate body or a county council that desired to provide houses, not only got the sanction of the Minister for Local Government, but had the money provided from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>For some reason or another it was held many years ago that the corporation <Col N="1402" /> should try to raise their own finance but on every occasion the loans, whether by public subscription or, as in one case, a private loan, were under the absolute guarantee of the Government for the time being and the banks, and on no single occasion has the Government said that it is the corporation's duty, not only to go through the motions of raising the loan but to find the loan from its own resources.</P>
    <P>Housing in this country has never been a problem of a single local authority, nor has the decision to provide houses for our people been the decision of a single local authority.  The efforts made over the years were always under the direction, control and advice of the Minister for Local Government.  In 1948 the then Minister for Local Government set out to speed up the provision of housing. The assurance, given by him at that time, was that from whatever other cause, housing would not be slowed down through lack of finance.  That is an assurance which has been echoed from many sides of this House and it was in furtherance of that assurance and under the drive and guidance of the Department that local authorities throughout the country have carried out intensive campaigns to provide decent homes.</P>
    <P>There are two areas which still have a serious problem.  I do not know how serious the problem is in Cork but I do know that in Dublin we still face the necessity of providing something like 15,000 dwellings and we face immediately and in the next few years the very serious and urgent problem of completing the clearance and rebuilding of the central city areas.  Some 12,000 to 15,000 dwellings have been completed since 1948.  Many of the larger families have been housed, and I have no doubt Deputies in this House will be aware that day after day families residing on the outskirts of the city are seeking to be transferred nearer into the city where the fathers, sons and daughters can get to their work more easily.</P>
    <P>The city does show the effects of the intensive drive during the last few years and the programme over the next year or so contemplates the building <Col N="1403" /> of flats in very many areas.  But can we build flats in Dublin without money?  The corporation on the occasion it floated its last loan realised only the usual one-third of what is required out of that loan, but that £6,000,000 was sufficient only to cover their housing requirements to approximately 31st March, 1956, and we are well past that period now.  This, of course, is not a problem basically for Dublin at all.  Census after census of the last 30 years has shown a steady increase in the population of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>And as Deputy Briscoe remarks, not all a natural increase. You have only to walk through any housing area and Deputies from various parts of this House representing Cork or Mayo, Sligo or Donegal, will hear the familiar accents of people who a few years ago were residing in their own beautiful counties. Housing throughout the country and, in particular, in the City of Dublin, during the past five years, has provided useful employment, constructive employment, and not only directly for those men engaged on the development of the sites, or in the construction of the houses, but also for many thousands of men engaged in the manufacture or processing of the materials that go to make the houses and to make the furniture and fittings in them.  Not all of these live, or are employed, in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April of this year, some 2,000 men were employed on Dublin Corporation schemes and possibly another couple of thousand were employed in carrying out the very many schemes operating only because of the existence of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  If the position which we have reached to-day is allowed to continue, we will face a very serious crisis in Dublin, because not only will the housing programme be brought almost to a full stop within a matter of weeks, but the employment of the men on the schemes will also disappear, and we will then be faced with another census report showing the bricklayers and <Col N="1404" /> plasterers, carpenters and plumbers and plumbers' labourers out of work in Dublin and seeking work across the water.  But their families will remain here as these men have no means of taking them with them.</P>
    <P>We&mdash;and now I am speaking for Dublin Corporation&mdash;in Dublin Corporation have one ambition and that is to play our full part in ensuring that our citizens are housed in decent houses or decent flats.  We want to play our full part in trying to ensure that employment in the building trade in Dublin is kept at the highest level possible.  Too often in this House and elsewhere, discussions and disputes and differences between Dublin Corporation and the Department or the Minister for Local Government have been the subject of unnecessary and undesirable publicity.  Discussions both here and elsewhere have contributed not a little, in my opinion, to the position in which the corporation finds itself to-day.  It has been said time after time by various interests and in various places that Dublin Corporation is not a creditworthy body or a body which it would be safe to support in its public loan issues, and it is nearly always forgotten that the corporation carries out its activities as a result of the initiative, and in the name of, the national Government, because, without sanction from the Minister for Local Government, the corporation, or any local authority, cannot build a single house, and when the sanction is received in the case of a local authority down the country, unless the money is provided by the Minister, the scheme cannot go on.</P>
    <P>We are reaching the position in Dublin in which, unless the urgency of the problem facing us is realised, housing activities will slow down very rapidly.  I would not attempt to suggest where the necessary finance should be found, but I would impress on the Minister the necessity of ensuring that it is forthcoming and there should be an assurance that it will be forthcoming very rapidly.  At the present moment, proposals are in hands, either in the Department, or in the hands of the technical officers of the corporation, for the construction of <Col N="1405" /> flats in various sections of the City of Dublin, but these proposals must prove to be stillborn, unless the financial position is examined and dealt with as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>During the month of January of this year, it was estimated that our housing commitments, those already entered into, totalled a sum of £3,490,000 and that, in order to keep the continuity in the housing drive, it would be necessary to enter into further commitments totalling approximately £4,000,000 during this year in respect of housing schemes scheduled for the years 1956 and 1957.  At the present moment, the corporation has money neither for housing under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, nor for its own housing.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate on this Estimate last week, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy O'Donovan, referred to one of the corporation's difficulties, the fact that £160,000 odd would be necessary in order that applicants who did not qualify for grants out of the £1,000,000 made available by the Minister for Local Government might get money to complete contracts entered into by them with builders.  The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that it would be very easy to find £168,000 in the corporation's total estimates of approximately £8,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that if the Parliamentary Secretary were here, he would now agree that the suggestion was not a serious one, because the estimates for Dublin Corporation, like the estimates for other local bodies, have to go before the estimates committee and each item of proposed expenditure is set down under the appropriate heading&mdash;housing, engineering, health services, and so on, and it is the common experience that most of the items receive very careful scrutiny.  The suggestion that, even in a Budget of £8,000,000, one could get £160,000 for which the manager had no authority, is a suggestion that cannot be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Of course, the money could be obtained if the local authority in question were prepared to bring in a supplementary estimate, but as the Dublin Corporation act only as the messenger of the Department of Local Government in connection with housing under the Small Dwellings Acts, it would be ridiculous to suggest that they would put a special sum on the rates purely for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I should like to mention again.  It is the fact that the Department of Local Government has had proposals for site development work in the Finglas area since February of this year.  The Finglas area is the only area left in the city where houses can be built.  Even if finance is made available to-morrow, unless early sanction is granted to the proposals that are now with the Department, housing will come almost to a complete stop next year.  There are proposals to build flats in the centre of the city.  All of us who have some knowledge of the situation are in favour of building flats in the clearance areas.  We know, however, that it is one thing to propose to build a block of flats and it is another thing to get them constructed.  In the case of one development, we have been waiting for seven years, due to delays, acquisition costs, legal actions, etc.</P>
    <P>Might I, in conclusion, again assure the Minister that we in the corporation are actuated only by a desire to cooperate in the construction of houses for our people?  We have co-operated with every Government that ever existed in this country.  It is a peculiar thing that, generally speaking, while many differences exist between members on all sides of this House, even those who are members of local authorities, in the Dublin Corporation, we have always been at one in our desire to house our people.  Might I impress upon the Minister the urgency of the problem facing him and facing us?  If money is not made available under the Small Dwellings Act, serious unemployment will take place in the City of Dublin and will take place rapidly.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe and I frequently differ and I might say that one matter on which we differ is that I, as a Deputy and as a member of the Dublin Corporation, would never hold back a contract.  I would issue that contract.  I would issue it immediately because I believe it is the responsibility and has been the responsibility of the Central Government to see that the terms of the contract are carried out.  Issuing that contract, I would ensure that the responsibility could not be avoided.</P>
      <P>There are some 15,000 dwellings still required in the City of Dublin and at the rate of building which has obtained for some years, between 1,500 and 2,000 per annum, seven years is a conservative estimate of the time needed to complete them.  Of course, if we were able to arrive at the peak output of 2,500 per annum, we could complete them much more speedily.  On present output, and realising the many difficulties facing all concerned, I think seven years would be a conservative estimate of the period of time.  However, that seven years is conservative only if there is no pause and if, at no time during that period, building comes to a standstill.</P>
      <P>I fear the immediate future.  Therefore, I make this appeal on behalf not just of the corporation but of the citizens of Dublin, many of whom have been waiting years for a decent home, that the Minister will take every possible step to ensure that housing will not be held up for lack of finance.  His predecessor of 1948 gave this House and this city and this country that assurance and, up to the present time, that assurance has been honourably observed.  I feel that, in this year of 1956, it should not be departed from one iota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just another aspect of what can happen when things are not properly planned and when there has not been a proper organisation of the nation's business. It is simply another consequence of a <Col N="1408" /> Coalition which was a muddle in its inception and has now reduced the affairs of the country to its own level.</P>
      <P>The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy D. Larkin, has spoken in regard to Dublin's problems.  Mark you, he was talking only about Dublin's problems. He was restrained and, in his character not only as a Deputy of this House but also as Lord Mayor, it was right that he was restrained.  The facts which he has disclosed&mdash;and he dealt only with the housing aspect of the problem in any detail&mdash;are serious enough for a Legislature to take serious notice of and particularly for a Government to do something about.</P>
      <P>This is a problem for the capital city of the country&mdash;I think I could summarise what has been said rather shortly as follows.  Owing to the ineptitude with which our national affairs have been handled and the lack of coordination and proper guidance from the Government in the past two years in the handling of the country's affairs, here is what Dublin City is facing.</P>
      <P>The corporation is being informed that there will be no money available to them on overdraft for capital expenditure. In other words, the situation is being brought about&mdash;whatever be the cause, and perhaps some of the things Deputy Larkin mentioned in connection with credit have a bearing on it&mdash;that the corporation finds itself in the position that it is not able to call on what I might call normal or ordinary borrowing procedure.  As a consequence, there has been no money in the corporation exchequer for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts&mdash;and I need not digress on the details of that: they have already been sufficiently published.  In itself, that situation is a crisis, or amounts to a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that situation, the Government can do no better than say that it will give support to the expenditure of £3,000,000, which is nothing much more than underwriting a commitment of £3,000,000.  The present position is that that £3,000,000 is already practically completely earmarked.  Further, unless the Government is able to give the corporation, on foot of its promise, that money at a particular rate&mdash;I am <Col N="1409" /> told that if that money is not forthcoming at a certain monthly rate&mdash; then even what is in train at the present moment is in jeopardy, let alone providing for the things that should be provided for.</P>
    <P>I am not a member of the corporation but I am a Deputy for Dublin City and perhaps the fact that I am not a member of the corporation enables me to reinforce what has been said by those members of the corporation who are Deputies.  I have tried to get certain information from other quarters.  As I understand it, unless the money is made available at a certain monthly rate, it will not be possible to maintain the present schemes in progress.  Therefore, it would appear to me that there is something more than the present provisions needed and that whatever provision is made is already committed and that there is even a problem about the rate of payment.</P>
    <P>I believe the corporation has, in its own internal finances, been forced to use moneys temporarily&mdash;whatever way these things are balanced out&mdash;in respect of commitments which can be only temporary and that if they have to meet certain existing commitments in regard to housing they are going to go short on other employment content work.  There you have it.  You have the extraordinary position where, again typical of the ineptitude of the Government in office to-day, one Minister will gaily sanction something to be done but the Government, having sanctioned it, will not provide the money.  I understand that that is not a problem confined to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin commented on the improvement in the speed with which sanctions are coming forward.  He said they were able to get sanction.  There is a certain touch of irony about that statement.  They get the sanction, but no money.  Where is the money to come from to pay for the scheme? Strictly speaking, I think a local body could in that situation&mdash;as I think Deputy Larking suggested&mdash; actually go to the contract stage, but there would be no money to pay for the contract if the local body were to <Col N="1410" /> place the contract.  What would the situation then be?  Supposing things deteriorated to such a position that action of that sort should be contemplated, as apparently was suggested here by Deputy Larkin.  To my mind, it would destroy the last vestige of confidence in our public institutions if such a thing were to be attempted. Central Government cannot and should not attempt to evade its responsibilities by passing these burdens on to local authorities in this matter and, so to speak, passing the buck.  You have a scheme and you give the sanction, but there is no money.  You leave it to the local authority to stew in that juice.  That is, so far as I can see, very largely what the Government is doing in this situation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the details of the problem a little more closely.  I want to put a few things on record, just for the purpose of referring to them later. I shall take one area of the city&mdash;an area in the north central portion of the city.  There are schemes proposed as follows: In North King Street-Coleraine Street, proposals for 50 flats; Lower Dominick Street, 114; Upper Dominick Street, 130; Lower Dorset Street, 93; Hardwicke Street, 201; at present in the course of construction; Grenville Street, 58; Upper Wellington Street, 35; and Dorset Street-Frederick Street, 48.  That is a substantial housing programme in a restricted and narrow enough area. Some of that work is actually under way, as is the case in the Hardwicke Street area.  Some of the work is proposed and, in regard to the bulk of it, the sites have been cleared.  The area is derelict.  Part of Dominick Street has been cleared and acquired ready for a scheme.  I understand that a scheme has been prepared and is practically at the stage to go before the Minister, and the same might be said about other areas.</P>
    <P>What is the future of that?  There are serious consequences for the city arising from this situation under three separate heads.  First of all, and in general principle, there is the whole housing programme, as Deputy Larkin mentioned.  Twenty-five years ago, there was an acute slum problem in <Col N="1411" /> Dublin and there was an acute housing problem, and almost a century's work to be caught up with.  The Government of that time planned and put under way a scheme which has done a lot and moved a great distance towards supplying the housing needs of the city.  That scheme is not complete and cannot be until these present schemes have been completed. The first point is that there is in question and in jeopardy there a major part of our programme for national reconstruction, with particular reference to the capital city.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the specific details. In order to carry out that programme, it was necessary to make the arrangements for acquisition and clearing&mdash; the arrangements upon which building was to take place.  That clearing was not without its dislocations and inconveniences for certain people.  We all know how anxious people are to get back to the centre of the city, if they can.  We should not forget the problem of the shopkeepers and traders in these areas who have lost their customers and the urgent need in the interests of the prosperity of these areas to restore the population there.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when we have got to the stage of clearance and then stop and delay, we raise a number of other problems which in themselves are serious and need adjustment.  I have referred to one&mdash;the question of the traders and shopkeepers&mdash;but there is the whole question of the development of the area and the development of the city as a unit involved in the matter as a whole.  That is one aspect.</P>
    <P>The second aspect is the one with which the Lord Mayor dealt, the provision of housing where housing is needed.  There are still in parts of Dublin dwellings which are not of the standard we require in modern times for our people.  There is still in certain areas a certain amount of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>The third point is the employment content.  The provision of employment is also involved.  Again, on such figures as are available to me, it would appear that there was a labour force altogether available of somewhere <Col N="1412" /> round about the 15,000 mark employed directly or indirectly in connection with housing.  The corporation would have had about 2,500 direct.  The Small Dwellings Act, another 5,000, and then you had other works in regard to the balance.  Let us accept as a very approximate figure that there is reason to believe that something approximating to one-third of that figure have emigrated or lost their employment in that activity since this crisis came upon us in regard to housing in Dublin.</P>
    <P>That is also something which cannot be ignored.  It was only last Sunday I was told in the Hardwicke Street area, where building is actually in progress, that there appeared to be a slowing down in the tempo of the development there and that, in fact, there appeared to be fewer men employed on the site. I think I have said enough to indicate, following on the other speakers, that there is a problem here which is serious enough to demand immediate action on the part of the Government. That this situation has developed and has been allowed to develop is something which must be charged against this Government, and against this Minister, as part of the Government.</P>
    <P>For too long we had the optimistic statements, the hope that something would turn up.  We had the situation in this regard as in other regards&mdash; something like what we had in regard to the tea: hoping for the best and putting it on the long finger.  Then, when the thing happened, it was worse than it need have been.</P>
    <P>This is being talked about and argued.  It has been the subject of serious concern to Dublin Corporation for a number of months past.  Belatedly the Government announced the underwriting, as you might call it, of £3,000,000 for the corporation.  That, as I have said, has not solved the problem, and the position now is that the Minister can no longer afford to delay an announcement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister must say whether building is to continue and, accordingly, whether people are to be kept in employment.  If progress is not to be halted the finances must be found. If the finances are not found then it <Col N="1413" /> is imperative that the situation be clarified definitely.  Meanwhile, you have the uncertainty, the unemployment, the emigration that is resulting from this situation.  Apart from anything else there is the difficulty that has been caused to the local administrators in Dublin in the handling of affairs in the city.  You have a situation in which it will be extremely difficult for local authorities to carry on at all in this atmosphere of uncertainty and buck passing that has emanated from the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to finish on this note: This position is the logical culmination of the policy that started in 1948 with the first Coalition Government. At that time many of us warned, and were laughed at, against the device the Government were adopting to avoid putting loads on the central Government by passing them on to local authorities.  There was obviously a limit to what could be done in that direction.  That limit has now been exceeded.  The Fine Gael Party is mainly responsible for it.  What is this Fine Gael Minister in this Government doing about it?  That is the question that the people of Dublin&mdash; not only the corporators but the people who are paying higher rates than ever before&mdash;are asking.  They see greater unemployment, they see the provisions of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts are being stopped and where the people already committed to these things are finding it hard to meet their commitments because of unemployment caused by such situations as the closing down recently of the motor assembly factory. There is also the slowing down in the building trade.  I do not think the Minister can let the occasion pass without clarifying the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I want to make some brief remarks concerning one of his responsibilities&mdash;the administration of the Road Traffic Act.  The Minister need not be perturbed; I think he will get his Estimate this evening.  Some weeks ago, there was a private member's motion dealing with road traffic tables which stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" />&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the increasing congestion of traffic on the roads and of the large number of fatal and serious accidents, the Government should without delay bring before the Dáil comprehensive proposals for dealing with the problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion was tabled following a discussion in our Party on the position regarding road traffic, and when the announcement was made that the Estimate for the Department of Local Government was to be discussed, a request was made to the Minister, through the Whips, that the motion should be taken in conjunction with the Estimate.  The Minister could not see his way to do that, and I can understand his reluctance in view of the variety of matters that arise on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is the view of my Party that the matter should not be allowed to rest until the motion would be taken in the normal course of Dáil business. That might not be for a year hence and the debate on the Estimate for Local Government gives us the only opportunity we have of expressing our concern about the position and our view as to the urgency of the need to do something about it.  The existing Road Traffic Act was passed in 1933 and, since then, there has been an enormous increase in the number of vehicles on the roads.  The speeds of motor vehicles have also increased considerably since then.</P>
    <P>The problem is growing year after year and it is clear it cannot be allowed to go any longer, without receiving the very serious attention of the Government of the day.  In other matters Deputies opposite occasionally ask, when proposals are made from this side of the House, why action in the matters mentioned was not taken by the previous Government.  That argument does not arise here.  It is a growing problem.  It is difficult to say at what stage this road traffic problem reached the dimensions which called for early action.  It is one that is growing continuously and one that will grow still further as time goes on.</P>
    <P>This motion, which was tabled at the <Col N="1415" /> instance of the Fianna Fáil Party, refers to comprehensive proposals.  We realise that, in dealing with this matter of road traffic problems, new legislation alone is not sufficient.  The problems associated with road traffic arise under the head of legislation, under the head of administraiton, under the head of enforcement of regulations and, to some extent, under the head of roads policy.  The Minister is not concerned with many of these matters, but he is with some of them. We must face the fact that the number of motor vehicles on our roads has increased for many years past at the rate of 10 per cent. per year.  According to the Budget Estimate, the Minister for Finance is assuming an even greater rate of increase this year, because he has based his expectation of revenue for the Road Fund on the assumption of an increase of up to 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Whether that expectation will be realised in face of the circumstances that have since developed is another question, but it is obvious the problem will not diminish.  Apart altogether from the continuing and substantial increase in the number of motor vehicles, a very special problem has been raised by the much more spectacular increase in the number of motor cycles.  Their number is increasing by 100 per cent. per year and that creates a special problem of its own. The Minister has announced his intention to introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Road Traffic Act of 1933.  However, I do not know how serious that intention is.  There is no sign of the action on the part of the Government which would normally be expected, if that intention were serious, to arouse public interest in this problem and to provoke public debate on the provisions which should be embodied in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>No doubt the public are very much concerned about the position.  They note the steady increase in road accidents; the number of fatal and nonfatal accidents is increasing in almost direct proportion to the increases in the number of vehicles.  The public are aware of the increasing congestion of <Col N="1416" /> traffic in city streets, but they have not yet begun to debate in a public way among themselves the course of action which should be taken in regard to these matters or the type of legislation most suitable.  Public debate in advance of the introduction of legislation can only be helpful to the Minister. It is probably true to say, as has been said, that the enforcement of regulations is even more important than the changing or extension of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I said earlier to-day in another debate that the Government is always moved by political motives.  Perhaps in this matter they do not see political advantage.  I want to say that if they think that they are very much mistaken. I believe there is a tremendous amount of public goodwill to be secured by any Government that goes out rigorously to enforce the traffic regulations and to secure the added safety and greater degree of order in the streets which rigorous enforcement of the regulations would secure.  We know that although the number of motor vehicles on the road has increased at this 10 per cent. per annum rate the number of Gardaí has not increased at all, and the number of Gardaí on traffic duties is not much larger to-day than it was many years ago when the number of motor vehicles and the dimensions of the traffic problems were a great deal less.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is not responsible for the activities of the Gardaí, and perhaps something can be said on that aspect of the problem in the debate for the Department of Justice, but he is in this position, that under the Road Traffic Act he makes a number of regulations and is, therefore, indirectly responsible for ensuring that those regulations are, in fact, enforced.  There is no sense in making them if they are not going to be enforced.</P>
    <P>The Minister authorises local authorities to erect traffic lights and other road traffic signs, and these things are very valuable.  They are observed and obeyed by the great majority of road users in their own interests.  But it would not be an exaggeration to say that in the City <Col N="1417" /> of Dublin those traffic lights and signs are ignored and the regulations relatting to them disobeyed a thousand times an hour without the offenders being detected or punished, and that is because of inadequate Garda supervision. Indeed, there is reason to suspect that in recent times there has been a falling off in the effort to enforce the Road Traffic Acts.  There is a very striking contrast between the statistics of the number of motor vehicles on the road, and the number of prosecutions for road traffic offences.  Although the number of vehicles has increased, and is increasing, at the rate of 10 per cent. per year, and the number of fatal and nonfatal accidents is increasing at the same rate, the number of prosecutions for road traffic offences is falling. Figures have only been published up to 1954.  In 1952, there were 78,800 prosecutions for offences under the Road Traffic Act.  In 1953 there were 75,020, and in 1954 there were only 58,653.  That is to say that although between 1952 and 1954 there was a 10 per cent. increase in the congestion of the traffic on the roads and the number of vehicles in use, and in the number of accidents, the number of prosecutions, cases taken to court, for offences against the regulations fell by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>It may be of assistance to the Minister in this matter to get from the representative of the Party in Opposition an indication of the things we think should be done in order to bring about improvement in the situation. First of all, there is the question of driving tests.  We have come to the conclusion that it is wrong to allow a situation to continue in which any person can get a licence to take a motor vehicle on the road without being subjected to some test&mdash;first of all a test of his competency to control the vehicle, and secondly, a test of his knowledge of the Road Traffic Regulations. That matter of the institution of a driving test was, of course, considered 25 years ago when the present legislation was being considered, and there was a great deal of argument <i>pro</i> and <i>con.</i>  Ultimately the decision was against it.  But the change in circumstances since, the considerable <Col N="1418" /> expansion in the number of vehicles on the road and the considerable increase in the speeds and sizes of some vehicles, do, in our view, justify the reopening of the issue.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that the operation of the system of driving tests by other countries has tended to minimise traffic accidents and to secure better conduct on the road.  It is recognised that there are, of course, a very large number of motor drivers, some of them perhaps not very competent, who have licences already, and it would probably be impracticable from an administrative point of view to apply a driving test to everybody seeking a renewal of a licence.  A driving test should, however, in our view be made a condition of the issue of a new licence, and the Gardaí should, we think, have a right to require any licensed driver, whose competence they have reason to suspect, to submit himself to a test.</P>
    <P>In that connection, perhaps not quite relevant but nevertheless associated with the problem, there is the question of the duration of driving licences.  At the present time a licence is issued annually, and every driver must renew his licence annually.  We note that in Britain under recent legislation it is possible to get a licence for three years.  I think there is something to be said for permitting that to happen here, for giving to approved persons, qualified to receive a licence, a licence for a three year period.  It probably would reduce considerably the administrative expenses involved in the issue of licences.</P>
    <P>The next suggestion we have to make concerns the publication in some way, so that they will be brought to the notice of all licensed drivers, of the road traffic regulations.  The Minister has made, under the Road Traffic Act of 1933, a series of regulations governing the conduct of people and vehicles on the roads.  I think it is probably true to say that not one driver in a hundred has ever seen those regulations in print, and a very high percentage of them appear not to know that there are regulations there at all.  We think that there should be published a suitable handbook, <Col N="1419" /> equivalent to the Highway Code in Britain, which would be brought to the attention of all persons receiving driving licences, and that the test for receiving a licence should include, not merely competence in the control of a vehicle but knowledge of the highway code.  A handbook of that kind, a code of rules governing conduct on the road, could not be given the exact force of a statute, but it could be provided in the legislation that evidence of a breach of the rules prescribed would be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of dangerous driving or driving without due consideration to other road users.</P>
    <P>That is particularly needed, I think, in the case of motor-cycle owners.  One of the complications of our road traffic problems is the very rapid increase in the number of motor-cycles, the 100 per cent. per year extension in that aspect of the problem.  It is true to say that the great majority of those who operate motor-cycles are younger people.  It is a mode of conveyance that does not recommend itself to people after they have passed a certain period of life, and traditionally those who are younger are more inclined to take chances, to their own risk as well as to the risk of pedestrians and other road users.  It is, I think, particularly necessary to bring to the notice of those people the rules that should govern their conduct on the roads.</P>
    <P>There is also in the City of Dublin and most Irish cities a special problem relating to pedal cyclists.  It is, I think, generally believed that the Gardaí have more or less abandoned the effort to impose order upon pedal cyclists particularly at the rush hours in the city.  Mark you, the great majority of cyclists are very well behaved on the road and exercise extreme discretion and caution because they are the most likely sufferers in any traffic accident.  Some 26 per cent. of the people who have been killed or injured on the roads in recent years have been pedal cyclists.  It is also true to say that there is a minority who act without due consideration and it is, I think, to be emphasised that some 20 per cent. of the pedestrians who are killed or injured on the road <Col N="1420" /> are killed or injured by pedal cyclists and not in accidents involving motor cars at all.</P>
    <P>There is need to consider the regulations that should govern the operation of pedal cyclists in the city and to consider also the machinery of enforcement which will prove effective in ensuring that inconsiderate or dangerous conduct will be checked.  It is also desirable in our view to bring in some system of testing the mechanical efficiency of vehicles.  It should be possible to provide for the recognition of garages throughout the country where suitable testing apparatus would be maintained and where the proprietors would be authorised to issue licences of mechanical efficiency.  Every motor vehicle should after a period&mdash;what the period might be is a matter for consideration&mdash;be subjected to test of mechanical efficiency and the Gardaí should have power to require any vehicle they thought suspect to be submitted to a test of mechanical efficiency.  They have that power at present so far as public service vehicles are concerned; but, in our view, the power should be taken also to cover vehicles of all kinds and particularly vehicles which are in constant use for commercial purposes.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems which has been discussed in the Dáil on previous occasions and which is, indeed, often a matter of public debate is the problem of &ldquo;drunk driving&rdquo;; in that regard I think the Minister should give very serious consideration to the wording of the statute.  The present statute makes it an offence for a person to be in control of a car when, through drink, he is in such a condition that he is incapable of exercising effective control over such vehicle while in motion.  Now that word &ldquo;incapable&rdquo; has, as the Minister knows and as Deputies are aware, been frequently used as a means of escape when persons are charged with being drunk in charge of a car.  It is desirable that we should seek to amend that phrase so as to make it an offence for a person to be in charge of a car when he has, through drink, put himself in the condition that he cannot exercise due care <Col N="1421" /> in its operation.  We think that the existing phraseology is too tight and it does not deal with all the problems associated with the control of motor vehicles operated by drivers when under the influence of drink.</P>
    <P>In the legislation of some countries it is provided that conviction for drunk driving involves automatic imprisonment. It is, I believe, contrary to legal principles here to provide for minimum penalties and there probably is good reason for that viewpoint.  The existing law does provide for the automatic cancellation of driving licences on conviction for drunk driving. Probably it is not desirable to go further than that.  But the Minister might consider whether it is not practicable to depart from the normal practice in this case and provide for automatic minimum penalties, including imprisonment, where conviction for drunkenness in charge of a car has been secured.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to mention is that of speed limits.  Again, the question of imposing maximum speed limits was debated very fully here when the Road Traffic. Act, 1933, was before the House.  At that time there was a body of opinion which felt that the provisions of the existing law at the time, which provided for maximum speeds for motor vehicles, should be retained even if the prescribed speeds were amended.  There was another body of opinion which held that speed in itself was not dangerous: it was speed in relation to all the surrounding circumstances, and the law was framed on the basis of that view and does not provide for maximum speeds for ordinary motor vehicles.  There are maximum speeds, which are perhaps out of date, prescribed under the law for public service and other commercial vehicles; and a local authority can, through a process, secure the prescription of maximum speeds for certain roads or in certain districts.</P>
    <P>In our view there should be maximum speeds prescribed for all types of motor traffic in built-up areas.  Now the term &ldquo;built-up areas&rdquo; is used in Britain and it is not perhaps altogether the most suitable for our circumstances here because our traffic <Col N="1422" /> congestion is not yet as great as it is in Britain.  But in the centre city streets and particularly in those which are not so wide maximum speeds are undoubtedly a contribution to safety and are likely to facilitate movement of traffic as well, even though they may not be prescribed for some other streets or roads which are also technically perhaps within a built-up area. Whether the speed limits are confined to built-up areas as a whole or whether different speeds are prescribed for different highways in the built-up areas is a matter upon which we have no fixed view.  Our view is, however, that the time has come when it is desirable to prescribe maximum speeds for motor vehicles in centre city areas at least.</P>
    <P>In many cities in Europe legislation has already been enacted prohibiting the sound of motor horns in towns at any time or after midnight.  Deputies who have travelled abroad will, I think, agree with me that on the whole the prohibition of the sounding of motor horns has contributed to safety. The elimination of the driver who depended upon his horn rather than his brake has meant that greater caution is exercised but, apart altogether from the safety element, there is a feeling that the sounding of motor horns in the city area after midnight should be prohibited.  There is another observation I might make in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is power, I think, for the Minister to prescribe or make regulations controlling the noise of motor vehicles.  I do not know what the scope of these regulations are or how they are enforced but I think it is certainly all wrong that a single individual on a motor bicycle can go roaring through the City of Dublin at 2 o'clock in the morning and wake up 250,000 people. There should either be a revision of the regulations, if they are not strict enough, or an enforcement of the regulations, if they are, in order to prevent undue disturbance of the public at night in that way.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion we would put forward for consideration is that the registered owner of a motor vehicle should be legally responsible for the <Col N="1423" /> manner in which the vehicle is operated. It is a problem for the Gardaí when they are trying to enforce the regulations that they have to prove not merely that the regulations were broken but that the individual charged was responsible for the operation of the car at the time that the breach occurred.  One will see a Garda on duty, controlling parking in the city, waiting beside a car until the person who drove it into the parking area in contravention of the parking regulations turns up, so that he can be identified by name.  That need not be necessary. I think the law could be amended to provide that the Garda can note the offence merely by recording the registration number of the car, and the owner of the car should be made legally responsible for the way it is controlled, so that prosecution can follow merely by the Garda giving evidence that the car with that registration number was involved in the offence.</P>
    <P>As regards road policy, there are a few suggestions which we have been debating.  In Britain, in the less frequented streets they had installed what are known as zebra crossings&mdash; places where the pedestrian has the right to cross the road and where all traffic must stop to enable the pedestrian to cross the road.  There may be need to consider the whole basis of our law in that regard.  As I understand it, our existing law provides that the pedestrian has prior right on the roadways and can, in theory, cross the road when, where and how he likes.  Many of them do not choose to exercise that right, because they are rather apprehensive of the consequences. Perhaps we might reconsider that problem, in relation to the busier streets on the one hand to ensure there is not unnecessary interruption of traffic as well as the safety of pedestrians and in the less busy streets of the city by giving the pedestrian the right which I mention, the right to stop the traffic to cross the road at specified places.</P>
    <P>In continental cities, the practice has been established that the pedestrian <Col N="1424" /> is controlled by traffic lights. Here he is not.  There the pedestrian has to obey the lights and I may say that I myself was once very nearly arrested for not doing so not so very long ago.  As any Dublin citizen would, I exercised my right to step off when I thought fit and I very nearly found myself in the lock-up.  In some places, they have special pedestrian crossing lights where the pedestrian is shown by the lights the time he can cross the road.  Whether that is practicable or desirable in Dublin is another question.  Consideration should be given to the basis of our law prescribing pedestrian rights on the road and to the giving of the facilities which are extended in Britain at zebra crossings to ensure that the pedestrian can cross in the prescribed places and that the traffic will stop.  It is true in Britain that there was a number of casualties when these zebra crossings were introduced first but the courts imposed such severe penalties for a breach of that regulation that there is now very little risk in Britain when a pedestrian exercises his right in that way.</P>
    <P>There is also probably need to revise the system of one-way streets and to increase considerably the number of one-way streets, particularly in the centre of Dublin, where many of the main and busiest streets are.  I presume that the Minister and his Department are giving consideration to the problem of parking facilities.  It is quite obvious we are reaching a stage in Dublin in which either the provision of some special parking facilities in the middle of the city will have to be considered, or, alternatively, people will have to be prohibited from parking their cars at all in many of the narrower city streets and the enforcement of that regulation taken in hand.  I suppose that at the busy time of the day one would hardly see a &ldquo;no waiting&rdquo; sign in Dublin without a car parked under it.  Progress through many streets is, therefore, considerably curtailed.  That is a matter for the local authorities, but the Minister should consider whether the provisions of the Act require amendment so as to extend the powers of the local authorities in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> As regards roads outside Dublin, I think it is true to say that the great majority of our main roads are quite good enough for the traffic on them at the present time, but I think we must assume that the traffic will continue to increase, and, in the planning of our road policy ahead, we must allow for that increase.  In one respect, that is not true.  For about ten miles outside Dublin, the traffic congestion on most of the main roads is such that they are now inadequate to enable that traffic to move freely and without undue risk. I gather there is a plan for double-carriage roadways on these main traffic routes outside Dublin and there was a statement made by the county manager of Kildare last week in that connection.</P>
    <P>The need for these roads may have been a matter of some controversy some years ago, but I think few Deputies who have put the matter to the test will not agree that the continuing increase in road traffic is now making it a necessity to provide for dual carriage-way roads on all our main traffic arteries outside Dublin for a distance of ten or 15 miles.  Beyond that, most of our main roads are quite good enough for the amount of traffic they have to carry at the moment.  The only obligation resting on the Minister in that respect is to take into account that at the present rate of progress the number of cars will have multiplied by 50 per cent. in five years and at that stage some revision of our roads programme to meet the increase in traffic may be necessary.</P>
    <P>These are the matters which, in the view of the Party in Opposition, the Government should consider when framing this legislation, and we want to urge that the legislation should not be delayed.  As far as we are concerned, we are prepared to give the Government every facility in securing its enactment and to co-operate wholeheartedly with them in ensuring that the proposals they bring to the Dáil will be effective to their purpose and generally agreed as far as the Parties in this House are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am sure the House will pardon me if I deal <Col N="1426" /> with the points raised by Deputy Lemass a moment ago.  Let me say at the outset that I welcome his criticism and that I am in full agreement with everything he says.  Deputy Giles raised the same point earlier in the debate.  Any serious-minded person is concerned with the fatalities which are occurring on the roads of this country, and not only with that, but with the number of people who are being maimed for life in accidents on our roads.  But no matter what regulations we make, no matter what bylaws are made, no matter what legislation is introduced and passed in this House, unless those bylaws are enforced and unless those regulations are enforced, the legislation they rest on is all for nought.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the regulations at present in force, were they duly enforced and were they duly respected by every motorist, cyclist and pedestrian in this country, would seriously reduce the number of accidents which are occurring.  As I said in moving the Vote, revised regulations on traffic signs, pursuant to the powers conferred by the Local Government Act, 1955, are being prepared.  It is hoped that in a very short time we will have international road signs&mdash;road signs which will be common to all countries in Europe, Great Britain and Ireland &mdash;and we are at a very advanced stage at the moment with the preparation of these signs.  We also hope, when the new regulations come into force, to issue a leaflet, as suggested by Deputy Lemass.  I am publishing a road safety booklet setting out the various regulations which should be enforced and recognised by pedestrians, motorists and cyclists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass talked about a driving test.  There is a lot to be said for and there is a lot to be said against it.  For instance, a man may succeed in a driving test when he first applies for a licence at the age of 60.  But one can imagine, as he grows older, his eyesight may deteriorate and he may deteriorate physically himself; and I think that a test given to him when his driver's licence was originally issued would not suffice to ensure he was a proper driver after, say, three or four years.  We should consider <Col N="1427" /> whether or not there should be a test every three, four, five or six years.  In Britain, they have a driving test. Every driver must pass this test prior to receiving his driver's licence, but we find that, proportionately speaking, we have a lesser number of accidents in this country in relation to the percentage of cars on the road than in Britain, where they have driving tests.</P>
    <P>Remember also that in this country we have a driving test in certain cases, for instance, in the case of all drivers of small public service vehicles and of large public service vehicles, such as buses.  They have these driving tests and I am sorry to say that, proportionately speaking, as many accidents occur to those drivers who have these driving tests as occur to the others who receive licences merely on filling in the application form.  It is very difficult to say whether driving tests will reduce the number of road accidents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also referred to the mechanical efficiency of motor cars. We also have in this country an examination of small public service vehicles and of large public service vehicles, but how often do we find that after an accident the brakes or some other part of such vehicles were found to be inefficient?  If you have, say, an examination once a year on vehicles which subsequently do 60,000 or 65,000 miles a year, you can imagine the deterioration in the mechanism of the vehicle. The question then arises as to how often these vehicles should be examined, every 5,000 miles, every 10,000 miles or every six months.  It is difficult to say, and I do not think having an efficiency test for mechanical vehicles would reduce the number of accidents.</P>
    <P>With regard to speed limits, there again we are up against it.  For instance, a Baby Ford travelling say at 20 miles per hour might be much more dangerous than a Dodge or a V8 travelling at 60 or 70 miles per hour.  On the Continent, I understand, there are no speed limits and we all have our eyes opened when we arrive in Paris and see the speed at which the vehicles travel there; still in the City of Paris <Col N="1428" /> we have fewer accidents, proportionately speaking, than in the City of London or in the City of Dublin.  It is a question of educating the driver, educating the pedestrian and the cyclist into seeing that they themselves will not commit breaches of these regulations, and inculcating into them a road sense.</P>
    <P>Silent zones were also referred to by Deputy Lemass.  Under the bylaws which are made by the Commissioner of the Garda with the concurrence of the Minister for Local Government, they have power to create silent zones. The Deputy also referred to the noise in the City of Dublin after 12 o'clock. He would want to reside in a country village where there is a dance-hall and where at night the driver is trying to collect his passengers after the dance, where there are 30 or 40 motor-cars with horns blowing at the one time and where a resident cannot get silence at night in his own home.  The Garda, I must say, in cases where there is persistent horn blowing by these drivers do prosecute and very often these drivers are convicted by the district justice if it is considered that the blowing of the horn was unreasonable. There is a lot to be said for silent zones and perhaps their enforcement in certain areas might be considered in the making of new bylaws.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also referred to the registered owner being responsible for the operation of the car.  I do not think he has given serious thought to this.  It is hard for a Guard to stand beside a car or beside where a car is parking for an hour and be able to say who was the person who parked the car; maybe the person who takes it away is not the person who parked it. But if the registered owner was responsible, say in the case of an army driver, would the Minister for Defence be responsible for his reckless or careless driving or in the case of a State car would the Minister for Finance be responsible for the manner in which one of the drivers drove the car on the public highway?  Again take the case of a limited company or take C.I.E.  Would C.I.E. be responsible for the driving of their employees?  If they were I am afraid the employees <Col N="1429" /> would be less careful than they are.  I believe there is no greater deterrent to reckless driving than the fact that the person driving is amenable to the law for the manner in which he drives a vehicle.</P>
    <P>The question was also raised by Deputy Lemass as to whether our main roads are adequate to carry our traffic.  I wonder did we reduce the number of accidents in any way by straightening the roads and widening the corners?  If we took the census of accidents on the road between Dublin and Naas, I wonder to what conclusion we would come?  I am afraid we are making the roads a little more dangerous by making these speedways which we have been developing in the past.  Particularly in night driving, as some Deputy has pointed out, unless you have a dual carriageway, a straight road is dangerous because one vehicle is inclined to blind the driver of the oncoming vehicle and there is a really serious danger from that point of view.  There is something to be said for the introduction of the yellow light on all our public roadways but then our roadways may not be suitable to the type of lighting such as they have on the Continent or in parts of Britain.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the suggestions that were made by the Deputy.  I think they are most constructive and they will receive the serious consideration both of my Department and, I am sure, the Department of Justice and the Commissioner of the Garda.  I would also like to thank the various daily papers for the leading articles and the constructive suggestions which they have made in connection with this matter.  I can assure you that I have given the whole question my personal thought and I have set out certain instructions in connection with it.  I have requested the co-operation of the Department of Justice in the enforcement of these regulations and bylaws and we are doing our best to eliminate accidents on the public highway. At the same time, as I say, when we have these new regulations drafted and the booklet issued, we hope that not only will the Garda endeavour to enforce the regulations <Col N="1430" /> but that the District Court justices will ensure that, where penalties are imposed, they will be imposed in accordance with the seriousness of the offence.  I think the present Minister for Justice should be congratulated on the stand he has taken in refusing to restore licences to convicted drunken drivers.  He is breaking precedent in that respect but I think he deserves the thanks of this House and of the people of the country generally for the stand he has taken.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of points have been raised during this debate. I shall try to deal with each Deputy in turn in relation to the various points he has raised, some of which are local and others of which are national.  First of all, Deputy Bartley referred to the note regarding capital services at the beginning of the Book of Estimates and asked whether the amount shown under Capital Services should be added to the amount shown in the individual Estimates themselves. The answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and the note at the beginning of the Book of Estimates makes that clear.  It says: &ldquo;The total of capital services included in the Estimates for Supply Services is, as indicated on the title page, £11,602,470.&rdquo;  Now there is also a cross index and a person can usually see where these items are included in the individual Estimates.  I think it was the same Deputy who referred to the extent of the discussion on roads. Actually my Estimate contains no provision for roads at all.  Local authorities defray about half the expenditure on roads of every description.  There has been no mention of roads in my Estimate for the simple reason that any State contributions to the local authority for road improvement or otherwise comes out of the Road Fund and not out of the Estimate with which we are now dealing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch of Waterford raised the question of tourist road grants and inquired whether the counties to benefit are defined.  They are defined. They are the Gaeltacht areas and the congested areas.  I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that Waterford gets a contribution from the Gaeltacht road fund in respect of that very fine Gaeltacht, Ring.  The contribution, I <Col N="1431" /> admit, is small but unfortunately so also is the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy and Deputy Esmonde complained that too much land was taken up for road works and that the road margins are frequently far too wide.  With that point of view I am in full agreement.  I have endeavoured, as best I can, to eliminate the acquisition of land except in certain places where it is clear that in addition to the road improvement now being done, further improvements may be needed later.  So far as I am concerned, I have let it be known that my policy is to eliminate the superfluous cutting of corners.  I think that far too much money is being spent on that.  I hope in future that, as a result of my declared policy, less land will be acquired for the making of roads except in the cases to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Brennan and other Deputies pleaded for more expenditure on county roads.  He also suggested that the policy I am now endeavouring to implement is the policy of my predecessor. I am not unaware of the fact that Deputy Smith increased the grants for county roads out of the income from the Road Fund when it began to improve but I can take credit for increasing the grant from £1,700,000 to £2,200,000 in the last financial year and to £2,400,000 in the present financial year.  Thus, the county road improvement grant was, last year, £500,000 more than it was in 1954-55 and in the present year it is £700,000 more than in 1954-55.  The House will see that I am actually implementing what Deputy Brennan asked me to do.  That has been my declared policy since I took over the office of Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney referred to the wearing of crash helmets.  Possibly I should have referred to that in reply to Deputy Lemass.  It was stated that the wearing of crash helmets was obligatory in England.  I am not aware of that but I am aware that various manufacturers are endeavouring to improve not only the design but also the material used in crash helmets.  It <Col N="1432" /> would be premature at this stage to bring in a regulation compelling motor-cyclists, or even ordinary cyclists, to wear crash helmets, although I would suggest, without making it obligatory, that motorcyclists should wear such helmets.  I hope the day will arrive when an ideal standard of crash helmet, both from the point of view of material and design, can be evolved.  When it is, I hope it will be compulsory for all cyclists to wear them for their own safety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett suggested that hotels should be prevented from putting up signs which might be confused with certain road signs.  With that I am in agreement but the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána has power to make regulations to prevent the display of these signs.  When the international signs to which I referred become operative in this country and elsewhere there will be no danger of confusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully discussed the question of working overtime in the long evenings in order to get surface dressing done during fine weather.  I do not want to be drawn into this controversy at all but all Deputies will appreciate that a good deal of money could be lost were we to surface our tarred roads during wet weather.  I think it is really desirable that we should take advantage of the good weather.  I am not going to enter into a discussion on the matter.  I am merely expressing a point of view when I say that I think advantage should be taken of the good weather to get on with the tarring of the roads.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes, they are usually executed during the winter months. The Deputy advocated that they should be executed during the summer months.  Road work goes on during those months and takes up the greater portion of the year, but in special cases I am prepared to sanction grants for the Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes during the summer months, schemes such as drainage works which could not possibly be done during the winter months.  I had application made to sanction schemes during <Col N="1433" /> the early harvest.  I granted permission to continue with the execution of these schemes during the summer months and I propose doing the same this year when a special case is made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles referred to the rebuilding of Enfield Bridge.  I am aware that this is a very serious matter.  A grant was made available for the rebuilding of this bridge.  Unfortunately, certain difficulties have arisen with regard to the acquisition of land for it.  Then, there is the question of diverting traffic while the bridge is in process of being built.  That is a serious matter.  As the House knows, this is a road on which there has been considerable traffic congestion and it is very difficult to divert the traffic.  The local authority are preparing schemes and when they are submitted I shall make no delay in sanctioning them.  The planning of the bridge itself is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to what they described as the raid on the Road Fund.  I propose referring very briefly indeed to the matter.  It is a matter which will be raised with the Minister for Finance and I thought it would be raised on the Finance Bill to-day but no Deputy, other than Deputy Lemass, offered himself on this particular subject.  Very many times in this House, we have criticised the policy of my predecessor in spending money on the cutting of turns and the widening of the main roads.  I have endeavoured to reverse that policy.  I have endeavoured to divert to the county roads the money which was being spent on what have been called the autobahns.  Actually, this year I have increased the county road allocation by £200,000.</P>
    <P>Any money that has been taken out of the Road Fund has been taken out, first of all, for capital investment and if it were left there it would be expended on the elimination of these expensive turns.  Deputy Smith justified his action in the widening of certain roads.  He instanced the road between Navan and Cavan and said he thought it was a good thing to do. Personally, I think all main roads are quite good, We must bring the county roads up to a certain standard.  I also <Col N="1434" /> think that housing, land improvement and capital investment are much more essential than the cutting of these corners and the making of these autobahns. I think it is a good thing to divert £500,000 for capital investment. I would like to see our housing and land improved to the standard of our main roads.  If they are, then we will be able to review the situation.</P>
    <P>I make no apology at all for being a member of a Government which took £500,000 for capital investment out of the Road Fund which would have gone into the improvement of these trunk roads and main roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, but I am saying that it is much better to divert it to housing and give it to the local authority to expend on housing and other capital investments which are absolutely essential and which are lagging far behind the main roads to which the Deputy referred.  As I pointed out, I have stepped up this year by £200,000 the allocation for county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to sanitary services, I think that most of the criticism referred to local schemes.  Deputy Gilbride said that no progress was made on the North Sligo regional water supply scheme for the past two years.  The Deputy is well aware that this is a regional scheme and I think the only difference between the Deputy and the local authority and myself is that he wanted to start at one end and the local authority decided to start at another.  I have personal experience of regional water schemes. <Col N="1435" /> One in my own county was started somewhere in the early thirties and is not yet completed, but, certainly, it is an ideal scheme and will reach out into all the localities and all the areas for which the original scheme was planned, and I have no doubt that the North Sligo regional water supply scheme will reach out to the area in which Deputy Gilbride is particularly interested.  A start must be made in some place and we must depend on the engineering advice tendered to us as to where that start should be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley raised the question of the Costello regional water supply, as he did last year.  I really do not know what I can say with regard to this scheme.  Certain provisions of the Water Supplies Act, 1942, were not complied with in connection with the council's proposals to acquire certain water rights compulsorily.  I sanctioned the scheme, but the mere fact that a Minister sanctions a scheme should not in itself prohibit the local authority from changing their mind.  I understand that water of fair quantity and quality was met at borings made at Banroughbaun and Derrough.  Fair quantity and quality was met at a depth of seven and 15 feet in these places.  As I said before, the mere fact that a Minister sanctions a scheme should not compel the local authority to proceed with it.  If they wish they are entitled to change their mind and proceed with borings elsewhere or with alternative plans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney referred to the water supply scheme for Fanad and he said that I was impeding the water supply scheme for this locality.  That is not so.  That statement is incorrect.  The Fanad scheme has not yet been designed and, therefore, there is no question of my Department approving or withdrawing approval in connection with the scheme.  I am most anxious that the Donegal County Council should get on with the preparation of the plan and the design.</P>
    <P>As I stated in reply to a parliamentary question on 25th April last, it is intended by the Government that a new assessment of the extent of the Fior-Ghaeltacht should be made and <Col N="1436" /> that the returns furnished in the recent census should be taken into account for that purpose.  The case of Fanad West will receive the fullest consideration in the light of these returns when they become available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney knows, as I stated in reply to that parliamentary question, that if a regional scheme, designed primarily to cater for the Fior-Ghaeltacht, includes portion of the Fanad West district, on engineering grounds, I would consider that that portion had a case for preferential treatment.  I made that very clear when I replied to the parliamentary question.  I think it was actually on the Adjournment, when he raised the matter again on the Adjournment, that I made it clear that I was only anxious to facilitate this part of Deputy Blaney's constituency.  I now appeal to him, as chairman of the county council, to get on with the design of the scheme and submit it to the Department for sanction and I can assure him that, if it is submitted to the Department, there will be very little delay in their approving it or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jack Lynch made some criticism of the Department's attitude towards the density of housing development and suggested that the Department of Local Government were opposed to terrace type houses.  It is not the policy of the Department to intervene in any way in the planning of local authority housing schemes, except to ensure that certain minimum standards are observed.  These standards are not unduly high, as all members of local authorities know, and the Department has not in recent years required the Cork Corporation to increase the density of development or to enlarge the accommodation standards of any of their dwellings.  I think some six years ago one of my predecessors issued a circular letter to local authorities generally drawing attention to an undue concentration on small detached houses and small house blocks, and suggesting that in many cases the design of schemes of terraced houses would enable more economical use to be made of the available building land, as well as achieving a saving in building and <Col N="1437" /> development costs.  I am not quoting the exact wording of the circular, but I am giving the gist of it.  A more general use of terraced planning by Cork Corporation would be very welcome indeed by my Department and I certainly recommend them to consider it in planning further schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Casey from Cork suggested that I or my advisers were complacent about housing progress in Cork.  It is but right that I should give some figures in connection with housing in Cork.  At the beginning of the financial year, 1951, there were 314 houses in progress.  In 1954, there were 538 in progress and, in 1956, there were 655 in progress.  The numbers in tender or for which tenders are invited are 211 now as compared with 98 last year.  This is a record which left me with no alternative but to compliment the Cork Corporation on the magnificent work they are doing.  I am quite satisfied that Cork Corporation are making a serious effort to grapple with the housing problem there and they certainly have stepped up progress during the years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Casey also referred to a proposal of the Cork Corporation for the building of a tenant-purchase scheme having being turned down by the Department.  This proposal to which Deputy Casey referred was a proposal to substitute a tenant-purchase scheme for a working-class scheme of 96 houses at Mayfield, for which tenders had already been received by the corporation.  I refused to sanction the proposal.  I took the <Col N="1439" /> view, and I take the view, that the present housing effort of the Cork Corporation should be directed towards completing the programme for the rehousing of the priority classes. I have praised Cork but I think they are not doing sufficient to house the priority cases.  I think they are not doing sufficient work to clear the slums of Cork.  Certainly I shall encourage them to do so if they wish.</P>

He said the Housing Acts expired on the 31st March last and that there was no housing legislation in force.  That is not true.  What expired on the 31st March last was the date for completion for private house grants.  The Housing Acts are still in force.  The only thing which expired was the date for completion for private house grants.  All other housing laws continue in force, as in the past.</P>
      <P>I gave an undertaking that a Housing Bill would be introduced here.  I confirm that undertaking now.  I do not wish to disclose the terms of it as I do not think it would be right to do so at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing public are well used to this practice.  It has been the practice down through the years.  They are well aware that, if there was to be any reduction in building grants, due and proper notice would be given by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would give due and proper notice to the building public and to the prospective buyers of houses so far as reducing grants are <Col N="1440" /> concerned.  I think I have referred to the scheme to which Deputy McGrath referred: I did not intend to refer to it at the particular stage at which I did.  I appeal now to Cork Corporation to get on with this scheme, to get on with the building, and, if they do, they need not worry about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith referred to what he did to provide money at 3¼ per cent. for Small Dwellings Acts borrowers who had already entered into commitments when the rate was increased in 1952 to 5¼ per cent.  Deputy Smith knows very well that on that occasion he took steps to ensure that such a situation would not arise again.  He advised local authorities by circular that, for the future, borrowers should be informed in advance that the rate of interest should be related to the rate current at the time of the issue of money from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That was always the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>After the increase in the interest rate to 5¼ per cent. in 1952, the rate fell again to 4¾ per cent. in January, 1954, and to 4½ per cent. in December, 1954.  Now, the rate has gone up to the 1952 level.  We have not gone beyond it.  At that time, there was a very steep increase in the rate: there was an increase of 2 per cent.  There were exceptional circumstances. Deputy Smith, the then Minister, ensured that they would never occur again.  We are only back at the 1952 level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  The Minister knows that circulars are as common as the falling snow in winter. A contract is one thing and a circular from the Department is another thing. As a lawyer, surely the Minister appreciates that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the very first circular issued on this subject and it was issued by Deputy Smith.  It was to ensure that local authorities would be informed of what would occur in the future and that they would inform borrowers of the rate at which they would have to repay.  There was a sudden steep increase of 2 per cent. in the rate in 1952.  I could understand <Col N="1441" /> Deputy Smith's attitude.  These are normal fluctuations.  The rate is now only the 1952 rate.  I remember that when it fell no person groused that he wished to pay the higher rate because he had entered into a contract or because a loan had been sanctioned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Casey referred to the encouragement which should be given to people to own their houses.  Local authorities are aware of the very reasonable minimum terms I am prepared to approve of for sales.  The differential rents scheme should not be an insuperable obstacle to the formulation of terms.</P>
      <P>Deputy James Tully asked that provision be made for amendment of Vesting Orders under cottage purchase schemes where the Vesting Orders contained an error or mistake.  I do not know exactly what he meant but I take it he was referring to Vesting Orders which had been made.  If an error or mistake has occurred in a Vesting Order, I have power to amend, on the application of any person interested, without further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Orders I have power to amend.  The Deputy also suggests that provision be made for adjusting annuities where the rents were increased because of the installation of electricity or some other change between the making of the scheme and the vesting of the cottage. It should be possible to make an agreement outside the terms of the Vesting Order in relation to any additional amenity which may be installed. They have power to enter into an agreement, apart altogether from the Vesting Order, for payment in respect of any amenities which may have been installed.  You cannot change the Vesting Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <Col N="1442" /> Deputy J. Brennan spoke about housing grants for the special housing of persons with T.B.  He said the matter was being frustrated by red-tape. His information must have been obtained before November, 1954.  At that time, I told the Donegal County Council&mdash;his own county council&mdash;that I would not be disposed to interfere with the discretion of the council in the matter of meeting the need or otherwise for whatever approved type of additional accommodation was required for a member of a family suffering from pulmonary T.B.  At that time I cut all the red tape so far as these houses and schemes were concerned. I hope that additional accommodation will be provided.  I offered to back by grants any action taken by the local authority with the approval of the county medical officer of health and the county engineer.  I could not go further than that.  I cut any red-tape which had existed in the building of this additional accommodation for T.B. patients.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Brennan also referred to a refusal of sanction to unserviced cottages being erected in Donegal over a limit of £1,100.  That is quite true but I must remind the Deputy that although in Donegal it is £1,100, in other areas it is only £1,000, and there is very good reason for it.  I do not wish to suggest to local authorities that they should build one of these unserviced cottages for £1,000 unless they are able to do it and I am going to quote figures to show what other local authorities can do.  In Wexford the local authority can build these unserviced cottages for £775; in Laois for £795; in Offaly for £840; in Limerick for £890 and in Meath for £827.  Deputies will see from these figures which I have just quoted that building of unserviced cottages at £1,000 or at £1,100 in County Donegal is therefore&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are quite recent figures.  Deputy Lynch&mdash;I do not know which of them it was&mdash;and Deputy Brennan made pleas in favour of corrugated asbestos roofing.  I have to be guided by technical advisers on <Col N="1443" /> these matters and they advise me that asbestos roofing is not a good roofing.  They say it is not suitable material for the roofing of dwellings and the regulations require that the various materials outlined in the specification should be used.  However, as I have stated many times before, while I am not prepared to depart from the regulations, where it is clear that the applicant acted in good faith or has been in any way misled, I am prepared to waive the reduction of the grant but not otherwise.  I think the Minister's technical advisers advise on what is best and that we, as laymen, must be guided by them.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of this Estimate, I entertained to luncheon members of the executive committee of the Municipal Authorities Association.  I merely mention this to inform the House that at the end of that luncheon I had the planning officer of my Department give a lecture on our recent itinerary in France where we inspected various housing schemes, examples of town planning in the reconstruction of the war-damaged areas.  The lecture was illustrated by lantern slides showing flat development, town planning and other urban and port developments in Paris, Marseilles, Orleans and other cities and towns.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the French Minister for the Interior and the Secretary of State for Reconstruction, both of whom placed every possible facility and hospitality at our disposal and gave to the technicians who accompanied me all the information and knowledge at their disposal when it was requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the rate of interest payable on loans from building societies and said that from 6¾ to 7 per cent. would be payable. The interest rates charged by building societies are as follows: Building Societies, 6½ to 7 per cent. per annum; Workingman's Benefit Building Society, 6½ per cent. per 20 years to 30 years; Irish Permanent Building Society, 7 per cent. per 25 to 35 years; Educational Building Society 7 per cent. per <Col N="1444" /> 25 to 35 years.  I think the Deputy said as a result of the guarantee scheme which we are negotiating at present the average man in the street, the man about to marry will be bringing on himself repayments of an extra 10/- or 12/6 per week.  Of course that is not true.</P>
    <P>In Limerick City, the Deputy's own city, the average loan is £1,200 and this also appears to be the average loan made by local authorities who normally borrow from the Local Loans Fund.  At the current rate of interest of 5¾ per cent. charged by most local authorities under the Acts, the loan repayments would be about £80 per year.  I may say it is common practice for building societies to advance loans for a term of 35 years. Assuming that he were to pay the highest rate of interest, that is 7 per cent. now charged by building societies that would work out, as I said, at a rate of 7 per cent. and his repayment would be £92 a year for a loan period of 35 years.  In short, he would be merely paying an extra £12 a year or less than 5/- a week extra.  The Deputy's figure of 10/- or 12/6 a week is absolutely incorrect.  The average would be 5/- per week for a £1,200 loan at 7 per cent. over a 35 year period.</P>

      <P>Now we come to Dublin Corporation. Deputy James Larkin spoke at some length reviewing the progress of conferences and negotiations in connection with the financial difficulties which have arisen in Dublin since last autumn and he also referred to the assurance given by the former Minister for Local Government, the late Deputy T.J. Murphy.  The tenor of the Deputy's speech was so closely related to current problems that Deputies may have failed to advert to the fact that the late Minister's discussions and assurances related to the rehousing of the poor of Dublin out of the slums of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, relating to the housing campaign generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well I looked up the references recently and I am satisfied that he was dealing with the rehousing of the poor in the slums of Dublin.  He gave the assurance that lack of money should not prevent these schemes proceeding. I think he said that the progress in that direction would not be slowed down or held up by financial difficulties.  I renew that assurance&mdash; of course, within the limitations of our financial resources&mdash;given by the late Deputy T.J. Murphy with regard to the rehousing of the poor in the slums of Dublin.  Financial considerations should not retard the building programme for rehousing these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy did criticise the conferences over which I presided and I think also the joint conferences which were held by the Minister for Finance and myself with Dublin Corporation.  We are anxious to secure and to divert as much money as possible towards that channel whereby <Col N="1446" /> the poor of Dublin may be rehoused. We are anxious to take out of that class the white collar workers and to give them the privilege and advantage of participating in the scheme we are now endeavouring to promote.  That will leave the Dublin Corporation with much more money to proceed with the rehousing of the poor from the slums of Dublin.  Of course there is no doubt whatever about it, the late Deputy Murphy's assurance about the continuity of finance did not apply in any way to the operation of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

As regards those who can negotiate loans from other sources, I fail to see on what grounds Deputy Larkin can criticise the suggestions I have made.  I need not remind the Deputies, of course, of the financial stringencies of the present day.</P>

      <P>Let me explain at this stage that the pattern of finance in Dublin Corporation has not changed in any way down through the years.  As I said many times in this House, I offered to assist Dublin Corporation in the month of November last to float their loan and make it a success.  I did the same thing for Cork Corporation and my advice was accepted.  I am not saying it was through my efforts, but I contributed a little towards making their loan a success.  I offered to do the same in Dublin, and when it came to their loan flotation I gave them sanction, as was given by my predecessor, to go to the bank for an overdraft which they could liquidate when their loan was floated.  But the loan was not the success it should have been, and you know the way that the Government has come to their assistance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith joined in this campaign for the first time in his speech on the Estimate when he referred to my speech at the opening of the housing scheme in Bandon.  It is right that I should quote what I said in Bandon. Having indicated the statutory responsibilities of local authorities for housing certain classes, I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is no part of the housing authority's responsibility to provide houses for persons whose circumstances are such that they may reasonably be expected to rehouse themselves or who are of a class normally catered for by private enterprise.</P>
      <P>The necessity for establishing the reality of the need for houses before building them may seem elementary. I am aware, however, of a few cases in recent times in which the local authority proposed the erection of a far greater number of houses in individual schemes than was warranted by an examination of the circumstances of the persons for whom the houses were to be built.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those remarks were dictated by no <Col N="1448" /> desire to slow up essential housing but rather to concentrate both central and local funds and local effort on essential housing.  I was not speaking without experience when I said that.  I know of a case, and Deputies on both sides of the House know of it, where a scheme of 103 houses had been completed and some of the houses were allocated to a teacher, a bank cashier, an accountant, a civil servant, a doctor, an hotelier, a bank official and a senior official of a local authority. It was to eliminate such schemes and the building of such schemes that I spoke in Bandon.  That very scheme of 103 houses to which I refer is not 100 miles from the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not in the City or County of Dublin.  It is to prevent schemes such as that being permitted that I urge that due consideration should be given to them.  At Bandon I was looking at a number of derelict sites in the centre of the town which could, in my opinion, have been reconstructed. It was to those houses I was referring when I said that, before proceeding with other building schemes, we should take an inventory of those houses which, in my opinion, could be reconstructed, and we would possibly find that we would not need some of the elaborate schemes such as those 103 houses being undertaken again.</P>

      <P>With regard to the pattern of Dublin housing, Deputy Smith did refer to his relations with the Dublin Corporation.  I am going to read a few extracts from letters written to Deputy Smith when he was Minister from the Dublin Corporation and a few extracts from letters written to me within the past few months, on <Col N="1449" /> housing and finance.  I want Deputies to pay particular attention to that, and, before I read them, to what was said by Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Local Government in July, 1952, about Dublin Corporation's finance problems.  I refer to the Dáil Debates, Volume 133, column 171:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the Dublin Corporation is not hindered in any way at the moment because of lack of finance.  There is no question of their being in straitened circumstances.  It is the business of the corporation when looking to the future to discover the places from which and the conditions under which money may be provided for the future.  It is the business of those&mdash;it is certainly not my business &mdash;responsible for the running of the banks to look at things from their own point of view, having regard, of course, at the same time to other interest.  All this is quite understandable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The situation has arisen before, as Deputy Norton pointed out.  As long as I can remember, since the housing problem of the Dublin Corporation has been pursued energetically, these difficulties have arisen from time to time over the last 30 years.  I am quite prepared to examine the steps that should be taken by the corporation to provide themselves with the necessary finances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I offer them the same.</P>

      <P>Deputy Smith went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am sure that all the institutions concerned are doing their business. The Government has not failed to do its part.  There is no need to be alarmed.  As the old saying goes, there is no need to shake hands with the devil until we meet him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was in July, 1952, and the devil, incidentally, did not appear for another six months when a £5,000,000 stock issue was floated in February, 1953.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Smith goes on to refer to the letter of the 25th October, 1954.  I do not think I need bother the House with that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone very carefully through the papers dealing with the situation to which Deputy Smith was referring in the statement I have just read.  It is most remarkable that the sequence of events leading up to the stock issue made in February, 1953, during his term of office, was very similar to that which Deputy Briscoe described here last week.  On the 15th January, 1952, the corporation sent a letter to the Department saying that the proceeds of the previous stock issue would be exhausted by the end of June and that the corporation would need to make arrangements for the provision of £5,000,000 for expenditure during the year from June, 1952.</P>
      <P>The first point of similarity is between the phrasing and form of the letters of the 25th October, 1954, and the letter of 15th January, 1952.  The first paragraph of the letter of the 15th January, 1952, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The finance and general purposes committee of the corporation, having examined the position as to capital expenditure, is of the opinion that the proceeds of the issue of £5,000,000 Dublin Corporation 3½ per cent.  Stock, 1960-65, which was underwritten by the Minister for Finance and was issued on the 4th June, 1951, at the issue price of £98 per £100 stock, will be exhausted, they estimate, at the end of June, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The first paragraph of the letter of the 25th October, 1954, is almost word for word.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The finance and general purposes committee of the corporation, having examined the position as to capital expenditure, is of the opinion that the proceeds of the issue of £5,000,000 Dublin Corporation 4½ per cent.  Stock, 1970-75, which was underwritten by the Minister for <Col N="1451" /> Finance and the Irish banks and was issued in June, 1954, will be exhausted at the end of December, 1954.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with that?  It is a statement of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The next sentence of the letter of the 15th January, 1952 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The committee also made an estimate of the money which will be required for expenditure during the year from June 1952 and is of the opinion that the corporation will need to make arrangements for the provision of £5,000,000 for expenditure during that year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The second sentence of the letter of the 25th October, 1954, is exactly the same except for the difference in the amount required and a difference in the dates.  The letter of the 15th January then says: &ldquo;Details are set out hereunder&rdquo;, and goes on to set out these details, which come to a total of £4,943,000.  The letter of the 25th October, 1954, is again almost word for word.  Instead of: &ldquo;Details are set out hereunder&rdquo;, it says: &ldquo;Details of the expenditure are set out hereunder&rdquo;.  Then, as before, the details of the expenditure are given, coming to a total of £6,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 29th April, 1952, the corporation wrote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The finance and general purposes committee of the Dublin Corporation at its meeting on the 28th instant expressed concern that a reply had not been received from your Department in regard to this matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 20th May, 1952, the corporation wrote:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The finance and general purposes committee at its meeting held on the 19th instant were perturbed that no reply to my previous letters <Col N="1452" /> to you on the subject had been received from your Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 1st July, 1952, the corporation wrote describing the interview which a deputation had with the Irish Banks Standing Committee on the 27th June, 1952, and their letter ended by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The committee were pertubed that to date they have no indication that money will be available to finance the corporation's capital undertakings and they directed me to request a reply from you within the next 14 days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 2nd July, 1952, a statement appeared in the Press under the heading: &ldquo;Banks Refuse £5,000,000 Loan for Housing.&rdquo;  The Press report goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The finance committee of the corporation met the Irish Banks Standing Committee to try to negotiate a loan of £5,000,000 needed for housing schemes.  The banks turned down the request stating that even at 5 per cent. interest they could not meet the corporation in any way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, then Deputy Norton, referred to the Press reports during the final stages of the 1952 Housing Bill and it was in reply to the points he made that Deputy Smith, then Minister for Local Government, made the statements I have quoted which ended with the advice that there was no need to shake hands with the devil until you meet him.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that Dublin Corporation in 1952, tried the same tactics as in 1956.  The Dublin Corporation adopted the same tactics, the only difference being that this time they succeeded in getting £1,000,000 out of the present Government from the Local Loans Fund, plus an undertaking to pay £3,000,000 for their other capital schemes.  Those are two very important items.  I know some Deputies may say that the £3,000,000 has not been paid.  I have asked, through my Department, for a break-down of that £3,000,000.  I find that they have directed their building director to refrain from accepting tenders for £400,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The present financial crisis is analogous to the other crises which they have had in the past seven years.  There were similar crises earlier, during the war.  I anticipated all this in November last and that is why I offered Dublin Corporation my services in an endeavour to float their loan and make it a success because the money underwritten could not be diverted to other purposes of the corporation. Deputy Denis Larkin referred to an announcement in today's paper.  I am afraid I have no official notification of that matter, but I feel certain the corporation will carefully consider the recommendations of the finance committee before sanctioning them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moran gave notice that, on the motion for the Adjournment, he would raise the subject-matter of Question No. 35 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>On to-day's Order Paper, in Question No. 35, I asked the Minister for Local Government:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether he is aware that the Mayo County Council, at their last meeting of 14th January, 1956, decided to apply for a loan of £200,000 for the purpose of financing a housing project under Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952, that the application, with all the necessary documents, was forwarded to his Department on 21st February, 1956, that the council have not received a decision to date, and that 1,200 applications are held up because the council has no money to deal with them; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have read the Minister's statement and I must say that it is both misleading in its contents and inaccurate as far as Mayo County Council is concerned. The Minister says that the borrowing of £200,000 proposed by the council was sanctioned on the 16th March.  I want to point out that the borrowing of £200,000 was not sanctioned, as far as Mayo County Council knows, and has not yet been sanctioned. There are some members of Mayo County Council in the House. Deputy O'Hara is there and I am sure the Minister's colleague, Deputy Kenny, is in the House also.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disqualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Hara may be technically disqualified but I know he takes a great interest in housing in Mayo.  I know he is in the same position as I and the other Deputies from Mayo are in, that we cannot tell the people whether the Mayo County Council can finance their housing programme or not.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that, as far as Mayo council and my colleagues and myself on the county council are concerned, we have no intimation from the Minister, officially or otherwise, that our application for the borrowing of £200,000 has been sanctioned.  The first intimation that I have had of this is in the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with this matter in a reasonable way.  In January of this year, when Mayo County Council decided in their wisdom that £200,000 was necessary to deal with their housing programme, I expressed some doubt on the feasibility of it in view of what has been happening here in Dublin.  I wanted to know could we get some definite decision from the Department as far as our housing commitments were concerned.  I <Col N="1459" /> waited patiently to see could we get any indication from the Minister's Department as to whether our £200,000 would be provided out of the Local Loans Fund.  I carefully refrained from raising any question in the House that might in any way embarrass the Minister or his Department.  Our only concern in this matter is to provide houses for the people, to go on with our housing programme.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now about the provisions under Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Housing Act, 1952, under which we have 1,200 applicants held up in County Mayo since last January who can get no money.  People are coming to me telling me their contractors are threatening to issue civil bills and writs against them in an effort to collect the money which these people cannot pay.  They entered into these commitments on the basis that we were providing these funds and we understood we would be in a position to provide them under our resolution at the meeting of January last.  We estimated our commitments for the immediate future at £200,000.  We were prepared to pay over that money and the council in their wisdom passed a resolution sanctioning it.  Whatever doubts I expressed at that meeting, my colleagues assured me that housing would go on and that we need not worry.</P>
    <P>I made it my business, before putting down this question, to go into the local authority and find out from the officials if they had received any word from the Minister or his Department. I asked them could I tell these people, who were asking me this question, that they could go ahead.  They said: &ldquo;No.  We have no intimation from the Minister or his Department as to whether this money is coming or not.&rdquo;  The result is that they cannot pay out one penny.  There was some indication given to them by phone, I understand, which the Minister glibly passed over in his reply to my question, that of our £200,000 application £50,000 by way of temporary overdraft from the banks would be sanctioned, that when the £50,000 was sanctioned, not from the Local <Col N="1460" /> Loans Fund but by way of overdraft from the banks, this thing would be all right.  They proceeded to do what I suppose, most local authorities would do&mdash;assume that it was all right and not only did they pay out the £50,000 but exceeded it by £25,000.  They have paid out £75,000 on foot of what they took to be the Minister's word that everything would be all right.  They are now held up and these unfortunate applicants who were thereatened with legal proceedings by their contractors, cannot get the money from the Mayo County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They have planned their houses and were relying on these grants which are not now available to them.  What I want to know is, will these people be paid?  Deputy Kenny interrupts me.  It will be quite sufficient for my purpose if the Minister will inform Deputy Kenny, Deputy O'Hara and my friend, the travelling student of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Lindsay, of the facts, so that they can tell the people of Mayo if they will get their money.  It will be quite sufficient if the Minister will tell his friend, the Minister for Lands, what is happening so that he can tell the people of Mayo not only that he is satisfied about the position in the fiords of Norway and Sweden but also that the people of Mayo will be able to get the money for the purposes of the building contracts to which they have committed themselves.  If the Minister will only tell the Mayo County Council in plain terms that he will ultimately give them this money then the position will be satisfactory, but not alone are people in the dark in relation to this matter but there is also the question of loans.</P>

      <P>An application dated 21st February, 1956 for sanction to borrow £200,000 from the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of making grants under Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Housing (Amendment) Act 1952 as amended was received in the Department on the 29th of February last.  On the 2nd of March the council was requested to furnish statistical information&mdash;the <Col N="1462" /> number of grants allocated, etc.&mdash; necessary for the proper consideration of the application.  This information was received on the 9th March.  On the 16th March, the Commissioners of Public Works were informed that the proposed borrowing had been sanctioned and the issue of the loan from the Local Loans Fund was recommended.  The council on the same day were notified in the usual terms that the Minister was in communication with the Commissioners of Public Works in the matter.  That notification was sent to the county council in writing and not over the telephone as alleged by Deputy Moran.</P>
