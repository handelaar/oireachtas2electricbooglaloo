      <P>There are five amendments altogether from the Seanad.  The first four are, in fact, one amendment.  They refer to Sections 26 and 35 of the Bill and propose the deletion of an additional condition contained in the sections that, on the establishment day, the optician should be a citizen of Ireland. The Seanad has deleted that condition. The first four amendments, therefore, all follow from the same proposal: they are consequential.</P>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 10, lines 1 and 2, &ldquo;conditions that, on the establishment day, he was a citizen of Ireland and&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;condition&rdquo; substituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on this Vote, I was outlining the position with regard to the hardships imposed on the people in the Shannon Valley, through years of constant flooding.  I have no intention, at this stage, of repeating my remarks on that important matter, except to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that I hope there will be no dilly-dallying about implementing the report and the recommendations of the engineering expert who came here to carry out a survey of the Shannon Valley problem.</P>
      <P>In connection with drainage in general, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify the position with special reference to drainage problems in the West.  We know that the Corrib will take approximately ten years to complete and that the overall cost of that scheme is £2,000,000.  The people in other areas who suffer from flooding are anxious to know whether or not schemes for the drainage of the Suck, the Moy and other rivers will be carried out before the actual completion of the Corrib scheme.</P>
      <P>Ten years is a long time to look forward to, so far as the drainage of the Suck and the Moy is concerned, and I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would give some hope to the people whose lands are flooded in the vicinity of these catchment areas that they will not have to wait another eight years before getting some satisfaction or amelioration of the situation. The people along the Corrib are very lucky in having the Parliamentary Secretary to back their case.  I have heard it said that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is the Parliamentary Secretary for North Galway.  I do not believe that; I believe that, if he gets a fair opportunity, other areas besides North Galway will reap the benefit.</P>
      <P>Naturally enough, I am greatly interested in the problems of the people whose lands adjoin the River Suck. The Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, Deputy Beegan, knows the position intimately, as far as the problems of the Suck catchment area are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks be to God, we have not got one for West Cork. The position with regard to the Suck is that a great deal of the land adjoining it is not of the highest quality, as far as agricultural purposes are concerned, although a great deal of it is quite good land; but there are more families living alongside the Suck than there are alongside any other river in Ireland.  The population basis should be the best argument in favour of giving priority to the Suck.  I know that when the Brosna was put number one on the priority list, the reason given was that a great deal of first class land was being flooded in its vicinity.  Although you might have a great deal of good land being flooded, there were less people making a living on that good land than along the banks of the Suck.  It is a matter of whether you will deal with these things on a material basis and whether the farmer who has 300 or 400 acres of land, 40 or 50 of which are flooded, is to get priority over a village where there are 18 families, with about 100 acres of land between them.  I think the human element and the fact that these families depend on such small holdings, and have to utilise all the land at their disposal to the utmost, should give them priority, as far as drainage is concerned.</P>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to assure us that, when the actual survey work on the Suck is completed, there will be no question of delay in putting the actual drainage work into operation.  I hope there will be no statement made here by the Parliamentary Secretary that finance is the bogey, that money is not available and that the people concerned will have to have patience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great play is being made in rural Ireland at the moment with the suggestion that people should be thankful to whatever Government is in power that a sum of £2,000,000 is to be spent on the Corrib catchment area over a period of ten years.  That is only £200,000 a year.  While the people are being told to be thankful for this expenditure, <Col N="1375" /> the Parliamentary Secretary, under the direction of the Government, has been spending £500,000 in making a runway for jet aeroplanes outside Dublin.  It is a matter of first things first.  If people down the country are to be told that they must be thankful for getting a certain amount of money to drain their land, it must be realised that, up in headquarters, there is great expenditure, and it is quite open to argument as to whether that expenditure is absolutely essential or not.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that when the Parliamentary Secretary found that one of his responsibilities was to construct a new runway for obsolete jet aeroplanes, he objected to the expenditure of a large capital sum on a matter of that nature at this time.  I know he cannot be responsible for every member of the Government, but I hope he made it quite clear, when he was directed to carry out this work on the construction of new runways, that he wanted more money for drainage purposes and for schools.  I will not say any more on drainage.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Vote, I see that there is a reduction of £353,000 under sub-head H, for Public Works and Buildings. I want to get this clear.  This Government has made it quite clear in their election speeches that they are committed to a reduction in the cost of administration of Government Departments, and I understand that this is one of the reductions that is being carried out.  It is one of the promises being carried out, but it seems extraordinary to me that this reduction is shown in the Book of Estimates and deals with schemes where the employment content could be well worth while, at a time when we have a large number of unemployed and a high rate of emigration.  If it is the Government's intention to reduce expenses, can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me whether there is a reduction in his Department of the Board of Works which is concerned in this reduction on expenditure on public buildings?  If there is to be a reduction of £350,000 on useful schemes, is it not fair and reasonable to suggest that there should be a proportionate reduction in the <Col N="1376" /> administrative section of this Department? I will bet my last dollar that there is not one civil servant or official going to lose his place, in spite of the fact that there is a reduction in the Department which deals with public works and buildings.</P>
    <P>This is a very interesting position.  I know that if you appoint a civil servant two steps up the ladder, he will have to have at least two more under him.  Once you appoint him, it would practically take the joint efforts of all the Cabinet Ministers to have him removed, or all the civil servants in every other Department would be on their heads.  Without being personal, I would say to the Parliamentary Secretary that we both need a fine comb these days to keep the spare ribs on top in place, but one would not need a fine comb to rake up the spare files in the Department of Public Works.  A good big hay rake would bring up enough spare files in the different Departments and the result of this action would be a considerable reduction in the expenditure on the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>One of the justifiable complaints the people have to-day is the heavy burden of Government services, particularly the administrative end.  The Board of Works have shown a reduction in expenditure on buildings and so forth, and surely they should be in a position to show a corresponding reduction in the personnel who administer these matters.  I have no dealings with technical experts.  I am all for the employment of engineers and technical men who are essential to plan out arterial drainage and to put the schemes into operation, but I certainly have a strong objection to keeping, for the sake of employment, a top heavy Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should make it his business to dismiss them.  Of course, that is an impossibility, having regard to the safeguards that are given to the Civil Service.  I agree that there should be a feeling of security for those employed by the State, but the Parliamentary Secretary should make it his business to see that, where there are extra staff twiddling their thumbs in <Col N="1377" /> his Department &mdash; that must be the case as a result of the reduction in expenditure &mdash; they should be transferred to other Departments where their services can be properly utilised. I will not say any more about that on this Vote, because I think I can deal with it on a broader basis on some other Estimate.</P>
    <P>One point I omitted to deal with earlier on the matter of arterial drainage was the question of workers. Again, I do not know whether or not other speakers referred to this.  At all events, I think the wages paid to the workers engaged on arterial drainage at the present time are scandalous. The wages paid to county council employees vary, as we know, from county to county, but, to my knowledge, even the lowest paid county council worker has at least 10/- a week more than his colleague who works on arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I need not elaborate to the House on the type of work involved in arterial drainage.  We know that at the present moment a certain amount of protection is afforded workers by the issue of rubber thigh boots, waterproof coats and so forth, but at times of the year this work is pretty tough.  It involves a considerable amount of hardship and if we are to keep men on this, to get them to work and to give of their best, there will have to be a big step-up in the wages in order to give justice to these men.</P>
    <P>There is one point to which I want to refer back concerning schools.  The other night, I told the Parliamentary Secretary of the delay in connection with the building of schools.  From the time an application was made to erect a school until the construction of the school began, there was often a delay of four and five years.  When speaking on that occasion, I had put down a question, but the answer was not available to me while I was speaking, but, luckily enough, I got it yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that the same amount of money is made available for the erection of new schools as last year.  In 1954-55, £1,350,000 was made available for the construction of new schools.  In the <Col N="1378" /> following year, 1955-56, there was a sum of £1,350,000 again.  I understand the same sum is provided this year, but, in the two years I mentioned, the Board of Works did not go within £300,000 of that figure.  The figure in the Estimates shown as being available for the building of schools is pure bluff.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary personally in this.  When we see £1,350,000 in the Vote for Public Works, the suggestion is that that sum will be spent on the erection of new schools.</P>
    <P>I have a tabular statement given to me yesterday, and as far as I can ascertain the Department spent all the money allocated for the erection of new new schools in only three years during the past 20 years.  I should like an explanation for that.  If we have a sum of £1,350,000 in the Book of Estimates for the building of new schools, why is is we did not go within £500,000 of that expenditure?  Where does the blame lie?  What is responsible for that position?  Does it not justify my argument the other evening that a Minister for Finance, no matter who he is, wants to keep down expenditure, and at the same time does not want the public and this House down on top of his head?  The simplest way he can have it is, when the local parish priest or a group of people in a parish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;make an application for a new school, the Department of Education hatch on it for a while.  A deputation has to come to Dublin to see some of the officials in the Department of Education and the minute a Deputy notifies the Department that the parish priest and group down the country are getting pretty annoyed over the matter, the Department of Education leap into action, and, when it comes to the time the Board of Works appear on the job, about three years have elapsed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a crossfire <Col N="1379" /> as far as correspondence is concerned. The people write and ask what the delay is, and then a letter is written. When that letter comes to the Board of Works, there is possibly an acknowledgement of the letter within a week, but then they have to consider further and make investigations.  That takes another six months.  Then, they will reply to the people in the parish and say that such and such a point has not been dealt with.  Perhaps it is a very minor point in connection with the fireplace in the school.</P>
      <P>That reply goes from the Board of Works back to the school manager and that gives them a glorious opportunity to hold money in the Department for another three months.  That is the skilful way in which the Board of Works acts as a watchdog on the public purse for the Minister for Finance. Between the Department of Education and the Board of Works the people who look for a school are unfortunate shuttlecocks.  The ball is hopped down the country now and then in order to keep the people in touch with the situation.  I have no intention of going into details but I should just like the Parliamentary Secretary when replying to give us the objections on the part of his office to having the responsibility for the erection of new schools charged up to the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping the manager would come into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not catch me on that issue and I will not make any comment on it.  I agree to this extent with both the Parliamentary Secretary and his predecessor, that very often as far as the managers are concerned there is delay there too.  I will not put the entire blame on the Board of Works but the technical faults that are found of a very minor nature by the Board of Works are, in my opinion, not of such serious import as to warrant the holding up of the construction of a school.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will have to agree with me that it is a God-send to the Board of Works to find on occasions <Col N="1380" /> a school manager who is slow to carry out his end of the work.  That gives an opportunity to the Board of Works to blame all the applicants, all the school managers all over Ireland and to put them all in the same boat as this lazy-bones.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary not to try to get out of the difficulty by quoting to me certain school managers who have been slow to carry out their work.  It is no good tarring all these people with the one brush.</P>
      <P>There is one other point before I conclude, something that has been brought to my attention here in Dublin and elsewhere &mdash; the condition of Kilmainham Jail.  I understand from many people who are interested that Kilmainham Jail is in the hands of the Board of Works.  I do not know how accurate the information available to me is, but I understand that this building is rapidly falling into a state of ruin.  That may be true as far as the superficial aspects are concerned but I think that the structure itself is pretty sound.</P>
      <P>Apart from all that, I think the proposal which was made here pre-war to turn the building into a museum memorial should be carried out.  Above any building in the State, it has the most historic connections.  Its associations with 1798, the Fenians, Parnell, the Land League, 1916, up to the present time, are such that to turn this into a national monument or museum memorial will embrace a period of at least 300 years, the richest period of Irish history.  I hope the day will not be long delayed when a firm proposal will be accepted and actual work will be done to have that proposal implemented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In Vote 8, there is a sub-head for National Monuments Grant and provision for staff in that connection.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary, in replying, would tell us whether <Col N="1381" /> he is satisfied that everything possible is being done by the staff of the office in connection with the preservation of buildings of architectural or historic value in the City of Dublin as well as in the country.  We have the Dublin Corporation planning organisation and I have no doubt they are very wise men who plan very carefully and take all these aspects into consideration, any historic sites that may be included in the areas which are being replanned.</P>
    <P>I was rather alarmed, however, to hear that there does not seem to be any public notice given if a building or a structure is being demolished; it may not be a house but some relic of an old wall, we will say, part of the old wall of Dublin or something in conjunction therewith.  That can suddenly disappear without persons who may be interested in this matter knowing anything about it.  It might be considered that it is not the business of the planning department to inform the intelligentsia &mdash; however they might describe them; let us call them, for example, the Old Dublin Society &mdash; as to what they propose to do, but when people give their time voluntarily and a good deal of labour oftentimes to work of this kind to try and preserve what is distinctive, and what those who have given any thought to the matter must consider something of the greatest importance here in our capital city, they ought to be consulted about these changes.  If they make suggestions it ought to be assumed that they are making them not out of a desire merely to be critical or superior but to be honestly helpful and to prevent something being done which if it is done, cannot be undone afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is really tragic to hear of old houses of the 18th century being pulled down.  The house in which Dean Swift was born disappeared long ago, a great loss to the city, but in our own time and in more recent years the house in which Edmund Burke was born on Arran Quay has disappeared.  If it is considered, after consultation at the highest level, that a house of this nature must be removed, I think there ought to be at least plaques &mdash; if it is not possible to preserve any part of the structure of the old house &mdash; on the <Col N="1382" /> buildings which replace them which often compare very badly, from the architectural aspect and from the point of view of the general interest of the onlooker, with those they have replaced.</P>
    <P>A great many of these houses, of course, have fallen into very bad condition. It is probably not the duty of the Board of Works but I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would see that they would keep a watching brief so that whatever we have we will be sure to hold on to and preserve.  We have these old surviving houses on streets, courtyards and closed in areas like Whitefriar Street and they are apparently likely to be demolished.  It seems a pity that, with the assistance of bodies like the Old Dublin Society and the Architectural Association which have shown their interest and which would naturally be expected to give a lead in these matters, something might not be done to preserve these very few remaining houses of that 18th century period.  I have not in mind the large houses like Tyrone House or Powerscourt House, but the dwellinghouses in the streets around Whitefriar Street.</P>
    <P>The British Association will be visiting Dublin next year.  When they visited Dublin in 1908, there was a very valuable guide book published that is considered the best book published about the City of Dublin, in particular about 18th century Dublin. Undoubtedly, these professors, scientists and scholars from Britain will be keenly interested in seeing Dublin at its best.  We ought to be in a position to show them historic buildings and monuments at their best.  On the last occasion these gentlemen were here, they were specially interested in the natural history of Dublin and its surroundings. I have no doubt that the Board of Works will bear that in mind in connection with their parks and gardens.</P>
    <P>It is rather a pity that it has not been possible to surround the new fountain in St. Stephen's Green with a garden.  It is a very beautiful monument, but it might have been better to have it set back farther from the pathway <Col N="1383" /> and to have got a more sylvan setting for it.</P>
    <P>A very important historical monument is Tailors' Hall in which the '98 men met and which is the only surviving building of the old Dublin Guilds. It has been suggested to me that the ideal thing to do with that building would be to have it taken over and maintained by the appropriate trade union or trade body that has taken the place of the Tailors' Guild in our modern society.  These vocational guilds lasted up to comparatively recent times.  The ideal thing would be to hand over Tailors' Hall to the body that would be considered the descendants of the original guild and to ask them to maintain it.  I am sure that would be possible.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the question of Kilmainham and as to whether steps are being taken to preserve the fabric and to obviate deterioration and damage as far as possible.  The question also arises as to the possibility of making the place available to visitors. I know the difficulties in that connection. Sometimes, when people are admitted free to a place, they do not behave themselves.  Very often it is children who are at fault.  They can do damage to themselves or to the place.  Within limits, it ought to be possible, particularly during the tourist season, to make Kilmainham available.  If all the 1916 Collection and everything connected with modern Irish history were transferred to Kilmainham to make it a kind of museum of 19th and 20th Century Irish history, it might be a solution to the problem of overcrowding in the National Museum, about which I am sure we will hear more on the Estimate for the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I want to refer in particular to the question of the Royal Hospital.  I understand that representations have been made to the Government with reference to the maintenance of the structure.  It was built about 1680 to 1684 and must be one of the oldest buildings of importance.  It would be a great pity not to convert it to some national purpose.  In Wales and Sweden there are folk museums which are very popular, because they are so <Col N="1384" /> situated that visitors to them can be out of doors and can move about. There are fairly large areas of grass and gardens surrounding them.</P>
    <P>On one occasion the question arose of converting the Royal Hospital to a folk museum &mdash; a question that has not yet been decided.  I shall not suggest at this moment that a museum is the proper use for the Royal Hospital.  At the moment, I am only raising the question as to the steps which are being taken to preserve the building, as to whether it may be made available to visitors, as to what are the conditions or whether it is open at all.  If the building is considered structurally dangerous, is it the position that visitors cannot go there?  Even if it is not considered safe, it is rather a pity that it could not be made more generally available to interested persons. There should be better facilities for those who are interested in going there.  I trust that when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, he will be able to give me some information about the Royal Hospital and about Kilmainham, in particular.</P>

      <P>In looking at the figures on Votes 8 and 9, the first thing that strikes one is the increase in regard to the wages, expenses and costs of running the office concerned.  On the other hand there appears to be quite a decrease in regard to the amount of money this same office of Public Works propose expending during the year. Under Vote 8, this year salaries and wages are estimated to account for an increase of roughly £38,000.  When we turn to Vote 9, which is to cover public works and buildings and the general proposed workings of this Department, we find a net decrease of £350,000 approximately.  I can understand that the increase of £38,000 has been brought about by virtue of general increases in wages and salaries, but while that may be true what I cannot reconcile is that there would be less work for these officers to do, yet they are paid £38,000 more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, to my mind, is a trend in the wrong direction.  In fairness I suppose it should be said that the vast amount of this decrease of £350,000 is <Col N="1385" /> accounted for in regard to new works, alterations and additions.  While that may be quite all right &mdash; I am not too sure that it is, nor do I hold I am qualified to say it is &mdash; if there is a justification for this reduction in that sub-head then I feel that, rather than have brought in a reduction of £350,000 this year, we might well have utilised some of the money saved to be added under some other sub-heads which we all know require more money and require to be shoved along at a greater pace than we have seen in the past.</P>
    <P>For instance, in regard to arterial drainage and construction works, we find that the allocation this year is £416,000, the same as it was last year. I feel sure that the Parliamentary Secretary and the members of his staff would like to see that figure increased; in other words they would like to see more work done under that sub-head. I feel that if savings are possible under one sub-head, rather than bring in a net saving the Parliamentary Secretary might have utilised this saving under other sub-heads to increase the amount of work under these sub-heads.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself has been fond of saying that it might take 100 years to carry out works spoken of at the moment.</P>
    <P>I come from one of the areas in which schemes of arterial drainage are very necessary and where, at the present rate of progress, the work will not be carried out, as the Parliamentary Secretary himself said when on this side of the House, within 100 years.  Whether or not that is an exaggeration, I am in entire agreement with him that many of the schemes that are believed to be necessary and listed under arterial drainage will not be done in his lifetime or in mine.  A number of these works relate to my own county and to my own constituency.</P>
    <P>We have got no real major drainage scheme anywhere near the top of the priority list in Donegal.  The best we have is about No. 26 on the list.  The River Finn is our major catchment area.  Other catchment areas in County Donegal are the Swillyburn, the Deale, the Lennon and the Swilly.  The Swillyburn <Col N="1386" /> and the Deale are about to be commenced.  The way in which the matter has been approached &mdash; the minor catchments taken first &mdash; is not a very favourable departure from proceedings in the past.  The reason the Swillyburn and the Lennon were taken so promptly is not because of a change of heart in regard to their placings on the priority list or that smaller works might be considered in conjunction with the larger; it is due to the fact that the people concerned with the fisheries of the Foyle have had quite an influence in this matter.  I am sorry they did not have influence in some of the other cases I have mentioned.  I am afraid that the Swillyburn and the Deale cannot be taken as an indication to us in the other areas that the Swilly, Finn and Lennon catchment areas will be taken in hand in the near future.</P>
    <P>I entirely disagree with the method employed in drawing up the priority list for arterial drainage.  I think it is a completely wrong approach to take the total number of acres in a catchment area as the basis on which to give priority.  The value of the land in a catchment area, its potential value to the people when drained, the method in which it will be utilised if properly drained, should have very much more to do with its place on the priority list than the total number of acres that area takes in.  I have seen some very good work done under this scheme in other parts of the country.  It was excellent work without any question, but the progress is much too slow.  On the other hand, I have seen where drainage work has been carried out on land that never grew anything and that never will grow anything.</P>
    <P>That is what I cannot reconcile in this matter and it is unfair to say that, because there are so many hundreds of thousands of acres in a certain area, it should be placed on top of the priority list.  I have mentioned the Finn, the Swilly and the Lennon.  In the Finn Valley in Donegal, for the benefit of those who may not be familiar with it, there is some of the finest land to be found anywhere in Ireland and some of the best tillage farmers.  The land along that river is becoming more waterlogged every year and it is becoming progressively more <Col N="1387" /> hazardous to approach within a mile of its banks.  If the crops are put down the chances are they will never be harvested.  That has been getting progressively worse over the years and the farmers have had their fingers burned so often that many of them are not taking the chance of tilling those lands any more.  These lands are being let out for grazing and even then farmers are taking the chance of having their cattle drowned.</P>
    <P>It should be realised that great wealth to the community and to the national economy generally could be taken from these lands if they were properly drained.  The saddest feature of all is that the sons of these farmers are no longer remaining on the farms, the greater proportion of which may lie in these flood areas.  Their sons will move out and there will not be a tradition of tillage farming carried on in the future as in the past.  If those people's sons are pushed out for those reasons, and if the land is not tilled for lack of drainage, even if the land is drained in the future in the Finn Valley it will not be utilised in the years to come as it could be utilised now, because the farmers will have departed from the tradition of tillage farming and the men who have carried on that tradition will no longer be available.</P>
    <P>In the River Swilly Valley again, we have a very rich vein of land, one of the richest in the county, but apparently we are unfortunate in that, while we have a good deal of mountain and waste land, the best of our land is in the valleys and lying along the rivers.  While this may be a normal geographical feature in all countries, it is particularly true in the case of Ireland, and in the River Swilly Valley, we have land second to none unused because of lack of drainage.  In this case, conditions are worse than usual because the land which is not itself subject to flooding does not rise steeply away from the valley and the result is that land lying adjacent to the land which is subject to flooding cannot be drained.  If one were to drain it, one would not get any grant from the Department of Agriculture, because the main outlet is not clear.  Therefore, <Col N="1388" /> the land surrounding the flooded land is neglected and grants cannot be availed of, because the main outlet is not considered an outlet any more. From the point of view of land improvement and production, the River Swilly Valley has land that we really should do something about.</P>
    <P>Going back but a few miles, we find ourselves in another stretch of excellent land along the River Lennon. This land is very much subject to flooding and thousands of acres of good land in the midst of very bad land are constantly being flooded, and the pity of it is that land is so scarce and good land so valuable in and around this valley that, no matter what may have happened in the past, farmers are forced to take a chance of cropping the lands along this river year after year, in the hope that, since it was flooded one year, it will not flood the following year.  But invariably, year in and year out, they are caught out, if not in the early part of the season, then late in the season.  One year after another, these farmers have suffered disastrous losses.  Yet this river could be cleaned very easily.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the oldest residents and those with the longest memories and clearest heads around this place and I find that it is in the more recent past that this flooding has become really bad.  I find the incidence of flooding has increased because of a number of obstructions built across the river by people who want to take water from it for their own purposes. Flooding has increased considerably since those obstructions were built across the Lennon.  I want to say that not only are these obstructions something that could be removed&mdash;since the people who built them are no longer depending on water power, as the E.S.B. has now come into the area&mdash; but, in addition to relieving flooding and helping farmers in this region, fishing would be improved.  Lough Fern, the lake from which the river flows, was one of the finest salmon and general fishing lakes in this country, and it is sad to-day to go along the river and see lying below the obstructions that have been built there salmon that have not sufficient water to go through.  At the same time, the <Col N="1389" /> lake which had a famous name in the past is disappointing very many visitors because the fish are lying in dead waters behind these obstructions in the approaches to the lake.  No fish worth talking about are being taken in the lake as a result.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to attend to this question, because I believe that the clearing of these artificial obstructions built in the past to suit people who apparently had the right to do anything they liked, would give a free flow in the river, which at best is a sluggish and lazy river.  I believe that the silting of the river, which is now causing flooding, would no longer take place and that the winter flood-waters would then be sufficient to keep the silt cleared away. I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to understand that it would be an easy matter to deal with the few people who have put these obstructions there.  In another place, I have already told them what I think of them, and what should be done about them and they did not like it; but I feel that the matter is too important to too many people who are poor, hardworking people and whose livelihood is depending on this drainage, to allow these few selfish people to stand in the way.</P>
    <P>There is now no necessity for these people to try to maintain the rights they established God knows how, in the past.  Having given the Parliamentary Secretary that information, I would ask him to regard the matter as urgent and to realise that it may not be as easy as it sounds to deal with the people who have built these obstructions. I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is just the type of man who could move these people and their obstructions, and I say that in no spirit of criticism.</P>
    <P>Having said that in regard to arterial drainage problems, I again appeal to those concerned with the drawing up of lists for works of this kind, and ask that reconsideration be given to the matter, so that the question of priority-placing for the future would depend much more on the value of the land, taking all the circumstances into <Col N="1390" /> account, and that these considerations should count more than the total acreage, as is apparently the case to-day. I do not think there is much point in draining land, or considering it essential to have it drained, if it is land of the type that, no matter what you do with it, can never be really good, productive tillage land.  In the three valleys I have mentioned, the Finn, the Swilly and the Lennon valleys, we have without question land and soil equal to, if not better than, land anywhere in the country. That land is situated in districts which may be regarded as congested and it would be of immense value, if reclaimed, to the people in that part of the country.  One acre of land in a congested area is worth at least ten acres in the heart of the central plain of Ireland &mdash; there is no question about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Good man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that, on that basis, some formula could be worked out whereby we could say that an acre of land in a congested district was equal to ten or 12 acres elsewhere as the case might be.  I would leave the working out of the ratio to people who are better equipped for that job, but I do assert again, that one acre in a congested area is worth infinitely more to the nation and to the people than ten or 12, or possibly 15, in the heart of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to get on to a few other little items that I wish to take up with the Parliamentary Secretary on this Estimate.  In regard to Portaleen pier, Glengad, County Donegal, I tabled a question to the Department of Agriculture yesterday in regard to that matter, and the reply I received should be of some interest to the Parliamentary Secretary, since he and his Department are the people who would carry out the work, if anything is to be done.  In regard to this pier, we have found, on the part of the Office of Public Works and on the part of the Department of Fisheries, a reluctance on the part of their technically qualified people to agree that anything can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Possibly it is untrue to say that they have said nothing could be done, but the scheme that was proposed as the only one feasible and that would be guaranteed to do the job well was estimated at a price which was so prohibitive that there was no question of the matter being taken up.  We might as well have been told: &ldquo;We will not do it at all.&rdquo;  A figure of £450,000-odd &mdash; almost half a million &mdash; was mentioned some couple of years ago, when we were trying to get this job done.  I understand from what I have heard that the engineers attached to the Office of Public Works were the people then responsible for drawing up that estimate.  At that time, our own engineer felt that something on a smaller scale and just as effective might be done.  On the other hand, of course, no engineer was going to be so foolish as to say that he would guarantee any job as a foolproof job.</P>
    <P>This pier and this place, Glengad, is on the extreme northern tip of the county.  There is no doubt whatever but that it is lashed by some very violent storms and very heavy seas. We have had occasion to know just how heavy because in the past few years we have lost there six large fishing boats on one occasion, and on all the occasions put together over the past ten years, the people of this small fishing village have had a loss of over 30 fishing craft.  That is a most serious loss to those people and to the country generally.  Those people are situated on the northern tip of our county and are, as a result of that, nearer to some of the best fishing grounds on the north-eastern coast than any other fishermen.  The result might well be that they could bring in their fish in better condition, bring in more of them and bring them in sooner, but the big snag is that they have nowhere to keep their boats.  We have been fighting this thing for years.</P>
    <P>If we could get an engineer who would forget for a moment that he has nothing to gain by giving us a scheme for Glengad and forget for a moment that he might lose something of his prestige, if it did not turn out as he thought &mdash; if we could get that approach in this matter, I believe we could get <Col N="1392" /> a scheme under way which would have a very good chance of being a success. I do not blame the engineers concerned. If this is a difficult job and an engineer is in a secure, permanent position, what incentive is there under the present system for that engineer to stake any or all of his reputation on doing a very difficult job in some out-of-the-way place like Glengad, which, when completed, might not turn out to be a satisfactory job?  What incentive has he to take the chance that it could be said of him in five years' time: &ldquo;There will be no promotion for you, my boy; you did not do a good job in Glengad&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>That, apparently, is how we are fixed at the moment.  I am not blaming the engineers.  They are playing safe, for the reason that there is no gain or no incentive to them, if they do a good job in difficult circumstances, and they might have quite a lot to lose, if they did not do a good job.  Such is the set-up in our public positions to-day that the man who might have the initiative or incentive to go ahead and do this job, and take the chance which, in my opinion, is well worth taking and save one of the few fishing communities left in the country to-day, will not take this step.  I believe that we should do something in that regard, and that we should give some inducement to our engineers to use their training, initiative and energy towards giving us an answer to problems like this, and if the job does not turn out 100 per cent. satisfactory in a difficult case like that, then, rather than holding it against them, they should be given some recompense for taking on the job at all.</P>
    <P>We can never get anywhere in regard to this matter, until we have got some approach that is not clouded over at all times by the chance that, if the job should not be done well, that engineer takes all the responsibility for planning it and may find himself debarred from promotion and getting a better job in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I would ask that the Office of Public Works and the Parliamentary Secretary concerned should seriously go into this matter and give these people in Glengad an opportunity to earn their <Col N="1393" /> livelihood, keep their families at home and give to the Irish market and Irish consumer a fairly good supply of some of the best fish to be found in any part of the world.  They are there to be taken.  The fishermen are there, convenient to the fishing grounds, but they have no harbour or shelter for their boats; and nobody is going to do anything about it, because we are bogged down in the red tape of Civil Service bureaucracy, or whatever you like to call it, and out of that we cannot get.</P>
    <P>If we had all the red tape and all the files, all the paper and all the notes written about this matter since it first commenced, I believe that, with our present process of lamination, we could, out of all the paper that has been used in passing from Department to Department over the years, erect at Glengad a sufficient shelter to protect our boats from any future storms.  I think it is time that something was done in this matter, instead of going around looking for safe jobs to be done in the safest possible way, at the greatest possible expense, and in the longest possible time.  That seems to be the system and the sooner it stops the better.</P>
    <P>In regard to Greencastle Harbour, a reply was given here to a question of mine that no representations were made to the Office of Public Works in regard to having repairs carried out to that pier; and the reply went on to point out that, if any such repairs should arise, they were the responsibility of the local authority, the Donegal County Council.  As far as I know, the actual repairs referred to &mdash; possibly it is a misnomer to say &ldquo;repairs&rdquo;&mdash;are not really repairs, but dredging.  That dredging is not being done and has not been done, despite the fact that a new and costly pier was erected there not long ago.  That brings me to the sting in the tail of this answer that, if any repairs are required to-day, they are the responsibility of Donegal County Council. If there should be any repairs arising so soon in regard to Greencastle Pier, which has only been completed in the past year or so, surely the responsibility should not be laid at the door of Donegal County Council, but at the <Col N="1394" /> door of the people responsible for doing the job?  If it is found defective within 12 months, it cannot be said to be a good job.</P>
    <P>If that should happen, the people concerned should not come to the Donegal County Council and say: &ldquo;We did a bad job.  It is not working out well.  You people have taken responsibility to maintain it and you must maintain it.&rdquo;  I believe there is such a thing in many contracts as a guarantee. Even in our own public buildings in Donegal, if any defect shows itself in a house within six months of that house being taken over as a finished job, the contractor must come back and remedy the defect at his own expense.</P>
    <P>In the same way, even though this pier may have been passed on for maintenance to our county council, if it proves now to be defective, somebody else should remedy the defects, rather than pass the buck to the county council, which has enough to look after at the moment, without finding new works, going bad in such a short time, pushed on to it as well.</P>
    <P>Apparently, what is really needed is dredging.  Where is the use in erecting a new pier, if, through lack of dredging, that pier cannot be utilised? Dredging is required, and, as far as I understand, that is what our local development committee have been agitating for and, to my mind, dredging would constitute a major repair.  Without dredging, this pier might as well have been erected in some of the fields surrounding Greencastle.  If one cannot get to the pier, there is not much use in just standing by and looking at it.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get this dredger now, while the weather is good and the sea calm, have it taken down to Greencastle, so that some of the sand and the silt which has collected around this new pier can be removed.  Put us in the position that some use can be made of the pier, the use we hoped to make of it when the pier was built.</P>
    <P>In relation to schools, I have heard quite a bit this morning and on other occasions about the position.  I have heard the Parliamentary Secretary extricating himself from any entanglement in the allegation that his office <Col N="1395" /> is responsible for any hold-up, so far as the erection of schools is concerned. I know the Office of Public Works have their own difficulties, inasmuch as they act as agents for other Departments and, if other Departments want to play ducks and drakes with the people, it is quite easy for them to pass the buck to the Office of Public Works and write saying that they have cleared the matter in regard to their Departments, that it is now with the Office of Public Works, and they are merely waiting to hear from that office.</P>
    <P>During the past year or two, I have been interested in the proposed school at Milford.  It is on the records of this House that for the past eight months the Office of Public Works, according to the Minister for Education, have been holding up this school.  We can get nowhere with the laying of the contract until the Office of Public Works clears it.  In reply to a parliamentary question here six months ago, I was told that it would be six months before this school would be reached on the priority list.  Apparently, there is a bottleneck in the Office of Public Works and there is a queue awaiting the &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; from the Office of Public Works.  Six months ago, the Minister for Education told me the school would not be reached for six months, that he had cleared it and his Department were not holding it up.  The local manager is not holding it up.  The Department of Education is not holding it up.</P>
    <P>A week ago I had another question down and, though six months have passed, the Minister for Education is in the same position still; he does not even know when work is likely to start and he pinpoints unquestionably the Office of Public Works as the people responsible for the delay.  I am not saying that is so, but, according to the records of this House, the Minister for Education in this instance, leaving aside all other instances, pinpoints the Office of Public Works as the people who are holding up &mdash; he did not say purposely &mdash; this school.  He said they are responsible for the hold-up in this instance, a hold-up of over eight months.</P>
    <P>A week ago, he did not even know, <Col N="1396" /> and I take it he inquired from the Office of Public Works, if they had prepared the plans for that school and given their blessing to it.  When that is the recorded position in relation to this school surely it is rather ridiculous of the Parliamentary Secretary or anybody else on behalf of the Office of Public Works, to stand up here and say that he is not responsible for any delays.  If they are not responsible, then they should get on to the Department of Education and clear the air. All I am interested in is finding out where the delay is.  I want to tie it down.  I believe at the moment it is in the Office of Public Works.  If, on the other hand, it is really in the Department of Education, I would like to know that.  It is only fair to the Office of Public Works that, if that is the case, the position should be clarified in their own interests.</P>
    <P>But there are other buildings which have been discussed here from time to time.  There is the new post office at Letterkenny and the new telephone exchange, at an estimated cost of over £29,000.  Away back in 1950, it was stated in this House that this building was about to be commenced, that it was almost ready to go ahead and the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gave a definite and decisive answer, I think that at the end of 1950, the building of this much-needed post office in Letterkenny would commence. Everything was ready to go ahead in the following six to eight months.</P>
    <P>The Government changed.  The Minister changed and six or eight months after I had got that assurance, I asked the then Minister when building would commence.  He said he did not know.  I asked him was the position, as outlined by his predecessor in 1950, not a fact?  I asked him were the plans not ready and everything there for him to go ahead. He said there was absolutely nothing of the sort.  We find now, in 1956, that this building has been listed in the appendix we were given here prior to this debate, and the total cost is reckoned to be somewhere around £29,000, of which £2,000 has been provided for 1956-57.</P>
    <P>I may be ignorant of the workings of <Col N="1397" /> these things, but it does appear to me that, if a building is estimated to cost £29,000 odd, and only £2,000 is provided in the current financial year, we can have very little hope that anything will be done during 1956-57, and we cannot look forward in the near future to seeing a suitable building to house a post office and telephone exchange rising in the town of Letterkenny despite the fact that a previous Coalition Minister for Posts and Telegraphs told us as far back as 1950, that everything was ready to go ahead and work would commence in six to eight months.</P>
    <P>What will be done in regard to this building in this year?  What does this £2,000 represent?  Does it represent a token Vote, merely for the purpose of keeping it alive and keeping some people satisfied that the post office has not been forgotten?  Is it, on the other hand, a genuine attempt to bring into this House some provision which will give us some sort of start in the current financial year, even though that start may not be made until next February or the beginning of next March?  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary exactly what sort of advice he has got from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in regard to this building.</P>
    <P>The present building is deplorably inadequate.  It is a scandal to any principal town in any county.  That is well known not only to the public, but, more so, to the staff who have to work in the back rooms of the present inadequate building, a building which would not be tolerated as a dwelling house for any family, never mind the 20 or 40 officials who are crammed into the back rooms there and up in the attics, trying to carry on the business of an ever-expanding postal service. Something should be done, and done quickly.</P>
    <P>All I ask is that the Parliamentary Secretary will let me know, if he can, what the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has given him to understand in regard to this matter.  Let us know whether they intend to go ahead with that building this year, or is this just a sop to keep us quiet in Letterkenny and to keep us from agitating <Col N="1398" /> for this building, which is so urgently required?  That is all I want.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works are not to blame. They are merely acting, as I said, at the outset, as agents for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary then to clear himself in regard to this matter, and if this is being done because of any orders, or brief, or directions which he has from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, then he should tell us so, and we can get right down to that Department and see if they are to blame for the production of this £2,000 for a job which is estimated to cost £29,000, which should have been done years ago and which is obviously not going to be done within the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The same can be said in the matter of Garda barracks and there are two cases which I propose to instance where it is obvious that the present buildings are very bad.  I refer to Carrigart and Kilmacrennan.  In the case of Carrigart, the position has been very bad for a considerable time and still nothing is being done about it this year.  The total estimated cost of rebuilding is £6,500 and a figure of £1,000 is given as the estimated expenditure in the current financial year.  Like the post office I have just mentioned, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to try to clarify the position in regard to Carrigart barracks. The sum of £1,000 which is provided cannot mean that a lot of work will be done this year.</P>
    <P>In regard to Kilmacrennan, the position seems to be a bit more hopeful. There, the estimated total cost is £6,500 and for this year a sum of £3,500 is being provided.  That looks as if the Board of Works means business there and emphasises in the other two cases that business is not meant this year.</P>
    <P>I know that Vote 10 is not being taken together with Votes 8 and 9 and so many of the remarks which I wish to address to the Parliamentary Secretary concerning the Office of Public Works will have to be left over until we reach Vote 10, which, I understand, may be taken immediately after this <Col N="1399" /> Vote is finished.  I wish, therefore, to conclude by saying again, as I said at the start, that it is somewhat amazing to me to see that, while the charges for salaries and incidental expenses have been increased by £35,000, at the same time, the amount of money to be expended on these buildings is being reduced by approximately £350,000 for the current year.  It does appear to me that we are going to pay the same money, perhaps to the same number of people, more or less, and, at the same time, reduce the amount of work those people will be doing to the extent of £350,000.  That means that much less work will be done at the same cost in salaries and expenses this year.  I should like an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary as to why that is so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking over this list of items, I regret to see that, in regard to County Wexford, there is only one item on which money is to be expended this year.  That is in regard to the Commodore Barry memorial at Wexford, for which a sum of £1,800 is included in the Estimate.  I am glad to see the provision of that money, but it would appear that only for the fact that the American people were good enough to honour this man, who was the founder of the American Navy, the Board of Works would not be spending a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; on works in my county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in my constituency, as is well known, the best farmers in the 32 Counties.  In the area outside Enniscorthy, the River Sow runs through thousands of acres of land and deputations have gone to the county council from the farmers in the area who want to have their land drained under the land project scheme and they have been told that it cannot be done because the River Sow is the responsibility of the Board of Works.  This river was attended to when the State was formed, but, since that time, nothing has been done to it with the exception of the occasional time when a county council worker went out and did some trimming.  That is all that is being done and land belonging to the farmers is constantly being flooded. According to this Estimate, there does <Col N="1400" /> not appear to be any hope that the farmers in the county wishing to have their lands drained will get it done.</P>
    <P>We find nothing is being done for the farmers in the County Wexford area and, at the same time, we see that most of the money provided in this Estimate is to be spent on works in Dublin.  There is an item of £20,000 which is to be spent on improvements and furniture for Áras an Uachtaráin. Nowdays the farmers are being asked to produce more and they are trying to do so, and surely it would be better to spend that £20,000 on the drainage and improvement of the farmers' land than on one house in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In Leinster House, a sum of £4,000 is to be spent on the reconstruction of the lobbies in 1956-57, and, reading further down the list, we find that a sum of £10,000 is being provided for a central engineering works and stores for the Office of Public Works.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that the people of the country are saying that the Government is not spending money in a proper way, or does the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister have any say in regard to these Estimates which are being produced and handed to the members of Dáil Eireann coming from rural Ireland, showing that all the moneys under the different headings are to be spent exclusively in the city?</P>
    <P>I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary, the Department of Social Welfare, and the Department of Justice on a few occasions to take over a castle which is lying idle in Enniscorthy.  It is a very famous castle in good repair, with 14 rooms with central heating.  It is lying there to-day and I believe that it could be used to accommodate civil servants.  If the civil servants were put in there, it would mean the saving of a lot of this money which is now being spent on the extension, improvement and renovation of buildings in the city.</P>

      <P>There may be a ghost <Col N="1401" /> in the Deputy's castle, but I do not believe there is any in this one.  We have a great deal of talk on this Estimate year after year and we still have that atmosphere about the Estimate to-day.  If the Department took over this castle in Enniscorthy, it would be a move towards the decentralisation of Government Departments, of which we have heard so much in the past.  Where good sound buildings exist in rural Ireland, it would be an advantage to the ratepayers if they were taken over by the Government. Private individuals cannot purchase some of these buildings and the only remedy is for the Government or the county council to step in and come to the aid of the ratepayers in such cases.</P>
      <P>Drainage should be the main object of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department.  On several occasions, farmers from my own area have come to me about this very important matter.  When I raised the question with the county council they pointed out that it is the responsibility of the Board of Works.  The best of land suitable for tillage is flooded there every winter because nothing is being done &mdash; and nothing has been done since the days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Only a few shillings have been spent here and there since.  Surely, after all the years, something could be done.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have a survey carried out on the River Sow in County Wexford.  If he drains this river, he will do a good day's work for the farming community there who have been appealing time and time again to the county council about this matter. They can get nothing done because the county council say that it is not their responsibility but the responsibility of the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied with the way this money is divided and I am sure other Deputies feel likewise.  Just glance down the list and see where most of the money is to be spent.  Most of it will be spent in or around Dublin City.  For instance, a sum of £38,000 is to be spent on a Garden of Remembrance in the Rotunda Gardens. That is a big item.  I am sure that that sum of money would do a good job <Col N="1402" /> in any constituency where there is a river causing flooding.</P>

      <P>£38,000.  Just look at No. 21 (2) &mdash; Abbotstown Farm: foundation stock farmyard.  The total estimated cost is not yet known.  The total estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1956, was £1,000 and the provision for 1956-57 is £13,500.  No. 26 (2) refers to an artificial insemination centre at Grange Stud and Dairy Farm.  The total estimated cost is £25,000.  The provision for 1956-57 is £1,000.  That money could be devoted, with greater benefit to the nation, to other projects.  Surely there is more important work than that?  Why, if it is continued, it will not be necessary to have bull sales here in Dublin.</P>

      <P>There is a provision here for an artificial insemination centre at Grange Stud and Dairy Farm.  In my view, it is not right that so much money should be spent on that work when we hear so much talk about depression and about money for the farming community.  I want to see drainage schemes which will give good employment.  the farmers want the rivers to be drained by the Office of Public Works, who are in charge of this matter.  Until that is done, the work on the land project will not be satisfactory.  That is the first thing to be done because if the land project is to be a success you must first drain the rivers.</P>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have a survey carried out immediately of the River Sow so that work can commence without delay and so that this coming winter the farmers will not be obliged to take their cattle up to the hills lest they should be swamped by the floods.  I want that assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  I thank God I do not come from a district where the rivers <Col N="1403" /> run slowly.  I support the plea that has been made in respect of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  In this building we have something that is unique in Europe.  It is an architectural gem. Its preservation and maintenance are of the utmost aesthetic value.  It should not be necessary for me to stress how important this building is from the point of view of tourism.  It is an architectural show-piece and it should be kept by us in the best possible condition and handed on to posterity. There is a grave danger that we may lose something here which money cannot buy.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary's Department will at least provide maintenance and give this building the attention that is essential before irremediable harm is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is customary on this debate to discuss arterial drainage. Usually, that is the main topic of discussion on this Estimate.  I propose to keep mainly to arterial drainage and matters concerned with it.</P>
      <P>A lot of useful work has been done down through the years by the Board of Works on drainage, not in my own immediate neighbourhood but in other parts of the country.  I have heard Deputies express that view here and I have seen some of the good work myself.  The principal complaint seems to be that the work is not progressing as quickly as it might.  My view is that the activities of the Board of Works in this connection could be speedier.  The position in the country is that the men engaged on arterial drainage receive rates of pay which are not comparable with the rates payable elsewhere for similar work.  That being so, you will be able to attract &mdash; in the main, in any case &mdash; only the type of person who is not free to go across to England or other countries to engage in this work, perhaps due to family circumstances.  I doubt very much if we have the very best men engaged on this work.  I feel that the best of our people have left and gone across the water to engage in such work in England where they receive higher rates of pay.  It is regrettable that that should be so but I am convinced that, indeed, it is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> Drainage is very important and the pay of the workmen, gangers, supervisors, engineers, and so forth, should at least be equal to the pay applicable for the same type of work across the water.  I should like to advocate a bonus system for these men.  If a man will get £5 or £10 a week, whether he works slowly or quickly, it is easy to understand that he has not the incentive to work hard and to get the job done quickly.  It is important and essential that this work be carried out more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>As things are, I do not think there is any such thing as a bonus scheme. There is no recognition, except progress by promotion, for people who work hard.  You will find the type of person who, regardless of whether he is getting a bonus or not, by his nature, will work hard.  Instead of such a person getting recognition by way of bonus, we often find that he is being laughed at on the job.  That has the effect of slowing down progress in this matter of arterial drainage.  I think the present Parliamentary Secretary, who is quite enthusiastic about having arterial drainage work done, as are the members of his staff in Dublin, as far as I know, should try to do something about establishing a bonus scheme.  If it is possible to have such a scheme in operation in England, surely it is possible to have it in operation here.  I do know that it gives beneficial results and it is well worth considering.</P>
    <P>I know well that the Parliamentary Secretary is expecting me to refer to the problem of the Moy drainage.  I am deeply interested in that problem and I know the Parliamentary Secretary himself is deeply interested in it, and I know that the survey work has been completed.  It took a long time to get that survey work completed. The Parliamentary Secretary increased the number of engineers and the survey staff on the work, and so the survey is now complete.  Still, no start has been made on the drainage of the River Moy, and I could not agree more with Deputy Blaney when he stated that special consideration should be given to the congested areas and to the West of Ireland as a whole, where an acre of land is of so much importance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> I know many people who have emigrated from the Moy Valley to Kildare, Meath or other countries, and the main reason they did so was that their places at home were flooded. Everybody appreciates that it is a very expensive thing to migrate a family.  It is a pity that this should have to be done, because it means the breaking up of community life, with all its sad consequences, and its loss to schools and towns, and so forth.  It can be a serious matter from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>I submit that special consideration should be given to all congested areas where the cancer of emigration is becoming more and more serious.  A new Department is to be set up for the Gaeltacht, and there are the Undeveloped Areas Act and the efforts to provide factories in these districts, but that situation of emigration still exists.  In Mayo, we have got nothing from arterial drainage so far, and I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to try, in the present year, to start work on that river.  As I have already said, I am aware that he appreciates the problem.  I am aware that he has interested himself in a big way in this whole question of the Moy drainage. People have lost heart in my part of the country because they were promised, from one election to another, that this work would be undertaken and now they will have to see the machines on the spot, and the work in progress, before they are convinced that any Government is serious about it.</P>
    <P>A special case can be made for such rivers.  The holdings along them are small and uneconomic, and, in relation to the amount of land that would be reclaimed, colossal sums would be paid in wages.  Our working people would stand to benefit and much more money would be put in circulation.  The problem of the balance of payments could soon be cleared up and there is no quicker way to clear it up than by making greater progress in the field of arterial drainage.  It is no wonder that we have a balance of payments problem when we allow thousands of acres of our best land to remain waterlogged. As Deputy O'Leary pointed out, the work of the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1406" /> and the land reclamation section is being impeded.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a situation in my county where work is almost held up.  Some of the contractors have gone into County Sligo to try to get work there.  They have committed themselves to the purchase of machinery and to the employment of men who are now skilled in this work, and it is skilled work.  They are reluctant to let these men go.  It would be a sad thing if they had to let them go, when they have gained so much experience. This work, in my area, is actually held up and is being impeded as a result of the condition of the River Moy.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that we have a lot of leeway to make up in the matter of getting greater output from our machinery.  We have some of the finest machinery in the world engaged on this work and, while I have the greatest respect for Deputy Beegan, no man was more enthusiastic than the present Parliamentary Secretary in the matter of providing the most modern and up-to-date machinery for excavation work.  However, I doubt very much if it is giving us the return it should be giving, and that is causing serious delay.  In the work on the Corrib I have seen two, or three, or four machines held up, perhaps for the want of spare parts.  It is bad enough when a working man is not pulling his weight, but it is not such a serious matter as when machinery, costing thousands of pounds, is held up.</P>
    <P>The work is being delayed as a result of such machinery being held up. I hate to have to refer to this but only this very morning I was speaking to a man who is a native of County Sligo. He was very critical in regard to what he saw going on on the Corrib in regard to the delay through machinery being held up.  That is a matter that should be inquired into to see what is the cause of it and when the trouble is pin-pointed some action should be the staff falling down on the job there is only one way of dealing with them and that is to dismiss them.</P>
    <P>We know that even at the present taken.  If there are some members of <Col N="1407" /> time such valuable and useful machinery is being held up.  Therefore, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary who, incidentally, does not live too far from where some of these things are happening, to take the necessary steps to see that these machines are kept going day and night if necessary, even if it means having a night shift, in order to get the rivers done.  I feel I have a special case to make in respect of the River Moy.  I do not begrudge to the other parts of the country, Donegal or elsewhere, the benefits of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>It is a pity in the national interest that any of these works would be delayed.  I am sure that what is true of my own area in the matter of reclamation work held up is also true in regard to other parts of the country. It should be appreciated that considerable sums of public money were spent on local authority works drainage.  A lot of the money was spent very usefully but, unfortunately, a lot was spent badly.  The truth, however, is that in opening minor drains, small streams, on to the main arteries, you are creating problems and difficulties. It is generally appreciated that, prior to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, some of these rivers did not cause such a serious problem from the point of view of flooding as they have since.  It is quite natural that when you drain extra water on to rivers that are already overloaded with water you are going to increase further the flooding. It is for that reason I feel it is necessary, where a lot of local authority drainage work is being carried out, to undertake the arterial drainage work at as early a date as possible.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to fishing and repairs to piers.  I feel there is not much co-operation between the local authorities, the engineers of local authorities and the Office of Public Works in this matter.  When one tries to get some repairs carried out to piers and slips, the Office of Public Works almost invariably tell you that that is a matter for the county council.  When you see the county council engineer about the matter, at least in our county, he will tell you it is a matter for the Office of Public Works.  You <Col N="1408" /> are pushed from Billy to Jack and do not know where you stand.</P>
    <P>It is a serious matter that the fishing industry should be hampered by such red tape.  Evidently Deputy Blaney has had a similar experience since he expressed some views on the matter. It seems to me that this complaint is pretty widespread.  Therefore, I would ask the present Parliamentary Secretary to try to bring about better relations between the various county councils in the Republic and the Office of Public Works and let us know once and for all who is responsible for the work and who is going to undertake it. The fishing industry can be developed. It could be built up to almost equal importance with agriculture, but while we have this state of affairs existing it is hard to expect the industry to thrive.  Indeed, it is hard to expect the people to go out fishing, having regard to all the hazards and risks involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to school buildings and Garda barracks, when you go round the country at the present time you can see scores and scores of new buildings erected in recent years and you can see the repair works that have been carried out in a very creditable manner.  The work reflects great credit on the Board of Works.  It is really a pleasure to see the great progress made.  If it were possible to get rid of some of the red tape, I believe we could make greater progress in this field as well.  We must be fair to those responsible for doing this work.  We must give credit to the staff in the Board of Works for having improved the school buildings in many parts of the country.  It is important work. Some school children have to walk a mile or two to school and in many cases in the rural areas they arrive at school buildings that are damp and cold and not properly heated.  That is very bad from the point of view of the health of the children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pass from that subject then but a lot of good work has been undertaken by the Board of <Col N="1409" /> Works in the matter of school buildings and I want to compliment them on the work they have done.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of repair work to Garda barracks.  I often thought that, for the expenditure of small sums on paint or on the replacement of a pane of glass in the windows, a great improvement could be brought about in many of our Garda barracks.  I am not sure if the Board of Works have permanent painters on the road, but I see no difficulty in the way of providing a van with a couple of painters and permitting them to go around the country from one Garda station to another periodically and endeavour to have such painting work carried out. After all, the Garda stations are places to which many people call to make inquiries in relation to roads and places of interest.  I think these buildings should be kept in better condition, particularly when that could be achieved by a small expenditure.</P>
      <P>I wish to conclude on the note on which I started &mdash; the all-important question of arterial drainage.  We in Ireland are fortunate in many ways. We are fortunate in that our climate is reasonably mild and our rivers are not unmanageable.  We have not the problems the Dutch people have.  We have not the problems of trying to keep back tides except, perhaps, in very few places, where a terrible lot of damage is not done.  We, therefore, should bend our energies&mdash;and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bend his&mdash;towards getting an increased output and getting the work through much more quickly than heretofore.  As Deputy Blaney said, I think the present Parliamentary Secretary is the right man for the job.  I would ask him to get behind those few I referred to who are holding up this work and prod them along.  He should let them see that, if they are trying to cod him or his officials, they will not get away with it.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep these matters in mind and remember that these are serious problems.  Particularly is that the case in Mayo in connection with the flooding of the River Moy.</P>

      <P>I have only a few matters to refer to on this Vote.  The first is a <Col N="1410" /> complaint and it is practically the same as that made by Deputy O'Hara, that is, the absolute need for some co-operation between the Department of Local Government, the Board of Works and the local authorities.  I put down two questions in connection with that this week to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Minister for Local mentary Secretary was kind enough to send me a certain amount of correspondence in the matter, but unfortunately the Board of Works do not seem to have grasped even the fringes of what we want to see them about. Government, respectively.  The Parlia-</P>
      <P>We requested that an official of the office be sent to a roads meeting of the Cork County Council to thrash out this matter, together with an official of the Local Government Department. There is no doubt that the rural improvements scheme has helped out enormously, as far as farmers' own roads are concerned, but there are other problems in connection with that, that is in regard to the places where the avenues into these people's land are longer and where larger amounts of money have to be put up by the farmers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My main reason for intervening in this debate is to deal with the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility for the improvement and development of harbours and piers. Representing a constituency which has a big mileage of coastal area, we are generally dissatisfied with the Board of Works.  Our main grievance is that, if any public representatives or any public body seek to have a harbour or pier improved for the benefit of farmers, fishermen and other people, utilising such harbour or pier, it takes <Col N="1411" /> a number of years before anything is done about it.  We have letters going up from, say, the county council to the Department, interviews by T.D.s and so on, and usually it is about four or five years before any work of a practical nature is commenced.  That is completely out of order.  I regard harbours and piers as very important work, but so far as this Estimate, as presented to us this year, is concerned, there is a very little money for such work in it.</P>
      <P>It is true that the total cost of major fishery harbour surveys has not yet been estimated according to this document presented to us.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary is he going to allow that state of affairs to continue?  Is he going to allow the people in his Department and whoever is responsible to delay unjustifiably in regard to improvement works in particular districts?  In a constituency like West Cork, where fishing, the landing of sand for manurial purposes, and so on, is of such great importance to the people, we are pressing and have been pressing, unfortunately with little avail, over a number of years to get proper harbours and piers down there.  These are the only moneys we can expect to get out of this Vote.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring to get some information, if the Parliamentary Secretary will give it, as to the causes of this delay.  The delay is so remarkable that if a person approached you to get a harbour or pier improved or a landing place on the islands around West Cork coast, you would be loath to take the matter in hands at all, knowing the type the people in the Board of Works are and knowing that every possible hindrance will be placed in your way and that you will be awaiting this scheme, even after it is recommended as a justifiable one, for four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must bear in mind that there is a number of such harbours and piers along the coastal areas of this country, particularly in the South and West and the people there are trying to press ahead as quickly as possible, and in a <Col N="1412" /> reasonable way, improvements to these harbours and piers.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows very well, or can ascertain in his office, that, so far as West Cork, with well over 120 miles of coastal area, is concerned, they are getting very little money over the past number of years for these works.</P>
    <P>That is the main reason why I rise to contribute to this debate.  It may be said it is a small matter, but private representations to the Parliamentary Secretary and to his officers have met with little result.  You are always told that the matter is under active consideration. The way you can define the term &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo;, as implied by the Board of Works, is that if you inquire about the same project again in 12 months, it is still under active consideration.  That is an out-of-the-way manner in which to do public business.</P>
    <P>A great percentage of time in this debate was taken up on this question of arterial drainage, so far as it relates to the West of Ireland.  Apparently, arterial drainage works seem to be confined to the West.  Whether that is due to the fact that the present Parliamentary Secretary and the former Parliamentary Secretary are from the West of Ireland, I do not know.  We have an annual wail made here by a number of Deputies about the Moy, the Suck and the Corrib.  These representations may be necessary in regard to catchment areas, but there is need for arterial drainage in other parts of the country.  In West Cork, we endeavoured to get drainage work carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but were informed by the engineering advisers that the work was of such a nature as to be outside the scope of the Act and that the only way in which it could be carried out was through arterial drainage.  There is little use in talking to the Board of Works about arterial drainage for West Cork.  They are too much perturbed about the question of arterial drainage in the areas represented by the Parliamentary Secretaries in both Governments and their particular followers. That is how I find the position.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two other items, <Col N="1413" /> one of which has been referred to by almost every Deputy who contributed to the debate, that is, the question of the improvement of school buildings. There is a number of buildings which are, to put it mildly, disgraceful.  The Board of Works should be obliged to inspect these buildings periodically, in conjunction with the managers, and to compel the managers, if they are reluctant, to carry out essential improvements. It is a scandalous state of affairs that there are buildings that have not been painted in the last 100 years situated on the main roads.</P>

      <P>I am relating it to this Vote in this way, that school managers will tell you that, having got approval for the work from the Department of Education, it is very difficult to get the Board of Works to carry out the work.  The carrying out of Board work is the responsibility of the Board of Works.  I have received complaints from a number of managers saying that the fault is not theirs that the buildings are not being improved and that the work which they consider necessary has not been carried out, that it is very difficult to get the Board of Works to move in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first item on the list in the Estimate is Árus an Uachtaráin.  We should all like to see that building maintained in a most up-to-date manner, it being the residence of the President, but it is time that improvement works and furnishing were completed. Over the past number of years, we have been expending thousands of pounds on that building. It was assumed last year that the work would be completed by 31st March, 1956.  Now, there is another legacy for the year 1956-57.  There seems to be plenty of money when it is a question of this residence in the Phoenix Park, but when a Deputy from a coastal area seeks a few hundred pounds for the improvement of a pier or harbour money cannot be found.  Having regard to the size and general economy <Col N="1414" /> of the country, I consider that too much money has been expended on Árus an Uachtaráin.</P>
    <P>There is a total estimated cost for improvements and furnishing of £39,000.  It would be very enlightening if the Parliamentary Secretary would give the figures that have been expended on this building over the past number of years.  It is only right that Deputies from rural areas that are hard hit economically should protest vigorously against the expenditure of such large sums of money on one building in the City of Dublin.  I single out that building for particular reference. I do so with no disrespect to its occupant.  As Irishmen, we all respect whoever is President for the time being.  We are not finding fault with him in any way, but we are finding fault with the people who are responsible for throwing away that money on one building in the City of Dublin.  It is time that the people responsible for compiling the Estimate saw to it that there is an end to this matter of improvement and furnishing of Árus an Uachtaráin.</P>

      <P>Despite Deputy Murphy's remarks, I intend to say a few words on the subject of arterial drainage.  I do not think Deputy Murphy is quite correct in talking about the annual wail from the West of Ireland.  I do not think that Deputy Murphy can have very serious problems in this regard in his own constituency because, if he had the problem that exists in the West, there would be more than an annual wail from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very good work being done under the grants which the various local authorities are getting under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but this method of dealing with minor drainage problems is really only picking at the matter.  It is absolutely essential, if the full benefits of the grants which local authorities are receiving under the Act are to be obtained, that the problem should be dealt with differently.  It may be that there are so many problems of this nature that the Office of Public Works cannot cope with them all at once.  I know their hands are full.  Nevertheless, we are only picking at the problem <Col N="1415" /> with these grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>There is one minor catchment area which I have in mind and which I should like to mention to-day, that is, the catchment area of the Killimor river.  As far as I know, representation has been made concerning the drainage of the Killimor river for many years.  We all agree that it is Government policy to increase the productivity of the land.  It is possibly not an exaggeration to say that, within that area, there would be, in all, approximately 100,000 or more acres benefiting from a minor scheme.  This is not a task which would take anything like the time to develop that a major arterial drainage scheme would take, such as the Corrib and other major schemes which will take years. The drainage of the Killimor river would be a comparatively small job and the effect would be tremendous within a short period of time.</P>
    <P>I would specially ask the Parliamentary Secretary, as far as possible, to give priority to minor catchment schemes of this nature, for the simple reason that the survey in the first instance will be a small task in comparison with surveys of major schemes and secondly, the execution of the work would take a short time, in comparison with the execution of the work on the major schemes.  As far as I know, the execution of the work on the Killimor river would not be dependent on the prior execution of a major scheme and, for that reason, it can be done as an entirely isolated scheme, divorced from any major scheme.  I have already made representations to have this work done under the land reclamation and the land rehabilitation schemes, but it is held up and cannot be done until the drainage of the river has first been carried out.  It affects a large number of families and a large area of land.  Although it is only a minor scheme the benefits to be derived from it would be great.  It is too big to be considered under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy suggested that most of the talk on this Estimate <Col N="1416" /> every year was about schemes of drainage in the West of Ireland.  I do not think anything could be further from the truth.  If Deputy Murphy had to face some of the problems which face us in the West of Ireland, I feel sure he would not be slow to talk about them.  I am glad to say that the Parliamentary Secretary is doing great work in the West and, although I feel sure it has occurred to him already, I should like to ask him to put some of his men and machinery, in so far as he can spare them, on a minor scheme on this river.  I have said before, and I repeat it only by way of emphasis, the length of time to survey this river, the cost and the length of time for execution of the work would be comparatively small in relation to the benefits that would be forthcoming.  This is work that must be undertaken by the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I wish to raise and I do so with all humility because of my short time in the House. I should like to refer to the visitors' waiting room in Leinster House.  I think it is a most undignified spot in which to have visitors waiting before admission.  The cost of improving it sufficiently would not be too much; I do not think it would affect the Minister's Estimate very much each year, and I do think that some more dignified structure should be available in which callers could wait for Deputies or while they were awaiting admission to Leinster House.  I feel sure the Parliamentary Secretary has had this matter in mind but I should like to add my voice to those of other Deputies who have mentioned the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of arterial drainage can be estimated from the fact that practically every Deputy who has spoken on this Estimate has referred to it.  Important as arterial drainage is in the fertile lands of the country, it takes on an added importance when one travels to the small uneconomic farms on the western seaboard.  It is on behalf of the small landholders in the West that I intervene in this debate.  There is no need for me to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that in the West good land is very scarce and very precious.  For that <Col N="1417" /> reason drainage is most important to the people if they are to hold on to the fairly good land they have been tilling over the years.</P>
      <P>From time to time, application has been made from various areas in West Donegal to have important drainage work carried out on the local rivers but unfortunately Government after Government have turned down our requests, so that the position is worse to-day than it was 20 years ago.  Along some of our smaller rivers in West Donegal we certainly have good fertile land, or land considered good in West Donegal.  It is disheartening to find year after year, the crops of the small farmers being carried away by the yearly floods.</P>
      <P>I have in mind two rivers, one the Owenea in the Glenties area and the other the Crolly river near Gweedore. The yearly losses to farmers along those rivers are a very serious matter. We feel that the Government should pay a little more attention to the question of arterial drainage in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  If these smaller rivers have to wait until the larger schemes have been carried out, I predict it will be in the neighbourhood of 50 years before the problem is solved.  By that time, if depopulation continues at its present rate, there will be no need whatever to drain the rivers because the problems that confront the people will not arise for the simple reason that there will be no farmers left in that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the delay in proceeding with the construction of piers and slips that have been sanctioned a considerable time ago.  Piers and slips are very important in the lives of the West Donegal people and of the people in the other western counties.  The success of the local fishing industry depends a great deal on the provision of such slips and piers.  For some years past, we have been informed that a new pier is to be erected in Magheraroarty in West Donegal, to serve the local fishing boats of the islands of Inishbofin and Tory.  One could understand the delay if the money had not <Col N="1418" /> been voted and the plans prepared.  We were informed two years ago that the construction of this pier would commence in the near future.  Two years afterwards it is necessary for me to stand up in the House and inform the Parliamentary Secretary that the work has not been done.</P>
    <P>The same applies to a smaller scheme in Curransport which also serves the islands on the west coast of Donegal. There does not seem to be anything to prevent the commencement of that small scheme and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to inquire why this delay continues year after year.  We have the same position in Arranmore Island for which certain projects were sanctioned.  I understand the plans have been prepared or are in the course of preparation.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into these matters which are of vital importance to a part of the country that, unfortunately, suffers more from emigration and migration than any other part of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The provision of piers will undoubtedly help the fishing industry and would keep more and more young people at home.  The drainage of the few rivers I have mentioned will help the small landholders in that part of the country where good land is scarce. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, who undoubtedly will have sympathy with the people of that part of the country, will take steps to have something done in the matter.  I feel that any Government should give more attention to the question of drainage in the Gaeltacht and the congested areas and to the provision of piers and slips.  I feel also that if the Parliamentary Secretary is given an increase in his Vote he will be only too glad to spend that additional money in those areas that require it so much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Breslin pressing for the provision of an increased number of piers.  My experience is &mdash; of course I have not as much experience of the West as Deputy Breslin &mdash; that we have far too many piers.  Back in the old days when people suffered from privation <Col N="1419" /> and want, a lot of money was spent on the building of small piers to accommodate small fishing boats.  Piers will not be needed in future to serve such small vessels.</P>
      <P>The trawler of an ordinary, normal size can come into a port 50 miles distant from another port for one reason or another &mdash; for instance, because the fish would be nearer to the market or because it would be easier to come in.  The provision of small piers along every two or three miles of coast is, in my view, a great mistake and a waste of public money.  I think our approach to the problem now should have relation to the high efficiency of the trawlers one sees nowadays, the speed with which they can travel and the ease with which they can enter ports which are able to provide sufficient depth for them.  It should be our view that the provision of numbers of piers, just because individual communities require them, is probably a great waste of public money.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to present a bouquet to the Board of Works with regard to their work in the provision of new schools.  First of all, they design new schools all over the country.  I think the design in rural areas is rather stereotyped&mdash;the schools are similar in each case&mdash;but excellent. Nobody has offered any real criticism of the design or structure of the schools which have been built over the last few years.  Certainly I should like to say that, notwithstanding the fact that over a long period of years the Board of Works has perhaps been labelled as the place where most delays occur, it has been my experience as a Deputy that the Board of Works has been most helpful, so far as my constituency is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember one instance which occurred recently when I met a parish priest on his way to the Board of Works in St. Stephen's Green and he said to me: &ldquo;I am just going into the Board of Works about a new school.&rdquo; I said to him: &ldquo;Tell me, Father, how do you find them in the Board of Works?&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;The decentest people I have ever met. There are many difficulties, but we can <Col N="1420" /> sit around a table, talk about them and do our best to solve these problems. I know that I will get my new school just as quickly as it can be provided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All parish priests might not express the same point of view and many of them may be irritated by the delays that occur, but many of these delays are occasioned by very excellent reasons, for instance, the necessity to make sure that there will be a proper water supply, the necessity to have a suitable site and the necessity to have other things of that kind looked after. There is also the necessity to get &mdash; if that is possible &mdash; the cheapest tender. These things take time, and while a body as large as the Board of Works must necessarily move slowly, I should like to hand a bouquet to the Board of Works for their work in my constituency in providing new schools at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I now move on to consider the Glyde and Dee drainage.  There are two positive aftermaths which are unpleasant to the people who have to suffer from them.  One is the great damage that has been done to farmers in the draining of the Glyde and Dee; the second is the damage that has been done to what one might term the Annagassan fishermen.  With regard to the farmers &mdash; and, I suppose, also with regard to the fishermen &mdash; the policy of the Board of Works must be conservative in these matters.  If damage has been caused, if it is going to cost money to repair it, if there must be a disbursement of funds, the normal approach to the problem by the Parliamentary Secretary and by the Board of Works in general, will be conservative and it will be very hard to get money out of them.  Any other approach to the problem must necessarily mean that too much public money will be wasted, that applications will be made by ten or 20 or 30 people where perhaps only one application is justified.</P>
    <P>That approach can have the opposite effect, because decent, honest farmers, or, indeed, fishermen, may not have at their disposal the words or the facilities to put their complaint in the proper light and it may well be that <Col N="1421" /> in offices down the country their requests are often, shall we say, not ignored, but placed in a file which is allowed to become dusty.  I feel that a more positive approach is needed to this problem and I would say that I do know &mdash; and I would register my complaint &mdash; that the farmers and fishermen to whom I have referred have been treated rather badly by the Board of Works.  I could mention cases where the Board of Works, while draining the Glyde and Dee rivers, placed huge piles of spoil, which were no use for spreading on agricultural land, huge boulders, and heaps of shale in positions where they interfered with the proper grazing of the land, and where, perhaps, the provision of a small hedge or small wire fence would have meant that the farmers could continue to graze their cattle where they had previously grazed them.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, we find that great loss has been occasioned because this huge heap of spoil takes up an area much larger than is really necessary. If the matter had been approached in a common-sense fashion and if fences which had been destroyed were replaced, or if fences were provided where they became necessary because of the drainage of the river by the Board of Works, this situation could have been avoided.  In the disbursement of public money we must be ultraconservative; we cannot afford to spend money on every applicant who puts in an application of this nature, but I do think an individual approach is needed in this case and I would make an appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to see that such an approach is used in dealing with the farmers in my constituency who have suffered as a result of the drainage of the Glyde and Dee.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that, whatever suffering was caused to individual farmers, nothing has brought such wonderful results and has so benefited the farmers of the district as this drainage has.  There are areas, which were bottoms, as they are called in our district, and which were used for grass but which in wet seasons were of no use.  Perhaps for six months of the year they were useless, but now they <Col N="1422" /> are capable of being grazed all the year round.  I think that is a wonderful improvement, but even if there was no improvement resulting from that drainage in that way, we now know that for the next 50 years or so there will not be one further field becoming a bog this year and a further field next year, as was the case during the 30 years of neglect due to financial and other reasons that preceded this drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>I now move on to consider the Annagassan fishermen.  Various theories have been propounded as to whether or not drainage has affected salmon fishing but, no matter what theories are propounded, nothing is as good as hard experience.  It is found all round where extensive drainage was carried on indiscriminately &mdash; and I suppose to be efficient it is necessary that it be indiscriminate &mdash; there has been grave loss to the salmon fishermen at the mouths of the rivers and this grave loss was occasioned to the Annagassan fishermen.  I, in my way of business, am in that village at least four or five days a week.  I remember when men, who could find employment with the farmers or in other businesses for may be eight months of the year, could go back to fishing salmon at Annagassan on the Glyde and Dee, at the fusion of the two rivers, for the months of the salmon fishing season.  They could make plenty of profit out of it, and as a matter of fact, it was a boon to the village, but with the advent of the Glyde and Dee drainage scheme, that has ceased.  Last year, about ten people set out to fish salmon, where before there might have been 50.  After a fortnight, they ceased to fish salmon. They tried again in another week or fortnight, but again they could not catch a fish.  I think I would not be incorrect in saying that the number of salmon caught in that mouth of those two rivers last year did not go into two figures &mdash; did not exceed ten salmon &mdash; and that in an area where an entire village had lived on this industry and had been able to put aside money for the winter every year!</P>
    <P>That is just one of these things which occur.  If we want to make an omelette, we cannot make it without <Col N="1423" /> breaking eggs; but, at the same time, these people, I think, find themselves cast aside because there are bigger fish to fry.  I think it is necessary that these people should be met, whether by the Board of Works, the Department of Finance or any other Government Department, and should be given some undertaking that, either they will be compensated for their losses or that there will be real and positive action taken by the Government to restock these rivers.</P>
    <P>It may be asked was the drainage of the Glyde and Dee responsible for this, and was it not true in the past that there was a cycle perhaps of five years when there was not a good yield from these rivers?  That argument does not hold.  If you want proof of it, you can go to Annagassan and you will not find the fishermen fishing there, but you will find them on the River Dee, because there is still dirt and refuse coming down the Glyde, and the fish will not go up there.  No salmon will go up a river that is sour; and if drainage has that effect, we must meet the situation.  In my view, compensation should be given to these fishermen, or alternatively we should be in a position to restock the rivers over a period of five or ten years, and the money necessary to do that would be very small in relation to the amount spent on drainage.  But it must be given if these 30, 40 or 50 men are not to be cast aside, just because in numbers and in influence they are not as important as those who were looked after in the drainage of the Glyde and Dee Rivers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take up this matter in his Department and make himself acquainted with these hard facts.  I can say to him that the Deputies of my constituency will be with him in the near future to discuss what can be done in regard to the Glyde and Dee Rivers.  These men are not afraid for the future; all they want is hope for the future, or else some compensation for the losses occasioned.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that there has been criticism of the fact that men on the Glyde and Dee drainage <Col N="1424" /> work and on drainage work generally have been paid a sum greater than agricultural labourers.  There is not any comparison, because these men can be told to go 20 or 30 miles to their work in the morning, and they have no choice but to go.  If they do not, they just can leave their work and go to the employment exchange.  There is no fixity of tenure for a drainage worker. For that reason, he must keep two houses; he must pay his landlady and send money home to his wife and family; his life is an arduous one. I do not think these men are overpaid. To be honest, I think, for the work they do, they are probably underpaid. and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider in the future whether or not these men are entitled to some increase in pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a few points on these Votes, Nos. 8 and 9. The Parliamentary Secretary is looking for a sum of roughly £4,500,000 for the services of the Office of Public Works.  Vote 8 bears the salaries and expenses of the administrative and executive sections in the Office of Public Works.  That office is of course responsible for the administration of Vote 9.  Vote 9 provides the funds for the purchase of sites for buildings for State purposes and for the erection, maintenance and furnishing of Government offices and other State premises, and also for the erection and improvement of national schools.  On this question of the provision of national schools, during the course of the debate, we heard some criticism of the approach of the Office of Public Works in dealing with the preparation of plans and the development of sites and other techinicalities related to the provision of schools generally.  In my experience, there is always a third party and in some instances we cannot level all the criticism at the Office of Public Works for the delays which sometimes occur in developing local sites for national schools, or in the negotiations and techincalities in drawing up plans and providing specifications or bills of quantity and matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could relate a tale which applies to a Midland town, not in my own constituency, <Col N="1425" /> where a teacher who has taught for over 40 years in condemned buildings is now forced by circumstances to teach in a converted shed. One could feel rather strongly on this matter, because, as well as the welfare of the teacher, one would have to consider the welfare of the children attending this shed, and, as we are spending large sums of money on health, in order to provide against infectious diseases of one kind or another affecting our children, I think it is too bad that at this stage, since a site has been purchased in the area, that negotiations should not be put in hand immediately to have the building started.  We all know that if children attending a draughty shed develop T.B., or a rheumatic disease of one kind or another, those diseases can affect them for the rest of their natural lives, and I think we should make it plain in this House that the blame should be apportioned proportionately. If local interests do not live up to their responsibilities, at least the parents and the children and, in the last analysis, this House should be severely critical of their attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>To come to drainage now, the Shannon valley flooding has been mentioned and the survey which followed the disaster of 1954.  I come from the Shannon valley.  In Longford and Westmeath, we have two rivers, the flooding of which badly affects both those counties.  We have the River Inny, which is placed No. 6 on the priority list and in respect of which I queried the Office of Public Works on a few occasions.  I always seemed to get the same answer.  On one occasion I was told that the survey was in <Col N="1426" /> hand, but that the report was not available and that it might take anything from four to five years before the Office of Public Works could say when they would be in a position to start even preliminary operations.  I think that is just too bad because it is generally conceded that the flooding of the River Inny affects thousands of acres of the best agricultural land in the country; and I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for pressing ahead with the preliminaries, at any rate, in relation to the River Inny.  Further than that, I will not go.</P>
      <P>We have then a second river, the Camlin.  I think it appears in the priority list as the Longford and, so far as I can gather, it is No. 15 in the minor catchment schemes.  So far as I am aware, there has been no move of any kind to deal with the Camlin in any shape or form.  Nevertheless, the Camlin was mentioned in the report of the Drainage Commission in 1940 and that report contained various recommendations in relation to the drainage of the Camlin river.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take steps as soon as possible to deal with these two rivers at present causing havoc in the Shannon valley.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy McQuillan who mentioned the report of the American expert in relation to the Shannon.  Speaking from memory now, certain recommendations were made some years ago in the report of the Drainage Commission and on the advice of our own engineers; if some move were made now, apart altogether from the report we may get from the expert from abroad, by the Office of Public Works to quicken up the flow of the Shannon from Athlone onwards &mdash; I admit that might be a big undertaking &mdash; then some of the problems affecting us in the Shannon valley would be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flooding over the past few years arises, I think, for the most part from the fact that so many bogs have been drained by Bord na Móna in the Midlands directly into the Shannon.  In 1954, when we had heavy and incessant rain, all the water heeled-up around Athlone and then spread out <Col N="1427" /> over the surrounding countryside.  I think we should take steps in easy stages to combat this menace.  If, and when, the report of the expert becomes available, the Office of Public Works should be put to work forthwith to see if we can find even a partial solution of this problem without delay.  It is a problem in the Midlands.  Even in a normal year, not to mind about an abnormal one, we are seriously affected by the Inny, the Camlin and the Shannon in and around County Longford.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig referred to the preservation of buildings of note, buildings of public interest and buildings of architectural importance.  He mentioned the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. Some time ago, there was talk of the Dublin Corporation reconstructing the Royal Hospital to house their staffs.  We would be delighted if that should come about because the Royal Hospital, apart from its association in the past with wild romance and high endeavour, is conceded by experts to be an architectural gem.  It is a pity that at this stage of our development we should let it fall into decay and into such a state of disrepair that it is no longer habitable.</P>
    <P>Likewise, there are certain houses in the City of Dublin and elsewhere which, in my opinion, could and should be preserved.  We have the home of Tom Clarke in Parnell Street, the homes of Richard Brinsley Sheridan and of John Mitchel.  A move should be made, preferably voluntary, if people were sufficiently civic-minded, to preserve those buildings but if a move is not made voluntarily, then steps should be taken by the State, even in a small way, to preserve these famous buildings.</P>
    <P>Someone mentioned in the course of this debate the delays which occurred in the machinery section of the Board of Works.  We have a number of very costly excavators and other machinery for dealing with arterial drainage.  In the course of my duties as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee we discussed the problem of running these machines in an economic fashion.  The <Col N="1428" /> majority of these machines were very costly, some of them costing £43,000. There are other types such as dredgers and excavators which cost upwards of £30,000.  The purchase of these machines represents a very substantial investment and I think it is incumbent on us, and particularly on the Minister, to see that these machines are kept working round the clock, if that is at all possible, because it is very easy to understand that if you do not use them on a round-the-clock basis they are not going to pay their way.  It may not be easy to arrange for that; in these matters the layman is very much at sea, but the experts should know more about the possibilities of the use of these machines for the longest possible working periods.</P>
    <P>I think it should be possible, having regard to the experience we have gained in working these machines over a number of years, to find some means of operating them more economically. I will for the present be content with saying that much because I am not prepared to go into the matter in greater detail.  I would say, however, that I have experience of the smaller type of machines which are used around farmers' premises and the farmers hold that if they cannot get work for the machines, at least for two-thirds of the time, that the machinery does not pay them.  I take it much the same applies when it is a question of machinery operated by a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I will satisfy myself now with saying once again to the Parliamentary Secretary that I hope that in the course of the coming year his office will be able to give me a more detailed account of the operations to date regarding the survey of the River Inny and that I shall also hear from them regarding the future plans for Camlin River.</P>

      <P>The matter to which I want to refer and on which I want to tackle the Parliamentary Secretary is also this question of drainage. I am not at all happy about the progress that is being made in the implementation of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  On other occasions and in other places we got the impression <Col N="1429" /> from the pronouncements of the Parliamentary Secretary, perhaps when he had not the same amount of responsibility as he now has, that if he were to find himself in his present position things would hum and hum very considerably in regard to this matter of arterial drainage throughout the whole country because of his interest and anxiety about the progress of the arterial drainage programme. We are anxious about the programme, but we do not see any indication of this humming which we were led to expect.</P>
      <P>It is nearly two years ago since a deputation came here and was received very kindly by the Parliamentary Secretary, in connection with the River Deale in County Limerick.  I do not want any extra favourable consideration for either the Deale or the Maigue in Limerick.  There was a previous priority list and I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary, and I want him to be specific about it, whether that priority list still holds. There were certain alterations made in it when one river was brought up and that put the others back one place and put the River Deale in the 11th place, according to the information we got from the previous Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Beegan, last year.  I want to know what progress is being made in regard to the starting of a survey of the Deale and whether any provision has been made or any consideration has been given to the matter so far.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately I was not able to be here when the Parliamentary Secretary was making his statement when introducing this Vote and I do not think that he referred to that matter of the Deale at all.  I know that this process of arterial drainage is a slow one and that it will take years upon years before it is completed, but I do not think that the progress made so far is satisfactory or that the work has gone ahead with the expedition with which we were led to believe it would proceed when the present Parliamentary Secretary was in charge of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather handicapped here to-day because I had a certain document from which to quote in connection with this <Col N="1430" /> matter of drainage.  It was sent to me presumably by a native of Limerick now living in the West of Ireland; it was a copy of the <i>Connacht Tribune.</i> It was sent to me with a report of a speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary in March last marked on it but unfortunately the paper has got lost.  I am, therefore, without more ammunition which I badly need for the purpose of this debate.  The Parliamentary Secretary was speaking about drainage schemes in progress or contemplated in the West of Ireland and principally in Galway at the present moment.  I drew the conclusion from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that he more or less gave the impression that there would not be any other drainage schemes in Ireland except those concerned with the West of Ireland and particularly with Galway. If that is the Parliamentary Secretary's view and if he adheres to it, he is in for trouble.</P>

      <P>I can tell him there will be wigs upon the green.  I remember one sentence out of that speech.  It was to the effect that the machinery was in Galway and he gave the impression that he was going to see that it would stay in Galway and in Connacht.  We in other parts of Ireland are just as much interested as the people of Galway and Connacht in this question of arterial drainage.  We want no priority beyond the priority available to us on the list.  However, we want to see that that priority list is rigidly adhered to and that continuous progress is made in the implementation of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.</P>
      <P>I want to know now specifically from the Parliamentary Secretary what are the prospects of any start, in the near future, of operations on the River Deale in Limerick, at least as far as the survey staff is concerned.  The information I have gathered during the course of years is that that survey is a protracted business itself, not to talk of the start of the carrying out of a comprehensive arterial drainage scheme on any river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> That is all I have to say in regard to this Vote.  There are a whole lot of other matters in which we are all interested, particularly rural Deputies. This is a Vote which concerns the representatives of rural areas in particular, I think.  However, there are a whole lot of other matters in regard to school buildings, the erection of vocational schools and other matters of that kind but the principal thing about which I want to speak to-day and to call to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary is the question of the arterial drainage side of the Office of Public Works.  I ask him to let us know definitely how we stand in County Limerick with regard to the River Deale.  We can come to the River Maigue later on; that is 14th on the list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, may I thank the 22 Deputies who spoke on this Estimate?  Certainly, from my predecessor, Deputy Beegan, who started the debate, to Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain, the 22nd Deputy to speak, the whole discussion was very helpful.  It was kept on a plane this year that I am proud of, just as every one of the 22 Deputies who spoke in this debate should be proud of it.</P>
      <P>The one complaint from Deputy Blaney and others as regards the Vote was that in Vote 9 there is a reduction &mdash;that is, in the work of the office&mdash; whereas, on the staff of the office, Vote 8, there is no reduction.  The reduction in Vote 9 should be accompanied, Deputies say, by a reduction in Vote 8. Apart from the fact that the increase in Vote 8 includes provision for pay increases of general application, the Vote includes a substantial amount for staff who are working on projects which have not yet reached the stage at which expenditure from Vote 9 is required.  A good example of this would be the cost of engineering and other staff engaged on survey, design and the preparation of arterial drainage schemes, as well as architectural staff engaged in planning other works which have not yet reached the contract stage.  That is the explanation. Apparently, it was the only criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain, when finishing his speech, said he was not too happy at all about the arterial drainage position.  Neither am I. Neither is any Deputy in this House. No matter what speed we attain, surely Deputies will all agree with me &mdash;it is my view, anyway&mdash;that we can never go fast enough.  Deputy Ó Briain referred to an item in a newspaper which somebody from the West of Ireland sent him.  It concerned a speech I made at some place or other. Well, as regards machinery, certainly they have more drainage machinery, I think, in the South of Ireland at the moment than we have in the West.  If I did make that statement what I really meant was that by the time the Corrib in Galway is finished some other scheme will probably be prepared and some of that machinery can be handed on.  I hope that, before the machinery finally leaves Kerry, it will go into Limerick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it is very unfair to talk about Galway or the province of Connacht as if they were getting something to which they are not entitled.  I suppose I have to carry that cross.  I feel it is very unfair. One of our first schemes was the Brosna; that is the heart of Leinster, so to speak.  Then comes the Glyde and Dee, which affect Counties Monaghan and Louth.  The third scheme was the Feale in Kerry and Limerick.  I think that if Connacht or Galway are getting something now, they are entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it plain that we are not responsible for any delays with regard to national schools.  The allocation this year is £1,350,000.  I hope we will spend it all. <Col N="1433" /> There are no delays, so far as we in the Board of Works are concerned, in the carrying out of that work. Deputies must realise that a site has to be provided by the manager.  We send our architect down there.  In some cases, the site may not be suitable. The drainage facilities may not be suitable there.  Probably the water facilities are not up to the mark.  The title may not be correct there.  All that causes delay, but we have to do it.  It will be seen, however, that the delays are not our fault.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have approached me on the matter of having schools, as they say, &ldquo;up-to-date.&rdquo;  I agree.  I agree that no school should be built without proper water being laid on and sewerage.  However, we are not the bosses at all.  Where it is possible to have such amenities, where the manager agrees to them, we are only too delighted to provide them.  We ask for that co-operation.  I hope that, from to-day out, where it is possible that facilities such as water and so forth can be got, they will have such facilities in any school that will be erected in the future, whether in urban or rural areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary mentioned the River Sow.  It is an old drainage district.  It was restored under the 1924 Act and further works were done in it in the early 1930s.  Its maintenance is the responsibility of the Wexford County Council.  It is No. 16 on the minor catchment list for consideration under the 1945 Act.  That is the position about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney referred to Milford National Schools, Donegal.  He said the Board of Works were responsible for the delay in building the school.  Plans and specifications have to be prepared before tenders can be invited from contractors. In the case of that school, the Board of Works architects have been working on the plans and these will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> Deputy Beegan referred, I think, to the Deale-Swillyburn scheme and its place on the list.  I think it was during his term of office that it was decided to go on with the survey of that scheme.  It is now completed and we expect that work will start on it this year.</P>
    <P>The Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, was mentioned by several Deputies. That building was evacuated because of danger arising from deterioration of the woodwork in the roof and elsewhere. Steps are now being taken to put repair work in hands but the future of the building has not yet been decided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan was worried about the progress on the Corrib scheme and said that I said it would take ten years to complete it.  I think Deputy Beegan himself made that statement before ever I did.  I hope it will not take ten years; anything we can do to speed up the job is being done.  I think the Deputy realises better than I do that the Corrib has about the hardest rock cut in Europe, but, nevertheless, I hope it will not take ten years.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon was mentioned here by several Deputies, particularly by Deputy McQuillan.  The position is, as the House knows, that the engineer was brought over here some time ago and he has submitted a preliminary report on the matter.  That has been circulated to the other Departments for their comments.  I think it has been returned and sent on to the engineer.  We are waiting now for his final report and the moment we get it the House will hear about it.  I hope it will lead to something being done along the Shannon, if anything can ever be done there.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke wants to know who is responsible for the maintenance of piers and harbours.  It is not so easy to answer that question.  We have various harbour authorities and county councils which are responsible for maintenance.  The Office of Public Works is responsible for Dún Laoghaire, Howth and Dunmore East.  There are several harbours constructed under the Marine (Works) Act of 1902 and there are 12 slipways and piers built by <Col N="1435" /> the Congested Districts Board.  We have no responsibility for any repair work.  As regards Howth Harbour, work on an extensive dredging programme to be spread over three years began last year.  Balbriggan is the responsibility of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and Loughshinny is the responsibility of Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>Another old eye-sore of mine was referred to by many Deputies.  That is the gate lodge at the entrance to Leinster House.  The position is that it was under examination several times and some years ago a plan for its improvement and extension was prepared by the Office of Public Works. That plan was not acceptable to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which took the view that any work done there would have to conform with the general scheme of improvement and extension of Leinster House.  May I say that if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges wishes to make representations on that matter, I shall be only too glad to get the work done, and the sooner the better?  Deputies should make their representations on the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I agree that the place is a disgrace, but as soon as representations are made to us, we will carry out the work.</P>

      <P>My information is that they did not.  They turned down the recommendations that were made to them.  If I am not correct in that, I shall let the Deputy know later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon wanted to know about repairs to the pier at Greencastle. A survey has been made by the Office of Public Works, but the report is not yet available.  No representations have been made with regard to the need for repairs there.  Such representations should be made to the Donegal County Council, which is responsible for the maintenance of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Beegan raised the question of the memorial at the Custom House. <Col N="1436" /> I am informed that the memorial committee have made arrangements for the unveiling ceremony to take place on the 20th May.</P>
    <P>I was also asked by several Deputies to give some report as regards progress on drainage schemes throughout the country.  The Brosna scheme is completed. On the Glyde and Dee, about 90 per cent. of the work has been done. On the Feale about 80 per cent. of the work has been done.  On the Corrib-Clare about 16 per cent. of the work has been done.  As regards survey work, the Deale-Swillyburn has been completed and work on the Maine, in Kerry, has also been completed.  I am wondering what subject of debate some of the Kerry Deputies will select when that work is in operation next year. At one time they spoke about the Feale and, when we got the work going there, they started about the Maine. When the work on the Maine is in progress and the Estimate comes along this time 12 months, what subject will they select at all?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be my fault if it is not.  Deputy O'Hara and other Deputies mentioned the question of the River Moy.  The survey is completed there and the design is in hand. Deputy Beegan mentioned that there was some delay in the work on the Suck.  That is not the case.  There is no delay whatever.</P>
      <P>Some other Deputies have raised the point of the maintenance of those schemes.  It is always a sore point when people have to pay.  It is all right when the money is coming from the Government and the taxpayers generally.  I was delighted when Deputy Beegan referred to this matter and said that he believed that maintenance work should be done by the local councils.  The Act makes that provision and I hope it will remain that way.  When a certain amount has been spent on drainage, the least the local people should do is to keep it in repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked what it would cost as <Col N="1437" /> regards the Brosna.  This coming year it will cost £21,000 which will be paid as follows: Leix will have to contribute £822 10s. 2d.; Offaly, £14,696 17s. 6d. and Westmeath, £5,480 12s. 4d., making a total of £21,000.  I was also asked what it would mean in regard to the charge on the rates.  It will cost Leix ¾d. in the £; Offaly, 1/1 in the £ and Westmeath roughly 4d. in the £.</P>

I am glad to inform the House that within the past 24 hours I got consent from the Minister for Finance in regard to an increase of pay for drainage workers throughout this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often I am held up here by questions put down in connection with what the pay should be. I agree that the work involved is very hard work.  I also agree that the workers in question are good, loyal workers.  I am asked why not pay the county council rate of pay and things of that kind.  We cannot do that because, as I explained several times&mdash;I am sure my predecessor agrees&mdash;drainage schemes may embrace two or three different counties where the standards are all different.  Therefore, one cannot go by that.  From this day forward, I hope that it will be some time before we will hear anything about an increase in pay as regards drainage workers because that increase is being given now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very grateful to each and every one of the 22 Deputies who spoke. Obviously, I could not cover all the points that were raised.  Deputies Beegan and Glynn referred to the Killimor river.  I think quite an amount of work was done there under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I fully realise the importance of this matter.  That is not because it is in Galway.  I shall go into the matter during the coming week and communicate with both Deputies about the <Col N="1438" /> position.  I made inquiries before and thought that a case could be made whereby we would get back a certain amount of valuable land in that area. It is a minor scheme and I do not think the cost would be very much.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Beegan say that we should have three or four major schemes and three or four minor schemes going together.  I agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">

      <P>We may be slow at the moment with regard to arterial drainage but we are only growing up in this matter, so to speak.  It is only a few years since it started.  From day to day, a certain amount of money is expended on extra engineers and surveying. We hope to speed that up and get along faster with the work in time.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Board of Works, I wish to thank the Deputies who spoke so nicely about the work we are doing. I happened to have a run round Leix-Offaly within the past week or ten days.  I am sure the House will be surprised to hear that, where some years ago I saw four feet of water, shops and houses are being built at the present time.  The work that is being done is splendid.  Possibly, some may say, it is too good.  I had occasion to visit Kerry and I saw there the great work going on on the Feale. Great work is also in progress in Galway. There is a big delay in the surveying and planning of arterial drainage schemes.  Since they are highly skilled jobs, the work has to be prepared.  The day of building a house without a plan is gone and the day of the arterial drainage scheme without a plan is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think our workers, engineers and staff are doing great work.  The only regret is that we are not doing it fast enough.  I am no more satisfied in that respect than is Deputy Ó Briain. I hope we will be able to do it faster every day.  I compliment every one of the 22 Deputies who spoke on this Estimate.  The points they raised will be looked into and, in regard to any <Col N="1439" /> points I have not answered, I shall communicate with the Deputies from the office.</P>

    <P>At the peak period of employment last year, in December, 1955, employment was given to a total of 6,015 men, of whom 710 were employed on urban schemes and 5,305 on rural schemes.</P>
    <P>There has been a further drop in the number of unemployment assistance recipients this year.  According to the census taken by the Special Employment Schemes Office, the number of male unemployment assistance recipients in the whole country was 29,953 in January, 1956, compared with 33,576 in January, 1955, and 39,989 in January, 1954.  This is a reduction of about 11 per cent. and follows a reduction of 16 per cent. in 1955 compared with 1954.  The reduction was greatest in the urban areas, being approximately 17 per cent. compared with 1955, following a drop of 22 per cent. in 1955 compared with 1954.  The figures for urban areas are 7,698 in January, 1956, compared with 9,316 in January, 1955, and 11,936 in January, 1954.  For rural areas, including towns with a population of 200 and over, the figures were <Col N="1441" /> 22,255 in January, 1956, compared with 24,260 in January, 1955, and 28,053 in January, 1954.  This is a reduction of 8½ per cent. compared with 1955 and follows a reduction of 13.5 per cent. in 1955 compared with 1954.  The total number of men in receipt of unemployment assistance for the week ended the 7th April, 1956, was 25,325 compared with 27,310 for the corresponding week in 1955 and 32,429 in 1954.</P>
    <P>Taking first the administrative sub-heads of the Vote, A to E: the increase of £6,105 in the salaries sub-head compared with 1955-56 represents mainly the cost of increases in Civil Service pay granted with the approval of the Dáil, with effect as from the 1st November, 1955.  It includes, also, the normal increments which accrue as years go by, as well as increased salary scales for engineering inspectors.  A number of these officers were formerly employed on a very temporary basis. In the last 12 months, they have been appointed as unestablished officers on increased scales.  The annual increments for the staff and the increase in the salaries of the inspectorate establishment amounted to approximately £2,400.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (Urban Employment Schemes) is intended to finance employment schemes in the four county borough areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the borough of Dún Laoghaire, and such of the 55 other urban districts in which there are sufficient numbers of unemployment assistance recipients to form gangs of economic size.  These schemes are administered by the local authorities concerned, through the Department of Local Government, and grants are made conditional on the local authorities submitting suitable works schemes for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office, and making a contribution towards their cost.  The contribution in the Dublin County Borough area is 20 per cent.  In the other county boroughs it averages about 17 per cent., and varies between 5 per cent. and 17 per cent. in the other urban areas, the average last year being about 14 per cent.  There is a substantial volume of work already authorised for execution, and the commitments for works not yet carried out <Col N="1442" /> in urban areas amount to £264,000.  The provision in the Vote for this service (£140,000) is the same as last year, and there is also available an unexpended balance of about £200,000 from previous years' National Development Fund grants.</P>
    <P>In Dublin a sum of £175,000 was allocated for grants for new works last year.  Schemes to absorb £163,397 were approved and the balance, £11,603, was provisionally earmarked to meet the cost of additional work proposed on the road through the Memorial Park, Islandbridge.  The total cost of the schemes approved amounted to £204,248, which include road works costing £83,622 and amenity schemes, such as parks and playgrounds, costing £120,626 of which approximately £52,000 is for the construction of a promenade, etc., at Howth Harbour. These figures represent the gross cost of the schemes and include the contribution from the Dublin Corporation. Some of these works have not yet started and on the 1st April, 1956, there was a carry-forward of uncompleted schemes representing approximately £200,000, in State grants.  The average number of men employed during the financial year ended 31st March, 1956, was 240, of whom 175 were unemployment assistance recipients. Each man gets 12 weeks' employment and, as the gangs rotate every three months, approximately 700 unemployment assistance recipients got a spell of employment in the year.  The number of unemployment assistance recipients in the Dublin County Borough area fell from 4,964 in January, 1955, to 3,937 in January, 1956, and the figure on the 14th April, 1956, was about the same, being 3,989.</P>
    <P>Employment schemes in rural areas under sub-heads G and H form a joint programme of works.  Sub-head G grants are for works on county roads, towards which the county councils concerned contribute one-quarter of the cost.  Minor employment schemes, sub-head H, are for works on accommodation and bog roads.  These two schemes operate only in rural areas, in which there are substantial numbers of unemployment assistance recipients and are carried out in the winter period, November to March.  The provision in <Col N="1443" /> the Vote for both sub-heads is the same as last year.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head I, bog development schemes, is for the repair and reconstruction of roads and drains to facilitate the production of hand-won turf by landholders, and other persons, for their domestic needs or for sale in neighbouring towns.  These are ordinarily full-cost grants and contributions are required only in the case of privately owned bogs, which are let annually to a substantial number of tenants and where the owner's income from such lettings is so high that it is only reasonable to expect him to give some assistance towards providing reasonable road and drainage facilities for his tenants.  The cost of this service continues to be high.  The expenditure in 1953-54 was £132,000 and it was £150,700 in 1954-55.  One thousand and seventy-three new schemes, costing £150,000, were authorised last year. The actual expenditure in 1955-56 was £167,000, more than 25 per cent. in excess of 1953-54.</P>
    <P>The rural improvements scheme (sub-head J) makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers, such as small drainage schemes, bridges, and the construction or repair of accommodation roads to farmhouses, lands or bogs.  It is a contributory scheme and applies to all parts of the country, irrespective of the unemployment position.  State grants varying from 75 per cent. of the cost in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of £18 and over to 95 per cent. in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of below £6 are available, subject to the balance of the cost being met by the benefiting landholders. Where the work is of substantial benefit to the general &ldquo;outside&rdquo; public, in addition to the farmers directly concerned, the percentage of State grant, where circumstances warrant it, can be increased.</P>
    <P>The Vote provision for the rural improvements scheme is the same as last year at £197,000.  The gross provision, including National Development Fund grant, in 1955-56 was £264,000 and 931 new schemes, costing <Col N="1444" /> £263,986 were authorised for execution. The cost of this service has increased considerably in recent years.  Including local contributions, the expenditure in 1951-52 was £173,210.  It went up in 1952-53 to £218,278, to £233,662 in 1953-54 and to £222,600 in 1954-55.  Last year, the expenditure reached the record figure of £288,000.  These figures, as stated, are gross figures and include local contributions by farmers averaging from 11 per cent. to 12 per cent., which are credited to the Vote as Appropriations-in-Aid through sub-head L.  Notwithstanding the expenditure of £288,000 last year, there is a carry-forward, as on the 1st April, 1956, of uncompleted schemes sanctioned before that date, amounting to £81,600.  In addition, contributions had been lodged with the Special Employment Schemes Office before the 1st April, 1956, representing a further expenditure of £52,800, so that we are starting this financial year with a commitment of £134,400.  Apart from the Vote provision of £197,000, there is an unspent balance of £38,740 available from previous years' National Development Fund grants to partly meet this commitment.</P>
    <P>The provision for miscellaneous schemes (sub-head K) is the same as last year.  It is mainly to meet expenditure on minor marine works, such as the extension and reconstruction of small piers and slips to facilitate the fishing industry and for the landing of seaweed and sand in the interests of local farmers.  The county councils concerned are required to contribute one-quarter of the cost of these marine works and to maintain them on completion. The sub-head also finances archaeological excavations at Tara, Lough Gur, Lough Gara, and other centres.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid (sub-head L) realised approximately £38,000 last year.  The sub-head is made up almost entirely of the contributions in respect of the rural improvements scheme, which amounted to £34,000.  It also includes receipts in respect of bog development schemes, county council contributions towards the cost of minor marine works, and receipts from the sale of surplus stores.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> The gross Vote provision in the current year, as can be seen in the statement at page 51 of the Estimates Volume, is £731,200.  The amount brought forward as unexpended National Development Fund grant from previous years is £248,400 so that there is a total of £979,600 available. Decisions have not yet been taken as regards the possibility of the money so available being supplemented from the National Development Fund, or any other source, and the Estimate is being put forward, therefore, for approval on the basis of the provisions herein stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would need to be pretty quick with the pencil to follow the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation of the expenditures under the various schemes.  I take it that the estimates under the various sub-heads are the same.  Vote 10 is of great interest to me and, I am sure, to most rural Deputies.  While Votes 8 and 9 cover a considerable number of major activities, this Vote covers what may be termed minor activities, but which are not by any means minor in their importance to the people in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The figures in the Book of Estimates and mentioned also by the Parliamentary Secretary are the same as last year.  There has been, the Parliamentary Secretary says, a considerable increase over the years.  I know that is true, but, if there is a considerable increase in the amount of money made available and expended, that does not mean that there is an increase in the volume of work carried out, because wages have risen very considerably in the past five or six years and, therefore, the same amount of work cannot be carried out with the same amount of money.</P>
      <P>I know very well the difficulty the Parliamentary Secretary has in extracting even the amount of money that is provided for these schemes from the Department of Finance, but I should like to see the amounts increased under every sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us a memorandum in regard to this Vote, <Col N="1446" /> as he did in respect of the Office of Public Works, to show the amount estimated each year, the amount expended under the various headings, the amount received from the National Development Fund and the way in which the money was expended under the various headings.</P>
    <P>I know that in one year we got £500,000 from the National Development Fund to be apportioned and expended by the directors and officers in charge of special employment.  I am told that there is a carry-over of £200,000 over the various years, but there is no indication that, in addition to that £200,000, there will be £300,000 made available for expenditure in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given us the figures showing the reduction in the number unemployed in urban and rural areas.  There is very useful work to be done.  In fact, it is not so much a question of creating employment as of carrying out useful work.  I refer, in particular, to development work on bogs and rural improvement schemes.  Considerably more money could be expended.  I know that a great deal of very good work has been done.  I am very interested in both schemes.  In a great many places, there is a crying need for the improvement of bogs, drainage and road repairs.</P>
    <P>There could not be any better form of national development than the repair of roads into bogs and bog drainage, because of the importance of the bogs in the West of Ireland, and those places where people depend on the bogs for their domestic fuel and because of the relation of this work to agriculture.  It is certainly related very closely to agriculture.  Where there is not good drainage of bogs and where there are bad roads into bogs, the people very often have to neglect their crops at the most important time of the year, in order to try to get their winter's supply of fuel.  Otherwise, they would never get their fuel at all. It is a very great comfort to the people, where this work has been carried out, to know that they can leave their turf in the bog, attend to their crops and that, if necessary, they <Col N="1447" /> can go on Christmas Eve and bring home a load of turf without any trouble.  For that reason, I think the sub-head dealing with the development of bogs is one of the most important sub-heads of the lot.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary in addition to the £100,000 estimated under this sub-head, to call upon the National Development Fund for more money, so that the amount would be increased considerably.  I know he has done so in the past. Nevertheless, it will be no harm&mdash;in view of what I have stated to the effect that the same amount of work cannot now be done for the same amount of money, in view of increased wages&mdash;for the Parliamentary Secretary to dip his finger a bit more in order to produce whatever additional money will be needed from the National Development Fund, particularly from that £200,000 of a carry-over. I should like to see 50 per cent. of that pushed in with the £100,000 for the carrying out of this work.</P>
    <P>Another important sub-head is the rural improvement scheme.  Very valuable work has been done, and our people have been placed almost in a second heaven in many parts of the country, as a result of work carried out under that scheme.  We have to-day roads where the people can bring in lorries and cars to their homes and over which those of them who have to walk can go on Sundays with clean boots.  In the old days, they had to walk over the fields, stepping from one patch of high ground to the other. This is a welcome change, although there is a great lot to be done yet.</P>
    <P>In recent years, an Act was passed empowering county councils to take over the maintenance of culs-de-sac. While the spending of money under the rural improvement scheme has done very useful work, at the same time, there is a considerable amount of wastage, if the roads are not maintained. In some cases, it is very difficult to get the people concerned to maintain them, because, after all, they are fairly big jobs and the distances are fairly lengthy.  Accordingly, it is not so easy to get the people to come <Col N="1448" /> together and to carry out the maintenance work.</P>
    <P>County councils are very slow to take over any further mileage of road and they certainly will not take over roads which are in bad repair.  The best chance that county councils will take over roads is that work on the roads, in the first instance, is carried out under the rural improvement scheme and that the roads are brought up to a certain standard of repair.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter which has been mentioned freely all over the country and which is being pressed forward by the people concerned.  Where there is a pretty big job of work to be carried out as a rural improvement scheme, the suggestion is that county councils should be permitted to contribute portion of the local contribution.  Perhaps it might be difficult to fit that in; perhaps it might need fresh legislation on the part of both the Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary.  I believe it would serve a useful purpose, but there again there might be a difficulty, because it would be a matter for the county councils whether or not they should pay any portion of the local contribution.  It would be a nice thing, if it were put to the test.  Then the people concerned could not blame the Board of Works or the Special Employment Office.</P>
    <P>This question of increase in wages has, in my opinion, diminished the amount of work being done.  That is something that has always to be borne in mind.  I do not criticise those increases in wages; I feel sure they are justified.  They are paid to county council workers and to agricultural workers, and I think they are equally justified as far as the workers under the Minor Employment Schemes Office are concerned.  Work has been carried out under that office which, in my opinion, stands on its own in comparison with any work of a similar nature carried out by county councils or the Land Commission.  I was very glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary state that a number of inspectors had their salaries increased, but they are still unestablished apparently.  That is having a very bad effect.  A number <Col N="1449" /> of them have been established in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be no harm to leave a number of them as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are inefficient, there is a way of dealing with them. I have not met any inefficiency in that section, and if they are efficient and discharging their duties properly, there is no great encouragement for them to remain on, when they can get good jobs elsewhere.  That is making it very difficult for the Minor Employment Schemes Office to accelerate and expedite the work.  They find very often that some of the best men they have leave them, because they are not established.  Their case has been brought forward often enough, and, if they get good jobs elsewhere, they cannot be blamed for taking them.  As I have said, that is retarding this whole business.</P>
      <P>Local authority gangers at the moment have a superannuation scheme. There is no superannuation scheme for supervisor gangers or gangers under the Minor Employment Schemes Office. I think these men should be placed in the same position as local authority employees.  It is true that when the county council employees get increases the Minor Employment Schemes Office come along and increase the wages of their men at the same time.  There is, however, the difference that the Minor Employment Schemes Office have no superannuation scheme although I think their men are entitled to it.  This is not peculiar to the Employment Schemes Office.  The same is true, I think, in the Land Commission.  It is something that should be taken into consideration.  When people give good, efficient and loyal service to the office and to the Department and to the people over a period of years, it is very gloomy for them to have to retire on the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all this period of time, they have no great incentive to be very careful with the work, or to be as careful as they would otherwise be.  It will not attract men of the calibre we would like to see, because, as I said, the work being carried out is as good as the <Col N="1450" /> work carried out by the county councils or the Land Commission, and men employed by the Special Employment Schemes Office and on other works of this kind are entitled to superannuation rights and establishment, if possible.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say on this Vote, other than to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary once again the necessity of putting his hand fairly deeply into the National Development Fund as far as two particular schemes are concerned, the rural improvements scheme and the bog development scheme.  I know I need not tell him about them, but it is no harm to give him a word of encouragement when he is approaching a Department it is difficult to move where some very important schemes are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this Estimate is really one of the most important from the point of view of the people who are concerned with it.  The works carried out under minor relief schemes and rural improvement schemes are regarded as very important, especially along the western seaboard and in my own constituency of South Kerry.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first of all with minor relief schemes.  I think that as far as possible, money is devoted in accordance with the number of unemployed in an electoral district.  Sometimes, there may be eight or nine men unemployed in a district, and, in a neighbouring district, there may be a similar number, or something like that, but I understand that so far as the Special Employment Schemes Office is concerned, there must be a certain number&mdash;I think 12 or 15&mdash;in order to get the benefits of that scheme.  I wonder if the regulations could be varied so as to allow two neighbouring electoral areas to be combined, so that works could be carried out that would be necessary not only for the improvement of the roads and land, but also in order to give employment.  Furthermore, it is also very necessary, as far as possible, to have the work carried out before Christmas, so that the unemployed would have some benefit for the festive season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money expended on these minor <Col N="1451" /> relief schemes is always regarded as money that is to a great extent wasted. I am not so sure about that myself, but it is somehow regarded as money simply given to the unemployed for doing what they like and for doing as little as they can.  I think a great deal depends on the type of gangers in charge of the work and, of course, as the Special Employment Schemes Office knows, we have grievances for many years in connection with these gangers, because it is only those of certain political affiliations who will be appointed.  I think the time has come when the rules and regulations should be so changed that new gangers would get a chance of gaining experience.  We know there are many complaints about that.  We are told that gangers who had experience in bog work, or schemes of that kind back for the past 20 years are the only ones who can be employed, and it is often the case that, when money is allocated for the improvement of accommodation roads or minor relief schemes, because of objections by certain people to the gangers employed, the money is actually withdrawn.</P>
    <P>It also happens occasionally that, even though money has been allocated for the improvement of roads or for drainage, that money is withdrawn when somebody through whose land the road or drain will pass, objects.  I think something should be done to ensure that, once money is allocated for a certain scheme, any objection by some crank along that road or drain should not prevent the work from being carried out.  I do not know exactly what power the board would have in connection with that, but I do know that the difficulty frequently arises.</P>
    <P>The same thing happens in the case of the rural improvement schemes.  In my own constituency, I know that, because of the objection of some peculiar individual, the work cannot be carried out even though the money has been allocated, and I should like to say that this rural improvement scheme is one of the best schemes produced by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  It is a great pity that, when roads are being improved, or when <Col N="1452" /> drainage schemes are being carried out, something is not done to persuade the people who benefit by those schemes to effect some little repair on that road or drain each year or, perhaps, on that stream or river.  In fact, I am hopeful the time will come when we will have all our main and county roads steam-rolled and then perhaps it will be possible to have these roads that have been improved by minor employment schemes taken over by the local authority and dealt with as we at present deal with the county roads, because it is absolutely essential that people living in remote areas or townlands should have roads as good as possible leading to their homes.</P>
    <P>In Kerry, we have so many roads yet to steamroll and put into proper condition of repair that it is not easy for us to take responsibility for roads leading into various townlands and various pockets in mountainous areas, but I am hopeful that, not only in Kerry, but throughout the country as a whole, the time will come when all our main and county roads will be steamrolled, and that we can then take over all these roads which we at present call accommodation roads, so that all our people, no matter where they live, be it in a remote area or otherwise, will have the benefit of good roads into their homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to refer to some of the things that have been said by previous speakers, and particularly to matters mentioned by the speaker who has just sat down.  In my own county, which is somewhat similar to that of Deputy Palmer, we have an unusually large road mileage that must be maintained by the council at the moment, and we have an even larger mileage of road which it is not the duty of the council to maintain, nor would it be in their power to maintain that mileage on the moneys they are now getting for road purposes.</P>

      <P>(a) To base October, 1938=100 the index of earnings per week in industries producing transportable goods averaged 266.4 for the four quarters of 1955, being 282.8 for the fourth quarter.  The corresponding information for the first quarter of 1956 is not yet available.</P>

      <P>(b) Taking as 100 the August, 1938, index in the series of cost-of-living index numbers to base July 1914=100 and linking this series at August 1947 to the consumer price index number series, the average of the four quarterly indices for 1955 was 236.  The corresponding figure for mid-November 1955 was 242 and for mid-February 1956 was 243.</P>

    <Col N="1457" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to corroborate previous speakers in regard to the heavy burden that must be carried by local county councils and local authorities in regard to roads, and to point out that, in addition to all the roads now being carried in the county programme, there are many counties, such as my own and along the western seaboard generally, with a very large mileage of roads which the county council do not maintain or repair and for which they have not got any funds to do anything about them. We find that, in times gone by, the only possible hope for these roads was through this fund before us here to-day.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that, in looking at the financial provisions for the coming year under this Vote, we find that the overall financial position for the coming financial year shows a net increase of £6,000 odd.  When you consider that net increase of £6,000 on the total sum of £700,000, it can be seen that that increase is not going to make any impression because of the higher cost of doing the work in the coming year as against last year.  When we look further, we realise that this little increase of £6,000 is really not an actual increase as far as getting work done is concerned, but, in fact, is an increase in salaries, wages, incidental expenses, telephone charges and telegram charges.  We then see that, in fact, during the coming financial year we will have exactly the same amount of money with which to do all the work we want to do throughout the country and that that money in the year to come will actually get less work done, due to increased costs, than the same amount did last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can see for ourselves that our position in regard to these roads done under rural improvement, minor employment and bog development schemes, is that the money available for the coming 12 months will, in fact, do much less work than the amount of work we got done under this heading last year.  I feel that that is a retrograde step and that it is neglecting <Col N="1458" /> something which is a vital link for the people of rural Ireland who have not got the services of county roads and who do not get any money from the county council to look after these roads serving their homes in the more remote districts of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what he has allowed himself to be pushed into in this case and to consider that he has the backing of the members on this side of the House, and quite a number on his own side of the House if, even at this late stage, he looks for further money for this office in order to do the rural improvement and minor employment schemes about which we are concerned. He has the backing of the vast majority of the members of this House in getting money for that very desirable job of work which is being carried on over the years and which we want to see carried on at a greater pace in the year to come rather than at last year's pace.</P>
    <P>I should also like to follow up what Deputy Beegan has said in regard to rural improvement schemes.  Surely something further could be done in regard to these schemes?  We have at the moment many roads which serve large numbers of people.  These roads are not a charge on the county council, but the council may, because of their nature, improve them; and in many cases, whether they have the money or not, they must take over the roads, do them and maintain them.  If we try to get a rural improvement grant for such roads, we are up against a certain difficulty. There may possibly be 40 people living on a road and, in addition, the road may be used by the public generally for other purposes.  In that case, we find it almost impossible to get the local contribution that is asked for.  In some cases, even if the grant is available, we find it impossible to get an unknown number of people, perhaps, to contribute their share to the local contribution in order to qualify for the grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan said that he felt, as I do and as many others do, that, in such cases as that, where the local authority believes that the doing of such a road would be of benefit to the public generally, and where it is <Col N="1459" /> difficult to get the local contribution, then, if the council so thinks fit, they should be empowered either to pay part of the local contribution, or all of it, if they think it is of outstanding importance that the road should be done.  I know quite a few such jobs which fell through because of certain difficulties.</P>
    <P>I think it is a pity that should happen, but, human nature being what it is, it is really impossible in a large number of cases to get each person concerned to put down the money in equal amounts for a job which may benefit one slightly more than another. The usual comment by one or two of the people concerned will be: &ldquo;It will not do me much good.  I did without it up to this and I can do without it now.&rdquo;  Very often, one will find that the real reason for this lack of co-operation is that the person who does not want to co-operate has that idea and feels that somebody else who lives further down, and whom he does not particularly like, will benefit more than he will.</P>
    <P>That situation should not be allowed to continue and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary as has been suggested to him before, that the regulation should be changed, so that the local authority may, if they think fit, contribute the local contribution for any of these necessary works, such as the improvement of cul-de-sac roads serving quite a few of the public.  In addition to that, I suggest that these roads, having been contributed to in part by the local authority, should then be handed over to the local authority, from the point of view of their repair and maintenance in the future.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Palmer, who put up the case that in his county&mdash; and this happens in other counties, too&mdash;they have more roads than they can look after from a financial point of view, I suggest that not only should the council be empowered to take them over after they have been done under a rural improvement scheme, but there should, at the same time, be a commensurate increase in their maintenance road grants from the appropriate Department, namely, Local Government, <Col N="1460" /> to cover the maintenance of any such roads they may take over in any particular year.</P>
    <P>That is not a new departure.  It is not a new suggestion.  It is an accepted article of policy, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, and it was published as such by us during the last local government elections. We make a present of that item of our policy to the present Minister, the present Parliamentary Secretary and his Government.  We would suggest that, despite the fact that it is a Fianna Fáil sponsored suggestion and a Fianna Fáil item of policy, that will not make it any the less useful to the people generally, should the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary think it worth their while to incorporate it in their policy.  As far as we are concerned, we will give him all the support he requires to get these provisions through, in order to give the people in the more remote rural areas a service they do not now enjoy and cannot enjoy under our present system of road maintenance and repair.</P>
    <P>In relation to minor employment and bog schemes, again all I can say is that the amount shown in the Book of Estimates is exactly similar to the amount provided last year.  That being so, we shall have a lesser mileage of bog road schemes and fewer minor improvement schemes in the current 12 months since the amount of money will not go as far, because of increased costs.  I know, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows, since he, too, comes from the West, that apart from there not being enough money last year, there will be much too little this year.  We should get much more money now for these jobs than we have been getting in the past. We want more bog roads done and we want more minor employment schemes throughout the whole western region, right down from Donegal to Kerry.  We will not have that extra work in the present financial year, since the provision is identical with that of last year.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has a very strong case now to go back to his colleagues&mdash;I am sure many of them hold the same views as I am <Col N="1461" /> expressing here&mdash;and tell them that the money is not sufficient in the current financial year.  Any addition that is made will not only be advantageous in the making and repairing of bog roads and carrying out minor schemes of drainage, but will, at the same time, provide in the poorer districts and in the congested areas that much-needed employment during the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>I come from a county in which we have a good deal of unemployment. The other afternoon I happened to be where the unemployed were signing on for unemployment assistance.  In a small parish in the North of Donegal, I found no less than 300 able-bodied young men signing for unemployment assistance in the month of May, 1956. There are no schemes in operation in that parish at the moment, despite the fact that many of the people who were signing on for unemployment assistance live in the most backward and out of the way places, with no proper access to their homes.</P>
    <P>Surely cognisance should be taken of as many as 300 able-bodied young men signing on for unemployment assistance in a small parish in rural Ireland.  That position could be  a good deal, if more money was provided under this Estimate.  Apparently nothing is taken into consideration, so far as these people are concerned.  What I saw happening represents the 300 that have remained.  At least another 600 born in the same parish are to-day over in England and Scotland and Wales. Some of them may come back.  Most of them will not come back, and the danger is that most of the 300 left behind signing on for unemployment assistance will go, too, if they see no hope held out to them at home.</P>
    <P>Much could be done under this Vote and the Parliamentary Secretary could do a good deal for these people.  I have only instanced that parish.  The same story can be told of every other parish down the western coastline from Donegal to Kerry.  The same, or relative, figures could be quoted.  Yet, instead of extra provision being made to cater for that situation, we find exactly the same provision being made as was made last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> I have already pointed out that that money will not go so far.  It will not provide as much work.  Indeed, it will give less work to a lesser number of people for a shorter space of time. Surely such a retrograde step is bound to have repercussions.  I understand that, in order to induce people to avail of rural improvement schemes, towards which a contribution ranging from 5 per cent. to 25 per cent. of the cost is usually asked from the beneficiaries, the people contributing get preference so far as work on such schemes is concerned. I think that is a very good idea for two reasons: one is that it induces the people to put up the local contribution and co-operate with other members of the community in the district; secondly, the biggest inducement of all is that the beneficiaries and the contributors are assured of work on the job, and, apart from the amount they may earn, they are assured, when they are actually engaged on the job, that the job will be done properly.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether or not that is the case at the moment, and whether we can take it that, in future, when we are asking people to come together and trying to encourage them to contribute to their own rural improvement scheme, they will have the satisfaction of knowing that they will be given work on that scheme and be able to work on the scheme, so that they can see that the work is done properly and that full value is being got for the money expended.</P>
    <P>To many people, that might not seem very important, but, to my mind, it is an important matter.  I have encouraged people to go in for rural employment applications rather than minor employment schemes.  I find that it is an encouragement to them to know that they can get work, if they contribute to these schemes.  That fact would be the greatest asset in getting their co-operation and would have a much greater effect in that way than anything else I know of.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this question and deal with the matter in that way.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is much more that I have to add on this matter, except to say that we on this side of <Col N="1463" /> the House are very anxious about the people of rural Ireland and to see that more money is allocated to ensure that necessary work can be done to lighten the hardships and make easier the lives of the people of rural Ireland, so that they will be encouraged to stay there and not emigrate, as so many of their families have done before.  We will give the Parliamentary Secretary every co-operation and support in any efforts he may make to secure more money for this necessary work of rural improvement, minor development, and bog development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this Vote as important so far as many areas of this country are concerned, and particularly the more remote and isolated districts.  I have indeed been very disappointed by the amount which is being made available.  I think it should be much greater.  A sum of £700,000 for the work which has to be carried out under this Vote is far too inadequate, having regard to the general value that accrues to the beneficiaries of the schemes and the different developments.  Undoubtedly, it is hard to over-estimate the importance of this work, so far as these rural districts are concerned.  Roads that were previously impassable have, as a result of the grants given from this Vote, been made quite passable, and people living along these roadways have now the advantage that they can bring lorries and farming machinery and equipment right up to their out-offices. Previously, they had not these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say I am not too satisfied with the manner in which some of these schemes are carried out.  I support wholeheartedly the case made by Deputy Blaney with regard to the contributors getting a preference for work on the rural improvement schemes.  I definitely understood that the beneficiaries would get preferential treatment in the matter of employment and Deputy Blaney has, I think, expressed fully the advantages which would come from such an arrangement. If the people contributing to the cost of the work were given employment on the schemes, it would <Col N="1464" /> not only give them an opportunity of recovering their contribution, but it would be an assurance that the work done would be of the very highest standard.  We have great difficulties in my constituency, so far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has informed me that contributors are entitled to preferential treatment in the matter of employment, but his officers in West Cork are not implementing that.  Over the past year, and even in recent months, contributors to these works have been refused work on the schemes, and I am surprised to find that the Parliamentary Secretary has one point of view in that regard and that his officers have another.  It is about time we had that position clarified.  Indeed, because contributors did not get work on particular schemes, those schemes had been abandoned in the West Cork area, and I blame the Parliamentary Secretary's office for that position.  When people make contributions, the least they are entitled to is that they themselves will get work on these roads, so that they can recoup themselves for the money they have put up by way of contribution. That is one matter about which I am not satisfied and it is one which has caused a great deal of dissatisfaction in West Cork.  If the Parliamentary Secretary makes inquiries, he will quickly become aware of the number of schemes which have been abandoned because the contributors were not given work on them.</P>
    <P>We were told by the office of the Parliamentary Secretary that work was made available to those on the employment exchange register and that the man in receipt of the highest amount of unemployment assistance should get first preference, when work is available. That seemed a very reasonable attitude, but when I went into West Cork, I found on an island scheme which was a minor employment scheme that the man with the lesser amount of unemployment benefit was working there, while two men in receipt of higher benefits were getting no employment whatever.  I called to the exchange to make sure that my facts were correct, and, when I found they <Col N="1465" /> were, I asked why that man should get work in preference to the other two. I was told that the matter would be investigated and later I was informed that the reason this man was taken on was that he has some special knowledge of the work.</P>
    <P>I know all these people concerned and I know that the man who got the job had no special knowledge whatever, and the only special thing he had was &ldquo;pull&rdquo;.  That &ldquo;pull&rdquo; obtains in West Cork in the matter of getting employment from this office.  We cannot have it both ways.  This is State employment given by State moneys and we should see to it that the money is expended on the people who need it.  The Parliamentary Secretary should see to it that the money provided under this Vote is used impartially and fairly.  I have had reason to complain on this Vote in past years.  Some of the allegations which I made were found to be proved and well-founded when they were specially investigated.</P>

      <P>In dealing with rural improvements schemes we find a tendency on the part of the Department's officer who reports on these schemes to reject a number of schemes put up to the Special Employment Schemes Office.  A number of these applications have been rejected, usually on the ground that the work benefits only one family and that its utility would not be commensurate with the cost of carrying it out.  That excuse has been given regarding so many of these schemes that I have taken steps to investigate a number of them myself where the reply came from the Parliamentary Secretary's office that only one family would benefit and, in cases where more than one family would benefit, that the general utility of the work would not be commensurate with the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think these reports are false, are not based on facts, and are not carrying out the terms of the Act.  According to the leaflet which is sent out with the application form, any scheme which benefits two or more farmers is entitled to consideration.  If the cost is within reason, there is an obligation on the State under existing legislation to carry out the scheme.  Now, we have schemes benefiting three, four or more, down in West Cork that have been rejected. I have a bag full of them now, but it is very hard to get anything done about it.  However, it is a matter for consideration.  Where a number of schemes are rejected and where complaints are made by public representatives and by the people themselves, there should surely be some obligation on the Special Employment Schemes Office to send down some investigator to ascertain whether or not the reasons for disallowing these schemes are justified.  I ask the Parliamentary <Col N="1467" /> Secretary to do that.  It is a reasonable request.</P>

      <P>Where schemes are rejected on one ground or another and where it is contended there are no good grounds for the objections, I should be glad if some superior officer were sent down to see the position for himself and to decide whether the junior officer's report is in accordance with the facts.</P>
      <P>For some years past, a large number of people have been unemployed in the Berehaven Peninsula in West Cork.  A number of schemes which were submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary's office for consideration as minor employment schemes are not being dealt with under that heading.  They have, however, been dealt with on a contributory basis under the heading of rural improvement schemes.  I thought the position was that where in an electoral division there was a sufficient number of unemployed men to warrant the implementation of the scheme by the Special Employment Schemes Office the cost would be borne by the State and no contributions would be asked from the local people.  That is not the case here.  The vast majority of the schemes from these areas&mdash;schemes which I thought would come under the heading of minor employment schemes &mdash;are transferred over as rural improvements schemes.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify that point for me when he is replying because I do not quite follow the reasons for such action and neither do the people who make the applications understand how it is that they cannot qualify for full cost grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of agitation on the part of beneficiaries when they contribute towards a scheme, and when the work is carried out reasonably well, to have it maintained.  Of course, that is not part of the business of the Parliamentary Secretary's office but there are many public representatives on county councils and other bodies who believe that a greater measure of co-operation might exist between the Special Employment Schemes Office <Col N="1468" /> and the local authorities throughout the country so that, when these schemes are carried out and a good deal of money has been expended on them, there would be some understanding between the Special Employment Schemes Office and the county council concerned with a view to the maintenance of the particular scheme. Unfortunately, particularly in so far as drainage works in nine or ten years' time are concerned, the position will be just as if the work had never been carried out by reason of the fact that no money for maintenance was available.</P>
    <P>I have raised on other occasions the matter of objections to particular schemes.  I do not know the reasons for objections in other counties but I have a fair knowledge of the reasons in my constituency of West Cork.  I regret very much to state that objections to the implementation of schemes by particular parties are in the main due to spite motives.  A scheme may perhaps benefit six or seven people. Unfortunately, maybe one of the six or seven persons is not too kindly disposed towards his neighbours.  If he has a small piece of land adjoining the stream or the roadway, as the case may be, he would be in a position to hold up the scheme indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I think&mdash;and it was envisaged under the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash; there is something in the present legislation governing these schemes to the effect that when a person objects to a scheme the onus and the obligation should be put on him or her to give his or her reasons for the objection. There are people whose fences adjoin the roadway and who would not be interfered with at all but, just because their land adjoins the roadway, they can hold up progress.  Some special legislation should be brought in to overcome these objectors.  If a man has a reasonable objection, well and good, but if the objection is not reasonable, and is made from spiteful motives, the work should be carried out, whether he likes it or not.  I am not advocating interfering with private property, but there is a substantial number of people throughout the country suffering from these objectors. A Deputy from Donegal has stated the <Col N="1469" /> position as far as his own county is concerned and the same applies to my constituency in West Cork.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House much longer, but I cannot speak too highly of these schemes.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the people in my area will get reasonable consideration and that schemes which were disallowed, and which it was claimed were disallowed wrongly, will be re-examined, not by the local officer but by an officer superior to him.  I would also suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should revert to the practice of giving contributors preference for work.  I think that is a definite step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>As far as employment on the ordinary schemes is concerned, and particularly the employment of gangers, the Parliamentary Secretary should take more care and be more cautious about who is employed and who is not employed.  My case is that they should be dealt with impartially.  They are all workers.  It is difficult for a Deputy, when a man comes along and brings it home to you that he has been discriminated against.  We have to take cognisance of such complaints and it is our duty and obligation to pass them on to the proper authority.  I have no doubt that the present Parliamentary Secretary will do his best to rectify these matters.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would appeal to him to try to get a little more money, if not this year, at least next year. The money allocated from 1st April, 1956, to 31st March, 1957, would not cover the number of schemes already submitted to the office.  I also think it is out of place that such a delay should take place between the date of application for a scheme and the date of implementation.  Usually, it is now about 20 months from the date of application to the date of implementation, but when these schemes started first, the delay was only about six months.  It is gradually growing longer. If a man applies for a rural improvement scheme in this month of May, he will be very lucky if the scheme is implemented by December, 1957.  I do not <Col N="1470" /> see any reason for such delays.  If sufficient money is not made available this year, I do not see why it could not be got for such useful work in future years.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to increase the allocation under this heading in the forthcoming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start off by saying that I agree with Deputy Murphy as regards rural improvement schemes.  We have the same situation in the West of Ireland, where a man who is ill disposed enough can block a whole scheme.  I think it is about time that some legislation was introduced to deal with that point.  Where a majority of the people living on a road are agreeable to have the road done, I do not think it fair that any one man should be allowed to hold it up.  I have had different experiences of that.  I have experience of a case in which everybody agreed and the money was collected, and this particular man was not even asked to contribute.  Yet, after the money was sent up to the office, he came along and blocked the road, and the money had to be sent back to the poor people who had to remain in the muck and dirt, because he took up this attitude.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the county councils should be allowed to contribute 25 per cent.  I have an open mind on that matter, but I think it is a very good idea to allow the people to do the work themselves.  In the old days, it was understood that one of the men who would benefit by the work should be allowed to be the ganger. When a man is working for himself, he will do a better job of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a whole lot of experience needed in making a bit of a road.  We all had to start, and I have seen men who had little experience taken and put in over the heads of men who were old road makers.  They had to put up with it. I think that a man who is using a road will have much more interest in that road than any outsider.  The making of a road does not take very long and there is always the engineer to come along and tell them what to do.  I would not say that a great deal of education is required.  I know that I never learned it at school, and I had to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I really want to make is with regard to the amount of money voted to this work.  Everybody knows that the cost of labour and materials has gone up considerably and still the amount of money voted for the work is reduced.  I have the utmost sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary.  I know he is not accountable or responsible for this.  If we have a Minister for Finance who wants to economise&mdash; and this applies to every Government &mdash;this is not the job to economise on. A sum of £100 to-day will not do as much work as £20 did five or six years ago, and, instead of giving more, you are giving less.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to insist on the Minister for Finance giving a fair amount for these works.  They are works that are very useful.  At the present time, the price of coal is £10 a ton, but bog roads are in a deplorable condition, and the Parliamentary Secretary can make a good case to the Minister for Finance, because the people desire those roads.  The day is gone when a man will go with a bag on his back into a bog to delve there and bring out turf.  If the money were spent on these roads, it would be money well spent and money usefully spent.  We hear a lot of talk about the flight from the land and about giving amenities to our people.  One way of doing something for the people is to improve the condition of the bog roads and the byroads, and, in employing money on such schemes, we are putting the money to the best possible use.  If we make the roads for the people, they will be enabled to cut their turf and <Col N="1472" /> have the turf, not only for their own use but for sale in the towns.</P>
    <P>The reason I rose to speak on the Estimate is that I believe the amount voted is too small.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has my sympathy.  I am sure he would be happier if he were handing out £1,000,000 more than he is handing out, but he wants the support of the people who are behind him to make the money available.  I believe he would have that support, especially from rural Deputies and those Deputies who go into bogs themselves.  It is up to them to see that, no matter what reductions are effected, they will not take place in this connection.  It is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to make a fight for a bigger sum of money.  I conclude by wishing the Parliamentary Secretary luck in the work he is carrying out, for, as well as being useful to the people, it will give employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>The general complaint heard from all sides of the House seems to be that we have not got enough money to put roads of the type this Vote covers in proper order. It is my view that we have not got enough money.  Any Government we had up to date failed to make sufficient money available to solve this problem, even in a small way.  Deputies from the rural areas seem to always be in the position of begging for the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table.  If Dublin City, Cork City or some other city in Ireland wants millions of pounds for some project or other, they have no difficulty in getting it, because the vast majority of the Deputies of this House come from the cities.  Then we hear of commissions being set up to inquire why people are leaving the land.  We hear of new Government Departments being set up. It is all nonsense to treat the people living in the rural areas in this way. In expressing that view, I seem to be repeating a lot of what has been said already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a deplorable state of affairs that the people who really count, the farming community, the producers of food and wealth, and the working people are treated in such a way.  Compare <Col N="1473" /> their lot with the people who work from 9 a.m. in the morning until 5 o'clock, with snacks and lunches in between.  They have television, water and so on.  They can get any amenities they want at any time.  Whenever the poor man wants anything, he is told that the money is not available, or that it cannot be got.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a member of my own Party, to get a little bit tougher in his office, to start throwing his weight about.  He should remind the Minister for Finance that it is his responsibility to make money available for important and urgent works of the kind I mention.  He should consider, in particular, the trials and difficulties of the farming community in endeavouring to get farm produce off their land, without having any facilities for doing so.</P>
    <P>Turf is used extensively in rural areas, and, to a certain degree, in the cities.  It proved to be an important national fuel during the period of the emergency.  That being so, the development of roads to bogs should be very favourably considered.  It is a much better proposition from the national point of view to make our fuel available to our own people than to send millions of pounds across the water for coal.  The position now seems to be that there is great difficulty about getting sufficient supplies of coal from Great Britain.  Be that as it may, while we have our own fuel, we should at least provide £500 or £1,000 in connection with bog roads.  That would be a far healthier investment from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>There are people in the rural areas drawing the dole.  These people would much prefer to work for three or four days a week for proper wages than to draw the dole and do no work of any kind.  We in Mayo have a very great mileage of roads of the kind I mentioned. We have also a lot of very fine scenery around Achill, Ballycroy, and in my own native district of Foxford.  The scenery in those areas is rugged, with lakes and rivers which appeal to all types of holiday makers. Unfortunately, tourists are discouraged from going to these areas on account <Col N="1474" /> of the neglect of the roads over a long number of years.  Again, that is very bad from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>Any time now we will hear a great sing-song about An Tóstal.  Flags will be waved and bands will be brought out and a great song and dance will be made about the importance of An Tóstal from the national point of view. The things tourists like to have when they come to a country are good roads. The roads are not good in our county. Evidently, from the speeches of the other Deputies, there is a similar plight in other counties.  We should have a more sensible approach to these problems and we should not try to deceive ourselves by endeavouring to deceive the people outside.  I think the sum of money provided is in the neighbourhood of £700,000, but, having regard to the increases in wages and other things, roads done under minor relief schemes will suffer.</P>
    <P>In connection with bog development, we should appreciate that to-day we have an entirely different type of traffic on the roads from what they carried 15, 25 or 30 years ago.  You see, even in the most remote parts of rural Ireland, four-ton and six-ton lorries every year hauling turf from the bogs.  A lot of turf was hauled out from the bogs and carried on these bog roads during the emergency. These heavy lorries did a tremendous amount of damage during that period. These roads were never intended for such heavy traffic and the Special Employment Schemes Office should now realise that they have to deal with an entirely different type of traffic to-day. Heavy lorries and tractors traverse these roads and the roads will have to be very well reinforced in order to carry this traffic.  Everybody who knows what a bog road is like, fully appreciates that the foundations are not always easy to make.  It should be the aim of the Employment Schemes Office to put in as good foundations as they possibly can.</P>
    <P>There is another point connected with the whole question of roads&mdash;the question of maintenance.  In my own native district of Foxford, I know some roads which have been repaired that should have been taken over by the <Col N="1475" /> Employment Schemes Office.  Deputies who represented that constituency beforce me submitted those proposals to the Department and I myself have submitted them. For some strange reason, nothing has been done about them.  I know of one village where people were expecting American visitors who left the country 40 years ago.  The poor bog road that was there 40 years ago is just as bad, if not worse, to-day. There is no rural electrification there, although it may come in a year or two. It is humiliating for these people to think that with a son or daughter returning home, that road is in a worse state of repair than when he or she left it 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>The method of selection in connection with minor relief works under full cost grant often struck me as rather strange.  I inquired how they were selected and I was told that there was a number of considerations, but that, in the main, selection was on the basis of the number of registered unemployed in the area.  Having regard to present-day conditions and to the fact that many of our young people who have emigrated to England are earning a lot of money, they will not return and I do not blame them.  The position in many areas is that there are not a large number of registered unemployed for the reason that they have gone from such areas.  Therefore, because the Special Employment Schemes Office takes cognisance of the number of registered unemployed in an area, these people get nothing at all, although they are really poor people with low valuations.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, perhaps even old age pensioners have not a road on which to go to Mass, or if a priest or a doctor goes on a sick call, there is no way to get into a house, except across the fields and through floods.  If these things were happening in Dublin, there would be a great hullabaloo, but when somebody speaks here about the rural areas, it does not appear in any newspaper. Not that I am worried about publicity, but it is one thing about which newspapers should cry out.  The Commission on Emigration, and so on, <Col N="1476" /> is so much humbug and nonsense, if attention is not given to the roads that urgently need repair throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have stated that, under rural improvement contributory schemes, the people who contribute should get preference.  I have some experience of that work and I agree with that point of view, that people who do contribute are, in the first instance, the patriotic type who are prepared to co-operate.  They are people who usually live on good terms with their neighbours and who are prepared to help out in anything that is good for the neighbourhood, or for the country generally.  In regard to people who are prepared to contribute to rural improvement contributory schemes, it is not asking a lot to give them work on such proposals.  This matter has been dealt with by other Deputies and I do not wish to repeat it, except to say that I agree with that point of view and I feel it is necessary for the Parliamentary Secretary or his Minister to change forthwith the regulations in regard to these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that the people who contribute are usually interested and they are the type of people who will see that the work is done properly.  They are entitled to some special consideration.  I realise it is the easiest thing in the world to criticise and that quite a lot of good work has been done by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  The regrettable thing is that so much remains to be done, and I hope that greater advances will be made which will have the effect of encouraging our people to stay at home, to get married and build their houses in rural Ireland. For that purpose, I believe an additional £1,000,000 over and above what is provided will have to be made available. People may laugh and ask themselves: &ldquo;Is this fellow daft? Where are we going to get the money?&rdquo;  As I have said already, it can be got for every purpose but for the people that count.</P>
    <P>Another solution I have to offer is that such roads should be done at a contract price.  An advertisement could be inserted in the newspaper in <Col N="1477" /> relation, say, to the road to &ldquo;Pat Murphy's&rdquo; house, certain specifications being submitted and the lowest tender being accepted, provided the person who tenders is competent to do the work.  I believe useful work could be done in that way, if we are prepared to take a bold stand in connection with these matters.  You might have a local man, a farmer with a couple of sons who has a tractor and a trailer, and who would be prepared to undertake the work, which would normally cost £400 or £500, for £250. He might have a sand quarry or be able to get sand, gravel or stones in his own neighbourhood.  If it is stones that are in question, as far as my own area is concerned, he is not likely to run short.  If anybody is interested, we will give them free, gratis and for nothing.</P>
    <P>A great deal could be done if the Civil Service mind could be changed a little, so that we would not be copying the British system or any other system. We should run our own country in our own way, in accordance with the way the members of our Parliament feel it should be run.  In saying that, I do not think I am preaching any extreme or extraordinary views.  There is nobody likely to suggest that it is Communism or anything like that.  If that type of contract work could be done, it would expedite matters in a big way.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the points I have made.  I should like indeed to be in a position in which I could compliment him on all the work done, the great mileage of roads improved, and so forth.  To the extent that I can compliment him, I have done so.  I admit that a certain amount of useful work has been done.  All that remains to be done presents a problem that other Deputies and I have referred to here. If it is necessary to come into the House with a Supplementary Estimate for improvement works the Parliamentary Secretary should not be afraid to do it.  It is quite plain to me that people on the opposite benches who have spoken on behalf of Fianna Fáil and many Deputies on this side of the House are most anxious that more and <Col N="1478" /> more money should be made available.</P>
    <P>We should not allow any Minister for Finance, no matter who he is, to neglect the people who have always counted and the people who always will count in this country&mdash;the producers of food and fuel for the nation, the people on whom, according to the newspapers, the whole country depends when an emergency is at our doors but who are very soon forgotten when the emergency is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The small amount devoted to the particular purposes set out in this Estimate affords me ample evidence of the truth of the statement I have often heard, that the economy of Ireland is the economy of the good land.  When one thinks of areas on the western seaboard from Donegal to West Cork and of the amount of work that remains to be done under the headings in this Vote, after so long a time, one cannot help wondering why the amount of money provided in this case&mdash;£705,700&mdash;is so small.</P>
      <P>As I am on the question of money, while at a later stage in my argument I will be stating something that may appear to be the contrary, I want to make the point that the administration of this figure, in both indoor and outdoor staff, costs between 10 and 11 per cent. of the total.  If we turn to the office of the Revenue Commissioners, we see that they collect about £88,000,000 at an administrative cost of about 3 per cent.  Perhaps there is some feasible explanation; perhaps there is a good explanation.  I should like to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious, also, that this small figure is governed in some way by financial, budgetary limitations but why these should apply in particular to areas which are singled out for special attention from time to time by Governments, whose peoples are praised highly as expediency would seem to warrant, I cannot understand.  I cannot see why the provision is so small having regard to all the things we hear from time to time under all Administrations. Perhaps it is that it is governed by financial limitations but there should be somewhere else where it is possible to economise rather than <Col N="1479" /> economise at the expense of people whose families have been living in areas for hundreds of years and who have been maintaining their families under the most adverse conditions.</P>
    <P>I have just said that the administrative cost of this small sum appears to be too high.  Perhaps it is because the amount is too small or so small that no smaller administrative cost is possible or feasible and that, if the amount voted were greater, the administrative cost would not be any higher&mdash;that it is a static cost that would remain the same even if the Vote were increased manifold.</P>
    <P>From my own observation and experience of the Office of Special Employment and Rural Improvement, my personal view is that it is an efficient office.  Complaints are made here by Deputies on all sides of the House about delay.  When I consider the volume of applications through various political organisations, through interested people, such as the local priest, the local teachers and through me and, in all probability, through other Deputies from my constituency alone and when I consider, in relation to that volume of applications, the amount of work that is done in the period allowed for the implementation of these works, I do not, for the life of me, see how people can make complaints about delay, particularly in relation to rural improvement and minor employment schemes.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is open to anyone to argue, when a particular road or scheme is not done in the year of application, that the office is probably the cause of the delay.  I can see the merit in the delay from a very irritating phrase which almost invariably occurs in letters addressed to me from the Office of Minor Employment and Rural Improvement&mdash;&ldquo;The work will be considered in competition with other applications from the area&rdquo;.  I have had one experience in my own constituency where I submitted six particular works in respect of one parish, last year, and four of them were carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The people there agreed that it was a reasonable average and expressed the hope that &mdash;they did not say next year&mdash;but in time, the other two would be done.</P>
      <P>I think this Vote should be bigger and that, if possible, there should be more outdoor staff.  I think I am right in saying that only one man covers the greater portion of North Mayo in the inspection of proposed works and in the making of estimates for them.  I have never seen anybody else except when the actual works are in progress when you have a number of gangers and inspectors.</P>
      <P>I would like to see more stress on the rural improvement schemes rather than on minor employment schemes. I think the rural improvement schemes create greater interest and I would say that there are areas where there will be no difficulty in getting the local contribution because of the standard of the people who require to have the work done.  There are other areas, however, where the local contribution should be nominal by reason of the fact that they are poorer areas. I think some attention might be given to that in the assessment of the local contributions under the rural improvement schemes.</P>
      <P>With regard to local objections, I think a lot of them could be got over by reasonableness and tact.  I myself have succeeded in getting over many of them and I think the proper approach would solve most of them.  I cannot agree with Deputy M.P. Murphy when he says that many of these objections are due to spite, to neighbours fighting one with the other.  Very few instances of that have come to my notice in my constituency.  Deputy Murphy was probably speaking of his own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fashionable in all assemblies, both national and local, to criticise officials and to find fault with them or with the appointment of gangers or to make complaints about victimisation. When all of these things are investigated&mdash;I am again speaking from personal knowledge&mdash;I find that the percentage of victimisation and the percentage of wrong judgment are very negligible indeed.  I do not know why <Col N="1481" /> you will always have that kind of cry but I think if people would give more assistance to their officials, not alone in this office but in every other office, much more would be achieved.</P>
    <P>The timing of the work in these matters is also of importance.  I think it is only natural to conclude that work done during bad or indifferent weather must yield less return than that done in weather during which a proper day's work can be done.  The Parliamentary Secretary is at a great disadvantage, having regard to the small amount of money available to him and his officials.  They are responsible for estimating the cost of each individual work and for the distribution of that work all over the country. They are at a great disadvantage in trying to give fair play to every area and to every parish.  All sides of the House, irrespective of Party, have urged upon him the necessity to raise with the Minister for Finance, and with the Government if necessary, the question of having more money made available for these schemes.  It is something which, in the national interest, should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>The amount of this Vote is very small and not at all the gesture which should be made to the people who live, work and have their social engagements under conditions that are truly appalling and in conditions which it is very difficult to blame them for leaving. You cannot play two tunes in this or any other country.  You cannot bemoan emigration and migration if you are not prepared to play your part in helping the people to avoid leaving the conditions under which they live at the moment.  We must get to the core of things and getting to the core of things is nothing more or less than having a realistic approach.  If the problem is approached with the care it deserves, £750,000 is not sufficient for a Vote of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that we are in agreement that an insufficient amount of money is being allocated for these very important works. Accordingly, it will not be necessary for me to reiterate what Deputies O'Mara and Lindsay have said.  I want <Col N="1482" /> to begin by complimenting the staff of the Minor Employment Schemes Office for the efforts they are making to get the works out in time.  However, I think they are not being given a reasonable chance of keeping up with the work they are being asked to do, not merely because the money voted is insufficient but because the staff of inspectors is grossly insufficient.</P>
      <P>I will admit that from 1954 to 1955 we had exceptionally bad weather. Immediately prior to last summer we had a bad winter, a bad summer and a bad winter immediately succeeding one another and I believe the number of applications that came in as a result of the problems created by the excessive rain was unprecedented.  I appreciate, therefore, that there would have been an extra strain placed on the Department staff over a considerable period because of this huge influx of applications, but I think no reasonable effort was made to catch up with the demand.</P>
      <P>The Department always had a perfectly true explanation&mdash;that the number of inspectors on the job was quite inadequate and therefore that they could not catch up on the back-log of applications.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should make an effort now to catch up on the arrears and try to get this work up to date. In South Mayo applications have been in for three, four, and five years which have not yet been tackled.  I repeat that is not the fault of anybody.  It is the fault of the administration which apparently regard these schemes as being not of sufficient importance to handle properly.  One minor grievance I have against the Parliamentary Secretary is that last year, for the first time, the list of approved schemes was not made available to all Deputies representing the areas concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let it be one way or the other.  Deputy Beegan suggests that they should not be sent out at all, even on application, and I, personally, am willing to fall in with either suggestion <Col N="1484" /> provided we are all given an equal chance at the starting line and can run off together.  It will then be our own fault if we lose the race and do not win the prize.  This is of some importance because, apart from everything else, there is hardly a townland in North or South Mayo, nor in Galway for that matter, in which there are not two or three road or drainage schemes or some such projects that have been applied for under the rural improvement scheme and in which the local people have a very deep interest.  A man with land under water who hopes to have it drained has portion of his income denied to him, and is naturally interested in reclaiming the land so that he may make some money out of it.  Therefore, it is a matter of some importance to county councillors and T.D.s and it should not be made a political plaything.</P>
      <P>I do not want to accuse the Parliamentary Secretary in any way of being unfavourable to County Mayo but I have the impression that Galway is doing even better than it did in Deputy Beegan's time and that Mayo is doing less well.  I think fewer schemes have been passed and less money spent on County Mayo in the past 12 months than in the previous 12 months, notwithstanding the fact that an unprecedented number of applications were in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters of an individual nature to which I wish to refer.  One of these concerns the problem of the people of Milford estate near Kilmaine who have been using a way through Lady Ormsby's estate for some 40 or 50 years.  The way which they have been using was not a right of way.  It has been used at the will of the Ormsby family who have been very decent to the local people in that matter, but for reasons I need not go into here and which are no reflection on the Ormsby family, it is not now possible for them to allow the local people to use that pathway.  For that reason application has been made to the Special Employment Schemes Office to have a road cut <Col N="1485" /> so as to enable people to go to Mass and children to go to school and to obviate the necessity of going a very considerable distance round about which would be a hardship on old people and on the children.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give special attention, if he can, to that application, of the merits of which I am convinced.  I do not think it is necessary at this stage to go into any further detail about it, but I shall be glad to give any further particulars at any time if requested.</P>
      <P>I understand that one of the schemes sent up by the county council this year was turned down.  It was, I think, sponsored by Councillor Durcan and it was of very considerable interest to people in the vicinity of Charlestown who had prevailed on the councillor in question to submit this scheme in preference to a number of other schemes which were all of considerable importance. Both the councillor and the people concerned are very disappointed that this scheme was rejected by the Department concerned, the Department of Local Government.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact, in his statement to the House, that the Minister for Local Government and himself jointly operated this section of the Vote.  I hope that it will be possible to review the refusal in this case.  I am familiar with the scheme itself and I cannot see any adequate reason why it should be rejected.</P>
      <P>Another thing that vitally affects the people of East Mayo in particular is the matter of arterial drainage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of arterial drainage does not arise on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that is so, but the effect of arterial drainage on this land is of vital importance.  As the Corrib-Clare-Dalgan drainage scheme progresses, land which was formally rejected under minor employment schemes year after year because of the fact that arterial drainage work had not been done will become eligible. I should imagine that in the next few years, when the Corrib-Clare-Dalgan drainage scheme is completed, an <Col N="1486" /> enormous number of schemes which had to be formerly rejected because they were not capable of being done then will be re-submitted and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that, if necessary, a Supplementary Vote will be introduced to enable these schemes to be carried out as quickly as possible.  The problem of places like Kilmovee and other places drained by the Boyle River is really frightening. Time after time the unfortunate farmers are told that they cannot have their land drained under minor employment schemes or under rural improvement schemes because the arterial drainage of the Lung River has not been completed.  That is understandable, but it is very unfortunate from the point of view of the local people.</P>
      <P>May I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that in an area like that, where not merely has arterial drainage not been carried out but where there seems to be no reasonable chance of its being completed inside the next 20 years, a special effort should be made to have road works done in substitution for drainage work so that the amount of employment in the area will be the same as would be given if the Board of Works, which is responsible for arterial drainage, had caught up with their job.  I think it is not wrong or unfair to say that areas like the one to which I have referred have suffered unduly from the employment point of view because of the fact that drainage schemes could not be operated.  The Parliamentary Secretary should devote more money or a corresponding amount of money for road development, which is equally behindhand and which could be done certainly for the next 20 years, while waiting for arterial drainage to be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it all boils down to the question again of how much money the Parliamentary Secretary has at his disposal. There is no use in my making Deputy O'Hara's speech or Deputy Lindsay's speech.  All I need say is that I fully agree that the amount available is niggardly and that the Government ought to be ashamed to ask the people from the West of Ireland&mdash;along the west coast&mdash;who are <Col N="1487" /> principally concerned, as far as these rural improvements, minor employment and bog development schemes are concerned, to spread out this ridiculously small amount of money over a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>I noticed that, at the end of his speech, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that over £248,000 of money is available, unexpended from the National Development Fund, but said that he does not know whether this sum, or any part of it, will be available in the coming year for the purposes of this Vote.  I do not think that any more worthy application of these funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by £250,000 than we are to-day, and as I say, we are bad enough now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think other speakers mentioned the importance of bog development at a time when coal is rapidly becoming a thing of the past.  I suppose, in 15 <Col N="1488" /> or 20 years' time, there will not be any coal used industrially or otherwise in this country, because its price will be prohibitive, if it is available at all; and, in the interval between now and the harnessing of the atomic bomb for the purpose of fuel and other production, we will have to depend more and more on turbary supplies in our own country.  That being so, every effort should be made to facilitate the cutting and producing of turf.  I think that even to-day there are parts of the country where an ass and creel have to be employed.  I worked with them myself when I was a boy, and I cannot imagine nor conceive any harder work for either the donkey or the person involved than taking turf out with an ass and creel.  It is an extraordinary thing to have to say that that should be necessary in any part of this country at the present time.  I suppose it is a reflection on us that it is true.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this Vote, except to say, in conclusion, that people who have contributed to rural improvement schemes have been rejected when they applied for employment afterwards.  Of course, I can understand that this is on the basis that all these schemes are described as employment and emergency schemes, and that the primary object of them is to give temporary work to people who would otherwise be on the dole.  Even so, there is one factor which is of great importance, that is, that the people who are directly concerned with the work, be it a drain or a road, will naturally be more interested in seeing that the work will be done economically and done well than a person who has no connection, other than the fact that he is on the dole.  For that reason, it is essential that at least a fair proportion of the people who are working on every scheme should be the people who contribute to the scheme and who are directly involved in it, and who would thus have an interest in seeing it done efficiently and the money spread out as well as possible.</P>

      <P>Being a member of a local authority for a long number of years&mdash;over 20 years now&mdash;I have been dealing with what are called the Christmas grants and relief works, the majority of which were under the Fianna Fáil Government.  The local authorities all over the country to-day are very dissatisfied with the procedure we have to go through in a local authority.  First of all, you put up a scheme from your engineer in advance and you probably get sanction for that in Christmas week.  My grouse is this: the ratepayers are not getting a good return for what they contribute, not through any fault of the workers concerned, but because of the time of year these schemes are carried out, in bad weather, wet, frost and, sometimes, snow.  The men are knocked off and put in hardship.  I always call these relief schemes hardship schemes, and I say it here again to-day, because they are started in the winter time. The local authorities, through the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, are sending a deputation to the Minister to try to have this work carried out at a more suitable time of the year than the dead of winter, and the ratepayers will thus get better satisfaction for the amount of the contribution they put up and it will also be more satisfactory to the men employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for some Deputies to say that the money is not enough, but if we are to get more money for roads and construction work, we will have to put up the rates.  What I find in my local authority is that the very people advocating that in the local authority are the very people who, when it comes to getting the money for roads, strongly object, and the first argument raised is: &ldquo;We cannot allow the rates to go up&rdquo;; but, at the same time, we are losing money because we did not raise enough at the time of the year that we should.  If the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department will meet the deputation from the <Col N="1490" /> Twenty-Six Counties, representing the municipal authorities of Ireland, and hear the case they have to put up, he will agree that an earlier start would give better results.</P>
    <P>I had occasion at the last annual conference in Athlone to make the same appeal as I am making now, namely, that we get an earlier start to the work and thereby avoid inflicting unnecessary hardships on the workers concerned, with better results all round for the public generally.  The present situation represents a real grievance.  A certain amount of the money goes waste because of bad weather.  Then there is another grievance inasmuch as some people will not get a day's work on these schemes.  I am referring now to single men.</P>

I would prefer to see all these schemes done in fine weather.  We would have a better return from them, for one thing.

      <P>As a Deputy representing a rural area where minor and rural improvements schemes play a very important part in the life and in the livelihood of the people, I am glad to have had an opportunity of studying this Vote in some detail.  I notice that the total provision represents a sum of £1,022,800, as against £1,018,300 in the previous year.  On the face of it, it may appear as if there has been an <Col N="1491" /> increase in the amount of money provided for rural improvements and minor employment schemes this year. That is not the case.  That increase is absorbed in the salaries, travelling and other incidental expenses, which have gone up by almost £4,000.  I do not begrudge officials getting increases. That is the natural consequence of the arbitration that was held.  At the same time, while officials are getting bigger salaries as a result of arbitration, less money is being provided for less work in those areas where minor employment schemes, bog development schemes and rural improvement schemes play such an important part in providing the people in those areas with certain amenities.  These areas with sometimes looked upon as the slumdom of agriculture.</P>

    <P>I do not want the officials of the Office of Public Works to think that I object to their getting an increase of salary.  In my long association with that office since 1948, I have met with nothing but courtesy and co-operation from the officials.  I have had a good deal of contract with that office, because there have been many applications for minor relief schemes and rural improvement schemes from the area I represent.  In fairness to the officials of the Special Employment Schemes Branch, I must say that I have met with nothing but courtesy. There was a time when Deputy Beegan, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, was accused of being influenced by political considerations in the appointment of gangers.  I never believed that; I knew that the officials in that office would not have stood for that.  I think it is equally unfair to impute such motives to the present Parliamentary Secretary, though I heard him challenged <Col N="1492" /> 12 months ago in relation to an appointment which, it was alleged, was made on political grounds.  I do not believe that happens.  I have tremendous confidence in the men at the helm.</P>
    <P>In the compilation of these figures for submission to the Minister for Finance, I do not think due regard was had to the volume of work to be executed in the current financial year. Leaving out the millions, there is only a difference as between £22,800 and £18,300 in the previous year.  That increase is offset by the increased salaries, travelling and other incidental expenses.  Within the last month, wages have increased in County Limerick by 22.6 per cent.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if he were standing on guard in his office, he should at least ensure that provision would be made for the same volume of work this year as was done last year.  Instead of that, in presenting this Estimate, he has depreciated the volume of work to be done to the tune of 22.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether my figure will be acceptable.  I am quoting the increase in wages in County Limerick. The wage content is an important factor in every scheme.  I do not think we are getting a fair break.  I have here in my pocket a little card.  It is one of those little cards that every Deputy receives so expeditiously and so courteously from the Office of Public Works.  I could not tell how many such cards I have received stating that certain matters are awaiting inspection, consideration or approval.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 8th May, 1956.</P>
