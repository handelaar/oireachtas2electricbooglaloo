      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that the level of emigration from County Mayo has reached unprecedented heights, and, if so, whether the Government propose to take any practical steps to give immediate employment in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies who have put down these questions to my replies to a question and supplementary questions addressed to me in this House on the 19th June, 1956, arising out of the position regarding emigration indicated in the Preliminary Report of the Census of Population, 1956; to the speech on the Estimate for my Department delivered by me on the 25th July, 1956; and to my address at a meeting held in Dublin on the 5th October, 1956, of which printed copies are now available in convenient form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On all these occasions, I emphasised that it is the constant aim of Government policy to promote an expanding economy, with higher levels of agricultural and industrial production, an increasing surplus available for disposal on a competitive basis abroad and increased employment and improved living conditions at home.  In my address of the 5th October, I announced a series of specific decisions taken by the Government, constituting a positive, practical and constructive policy, a programme of action designed for the achievement of the general aims which I had stated on the previous occasions referred to and on many earlier occasions.  Where the decisions can be carried into effect by administrative action, such action has been and is being taken and will be continued with all possible speed; and, where legislation is required, the Government have directed that the preparation of the legislative proposals should receive priority at every stage, and the necessary Bills will be introduced <Col N="3" /> in this House at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Deputies may rest assured that the Government's measures for developing the national economy will be applied with full regard to the circumstances and particular difficulties of all individual areas of the country.  As an indication of our concern in this regard, I may draw attention to my reference to &ldquo;the accepted policy of decentralisation of industry&rdquo;, in connection with the location of new factory buildings qualifying for the grants announced in the course of my address, of the 5th October.  In that address, I pointed out that, since June, 1954, the national policy of decentralisation of industry has been pressed vigorously ahead and that the results may be seen, in concrete form, in the undeveloped counties where factories assisted by State grants have been opened in the past few years.  I added that, since June, 1954, three times as much capital has been provided by An Foras Tionscal to establish factories as was provided in the period of the previous Government and that, in addition, a number of other valuable projects are proceeding in the western areas.</P>
    <P>Practical demonstration of the Government's anxiety for the welfare of the Gaeltacht areas, including the Mayo Gaeltacht, has been given by the establishment of the new Department of the Gaeltacht, whose function, as the House is aware, is to promote the cultural, social and economic welfare of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I put was to ask the Taoiseach what immediate steps the Government had decided upon to relieve the unemployment and emigration position.  The Taoiseach has now reiterated the long-term policy of the Government.  Would the Taoiseach, in a few words, simply answer the question whether the Government has any immediate plans to solve the ever-growing weekly unemployment and emigration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, is it not a fact that, while the Taoiseach has been talking, unemployment has been growing and the people have been going?  Is the Taoiseach's remedy for the present critical situation deluging the country with words while the people are going?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about deluging the country with words, we have at least put forward a practical constructive proposal in an endeavour to solve both the emigration and the unemployment problems.</P>

      <P>Further arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, is the Taoiseach aware that State capital expenditure has fallen from £34.5 million in 1953-54 to £23.7 million in 1955-56?</P>

      <P>(a)  It is estimated that in 1954 Government Departments used 14,500 tons of imported coal valued at £94,000.  The corresponding estimates for 1955 are 12,250 tons valued at £87,000 and for the period January-June, 1956, 6,000 tons valued at £44,000.  These figures exclude any imported coal used at Garda stations outside the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
      <P>(b)  The principal coal-using State sponsored bodies (the E.S.B., G.N.R. board, C.I.E., Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, Cork Dockyards, Limited, Dairy Disposal Company, Limited, imported 364,000 tons of coal in 1954, 376,000 tons in 1955 and 134,000 tons in the period January-June, 1956, but the value of these imports is not available.</P>
      <P>(c)  Particulars of the quantity and value of imported coal used by local authorities are not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that retailers of consumer goods are not displaying price lists in accordance with the regulations, and if he will state, in respect of the past nine months, the number of prosecutions in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that retailers of consumer goods are not displaying the price lists to a satisfactory extent.  Regulations requiring the display of price lists apply only to certain specified foodstuffs and the position regarding the display of these price lists is being kept under constant review.  Traders have been advised by Press and radio annuncement of their obligations in this matter and they have been warned that failure to display price lists renders them liable to prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current regulation requiring the <Col N="13" /> display of a price list has now been in operation since September, 1955.  Every effort has been made to induce the cooperation of traders and the stage has now been reached where prosecutions will have to be undertaken when the regulation is not observed.  Inspectors of my Department have in recent weeks been engaged in an intensive survey, both in Dublin and in provincial areas, for the purpose of obtaining the evidence necessary to support prosecutions against traders who have not yet complied with the regulation.</P>
    <P>I should mention that approximately 66 per cent. of the traders visited in Dublin and district have been found to be displaying the price list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Minister is aware the regulations have been broken, is it a fact that no prosecutions have yet been taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have preferred to proceed by the method of inducement and urging rather than by the method of prosecution.  The inducement and urging have produced a response of 66 per cent. compliance in Dublin but it is clear that as far as the provinces are concerned there is a greater degree of non-compliance.  Having given all methods of persuasion a trial, the time has now arrived when, if the terms of the regulations are not complied with, prosecutions would appear to be inevitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Two Orders controlling the maximum retail prices of bacon were made in 1954, viz.: (i) The Bacon (Maximum Prices) Order, 1954, which came into operation on 4th October, 1954, and (ii) The Bacon (Maximum Prices) (No. 2) Order, 1954, which came into operation on 22nd November, 1954.  The controlled maximum retail prices are set out in the Schedules to these Orders.</P>
      <P>On the 12th February, 1955, the Bacon (Maximum Prices) Order, 1955, was made by me.  The Schedule to that Order specified, in eight different columns, a series of maximum retail prices for bacon, and the Order provided that the prices specified in any particular column could be brought into operation by a direction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the recent increase in the wholesale price of bacon was imposed following a recommendation from the Prices Advisory Body, and, if not, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The wholesale price of bacon is not controlled.  As the Deputy is aware, the Bacon (Maximum Prices) Order, 1955, provides for the control of retail prices, and the last direction given by me under this Order, reduced the maximum prices with effect from 8th October, 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage, it is not merely wholesale prices of bacon in the ordinary sense that are involved.  You have the manufacturer, the wholesaler the retailer and the consumers.  In this particular case the wholesaler is, in fact, the curer and so far as the fixing of prices at the curing level is concerned that is as much a matter for the Department of Agriculture as it is for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that while the bacon factories are grading pigs for producers, and pricing them accordingly, consumers are paying uniform prices for all grades; and, if so, if he will take steps to ensure that bacon for the consumer is graded both in quality and price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already considered the possibility of having the different cuts of bacon for retail sale stamped according to quality or grade but I am advised that this course would be impracticable.</P>
      <P>The grade marking could not be done when the pigs are being graded after slaughter because grade A pigs may sometimes produce grade B bacon and grade B pigs may produce grade A bacon.  If the grade marking were to be done when the bacon is ready to leave the factory extra staff and expense would be necessary and this would be inevitably reflected in dearer bacon.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the general dissatisfaction at the additional increased cost of bus fares arising from the uneven location of stages in Dublin City and suburbs, he will ask C.I.E. to revise the present system and arrange the fares in relation to the distance travelled, or, alternatively, if he will have the matter referred to the Prices Advisory Body for investigation.</P>

      <P>The Legislature imposed on C.I.E. the task of providing &ldquo;an efficient, economical, convenient and properly integrated system of public transport&rdquo;, with due regard to certain considerations, and of conducting their undertaking so as &ldquo;to secure, as soon as may be, that, taking one year with another, the revenue of the board shall be not less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue&rdquo;.  For carrying out this task the board were empowered to &ldquo;fix, demand, take and recover such charges as they may think fit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these statutory provisions, the full responsibility for determining the proper fare stages rests with C.I.E. and that is in accordance with the wishes of the Oireachtas as set out in the Transport Act, 1950. I cannot relieve C.I.E. of their statutory responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is intended to proceed with the development of rural electrification on the same scale as heretofore, and whether there has been any reduction in the amount of money allocated for this purpose recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that they expect to complete the electrical development of at least 80 rural areas this year.  The number of areas remaining to be completed is limited and the board favour a gradual tapering off so as to avoid sudden dislocation of employment, including employment in industries catering for the supply of equipment.  This matter is still the subject of discussion with the board.</P>
      <P>There is no separate advance from the Exchequer for rural electrification, which forms part of the general activity of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that what the Minister really means is that there will be some reduction in the development of the rural electrification extension?  Is that really what the Minister means?  I am not quite sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as rural electrification is concerned, I indicated what the position is, namely, that the board hope to complete 80 areas this year. The board said they are now coming towards the end of the scheme and would like the end of the scheme better organised than they feel it will be if they go full steam ahead.  That is based on their own views.  The better organisation of the scheme will provide the maximum employment over a longer period because you have people employed by the firms which supply the goods.  They have asked, therefore, that there should be some organised tapering off in the rural electrification scheme and in that respect they say that the matter is under consideration.  The Deputy will be glad to know that in the year ending March, 1954, the total cost of the rural electrification scheme was £2,600,000.  It is expected to be very much more than that when this year's scheme is completed.</P>

      <P>Let the Minister answer the question in his own way if the Deputy does not mind.  In the last year in which the Fianna Fáil Government was in office the number of areas completed was 60.  That was the highest they ever completed.  The number this year, if it is 80, will be 33 per cent. higher than the last Government's highest ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

What stopped them this year?  What brought down the rate of development by 20 per cent.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister stated in this House that the E.S.B. had too much current over and above the amount that could be consumed?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister told me personally in this House six months ago that the rate of development was being stepped up each year until 100 areas would be taken on?  The figures given by the Minister now for this year are in respect of 80 areas.  Is that not a reduction or does the Minister know mathematics?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the board is concerned, it has expressed the view that better organisation and better employment would result by a tapering off of the rural electrification scheme. If the scheme is rushed to the end and stops suddenly, hundreds of skilled workers who are now getting employment in the production of electrical equipment for the rural electrification scheme may be catapulted into unemployment. The board is concerned about that.  The firms making the equipment are concerned about that and the trade unions who cater for these workers are concerned about <Col N="29" /> that.  I think a discussion with these people is likely to be much more fruitful than listening to vapourings in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil éinní sa chás seo a bhéarfadh go mba cheart dul siar ar an mbreith a tugadh.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During the recess, members learned with deep regret of the death of Deputy Peadar S. Doyle. The late Deputy was a Dublin man, proud of his native city, deeply interested in its arts and crafts, its buildings, its history and the welfare of all its citizens.  He first came into public life as a member of the Dublin Corporation in 1918, and he served continuously on that body until failing health, last year, forced on him a most unwelcome restriction of public activities.  He was a zealous representative and an excellent chairman.  For three years he was Lord Mayor of Dublin and for many years Chairman of the Dublin Board of Assistance.  He was also a Governor of Dr. Steevens' Hospital and a member of the Boards of the Meath Hospital and the old Cork Street Fever Hospital.  For many years, also, he was Chairman of the Visiting Committee to Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy Doyle had unbroken membership of Dáil Éireann for 33 years.  At the time of his death he was Whip of the Fine Gael Party and had been, for many years, Whip to the Cumann na nGaedheal Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peadar Doyle was a skilled craftsman, a trade unionist and a splendid example of the eager and enthusiastic men who found their way into the Gaelic League, the Sinn Féin organisation and, finally, the Irish Volunteers.  He fought in the Dublin Union under Éamonn Ceannt in the Rising of 1916, and, like Ceannt, he was sentenced to death.  He survived that death sentence only to meet with the poignant loss of one of his sons, who was killed by the Black and Tans during the War of Independence in <Col N="68" /> 1920.  Great as was the disturbing influence of the times for one moulded to craftsmanship, culture and the domestic and civic arts&mdash;rather than to contention and strife&mdash;he was, nevertheless, able, in the crucial years of the struggle for freedom and in the formative years of the State, to put all his energies at the service of his country, which he continued to serve in a selfless manner right up to the time of his death.</P>
    <P>Peadar Doyle was a man who never flinched from his duty.  He was a builder&mdash;anxious always to construct rather than to tear down.  He had his own strongly-held views, but he was ever tolerant, friendly and understanding to others.  He survived all the upsets and differences of 40 years of Irish public life without uttering a harsh word.  It is true to say that, irrespective of Party, all of us in this House who knew him were his friends and deeply regret his passing.  So also will his constituents in Dublin, whom he served so ably and so long.</P>
    <P>Peadar was a loyal colleague, a good friend, a most conscientious Deputy and a gentleman whom it was a privilege to have known and to have worked with.  We shall all treasure many kind memories of him.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his widow and other relatives the sympathy of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after the House adjourned last July for the summer recess, members learned with deep regret of the death of Diarmuid Ó Duibhir, the Clerk of the Dáil.  His death occurred, most lamentably, within a short time after his appointment to the post at the beginning of June of this year.  Solas na bhflaitheas dá anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. O'Dwyer was for many years a familiar figure in Leinster House, the service of which he first entered in 1925 as an executive officer.  In 1935 he became an administrative officer and in 1941 he was promoted principal clerk. <Col N="69" /> In 1948 he was appointed Clerk-Assistant of the Dáil, from which post he was selected to be Clerk of the Seanad and Seanad Returning Officer in April 1954.  He lectured for several years on central Government in the course for the Diploma in Public Administration at University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The late clerk was an officer about whom it may be truly said that his greatest ambition was to give the very best of his services to Parliament, and, on the records of both the Dáil and the Seanad offices, he has left behind him a lasting imprint of his keen intellect, sound judgment and broadly-based views.  He was well versed in comparative parliamentary procedure and had an unusually retentive memory, and his fund of knowledge and experience as to what was proper and what was possible in the sphere of parliamentary practice was always at our disposal.  His pleasant and agreeable manner and his quiet, unassuming efficiency quickly won for him the affection and respect of members of both Houses.  On personal grounds, we feel the loss of Mr. O'Dwyer, and, on public grounds, we feel the loss that this House has suffered by the death of an officer whose past achievements had led us all to look forward to even more valuable service from him in the interest of this House for many years ahead.</P>
    <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to have recorded in the Journals of the House the regret of the Dáil at the untimely death of Mr. O'Dwyer and an appreciation of his services at the Table.  I also ask you to convey the sympathy of the House to his widow and family.</P>

    <Title>National Loan, 1956. - Statement by Minister for Finance.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that a National Loan will open for subscription on Monday next, 29th October. Before I announce the terms of the issue, it would not be out of place to examine what progress has been made towards a better balance in our external trade and payments since I addressed the House last July.  I pointed out then that the critical need was to stop the drain in the balance of payments which, if allowed to continue unchecked, would have most serious consequences for the economy. Decisive action was called for to deal with the situation.  There was no immediate prospect of a significant increase in our earnings from exports and it was, therefore, necessary to cut down our external payments by reinforcing and extending the scope of the special import levy imposed in March and reducing the basic allowance for foreign travel.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that these measures, together with the other steps taken by the Government to reduce unnecessary spending and encourage saving, are, through the co-operation of the people at large, beginning to produce results.  Clear evidence of this is afforded by the trade figures in which there has been a gratifying improvement in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Up to the end of July this year the cumulative trade deficit totalled £55,000,000 as compared with £58,000,000 in the corresponding period of 1955, representing a decline of only £3,000,000.  In the months of August and September, however, there has been a total net improvement of £7,000,000 in the trade deficit as compared with the same two months of 1955.  If this trend is maintained we can look forward to a greatly reduced external deficit this year and we can derive encouragement from the thought that if the improvement is maintained we may hope in 1957 to lay the spectre of the balance of payments deficit that has been haunting us for so long.  The important thing to remember, however, is that while the latest trade figures are encouraging there can be no relaxation of our efforts.  The vital need remains of preserving a sound economy.  We must, therefore, be ready to overcome any setbacks but it is heartening to know that our efforts are bearing fruit and that the trend is now in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It is against this background of improvement in our national accounts that I announce the terms of a new National Loan.  The amount for which the loan is being issued is £12,000,000. The rate of interest is 5½ per cent. and the issue price £98 per £100 of stock or £9.16 for each £10 taken up.  Only one redemption date has been fixed. The loan will definitely be repaid in 1966.  The issue will be underwritten jointly by the Government and the banks.  As it is being made at a discount, the ordinary investor who buys the stock now and holds it for the relatively short period of ten years to redemption will receive a tax-free capital gain of £2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Applications will be accepted for amounts of £10 and multiples thereof and only 10 per cent. of the subscription need accompany each application, the remainder being paid over the months of November, December, and January.</P>
    <P>The tax privileges which have been a feature of recent National Loans are again included.  For example, stock of the issue will be accepted at face value, <Col N="72" /> with due allowance for any accrued interest, as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part. Interest will be paid without deduction of income-tax at source, but it will, of course, be liable to tax in the hands of recipients at the rates of tax appropriate to their respective incomes. The usual tax concessions for non-residents are also provided.</P>
    <P>The prospectus for the loan, moreover, incorporates a new and valuable concession.  This is that the stock will be acceptable at the issue price, with an allowance for any interest accrued, as the equivalent of cash for the purpose of subscription to any public issue by the Government which is made within the next five years and is quoted on the Stock Exchange.  In other words, holders of the stock will be able, should they so desire, to transfer direct into any new Government issue of the conventional type announced in that period; the £98 cash which they subscribe for £100 stock of this issue will be worth £98 as a subscription to any such issue.  Those who hold stocks of National Loans to maturity are, of course, assured of no capital loss on their investment but it is sometimes a source of anxiety to subscribers that, in the event of their having to realise their stock before the due date, they may suffer a loss because of market conditions at the time of sale.  The provision I have mentioned is an assurance to investors in this loan that the value of their security will stand high regardless of market trends.  When the five years are up, the short period outstanding to redemption, combined with the other attractive terms of the issue, including its trustee status, will operate to support the market price.  In addition, the substantial half-yearly sinking fund allocations which are provided and the fact that the Government stockbroker will be prepared to buy or sell blocks of the stock in reasonable amounts will ensure a continuing and active market in the issue.</P>
    <P>The prospectus and application form will be published in to-morrow morning's newspapers and copies may also be obtained as from to-morrow <Col N="73" /> from banks, stockbrokers and post offices.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 2nd November.</P>
    <P>Every subscription to the National Loan, no matter how small, will help to raise the country's production, create additional employment opportunities at home, stem the flow of emigration, and improve the living standards of all.  The works of national development which the loan will finance include land improvement and other schemes to increase agricultural production, expansion of electricity generating capacity, industrial development, purchase of ships and aircraft, improvement of internal communications, development of bogs, afforestation and housing.</P>
    <P>There may be some comment that the amount of the National Loan I am now announcing is £12,000,000 rather than the £20,000,000 which has come to be regarded as normal.  I should, therefore, explain that, while this will be the only public issue of the conventional type floated in the present financial year by the State or any public authority, it is the intention to supplement the proceeds of the present loan by what is for this country a novel method of raising capital, namely, an issue of Prize Bonds.  In recent years there have been many suggestions that such a scheme should be introduced here.  These Prize Bonds will be placed on sale early in the new year.  They will be encashable in full at short notice but, instead of earning interest, will participate in drawings for cash prizes, free of income-tax and surtax. The proposed issue of Prize Bonds need not cause anyone to hold off subscribing to the new National Loan. Rather the contrary, for subscribers to the National Loan will be at a special advantage in regard to the first issue of Prize Bonds.  It will be a term of the prospectus of the loan that each £100 of stock (for which, of course, only £98 in cash will have been subscribed) will be accepted as the equivalent of £100 in cash&mdash;up to a limit of £1,000 for any individual&mdash;for the purpose of subscription to the first issue of Prize Bonds.  The details of the Prize Bonds scheme will be announced at a later date.  I would stress, however, that no <Col N="74" /> one need await the terms of that issue because, under the conversion scheme I have announced, subscribers to this loan can, if they wish, exchange on advantageous terms into the first issue of Prize Bonds.</P>
    <P>In our efforts to achieve external balance the savings drive plays a vital part.  By refraining from unnecessary spending on imported goods and by investing at home the money saved, all of us, no matter what our station in life, can help to create the conditions in which greater national prosperity can be permanently achieved.  The recent trade statistics are, as I have mentioned, satisfactory but we still have far to go before our objectives are attained.  Every person who feels that he ought to be playing his part in the savings drive is now provided with a timely inducement to add his share to the national effort by subscribing to the loan.  The terms are very attractive and, indeed, it may be many years before a National Loan as profitable to investors is again put on the market. I confidently commend the new issue to the House and to the public generally.</P>

      <P>No words are necessary from us to recommend this loan. The terms as announced by the Minister are its best recommendation to prospective investors.  The Minister has gone extraordinary distances and taken unprecedented steps to make it attractive.  This is not the occasion in which one should examine these in detail and consider their likely effects, but, undoubtedly, they make the issue most attractive.</P>
      <P>The money is urgently required to prevent any possible suspension of productive effort in the State, and consequent unemployment.  Therefore, we are most anxious naturally that this money will be forthcoming and we recommend this loan to the public.</P>

      <P>I might add, for the information of the Dáil, that, subject to the approval of this motion by the House and the subsequent appointment by the President of Deputy Lindsay to be a member of the Government, I propose to terminate the assignment of the Department of the Gaeltacht to General Mulcahy, which I made on the 2nd July last, and assign that Department to Deputy Lindsay.  I am satisfied that the new Department will require the whole-time and undivided attention of a member of the Government, and, as I indicated to the Dáil in the course of the debate on the Estimate for my Department on the 26th July last, the assignment of the Department of the Gaeltacht to General Mulcahy was purely a temporary arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are against this appointment.  We think it should not be necessary to introduce a further member into the Government in order to get this work of the Gaeltacht done. My own hope was that there would be put in charge of that Department one whose public activities had associated him with the Gaeltacht and the restoration of the Irish language.  It is possible, in my opinion, to get the necessary work done without addition to the membership of the Government. The present Government, if this Minister is appointed, will have two Ministers and one Parliamentary Secretary more than we had in our time.  There are some Departments of State which do not, to say the least of it, overwork a Minister and it should be possible not to increase, anyhow, the existing number in order to get this work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do believe the Department of Education requires a whole-time Minister. I believe also that, if anything is to come from this creation of a Minister for the Gaeltacht, it is necessary that the person who is appointed should be able to devote his whole time to it and that he should be a person in whom the public will have full confidence so that he might get the necessary co-operation and his work be effective. We do not think the present appointment of an additional member is necessary and we do not think that the person who is being nominated by the Taoiseach is the best person to <Col N="77" /> take charge.  For that reason, it is necessary for us to oppose this appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion requires some further elucidation.  This Government was returned in order to reduce expenditure.  This Government was returned, according to its own declarations, on an undertaking to make Government Departments work more efficiently.  One would have thought that for a Department with such a difficult task before it as that of the new Department of the Gaeltacht, an experienced administrator would have been proposed by the Taoiseach.  I do not wish at all to impugn the ability of Deputy Lindsay. I am sure he is able.  I gather he has had a very good and successful career in another place, in the forensic arena. He has built up a substantial practice and connection as a practising barrister, but no one will deny that his experience as an actual departmental administrator has been of the briefest.</P>
      <P>This neophyte&mdash;and I do not use the word in any offensive sense&mdash;this neophyte in public affairs is going to be given one of the most difficult tasks that could be imposed upon any Minister. Just think of what he has to do. He has to look after the interests of an area, which, as we all know, has been sadly neglected over a great number of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would ask you to recall the words of the Taoiseach in presenting this motion to the House. He has submitted a motion that the Dáil should approve the nomination by him of Deputy Patrick James Lindsay for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government, as he proposed to entrust to him the portfolio of Minister for the Gaeltacht. That, Sir, naturally, I submit, raises the question as to the fitness, from the point of view of actual experience in public administration, of the Deputy whose nomination the House is asked to approve; and it is on that basis that I am endeavouring to put to the House the argument that this is, as I have already said, a most difficult portfolio.  I have just pointed out that after a great number of years, despite everything that has been done by this House to improve the lot of the people of the Gaeltacht, the people are still leaving the Gaeltacht.  If one takes up the statutes of the Dáil, one will see therein special Acts relating to Gaeltacht housing and special provision made for Gaeltacht roads.  The fisheries legislation is very largely centred upon the needs of the Gaeltacht. In fact, one could say that there is not any problem that would properly come before us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This, Sir, is a most important appointment and I am suggesting that the person to be appointed will have to deal with problems of the same complexity as those with which the Government as a whole has to deal in relation to the country as a whole.  Now, everything that has to be dealt with by the Government in relation to the country as a whole, but which the Government allots to separate Ministries, will have to be dealt with by the Minister for the Gaeltacht in himself.  He will have to consider many of the problems that the Minister for Local Government has had to consider; he will have to consider many of the problems the Minister for Health has to consider; he will have to consider many of the problems that the Minister for Lands has to consider; he will have to consider many of the problems that the Minister for Agriculture has to consider.</P>
      <P>What is happening?  Here, the Taoiseach proposes to ask this House to approve of the appointment as Minister for the Gaeltacht of a Deputy who, however estimable in himself, however high his personal qualities, has not had experience of any Government Department hitherto&mdash;has not been in the Department of Local Government, has not been in the Department of Agriculture, has not been in the Department of Lands, has not been in the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Surely the problems of social welfare as applied to the Gaeltacht are some of the most difficult problems with which the Minister for the Gaeltacht will be confronted.  I think, Sir, if it had been for instance an experienced member of the Government&mdash;a member of the Government who had been, say, Minister for Local Government or who had been associated with, say, the Department of Education, who would know the <Col N="80" /> difficulties of applying an educational programme to the Gaeltacht&mdash;who had been submitted to this House, then many of the objections which are, I consider, very pertinent in this instance would, of course, be unsustainable. But that is not the position. Here we are confronted, as I have said&mdash;again I want to make it quite clear that I am not reflecting upon the ability or the capacity of Deputy Lindsay&mdash;with the fact, known to every member of this House, that Deputy Lindsay's association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While we welcome the appointment of an independent Minister for the Gaeltacht, we are not satisfied that it is necessary to appoint an additional member of the Government. After all, there may be a few Ministers who are overworked.  No one will deny, for instance, that the Minister for Finance, faced, as he has said, with the spectre of the balance of payments, must have a very anxious job; no one will deny that the Minister for Agriculture perhaps, faced with the fact that we are producing less and less agricultural produce and that the plight of our farmers is becoming worse and worse&mdash;</P>

There are Departments of State, presided over by Ministers, which could very readily be amalgamated with others. There are Departments of State whose ministerial heads are, as everybody in the country knows, mere ciphers.  If there are some Ministers who are overworked, there are other Ministers who are scarcely capable of running their own Departments, and I would suggest that some of these Ministers should resign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is quite obviously concerned with the fact that we are spending too much.  We are spending too much.  He is asking the people to spend less, to save more.  They say charity begins at home.  That precept should be put into practice first of all by those who preach it.  Therefore, in this situation I suggest that if the Government is in earnest in preaching thrift to the people the Taoiseach ought to practise it in relation to the Government's personnel. They should decide, if the team as a whole is not good enough to give them a good Minister for the Gaeltacht, to look through the existing Government Departments and see which could be amalgamated to provide a separate Minister.  They should do what is done in business.  Even in football, if your team is not good enough, you put somebody off before you take another man on.  That is what they should do here in relation to this Ministry; they should decide that one of the passengers, one of the ciphers in the Government, should be put off.  They could bring in Deputy Lindsay then if they want him, but if they do bring him in as a substitute, do not put him in charge of the Department for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are easier Departments than that in which Deputy Lindsay might try his apprentice hand, in which, so to speak, he might serve his apprenticeship. Give him one of the other Ministries, but do not give him the Ministry of the Gaeltacht.  At least, give to the people of the Gaeltacht the services of one of the more experienced administrators who are familiar with the problems with which the Minister for the Gaeltacht will have to deal.  Do not trick the people.  Do not pretend <Col N="87" /> to the people of the Gaeltacht that you are concerned about them, when you prove the opposite when you give them the most junior Minister in the Cabinet, a Minister who, as I said before, has had no real serious experience of public office.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I am not reflecting on Deputy Lindsay's ability as a lawyer or his capacity in ordinary affairs, but I say that, if for no other reason than that he is not sufficiently experienced to deal with this very important Ministry, the House should not approve of his nomination.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cur i gcoinne an cheapacháin seo.  Ní hionann san is a rá nach bhfuilim sásta go bhfuil gá leis an Aireacht a bheith curtha ar bun, ach amháin ná fuilim sásta go bhfuil an t-am tagtha fós chun eagras feidhmiúcháin a chur ar bun nó go bhfuil an polasaí deimhnithe ag an Rialtas fós i dtreo is gur féidir Aire a cur i bhfeighil na h-Aireachta seo.  Do réir mar is eol dom, níl go dtí seo ach beirt oifigeach seasamhach san Aireacht nua.  Tá beirt nó triúir eile sealadach ann agus ansan tagann an Taoiseach isteach sa Tigh agus iarrann sé orainn an ceapachán nua a dheanamh chun fuireann den mhéid agus den tsaghas sin a riaradh.</P>
      <P>My principal objection to this appointment is that at the present time there is neither the staff nor a policy of sufficient clarity to warrant the appointment of a Minister.  As far as I know&mdash;and I am fairly sure of my ground&mdash;there are only two permanent officials of the Civil Service assigned to this Department, that is a secretary and a principal officer.  There are two others who are assigned from another office in a temporary capacity and that is another office which is also charged with certain obligations towards the Gaeltacht as well as towards the congested districts.  I suggest that the necessity for appointing a Minister in charge of such a small staff charged with a task of such magnitude is asking too much of the House and of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> When this Ministry was set up by amendment of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, I suggested that it would prove to be no more than the changing of the nameplate on the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government to that of Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I was wrong, because the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government&mdash;which has changed in character&mdash;I should have said Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng&mdash;is still in existence and side by side with that office, we are asked to approve the appointment of a Minister in charge of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Government's policy in relation to the administration of such an office should be much more clearly indicated to this House.  It may be suggested that when the appointment of a Minister for Health was made by the former Fianna Fáil Government, the Minister had neither office nor staff with which to start the proposed new Ministry.  At least he had a charter; he had a Health Act on which to work.  This Minister, if he is appointed, will have no such charter; he will have no terms of reference other than to do his best for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language. He has been given a defined area, defined in so far as it can be defined as a certain few Fíor-Ghaeltacht parishes that are now in existence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I suggest that the appointment of Deputy Lindsay as Minister in charge of a Department that has at the present time four officers in it is relevant and I suggest that the House should be in a better position to assess the value of such an appointment by being told what functions of government and administration are to be assigned to that Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having had some experience of that type of work with which Deputy Lindsay as Minister for the Gaeltacht will be charged, I know that that work is of such diverse character that it <Col N="89" /> requires a fairly clear indication from the Government of what functions the Minister is to be required to discharge. In the Gaeltacht, as Deputy MacEntee has pointed out, almost every other Department of State functions through one agency or another and possibly, in the Gaeltacht, certain Departments of State function more than others.  I need only refer to the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance which operates in a special way in providing schemes for the workless in these areas.  The fisheries branch of the Department of Agriculture has certain functions there; the Department of Agriculture itself has functions in the Gaeltacht. So also has the Department of Lands and almost every Department of State that has any active or constructive work of a concrete nature to perform is engaged in one way or another in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Should we not be told in view of the proposal to make this appointment, which, if any, of these functions are to be assigned or allotted to the new Minister?  Should we not be told whether his functions are to be a continuation of the functions that were given to me as former Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Oifig na Gaeltachta and, if so, I suggest that such an office, under the circumstances, would still be sufficient usefully and effectively to carry out the type of duties that I foresee the new Minister will have to perform.  I need refer only to the half-hearted manner in which some of the schemes that were there before and some that were envisaged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can refer, I take it, to the manner in which these schemes or the administration of these schemes was formulated previously, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the manner in which I envisage it will be formulated by the new Ministry. Attached to Oifig na Gaeltachta was an inter-departmental committee, composed of officers chosen from each of the Departments to which <Col N="90" /> I have referred.  They were senior officers who knew their business in relation to the administration of affairs in the Gaeltacht.  They came together and were presided over by me as Parliamentary Secretary.  They met once in three weeks and more often twice in every three weeks.  In the period of the present Government who are almost completing their third year, that inter-departmental committee has not met more than ten times.</P>
      <P>I submit that if the new Minister could be properly equipped to acknowledge the task he has before him, he should have been in a position to have had more frequent consultations with such a departmental committee.  He should be in a position at this stage to know what, if any, of the activities of the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Agriculture, in relation to fisheries, or the Minister for Finance in relation to special employment schemes, he would be given executive functions in.</P>
      <P>At the moment I believe that the new Minister does not know what he is supposed to do, or what executive functions he will have, whether he will have any or have any money within his own power to dispose of and spend in connection with employment in the Gaeltacht areas.  I suggest that the time is not yet ripe to appoint, from the administrative and the staff structure point of view, such a Minister, and, since reference has been made to my knowledge of the Gaeltacht areas, let me say that I never presumed to have any when I took up office and I would remind Deputy Coogan that there was no intention of appointing me Minister or member of the Government in the office I held from 1951 to 1954.</P>

Tá taithí aige sin ar an Roinn Oideachais; tá taithí mhaith aige ar labhairt na Gaeilge; tá baint aige le fada leis an nGaeltacht agus tuigeann muintir na Gaeltachta é sin.  Ach níl an scéal céanna amhlaidh maidir leis an Aire úr.  Is an-olc an rud é toiseacht le hAire nach bhfuil muinín ag muintir na Gaeltachta as.  Níl rud ar bith déanta ag an Aire úr san am atá caite go bhféadfadh muintir na Gaeltachta amharc siar air is go ndéarfaidis; &ldquo;Sin fear a bhfuil obair mhaith déanta aige agus a bhfuil muinín ag muintir na Gaeltachta as.&rdquo; Ach níl mórán déanta aige sa Ghaeltacht ná in áit ar bith eile go bhféadfadh muintir na Gaeltachta amharc siar air agus a rá gurb shin gníomh atá déanta ag an Aire úr, agus gur fear fóiristineach ceart é don Aireacht úr.</P>
      <P>Chuir mé féin suim mhór sa rud adúirt an Teachta Ó Loingsigh maidir leis an mbeagán oibre a bhí déanta sa Roinn úr le blianta anuas, ón am a cuireadh ar bun í.  Níl mé ag lochtú an Aire Ua Maolchatha mar gheall air sin. Bhí, agus tá, a lámha lán aige in obair na Roinne Oideachais.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil i réim bhí an Aireacht Shláinte is Leasa Shóisialaigh i bhfeighil duine amháin. Rinne an duine amháin sin an-obair agus rinne sé mórán oibre.

      <P>Nuair a bhí an tAire nua ag cainnt sa Tigh seo ar an mBille, do thug sé mar leithscéal nach raibh an Ghaeilge go ró-líofa aige.  Do labhair sé i nGaedilge ar feadh cúpla nóiméad agus ansin d'iompuig sé ar an mBéarla.  Dúirt sé nach raibh taithí aige ar labhairt an Ghaeilge.  Anois, nílim a rá go bhfuil aon locht air ins an méid sin. D'fhéadfadh duine nach bhfuil ach beagán Gaeilge aige bheith in a Aire mhaith don Ghaeltacht agus d'fhéadfadh leis fónamh don Ghaeltacht.

Do bhí muintir na tíre a rá cúpla lá ó shoin go raibh an Rialtas ag caitheamh barraíocht airgid, go raibh barraíocht Teachtaí sa Tigh seo nuair ba leor caoga Teachtaí don tír agus go raibh barraíocht Seanadóirí ann don tír.

      <P>My observations will be few but I hope they will be pungent. In the first place, I want to make it quite clear that I consider Deputy Lindsay to be a far more competent person than three-quarters of the members of the present Government. Indeed, I am sure that will not be contested by anybody, even by those who may not share my opinion of Deputy Lindsay's abilities.  If this proposal came to the Dáil simultaneously with another proposition to get rid of three or four of the existing Ministers who, everybody knows, are incapable of discharging the functions of their offices, this would not be contested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is in order on a question of increasing the number of Ministers.  I remember when Deputy de Valera, as Taoiseach, came here in 1947 with a Bill to establish the present Ministries of Health and <Col N="94" /> Social Welfare.  I remember how the then members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party argued that these additional Ministries were unnecessary, that they represented an avoidable increase in the cost of Government, and they committed themselves to make changes which would involve a reduction in the number of Ministers.  The Fianna Fáil Government carried on the administration of this country with 12 Ministers and five Parliamentary Secretaries.  To-day, we have 13 Ministers and seven Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;and we are now going to get a fourteenth Minister to try to carry on the work of Government. It will not be contested that half a dozen of the present Government could be dropped and would not be missed.  In fact, the administration of Government would improve.</P>
      <P>Is it reasonable for the Taoiseach to come here with a proposition to increase the cost of Government by adding another Minister to the Cabinet at a time when hundreds of officials and workers are being dismissed on the plea of the need for economy?  Does every Deputy not know that in his own constituency men are losing their work because the Government has given directions that they are to be dismissed in order to save their wages?  It is in that atmosphere&mdash;an atmosphere in which the number of unemployed, because of Government policy, has increased by 30 per cent. in a few months &mdash;that the Government come here with a proposition to increase the number of Ministers by adding one to their own membership, thus putting another salary on the public pay-roll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay's appointment will, I think, improve the quality of the Government but it would be improved enormously if, simultaneous with his selection, those who have proved their incompetence, and whom every Deputy sitting behind the Taoiseach knows to be incompetent, were removed.  I want to stress a point of view which may be peculiarly my own.  I think there are too many lawyers in the Government. Did the Taoiseach consider any other appointment to this Ministry except a lawyer?  Did he think it worth while to look through his own Party or the <Col N="95" /> Parties in alliance with him to see if there was not somebody qualified for the appointment to the Department of the Gaeltacht who had some other claim than that he frequented the Fine Gael circles in the Four Courts? Is that the only road to appointment in the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to agree that, in any Government, one or two people with legal training are an asset, but the indications are that nobody can get into this Government unless he has first passed the test of some investigation in the Four Courts. Again, I want it to be quite clear that, if you have to get another lawyer in the Government, Deputy Lindsay is as good as you can get.  I believe that to be so, and perhaps I have more knowledge of Deputy Lindsay than some of my colleagues who are present now.</P>
      <P>I feel it is completely unjustifiable for the Government to go on adding to the cost of Government at the present time.  It makes all their declarations about the importance of saving and the need for economy sound like so much hypocrisy.  Do they think anybody will take them seriously when they again go on the radio to urge the need for economy and saving at a time when they themselves add to the cost of Government by their own act?  All the indications are that the Government do not mean a thing they are saying to the people.  That is the impression they have left on the public mind by their actions and words up to this. This proposition before the House to-day will reinforce the members of the public in that opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are only pretending when they profess concern about the state of the country.  They do not care how many people their policy may disemploy. Again, to-morrow, after they have passed this motion and made this appointment, they will issue more directions that will put hundreds of people out of work and they will think that the people will take them seriously <Col N="96" /> when they come to justify these dismissals on the grounds of economy.  It was possible to carry on Government up to 1954, and to do it much better than it has been done by this Government, with a much smaller number of Ministers and Parliametnary Secretaries. Why can it not be done now? The only answer is, and the Taoiseach knows it, that half a dozen of his Ministers are not worth their positions.  Not merely can he make a place for Deputy Lindsay but he can improve the whole administration of the country by getting rid of them and appointing in their stead those who are available to him, sitting behind him at this moment, to these posts and make some effort to carry on properly.  One of the curses of the Coalition Government is that the Taoiseach has no choice of selection in his Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with what has been said in regard to the addition of an extra Minister in the present Cabinet.  I am afraid I am not in agreement with the personal opinion of Deputy Lemass regarding the present man who is before this House as being more suitable than three-quarters of the Government at the moment.  The fact is that, while he may not turn out the worst, the least you can say is that he will not turn out the worst of a very bad lot.  To-day we have on all sides a reduction in the amount of expenditure and a reduction in the amount of work done throughout the country.  We have, in fact, the future being painted at the moment of very little work being done in the various Government Departments by the people now employed to do the planning and administration work in those Departments. <Col N="97" /> While that is the case, I fail to see why we should be burdened by the cost of an additional Minister, much though we may agree with the idea of a Minister given over to the sole charge of the Gaeltacht Department.  Again, I wonder whether or not Deputy Lindsay is a proper selection in this case.  There are several other Ministries in the Cabinet, if some place had to be found for him, where he would be much more acceptable and likely to do better work.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to a quotation from a speech made by Deputy Lindsay on the question of Irish, on July 7th, 1955, in this House.  In Volume 152, column 410, of the Official Reports, he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The introduction of Irish, with the intensity with which it was introduced has had a deteriorating effect on our people's knowledge of English.  I see no future for the Irish language as a spoken language unless bilingualism is going to flourish.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main theme about that particular output is that he sees no future for the Irish language as a spoken language, according to his own statements in this House only a few months ago.  If that is so, and that was his then opinion, how can any Government sponsor his appointment to-day as the Minister to look after the interests of the Gaeltacht, for without the Gaelic language it could not be called a Gaeltacht.  Is it not also true that Deputy Lindsay is not acceptable to the Gaeltacht people?  If any immediate proof of that is required, is it not true that the Gaeltacht area from which he comes himself did not see fit to select him even as a county councillor in 1951, when he stood for that area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir, but I feel that if the people of his own area did not see fit to elect him, we cannot consider him a suitable candidate to run the Gaeltacht Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what has prompted the introduction of this Deputy to control this Ministry, which can be of vital importance to the future of our Gaeltacht <Col N="98" /> areas.  Surely there are in the Party to which the Deputy belongs many people who have given quite a part of their lives to the advancement of the Gaelic language and Gaelic ideas and to easing the congestion in Gaeltacht areas.  Why is it then that those people must be passed over if we must have another Minister and another Ministry?  Why could not we have some of those people who are sitting behind the Front Bench and who are not even considered worthy to sit on the Front Bench?  To-day when we have a credit squeeze in all directions and when we should be getting a lead, how can we justify or stand over the various circulars sent to the local authorities asking us to try to put across the spirit of conserving capital and of cutting down on various unnecessary schemes in order that the finances of this country can be brought to a fairly satisfactory state?  How could we do that when at the same time we have a proposal for another Ministry, with all its attendant cost? It is outlandish to find the Government crying out for economy and, at the same time, coming before the people of this country and saying: &ldquo;We want another Ministry and we are not going to cut down on the number we already have.&rdquo;  There is quite a good reason why some of the present Ministers could be left more or less on the dole. They have very little to do and judging from what we have heard and the cuts we have seen in the public moneys for some time to come, they will have less.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to discuss other Ministries; I am trying to point out that we are already spending unnecessarily on unnecessary Ministers and on inefficient Ministers, and here we add another who, to my mind, will be very little better, and possibly worse, than what we have already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay is not an acceptable person to operate this Ministry.  He may be qualified in other directions, but there are behind the Government men who have given years of service <Col N="99" /> to the Government.  This Department is going to embrace quite a bit of the various functions of many Departments and that is why I believe it is fundamental that the man appointed to look after this Ministry should be of some experience, who will fully comprehend the workings of the various Departments. Deputy Lindsay has not got that experience and it is a question of foisting a greenhorn on this Assembly as Minister for the Gaeltacht. There is no question or doubt about it.  I can see nothing whatever to commend this motion to appoint Deputy Lindsay to this new Ministry. It is an unheard of thing and it is something we should oppose because it is not true economy, it is not giving us the best man for the job and it is not giving us any hope now or in the future that we will get value for money under this new Ministry.</P>
    <P>I also want to point out something that appeared in the Press last Sunday in the form of a letter from Deputy Lindsay.  He was referring to the Gaeltacht Areas Order and to some action which I had taken at an earlier date.  In the course of that letter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The main remark&mdash;if I were pushed I could go a little bit further back to some of the ideas and public pronouncements on Irish we have been given by Deputy Lindsay, the Parliamentary Secretary, but I will not go further back&mdash;the main remark, the one that really counts and that is of importance, is that recorded in this House and spoken by him 15 months ago.  We are appointing as Minister for the Gaeltacht a man who said in this House in a debate that he sees no future in the Irish language as a spoken language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for Education agree with those sentiments? <Col N="102" /> Does the Minister and the Government agree that a person with such views is the proper person to be in charge of the new Gaeltacht Ministry; that Deputy Lindsay will foster Irish and look after the interests of the residents of that area?  I say such a person is not suitable.  In addition, there are people behind the present Government, sitting in the benches there, who are more suitable.  We fail to see why some one of those people should not have been appointed and Deputy Lindsay moved into some other Department.  There are various Departments where he could carry on work which is not being carried on too well at the moment.</P>
      <P>Last, but by no means least, is the fact that we are going to spend additional money at the very headquarters, at the very fountain-head of our whole national resources and economy, that we are going to spend that money on a new Ministry with all its attendant costs, while, at the same time, due to the reduction of public expenditure on necessary work, we are chasing hundreds of people out of this country and putting more people on the dole at the same time.  I think it is a disgrace, and I believe the people of this country think it is a disgrace also.</P>

      <P>Tá iarrtha sa tairiscint seo glacadh le hAire nua. Tá sé réasúnta ar an taobh seo den Teach an cheist do phlé: céard iad na dualgais a comhlíonfar.  Cuireadh ceisteanna le dhá bhlian go leith anuas ar an Aire Oideachais, go speisialta, faoi bhunú na hAireachta seo.  Dúirt sé i bhfreagra a thug sé orm féin sa Teach seo go mb'éigin dóibh dian-smaoineadh a dhéanamh ar an gceist seo sul a bhféadfaí fiú amháin an Aireacht a chur ar bun.  Bhí an Rialtas beagnach dhá bhliain in oifig nuair a thug sé an freagra sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Aireacht á cur ar bun, cuireadh ceist ar an Aire a bhí i bhfeighil an Bhille&mdash;an tAire Oideachais &mdash;agus dúirt sé gurab shin é díreach an fáth go raibh an Aireacht dá cur ar bun, le go bhfaighfí amach céard iad na dualgais a bheadh le comhlíonadh ag an Aireacht.  B'fhéidir go raibh réasún éigin leis sin.  B'fhearr liom go mbeadh <Col N="103" /> an capall curtha roimh an charr ná go mbeadh an capall i bhfad taobh thiar den charr agus is cosúil go bhfuil an capall i bhfad taobh thiar den charr i gcónúí, mar anois, agus sé mhí eile curtha dinn, níl aoinne i ndon insint dúinn céard iad na dualgais atá le comhlíonadh.  Ina leaba sin, tá mí-chúirtéis caite leis an Dáil ag an Rialtas, go mór mhór ag an Aire Oideachais. Chuir mé féin ceist air cúpla babhta sa Teach seo agus luaigh mé seirbhísí faoi leith, ar nós Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta, deontas na Gaeilge do na páistí scoile, agus mar sin de, agus ní raibh sé i ndon a rá an dtiocfaidis faoi scáth na hAireachta.</P>
    <P>Feicim anois ar Riar na hOibre inniu go bhfuil ceist ann a bhaineas le Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta, d'Aire na Gaeltachta, agus is dóigh go bhfuil an rannóg sin faoina scáth i ngan fhios dúinn.  Tá fhios agam nuair a bhíonn orduithe déanta ag an Rialtas go bhfógraítear ar Pháipéir na Dála iad agus is féidir le Teachta Dála dul síos go dtí an leabharlann agus breathnú orthu.  Cheapas go mbeadh an tAire Oideachais agus Aire na Gaeltachta, mar a bhí ann go dtí inniu, cúirtéiseach leis an Dáil agus go gcuirfeadh sé chuig na Teachtaí, i gcóir na díospóireachta seo, cuile ordú atá, déanta aige a bhaineas le bunú Aireacht na Gaeltachta.  Níl fhios agam an inseoidh an tAire inniu cé mhéid orduithe atá déanta aige.</P>
    <P>Bhí díospóireacht ar nuachtán idir an Teachta Ó Bléine agus an Teachta Mac Loingsigh faoi Ordú Límistéirí na Gaeltachta.  Bhfuil aon ordú eile ann? Má, tá, tuige nár cuireadh cóip de chuig gach Teachta ós rud é go raibh an tairiscint seo le teacht ós comhair na Dála inniu?</P>

      <P>Ceist agam ort faoi sin&mdash;tá iarrtha ar an Dáil sa tairiscint seo Aire nua a cheapadh <Col N="104" /> agus níor cuireadh in iúl dúinn&mdash;ach ar nós cuma-liom&mdash;gurab é Aire na Gaeltachta a bhí i gceist.  Is cuma maidir leis an bpointe sin; ach nach bhfuil sé réasúnta ceist a chur ar an Rialtas nuair atá iarrtha aca ar an Dáil Aire nua a cheapadh, ceist a chur orthu céard iad na dualgais a bheas ar an Aire, céard é an obair a dhéanfaidh an tAire sin.  Sin í mo cheist ortsa, nó an féidir leis an Aire í fhreagairt?</P>
      <P>Mar dúirt mé, tá an Rialtas ag útamáil leis an gceist seo le dhá bhliain go leith.

Má bhí an phlean chomh fada sin chun cinn dhá bhliain ó shin, nach gceapfadh aoinne go bhféadfadh aon duine a bhfuil baint aige leis an Rialtas eolas a thabhairt dúinn i gceann dhá bhlian go leith céard iad na dualgais a bheas le comhlíonadh ag an Aire.  Níl ach an t-aon rud amháin ceaptha fós, go bhfios dómhsa, is é sin, na ceantracha a háireofar a bheith sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht feasta ach, ar ndóigh, bhí an t-eolas sin againn le fada an lá, muna raibh foirmiúlacht oifigiúil ag baint leis féin.  Bhí an t-eolas sin bainte amach ag eagrais eile.  Bhí an obair sin déanta in aisce ag daoine taobh amuigh, agus níor ghá d'aoinne fiu lá amháin a chaitheamh chun na ceantracha sin a phiocadh amach. Bhí an t-eolas sin faighte amach cheana.  Tá mí-chúirtéis caite ag an Aire Oideachais leis an Dáil, gan aon tuairisc faoi dualgais na h-Aireachta a thabhairt di.</P>

Bhí díomá orainn nuair a chualamar nach raibh Aire faoí leith á cheapadh le haghaidh na Gaeltachta agus bhí mé ag cur síos ar an bhfáth go raibh an díomá sin orainn.  Tugadh le tuiscint dúinn go raibh pleananna agus córas oibre ag an Rialtas leis an nGaeltacht a shábháil agus a chur chun cinn seachas mar bhí ag Fianna Fáil agus má bhí pleananna chomh maith sin acu b'fhacthas dúinn gur mór an trua dá gcuirfí aon bhac ar na pleananna sin cheal Aireachta agus Aire.

      <P>Sé an chéad fháth, go ndearna an córas leasa shóisialaigh níos mó tairbhe don Ghaeltacht ná aon cheo eile atá déanta. An gceapann an tAire Rialtais Aitiúil go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht chomh fairsing is atá sé anois marach an córas leasa shóisialaigh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní cheapaim gur cheart do dhuine ar bith sa tír seo a bhfuil baint údarásach <Col N="108" /> aige leis an nGaeilge nó le athbheochaint na Gaeilge a rá gur polasaí dhá-theangach a bheas ag an Roinn nua seo.  Deirtear gur tús maith leath na hoibre, ach is tús thar a bheith dona é seo.  Ba cheart go ndéanfadh an tAire ceartú ar an bpoinnte seo chomh luath agus is féidir sa chaoi nach mbeidh aon dalladh mullóg ar intinn na ndaoine sa nGaeltacht.  Tá an dubhshraith leagtha cheana féin ag an bhfear a bhí mar Aire ar an Roinn nua seo agus atá mar Aire ar an Roinn Oideachais.  Nár dhúirt sé nach mbeadh aon bhaint aige leis na daoine i gContae an Chláir ós rud é nach raibh an teanga acu, gurb í an Ghaeilge céad dualgas an Aire nua?</P>
    <P>Más é a mhalairt de scéal atá anois aige, cén fáth a ndearna sé an tagairt sin do mhuintir an Chláir?  Más í an Ghaeilge an príomh-chúram atá ag an Roinn nua seo, nach ait an rud a rá gur beartas dhá-theangach a bheas ag an Roinn?  Ba cheart go mbeadh súil againn go mbeadh an Ghaeilge, mar phríomh-theanga againn sa tír seo i gceann tamaill, agus muna bhfuil an dearcadh sin ag an Roinn nua seo ní dhéanfaidh sé mórán maitheasa don Ghaeilge.  Sin é tuairim formhór na ndaoine sa tír seo, na daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a bhfuil spéis acu sa teangain.  Tá súil láidir acu go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar phríomh-theanga sa tír seo agus go mbeidh an Béarla ina dara teanga.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go leanfadh an Rialtas seo leis an obair a thosnuigh Rialtas Fianna Fáil roimhe seo.  Cé'n chaoi ar féidir leis an Rialtas an dá intinn seo a réiteach lena chéile&mdash;gurb í an Ghaeilge an príomh-dhualgas ar taobh amháin, agus, ar an taobh eile, a rá go mbeidh an Béarla ar aondul leis an nGaeilge?  Aon duine údarásach a deireann é sin, agus a dhéanann iarracht an dá intinn sin a réiteach, níl sé feiliúnach don obair seo, fiú amháin más é an tAire Oideachais é féin a deireann é.</P>
    <P>Tá díomá mór orainn nach bhfuil tuar le feiscint de na pleananna nó den chóras mór a bhí ag an Aire Oideachais chun an Ghaeltacht a <Col N="109" /> shábháil.  Sé a mhalairt de scéal atá againn, ón am a tháinig an Rialtas seo isteach.  Tar éis dhá bhliain go leith ba cheart go mbeadh sé ar chumas an Aire Oideachais a rá linn cén beartas nó cén córas oibre atá leagtha amach aige.  Faraor, níl an t-eolas sin le fáil.  Tá fhios againn cé na ceanntair a thagas isteach faoin Roinn nua seo.  Ach bhí an t-eolas sin againn cheana féin, nó bhí sé ag aoinne a raibh suim dá laghad aige sa gceist seo. Níl an Rialtas seo ach ag útamáil leis an scéal ó tháinig siad isteach. Dá mbeadh aon bheart acu chun obair a dhéanamh ní bheadh aon údar cleamhsáin agamsa anseo anocht. Ba cheart go gcuirfeadh an Rialtas in iúl do na Teachtaí, go mór-mhór do na Teachtaí a bhfuil baint acu leis an nGaeltacht, céard tá beartaithe.</P>

      <P>Cuirim-se i gcoinne na tairiscinte seo freisin toisc go gcuireann sí le costas an Rialtais mar is tairiscint í nach bhfuil riachtanach.  Maidir leis an bhfear atá ceapaithe, tá fadhbh eile le réiteach ansin.  Is duine mise a raibh dlúth-bhaint aige leis an nGaeilge, a bhfuil dlúth-bhaint fós agam léi agus ag a mbeidh go rachaidh mé i gcré.  Tá aithne agam ar na daoine a bhfuil dlúth-bhaint acu le hobair na Gaeltachta, ní hé amháin in mo cheantar féin ach ar fud na tíre.  Tá aithne agam ar na daoine ar fud na tíre atá ag obair go dícheallach, dúthrachtach in athbheocaint na teangan.  Ach níor chuala mé riamh go raibh dlúth-bhaint ag an bhfear atá ainmnithe anseo inniu leis an nGaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sé an príomh rud atá riachtanach don duine a ceapfar mar Aire ar an Roinn seo go mbeadh cruinn-eolas aige ar an nGaeltacht agus ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Táim in amhras go bhfuil <Col N="110" /> na tréithe riachtanacha ag an bhfear atá in aigne an Taoisigh a cheapadh don phost seo.  Tá caint i dtaobh na hAireachta seo a chur ar bun le blianta beaga anuas.  Nuair a tháinig tairiscint an Rialtais os cóir na Dála chun an Aireacht seo a bhunú, cé go rabhamar in amhras faoin scéal, d'aontaíomar leis ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an tír.  Ach fé mar adúirt an Teachta Mac Pharthaláin, do thóg sé an-fhada ar an Rialtas a aigne a dhíriú ar an gceist, agus tá tuairim láidir agam nach bhfuil tuairim dá laghad acu i dtaobh plean, scéim nó eagraíocht chun an obair a bheadh le déanamh a dhéanamh i gceart.</P>
    <P>Is í an Aireacht seo ceann de na hAireachtaí is tábhachtaí sa Rialtas, dar liomsa, mar gheall ar chomh dian is a bheas an obair agus a thábhachtaí atá sé aon obair fhónta a dhéanamh nó aon scéim fhónta a chur ag obair maidir le leas na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ar an gcead dul síos, tá ceist na Gaeilge féin tábhachtach.  Mura bhfuil beartaithe ag an Rialtas go mbeidh an Roinn seo Gaelach ó bhun go barr; muna bhfuil beartaithe ag an Rialtas gnó na Roinne a dhéanamh ar fad i nGaeilge, agus muna bhfuil beartaithe acu an Ghaeilge d'úsáid leis an bpobal ar an taobh amuigh, beidh thiar air agus ar an Aireacht.</P>
    <P>Tugaidís an deá-shampla maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge agus caithfidh an Aireacht an deá-shampla sin a thabhairt. Ón gcruthú atá againn mar gheall ar an bhfear atá ainmnithe don phost, níl mé sásta go bhfuil sé, mar dhuine, ábalta ar an obair a dhéanamh mar ba cheart í a dhéanamh.  Sin é mo thuairim agus tuairim a lán daoine eile.</P>
    <P>Dob fhéidir leis an Taoiseach an Aireacht seo a chur faoi chúram duine eile a bhfuil níos mó eolais agus taithi aige ar an nGaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge. Cad'na thaobh ná tabharfaí é don Teachta Ua Maolchatha, an tAire Oideachais?  Admhaím go mbeadh sé deacair fear oiriúnach eile d'fháil chun é chur sa Roinn Oideachais ina ionad. Admhaím, leis, gurab é cúram an Taoisigh, maidir le ceist den tsaghas seo, duine a ainimniú mar Aire do <Col N="111" /> réir an Bhunreachta agus níl sé ach ag cur leis an dualgas sin.</P>
    <P>Ach tá scéal eile ann.  An bhfuil an duine atá ceaptha oiriúnach don phost? Dála an scéil, níor ghá Aire nua sa mbreis a cheapadh in aon chor ag féachaint don méid cainte a chualamar ó bhaill an Rialtais mar gheall ar a thábhachtaí is atá sé airgead a shábháil. Féachann sé aisteach ar fad go dtiocfadh an Taoiseach isteach sa Dáil ag iarraidh cur leis an gcostas atá cheana ar an tír mar gheall ar an Rialtas do choimeád ar siúl.  Admhaím nach bhfuil ann ach mion-rud i gcomórtas leis na milliúin púnt eile a caitear.  San am chéanna, áfach, do bheadh an deá-shampla dhá thabhairt dá gceapfadh an Taoiseach gléas eile agus an post atá le líonadh a líonadh le duine de na hAiri atá ann cheana féin.  Ba chuma liom-sa cé ceapfaí, cé acu dlíodóir, múinteoir, feírmeoir, nó gabha a bheadh ann dá mbeinn cinnte go mbeadh na tréithe oiriúnacha aige atá riachtanach le haghaidh an phoist.</P>
    <P>Táimid go léir sa Teach seo ar aon-aigne nó in ainm a bheith ar aon aigne, mar gheall ar chomh tábhachtach is atá sé an Ghaeilge d'aithbheochaint. Níl mise sásta leis na tuairimí mar gheall ar an nGaeilge atá nochtaithe ag an duine a hainmníodh. Níl mé sásta go bhfuil sé dáiríre agus dúthrachtach maidir le haithbheochaint na Gaeilge.  Dá bhrí sin, ní dóigh liom&mdash;is oth liom go bhfuil sé orm é seo a rá, ach is fearr tuairim a nochtadh do réir má tá sé in aigne dhuine&mdash;go bhfuil an fear a hainmníodh oiriúnach. Támuid ag cur i gcoinne na tairiscinte seo atá curtha os cóir na Dála inniu ag an Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The mentality and outlook displayed by this Government in connection with this appointment can best be summed up in that old saying: &ldquo;Do not do as I do, but do as I tell you.&rdquo;  Several speakers have already pointed out that this Government has lost no time and left no avenue unexplored in trying to bring home to the public both the desirability and the absolute necessity for that same public saving at all costs. Deputies and the public are aware <Col N="112" /> that vast sums of money are being expended in publicity drives in our daily papers, and elsewhere, in order to bring home to the people how serious the financial situation is as far as the Government is concerned.  We even have the picture painted and the description given of young children down the country saving their pennies and tuppences as a result of this nation-wide appeal by the Government to save.</P>
      <P>Yet, the very first day the Dáil reassembles, the very first measure that comes before the House for decision is one which will increase expenditure so far as the Government is concerned.  If any justification can be made that this expenditure would in fact prove of benefit to this mythical place known as the Gaeltacht, then I would be the last to criticise the motion before the House for the appointment of Deputy Lindsay as Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I want to be quite clear on this.  I want to be quite fair to Deputy Lindsay.  What I have to offer here is not offered in personal criticism of him.  As far as Deputy Lindsay is concerned, I have no objection whatever to his appointment to any office.  But I am opposed to the principle of this appointment for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to it because I think it is unrealistic at the present time to take steps that should have been taken 30 years ago.  Even if such steps had been taken 30 years ago it is doubtful if they would have proved successful at that particular period. To envisage at this stage taking action that might have had some hope of success 30 years ago&mdash;and that is open to doubt&mdash;is an unrealistic approach, and it is unfair both to the people of the Gaeltacht and to the nation as a whole.  This is a matter of perpetuating a type of &ldquo;Cloud Cuckoo Land&rdquo; so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.</P>

I have pointed out quite clearly that I have no personal feeling whatever against Deputy Lindsay. Surely, it is not suggested that the only thing that can be discussed is the suitability, or otherwise, of Deputy Lindsay for appointment.  I have made it quite clear that I have no objection to the particular man himself for appointment but, as far as I am concerned, <Col N="116" /> irrespective of what name came before the House in connection with this appointment to-day, I would oppose it on certain grounds; and, with the permission of the Chair, I have been trying to give those grounds to the best of my ability within the scope allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern with this motion is mainly on the grounds that it proposes to extend the present Ministry.  My objection to that, at the present time, is because of the circumstances in which we exist at the moment.  If any confirmation in regard to the seriousness of the situation which confronts our people to-day is required it can be found by reference to the statements broadcast by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.  I think the very fact that the Taoiseach deemed it desirable to have recourse to the broadcasting system in order to convey his views to the whole nation is sufficient justification for my objection to an extension of the Ministry which necessarily means additional expense to be incurred by the nation and to be paid for by the people of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is sufficient justification for the attitude which members on this side of the House are taking up with regard to this appointment.  Numerous Deputies have spoken and have already made it clear that their objection is not to the appointment of a Minister to deal with the affairs of the Gaeltacht but, in the main, to the extension of the Ministry.  I have no doubt that the Gaeltacht would benefit to a very great extent if a Minister could give his whole time to that difficult <Col N="117" /> question but what we must consider is that the setting up of an additional Ministry means, of necessity, the setting up of another Department of State.  While Deputy Jack Lynch referred to the fact that there was in his time, at any rate, a very limited staff, I have no doubt that that limited staff would be very considerably augmented by any Minister taking up a post of that kind who intended to deal with its problems in a serious manner.</P>
    <P>I have nothing whatever to say to the individual whom it is proposed to appoint.  As far as the motion is concerned, it merely proposes that Deputy Lindsay be appointed a member of the Government.  We must presume that he is being appointed to the new Ministry. Whether he is competent to deal with that particular situation I am not in a position to say, but in view of the statement which the Taoiseach made over the radio and in view of the fact that his statement was supported by the Tánaiste, the next in rank to the Taoiseach, and that it was further supported by the Minister for Finance, I think there is sufficient evidence that a situation of a serious kind exists here.</P>
    <P>What I want to point out is the difficulty of the man and woman in the street in accepting these statements in view of the example which they have been given here to-day through this motion.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance stressed in full measure the necessity for economies, the necessity for the ordinary man and woman to forgo personal luxuries in order that the State might recover its former position and in order to relieve the situation to which they referred.  What are the people to say when confronted with an example of this kind?  It can only be regarded as a contradiction of what has been said over the radio.  It is an astonishing situation.  The temerity of the Taoiseach in coming to this House to propose an additional Ministry, to increase the present Ministry from 13 to 14 is fantastic, and I think the general public will regard it as such.</P>
    <P>I could understand it if the Ministry that is now proposed resulted from the <Col N="118" /> telescoping of one or two other Ministries. We could then say that the Government were making some effort, not to increase or to add to the expenditure which exists at present, but to go about it in the manner in which they have done is, to my mind, bordering on the audacious.  That is the only description I can give it.  I feel sure the public would understand the establishment of an additional Ministry if that additional Ministry were set up to deal with unemployment and emigration, the twin scourges of this nation at the moment.  These are scourges which are being accentuated by the fact that the present Government do not seem capable of dealing with the situation either in regard to unemployment or emigration.  If they are capable of dealing with these problems there is no evidence to that effect.</P>
    <P>I feel the Taoiseach would be very well advised, before concluding this matter, to read up Volume 103 of the Dáil Debates, where he will find all the solutions to the difficulties which he is facing at the present moment. These solutions came from his own colleagues who were then in opposition. I would strongly recommend the Taoiseach to give serious consideration to these matters before the conclusion of this debate and the recommendation to the President of the appointment of this additional Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that, by this motion, this Government has lost all contact with the people of this country and the position that exists in it at the moment.  One would be glad to see some further and better steps taken to deal with the Gaeltacht than has hitherto been the case, but I am not at all sure that the appointment of a separate Minister will do that. Apparently the Government consider that the appointment of a separate Minister will do such work, but, nevertheless, surely it would be possible to amalgamate some other two Ministries, as was done under the Fianna Fáil régime, and carry on with the present number of Ministers in the times that exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One recalls all we heard about this Government's intention to reduce expenditure <Col N="119" /> and to give us a better time.  One recalls the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement and his later statement on the levies and his declarations about the position of this country and of the necessity for everybody to economise and save. When one reads our weekly return on unemployment and observes the figures rising by 1,000 a week, and when one finds that whole families are emigrating owing to the times that exist, then surely it must be agreed that this is not an opportune moment to add a further Ministry to the Government and to bring the number of Ministers up to a total of 14 as against 12 Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
    <P>The people who now propose to appoint a new Minister were the very people who, in 1946, took a very strong line against increasing the number of Ministers at that time when it became necessary to do so, owing to the growth of social services.  The late Deputy Dr. O'Higgins had this to say, as reported in Volume 103, column 1146:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Taxation, expenditure, pomp, ceremony and extravagance have reached such a point here that the worms are beginning to turn and that it is not just a case of &lsquo;Ask and you shall receive&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently, considering the times that are in it to-day as compared with 1946, we could add that that does not apply to Deputy Lindsay.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Lands, then Deputy Blowick, is reported at column 1190 of the same volume as saying: &ldquo;We seem to be merely creating jobs.&rdquo; I wonder what he thinks to-day, as a member of this Government, about establishing a further Ministry that could be done without at the moment, at the same time carrying on the work of the Gaeltacht.  It seems to me that it must take a real hard neck to propose such a thing in present circumstances. Moving around Dublin City, meeting the people and meeting the shopkeepers, one hears nothing but complaints about the times that are in it and of how hard it is to meet one's obligations.  There is almost a spirit of despair amongst some of them <Col N="120" /> and yet this is the time that is chosen to bring in a measure such as this. I should certainly like to see improved work done in the Gaeltacht, but I do not think a further Minister is necessary and I feel it is outrageous to bring in a motion now such as the one before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow all the so-called arguments that have been put forward in this House to-day to justify the opposition to this proposed appointment.  In my opinion, the entire of the Opposition speeches was nothing but political play-acting. Those who have spoken against this proposal have spoken with different voices.  We were told by a number of speakers that they are entirely in favour of the appointment of a Minister, but not this Minister, and we were told by a number of others that there is no necessity for the appointment of a Minister at all.  The last speaker, Deputy Colley, delivered himself of the profound utterance that there is no necessity to have this Ministry at all at the moment and that the Gaeltacht business could be carried on without it.  Again, we find Deputies on the Opposition benches saying that the Deputy proposed to be appointed to this Ministry is supremely competent while others say he is not.</P>
      <P>I would remind Deputies that the Bill setting up this Ministry was passed unanimously in this House and became law as recently as the 30th May last.  You would think by the talk about economy that the Deputies opposite were so concerned with economy that they would never have been parties to the passing of this Bill at all.  This Bill was passed and became law on the 30th May&mdash;at a time when there were serious financial and economic difficulties in the country.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the opposition to this motion will be regarded simply as political play-acting and hypocrisy on the part of the Opposition.  It would appear from the debates which took place on the Bill to establish the Department of the Gaeltacht that all were in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> The establishment of the Ministry was proceeded with because it was part of the policy on which this Government was formed.  What do I find on July 26th of this year in the debate on my Estimate?  Far from the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, urging economy on me and my colleagues, he was reproaching this Government for the delay in setting up this Ministry and reproaching us for having only a Parliamentary Secretary and not a full-time Minister.  He pointed out the responsibility which would be given to the Minister for Education in the holding of the two posts and he felt that any one of these posts would be sufficient to occupy the full-time energies of any individual.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera, who now weeps over this proposal and says he is not in favour of it, said on July 26th in Volume 159, column 1907 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After a couple of years of waiting, we have got it set up and we hope, now it has been set up, that it will get to work rapidly and that we will not have another two years spent in some other organising of machinery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was not complaining of setting it up then.  He was complaining that the Minister for Education who was going to take on responsibility for both Ministries would be overburdened with work.  He is overburdened, I agree.  That is one of the reasons why I am asking the House to approve of this motion.</P>
      <P>He reproved me for having made temporary arrangements.  After I objected to the suggestion that everything was being done as a temporary arrangement, stating that it was not so&mdash;in the same volume and column&mdash; this is what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Two years of it and all we get is a Parliamentary Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was complaining that all we had was a Parliamentary Secretary and to-day he comes in and weeps about <Col N="122" /> overburdening the people.  It was the day after the announcement that the special levies on imports had been increased.  He knew then the serious situation that existed.</P>

      <P>He was in favour of this Bill in April or May and on July 26th, when the levies were increased, he was complaining that all he was getting was a Parliamentary Secretary, and now Deputies have the impudence to pretend that they are in favour of a new Minister but not the expense. Deputy de Valera and some others said they wanted a whole-time Minister and said the Department would be sufficient to occupy the full-time energies of any one Minister.  That is what we say.  I do not intend to descend to the depths of alleged argument to which Deputy MacEntee descended, as usual, nor the depths to which Deputy Lemass descended.  Their arguments were entirely unworthy of occuping the time of this House.  Deputy de Valera and some of the others said that they wanted this Ministry.  Deputy de Valera in July complained that he only got a Parliamentary Secretary.  He did not make any suggestion, as I understood him, as to how we could have a whole-time Ministry and at the same time not have one.  The only inference I can find is that you double up some of the Ministers.</P>

      <P>It is not as easy to pick a Minister for the Gaeltacht as you might think.  It requires a man of particular talents and particular knowledge. It is hypocrisy for Deputies to say that they want a full-time Minister and at the same time are not in favour of the expense involved.  It is sheer political play-acting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Lynch complaining, in the midst of the chorus, that there was not enough staff.  That is more hypocrisy coming from the Opposition Benches.  He comes and says that there is not enough staff and that that is one of the reasons he is against appointing a Minister.  He said there were only four people in the office and <Col N="123" /> he was against the appointment of the Minister.  It was with deliberate intention that a small staff was put in. It was the deliberate intention that this Ministry should cost as little as possible and should not involve any avoidable expense on the people.  We took existing civil servants, fully competent, and put them in; we took only two, and they have proved to be extremely competent.  Two others were appointed recently.  The Minister then in charge of the Department, with the assistance of the Parliamentary Secretary, was going cautiously under my direction.  They were spending as little as possible.  My direction to them was to have no files in that office. We wanted as little Civil Service procedure as possible.  Another Deputy says there is going to be too much staff.  The case being made here, as I said, is nothing but sheer hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies pretended they thought Deputy Lindsay was eminently suitable.  Some thought he was suitable in other spheres but not in this. Deputy Lindsay comes from the Mayo Gaeltacht.  He was born in the Mayo Gaeltacht, brought up there, and educated in a national school there. He went to a secondary school and to a university, the Gaeltacht University <Col N="124" />&mdash;if I may call it that&mdash;University College, Galway, and he had a distinguished career in classics.  He obtained an honours degree in Classics, a Master of Arts degree on a thesis in the Irish language and an examination, at the same time, through the medium of Irish, in Ancient Classics.  He has been able to carry on his duties as Parliamentary Secretary in conjunction with General Mulcahy, during the summer and autumn entirely through the medium of the Irish language.  He is an Irish scholar in the best sense and a man supremely qualified for the post for which such qualifications are so urgently required.</P>

    <Title>National Loan, 1956. - Animal Remedies Bill, 1956&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to put an end to the widespread and persistent abuses in connection with the sale of certain alleged animal remedies which have very little or no value, and to encourage instead the use of animal remedies which have a real scientific value.  Many useless remedies are still finding a ready sale throughout the country and farmers are induced to buy them by means of high power salesmanship, for example, extravagant claims made in Press advertisements and by travelling salesmen.  Of the many examples which have come under the Department's notice, the following may be mentioned: A product sold at 3/- er small bottle purported to be a remedy for hoose in calves.  It was found to consist of commercial turpentine. A preparation described as &ldquo;Cod Liver Oil Tonic Compound&rdquo; consisted of 22 per cent. cod liver oil, 3 per cent. iron oxide and 75 per cent spring water. This was sold at 37/6 per gallon while the price of undiluted cod liver oil was then 15/6 per gallon.  Another product was sold at 2/9 per small bottle and was suggested as a cure for abortion and sterility in cattle.  No &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for these conditions is known to veterinary science.  The product was found to be almost entirely spring water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such practices do great harm in more ways than one.  Farmers who buy such preparations are not only cheated but <Col N="127" /> they may be lulled into a false sense of security as regards the cure or prevention of disease, sometimes disease of a transmissible nature.  While many of the disease conditions concerned will successfully respond to veterinary treatment if taken in time, the farmer who uses a spurious remedy under the persuasion of an eloquent salesman runs the risk that, in the absence of proper and early treatment, his animal will be beyond veterinary aid by the time he realises that the alleged remedy is useless.  This must tend to impair the confidence of farmers in veterinary treatment as well as in the alleged remedies.</P>
    <P>My Department has by means of Press and radio announcements repeatedly pointed out that the claims made for many alleged animal remedies were not justified and advised farmers to be very careful about what they purchased and used. Similar advice has been given direct to farmers by the outdoor staff of the Department.  Unfortunately, however, many farmers continue to be fascinated by the attractive promises made by the sellers of such preparations.</P>
    <P>It is a strange paradox that quack remedies should continue to be used on quite a large scale when, as a result of modern veterinary research, farmers have now available to them to an extent never before known, a wide range of economical and proven remedies, which, under veterinary guidance, can be used very effectively in the treatment of many of the major live-stock diseases present in this country.  For example, strain 19 vaccine is a sure preventive of contagious abortion and the Department, in collaboration with the veterinary profession, makes it possible for farmers to have their cows and heifers vaccinated professionally at specially reduced fees.  The Department's veterinary scientists have shown in recent experiments that white scour in calves can be effectively controlled by the proper use of antibiotics.  Then there are those excellent preparations, hexachloroethane and phenothiazine which are so successful in the treatment of fluke and stomach worms respectively. Such remedies, however, are in <Col N="128" /> general not yet used on a sufficiently widespread scale, and yet a considerable number of calves&mdash;though nothing like as many as previously&mdash;are lost every year through diseases with a consequent depressing effect on production.</P>
    <P>The existing law does not in practice enable effective measures to be taken to deal with the abuses that exist in connection with the sale of quack remedies and the present Bill has been drafted accordingly.  The Bill envisages two types of control measures. The first of these, set out in Section 5, requires in the case of every commercial animal remedy that the name of the remedy, its composition, the specific remedial property or properties claimed and the name and address of the manufacturer and the packer be disclosed on the container and on any outer wrapper and that advertisements about the remedy should contain the same information. The disclosure of additional particulars may be required by regulations made after consultation with the consultative committee provided for in Section 4.</P>
    <P>The second type of control provided for under Section 7 empowers the Minister, after consultation with the consultative committee, to make regulations for the control, including control by licence, of the manufacture, preparation, packing, import or sale of animal remedies.  It is intended that this latter provision would be implemented, on the advice of the consultative committee, should Section 5 alone be found in practice not to be a complete deterrent to present abuses. It is believed, however, that the obligatory disclosure of the composition, etc., of animal remelies should go a long way towards putting an end to the sale of quack products because farmers will know exactly what is being offered for the prices charged and sellers of such products who contravene the provisions of the Bill will be liable to proceedings.  At the same time it should be understood that Section 7 will undoubtedly be put into operation if the Minister, in consultation with the consultative committee, at any time considers that this is necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> The consultative committee under Section 4 has a parallel in the similar committee which functions under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932.  It will consist of experienced persons who will be in a position to advise the Minister in the making of regulations. It is intended that the committee will include representatives of the Veterinary Council, the Pharmaceutical Society, the Department of Health and the farmers.</P>
    <P>Discussions in regard to the proposed legislation have taken place with professional and trade interests concerned and in framing the Bill regard has been had as far as practicable to their views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say that every Minister for Agriculture has been looking forward to bringing in a Bill of this kind and I am very glad that at last the Bill has been produced. There is no doubt that it is absolutely necessary.  The only thing I am not clear about is how far this Bill can go. It is not easy for a layman to understand legal language to a fine point.  I quite agree that in many cases Section 5 would probably be sufficient. Take, for instance, the examples quoted by the Minister: if it were written on the container that this medicine or remedy contained, let us say, 27 per cent. of cod liver oil and the rest water, nobody would buy it at the price mentioned.  However, it may be a bit better than that, but yet not good enough, especially if it contains two, three or four ingredients that the ordinary farmer may not know very much about.  Take some of those medical preparations which the farmer would not know much about.  He might have an idea that it was a good remedy and be inclined to believe what was claimed for it as a remedy, but he might be paying too much for it.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if, under this Bill, the Minister can object to the price charged and I think that is a very important matter.  He could, of course, in this Bill, say: &ldquo;I will not give you a licence because you are charging too much,&rdquo; and in that way the person has to come down to a reasonable price or not get a licence at all.  In any event, I think the price is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> As regards patent medicines generally, it is obvious they are not good value.  Although I have not been in medical practice for many years, my name is on the medical register and I am not exaggerating when I say that every morning I get an average of four or five fairly large envelopes packed with literature and sometimes with a number of samples.  There must be about 40,000 medical practitioners in Ireland and Great Britain.  They all get this literature and if you do the necessary multiplication of the amount of literature that is sent out by the manufacturers of patent medicines for the human being, you will find that the cost of this advertising is enormous and, after all, that comes out of the price the person pays.  In this case, of course, the remedy which they are suggesting for any human disease must be fairly attractive because this literature comes not to the layman but to doctors, and a doctor will have a fair idea whether the thing is good value or not.  Nevertheless, that huge amount of money is spent on advertising.</P>
    <P>I have no idea in the case of animal remedies what the cost of advertising them would amount to, but when we look at the provincial and daily papers, we see a good deal of advertising every week or every day.  That is why I should like to be assured by the Minister that if the remedy is fairly good, a good remedy for the disease for which it is claimed, we should also have some control over the price and see that is is not issued at an unreasonable price to the farmer.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the remedy may include anything.  I should like to know does it include, for instance, such things as condition powder?  Sometimes you see nuts advertised, which, if fed to the animal, are supposed to give the necessary bloom and so forth. Whether all these things are or are not covered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The points I have in mind can perhaps be better discussed on the Committee Stage, but I mention them now so that the Minister will be able to give us some information when he is winding up.  The principal points are whether he is taking enough power and whether the remedy is good value for the money charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I could legitimately comment on the observations of Deputy Dr. Ryan and compare them with the less generous observations of his Leader earlier in the afternoon. I value Deputy Dr. Ryan's advice on this.  I have an instinctive reluctance unnecessarily to push people around.  I think it is a good thing, if an abuse manifests itself, to take measures to suppress the abuse, but not to avail of the opportunity to take powers to harass unnecessarily all and sundry.  I think the average farmer, if he gets full information on the packing of what in fact he is buying, ought to be left to himself to judge whether or not he is getting value for his money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan mentioned, by way of comparison, the experience of physicians and doctors who receive hundreds of samples.  We all know that a thing like Kruschen's salts may in fact be only glauber substantially and that, if a person went out and bought tuppence worth of glauber salts and used them prudently, as his grandmother probably did, he would get just as much benefit as he gets out of Kruschen salts.  But, on the other hand, I think it is true that there are probably a good many Deputies in this House at the present time quietly buying their bottles of Kruschen salts and solemnly taking out their sixpences <Col N="133" /> every morning, covering them with Kruschen salts and putting the salts into their morning cup of tea, and feeling like a million dollars.  Deputy Dr. Ryan and I may tell them that if they go out and buy tuppence worth of glauber salts and take a teaspoonful in half a glass of water, they will do them as much good and be much more economical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Harm or good in any case.  But I often wonder would it? One preparation commands their confidence and they continue to use it, if it is benefiting them, whereas the other does not command their confidence. I have a feeling that, unless a very serious abuse arises, if the vendor of the patent remedy openly declares to the purchaser what he is getting for his money, it is fair enough to leave it to the purchaser to determine for himself whether or not he is in fact getting fair value.</P>
      <P>I see the point of what Deputy Dr. Ryan said, that where the formula is deliberately made to appear very elaborate, it is hard for the farmer to determine when the formula is so long and exhaustive, that it is maybe value for his money.  If a situation of that kind developed to the point where it amounted to a real abuse, then there is power under Section 7 on which we can fall back, authorising the Minister for Agriculture in that event to impose on those who deal in patent remedies of this type a complete licensing system, thus enabling him, if a wholly spurious remedy is offered with a very elaborate formula and at a shameful price, to prohibit its sale altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge on the Deputy not to press upon me the obligation of fixing the price for every patent remedy.  I think the Deputy, on reflection, will feel that he has perhaps gone a little further in condemning advertising than the facts would justify.  I wish to ensure that the manufacturers, for instance, of phenothiazine and hexachloroethane will conduct <i>vis-a-vis</i> the farmers the kind of intensive sales campaign as Deputy Dr. Ryan has himself experienced in connection with certain therapeutic remedies offered <Col N="134" /> to doctors.  I remember when I first tried to popularise hexachloroethane and phenothiazine, I went to the extreme length of sending out very many thousands of postcards addressed to each individual farmer, and I am prepared to say that I got a greater response in the user of these two drugs from that than from any other form of publicity that the Department and the veterinary profession or anybody else since enjoyed.</P>
    <P>So that, even if the manufacturers of preparations of that kind did add a fraction to the cost of a drug of that kind, and from that extra fraction of the cost, financed an intensive publicity campaign for its general user, I would welcome it.  But I would find myself in a desperate difficulty if I were trying to determine a fair retail selling price for every medicine that was put on the market.  The Deputy asked me to clarify, as far as I could, what exactly the Bill would cover.  I think anything that is not caught under the terms of this Bill would be caught under the terms of the Animal Feeding Stuffs Bill, if that is the correct name of the other statute.  I think the Deputy should look at the interpretation section&mdash;Section 2.  He will find that &ldquo;animal remedy&rdquo; means any substance, preparation, mixture or compound, other than a feeding stuff commonly known and used as such, which is intended for administration or application whether internally or externally to an animal by any means for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing or treating any injury, disease, ailment or defect or improving its health or condition.</P>
    <P>I think that definition is wide enough to cover everything which is not covered by the compound feeding stuffs legislation.  If any other points arise on Committee Stage I shall, of course, be happy to give Deputies any information at my disposal.  I should like to say that I am grateful for the spirit in which this Bill has been received, most especially for the tribute paid to my expedition in bringing it before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question which I overlooked when speaking.  If he would look at Section 5, sub-section (6), he will see that it says the Minister may require any person who sells an animal remedy to satisfy him of the accuracy of any statement on the container or outer wrapper of such remedy.  Does that cover all claims in respect of a remedy?  For instance, if the remedy is advertised as a cure for hoose, must the person satisfy the Minister that it is a cure for hoose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think it does.  I think it effectively or almost effectively precludes extravagant claims of that kind.  For instance, I think phenothiazine is unquestionably as nearly specific as you could get, but I would not think it right for any person to declare it to be an absolute cure for every kind of stomach worms, because one worm has emerged for which it is not a perfect cure without some concomitant. The thing is that people should be prevented from making extravagant claims.  A person might not describe it as a cure for hoose but he could describe the medicine as a useful remedy.</P>

    <Title>National Loan, 1956. - Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Bill, 1956&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Since the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, was passed nearly 80 years ago, special legislative provision has existed for the supervision and control in the interests of public health of the methods of production and distribution of milk for human consumption.  It has been recognised that not only should milk when drawn from the cow be of a high standard of quality and free from disease organisms harmful to human beings but also that sufficient precautions should be taken at subsequent stages until the milk reaches the consumer to ensure that its quality will not be impaired by unhygienic methods of handling and distribution.</P>
      <P>The Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, revised and improved the system of control of the quality of milk for liquid consumption.  That Act has now been in operation for 21 years and it is a tribute to the local sanitary authorities whose onerous function it is to operate most of the provisions of the Act that the general quality of our liquid milk has greatly improved throughout those years.  While the Act has been operating pretty smoothly, experience has shown that some improvements are desirable and that we should strive to make what seems good even better. This Bill is accordingly designed to amend the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, with a view to improving the control system and also, to facilitate the operation of the system by removing some administrative difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are two categories of producers of milk intended for liquid consumption <Col N="137" /> who have not hitherto been required to conform to the standards of hygienic production laid down in the 1935 Act and the regulations made thereunder.</P>
    <P>As regards the first category, creameries engaged in the pasteurisation of milk for the liquid trade are at present free to obtain their milk supplies for this trade from unregistered sources.</P>
    <P>The increasing demand throughout the country for pasteurised milk is encouraging more and more creameries to enter into this business and it is only right that such creameries should now be required to obtain from registered producers that portion of their milk intake which is utilised for the liquid trade.  This means that the milk so used by creameries will have to be obtained from producers whose animals are not suffering from any disease which would be liable to contaminate the milk and that the producers must conform to the requirements as to standard of cowsheds and dairies, that they must register as dairymen with their local sanitary authority and that their premises and milk supplies will be subject to inspection.  As, however, isolated instances may arise from time to time of local temporary shortages of milk from registered dairymen, it is necessary to retain the power to enable such shortages to be met at short notice by creameries.  In substitution, therefore, for the general exemption now being withdrawn by Section 3 of this Bill, it is proposed under Section 12 to give the Minister for Agriculture the power to exempt by declaration creamery milk suppliers in specific cases for short periods where supplies of milk are required from creameries to meet emergency shortages.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear, however, that all the foregoing remarks do not relate to the ordinary farmer who supplies milk to creameries for the manufacture of butter and other milk products: they are not governed in any way by the Act of 1935 or by this Bill, the purity and freshness of their milk being subject to control by inspection on the creamery platform under the Dairy Produce Acts.</P>
    <P>The other category of milk producers <Col N="138" /> which have been exempt from the provisions of the 1935 Act are those who sell not more than two gallons per day in rural areas.  The same type of exemption also exists in regard to creameries whose sales of liquid milk in rural areas do not exceed five gallons per day.  These two exemptions were operated by means of the Emergency Powers (No. 95) Order, 1941, and, in the past 15 years in which that Order has been in use, have occasionally proved a boon to consumers in remote areas who could not obtain their small requirements of milk from registered sources.  It is now intended to replace this Emergency Powers Order by a slightly different type of exemption as provided in Section 11 of this Bill.  The new exemption will not, as heretofore, be of general application but can be given by the Minister for Agriculture after consultation with the local sanitary authority concerned, in any particular rural area where the exemption is needed to avoid hardship to consumers.</P>
    <P>The requirements in relation to the bottling of milk for sale under special designations, such as Highest Grade Milk and Pasteurised Milk, are stringent and well known.  The bottling of milk for sale under such general designations as &ldquo;milk&rdquo;, &ldquo;new milk&rdquo;, or &ldquo;fresh milk&rdquo; has not hitherto been subject to regulation for the reason that the bottling of such milk was not commonly practised.  It has, however, in recent times increased to such an extent that it is now essential that sanitary authorities should be enabled to supervise effectively such activities and ensure that the dairymen involved are equipped with proper bottle-sterilising and other necessary equipment. As the process of bottling milk, unless done in accordance with strict hygienic methods, may only increase the risk of contamination, it is important that sanitary authorities should be empowered to exercise a greater measure of control over this branch of the business.</P>
    <P>Another provision of the Bill, to which I wish to direct special attention, is that relating to milk used in hotels, restaurants, hospitals, sanatoria, schools and other similar establishments. <Col N="139" /> The present law relating to the sale of milk is not specific enough to cover milk used at such premises because of the doubt whether milk consumed on such premises can legally be regarded as having been sold.  Also, proprietors of such premises who have their own herds which supply the requirements of the premises are not at present obliged to have their dairies registerd and so are not bound by the various regulations designed to ensure the hygienic production of the milk.</P>
    <P>This is now being rectified in this Bill by requiring that all milk used on those premises must be obtained from registered sources.  The relevant provision of the Bill follows the lines of a similar provision which is contained in the Health Act, 1947, relating to food of any kind consumed in those establishments.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a provision which will have the effect of preventing registered dairymen from supplementing their milk supplies from unregistered sources.  While the need for stopping such a practice is obvious the 1935 Act did not quite achieve its object in this respect.</P>
    <P>Another provision which I should mention is that relating to the disposal of milk obtained from animals which have been found suffering from disease.  The Act of 1935 already contains the essential provision enabling the sale of such milk to be prevented, but the specific reference in the Act to &ldquo;sale&rdquo; did not go far enough.  It is now proposed to empower veterinary inspectors of sanitary authorities not only to prohibit the sale of milk from a diseased cow but also to direct the manner in which the milk should be disposed of.</P>
    <P>The experience gained in the working of the 1935 Act has revealed that one of its provisions, which at the outset seemed to be quite desirable, has operated unduly harshly on some dairymen.  This is the requirement under which it is obligatory on a sanitary authority to cancel a dairy-man's registration, thereby putting him out of business, if he is convicted in any five-year period of three offences under the Act and the Sale of Food <Col N="140" /> and Drugs Acts.  For example, where a shopkeeper is convicted of the offence of selling milk deficient in its fat or milk solids content, even though it has not been proved that the deficiency was due to adulteration, the sanitary authority has no option but to cancel the shopkeeper's registration as a dairyman following three such convictions within five years.  It is now proposed to remove this provision of the 1935 Act but to retain the very necessary provision of that Act which gives discretion to the sanitary authority, provided that the consent of the Minister for Agriculture is obtained, to cancel the registration of a dairyman convicted under the Acts mentioned.  I may say that the latter power is rarely exercised and only in cases where it is fully established that it is in the interests of the public to do so.</P>
    <P>Another important matter covered in the Bill is the proposal to incorporate in permanent legislation, with some modifications, the provisions at present contained in the Emergency Powers (No. 145) Order, 1952.  That Order was made for the purpose of meeting the situation which arose out of the occasional inadequacy of the supply of milk to the Dublin area from registered sources.  The Order provides for the grant of special temporary licences to creameries not in possession of the type of pasteurising plant normally required under the Milk and Dairies (Special Designations) Regulations, 1938, so as to permit such a creamery to supply pasteurised milk to Dublin. Experience has shown that it is essential that the powers contained in this Emergency Powers Order should be retained and incorporated in permanent legislation so as to ensure that the supply of milk to Dublin can be supplemented, when necessary, at short notice.</P>
    <P>For example, in the year 1955, it was found necessary to utilise the provisions of the Order on nine occasions. Although no need presented itself for such special licences this year, it cannot be assumed that the facility will not again be needed in the future.  As it may also happen that temporary shortages of milk may arise in areas <Col N="141" /> outside Dublin which cannot conveniently be met at short notice from registered sources, it is only prudent in order to enable those shortages to be met by creameries, that the Minister for Agriculture should be empowered to grant temporary licences for areas outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>All the other provisions of the Bill are in the nature of relatively minor amendments of the provisions of the 1935 Act which experience has revealed as necessary for the efficient administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>In these days of advancement in the field of hygiene and public health, the problem of ensuring as far as is humanly possible a supply of wholesome milk is particuarly worthy of our most careful attention and it is, therefore, with a view to strengthening some weak links in our chain of armour against the spread of disease through contaminated milk that I place this measure before the House for its consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very long Bill of 31 sections and it is entirely a Bill by reference.  Therefore, practically every single section in this Bill amends some section in a former Act.  I think Deputies will realise that it is very difficult for an ordinary Deputy to study the implications of a Bill of this kind. It has been the practice in this House to supply an explanatory memorandum when a Bill like this is circulated and I would ask the Minister if it could be possible to supply that explanatory memorandum before the Committee Stage is considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent some few hours on this Bill and I did not get very far.  One would take some days to go through the whole Bill and find out exactly what each clause means.  You would have to read the original clause in the principal Act, write it out and then put in the amendment, read it again and then see what it means.  I do not think it would be right for me to take down a statute in one of the rooms here and write the amendments into it because you would injure public property.  One must take down the clause, write it out, put in an amendment and see how the new <Col N="142" /> clause reads.  It is a very slow job for ordinary Deputies.  The Minister should have given us an explanatory memorandum telling us the meaning. It would be necessary for the Minister to do what I had to do myself in order to ascertain what any of the sections mean.  You are amending an original section which meant so-and-so and now means something else.</P>
    <P>I think an explanatory memorandum would be very helpful, when we are dealing with the Committee Stage. The Bill is really a Committee Bill because, as far as I can see, every single section deals with a different matter. No very big principle is involved that we could discuss on Second Reading and it is not necessary, therefore, that we should have Second Reading speeches, as far as I am concerned anyhow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make another observation.  I do not know exactly how we stand on this but I remember, first of all, in 1935, when I was Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health brought in a Milk Bill.  It took a long number of consultations between the two Departments to try to work out what the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was concerned with and what the Minister for Agriculture was concerned with.  There was another Bill before I left the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the officials of the two Departments on that occasion and I found myself within a few months in the Department of Health.  I had to meet them again but, strange to say, I was able to hold the same views when I became Minister for Health.  Roughly, the division I thought should be made was that the Minister for Agriculture was the Minister on the economic side, on the <Col N="143" /> production of milk.  It is the function of the Minister for Agriculture to see that milk is produced economically, in a healthy state as far as the animals are concerned.  The animals should be healthy.  But the handling of the milk and the exposure for sale should be the function of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>That is a rough division.  I know that, when you come down to details, it is sometimes inconvenient to make the division at that particular spot.  It may be more convenient to let the Minister for Agriculture go a little bit further or permit the Minister for Health to start a little bit back from that particular division.  It appears to me that in this Bill the Minister for Agriculture is taking over more of the business of milk production and the exposure of the milk in a clean and healthy condition for sale than had been the case up to this.  I think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>However, I am not too sure of that, because the Bill is very hard to understand and study and I may be wrong in my assumption.  There are, as the Minister explained, in this Bill clauses which make permanent powers that were already taken under the Emergency Powers Orders.  As far as I can study that matter, too, I think the Minister is right in the course he has taken.  Take the case of rural areas, for instance.  A farmer is permitted by Emergency Powers up to this to sell up to two gallons per day to his neighbours. I think that should remain&mdash;at least for the present.  We may reach the stage sometime or other&mdash;I am afraid it will be a long time&mdash;when we will be in a position to compel everybody who sells milk to bring his cow byre or dairy up to the standards that we expect for those who at the moment supply the city.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if you compel the farmer in a rural area to go to considerable expense in order that he might be registered to sell milk to an amount of not less than two gallons, he would say he would go out of business and that it would not pay him to go to that expense.</P>
    <P>The same, I understand, applies to creameries, whether central creameries <Col N="144" /> or auxiliary creameries.  In their case, the sale permitted is five gallons. These matters, which were embodied in Emergency Powers Orders up to now and which are now going to be permanent legislation, appear to me to be right and proper, but I find it hard to discuss this Bill to any extent on Second Reading.  I think it is a Bill we will have to settle down to discuss in more detail when the Committee Stage arrives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped, when I heard the Minister was bringing in a Milk and Dairies Bill, that he was going to take some steps to increase the price of milk in view of the increased cost of production to the farmers.  Instead of that, I find legislation to impose further difficulties on the farmers.  I entirely endorse what Deputy Dr. Ryan has just said.  It has been cusomary to issue an explanatory statement with each new measure brought into this House.  We ordinary Deputies always found that rather useful. However, it has not been done in this case.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that when the Minister introduced an improvement of this type, he would take into consideration a growing practice amongst the larger farmers who are now dealing in milk, particularly liquid milk for cities and hospitals.  We all know that the average butter fat content in milk is about 3.5 per cent.  Some time ago, a storekeeper in one of our hospitals asked me if I ever heard of cows that, for six consecutive months, were producing milk at never higher than 3.1 per cent. butter fat, and I said I never heard of such a thing.  However, I told him that if he looked on at the manipulation in regard to the milk, he would find out what was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Large purveyors of milk usually sell a lot of cream.  By separating the milk and adding so many gallons of separated milk to the milk produced, they are able to bring the butter fat down to 3.05 per cent. which passes the test, but deprives the people of the butter fat in the milk.  Those people are under-cutting farmers, who are the usual contractors to hospitals and places of that description and who supply milk as it comes from the cow, <Col N="145" /> 3.5 per cent. to 4 per cent. butter fat, by 1d. or 2d. a gallon.  They have succeeded in driving the ordinary farmer out of the market with an article which, in actual value, is four to five points per gallon less in butter fat.  If the Minister is so active in dealing with this matter, I wonder if he would get knowledge of that difficulty that has now arisen and take steps accordingly.</P>
    <P>As chairman of our board of assistance, which is concerned with hospitals, I have endeavoured to have certain tests taken from time to time. I found that the statement made to me by the storekeeper was correct.  Those people are not supplying ordinary milk of 3.5 to 4 per cent. butter fat content. The milk they are supplying might be pasteurised: I think &ldquo;pauperised&rdquo; is nearer the mark because it is generally not more than 3.1 per cent. butter fat in content.  That is not milk that is ordinarily delivered by the farmer to any pasteurising plant.  I should like the Minister to take that aspect of the question into consideration when introducing a Bill of this description and to see if he can get rid of that type of pauperised milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not the practice of reconstituting milk is general here, but if there is any evidence that it is, then I think the Minister should have the matter examined.  My concern is to know just what the impact of this Bill will be on creameries supplying hospitals.  At the moment, there is a practice whereby the county managers, on the advice of the health authority, in the main insist on the supply of pasteurised milk to hospitals.  The creamery itself sends in the tender for pasteurised milk and supplies it to the hospital.  Obviously, when this Bill becomes law, these contacts will no longer be effective, for the simple reason that the suppliers to the creamery will not, in my opinion, go to the expense which this Bill will impose on them by way of making arrangements in the matter of cowsheds and dairies.  Therefore, the creamery will not be able to have a sufficient number of suppliers to provide that quantity of milk as prescribed in the Act for the supply of <Col N="146" /> the contracts which they now have.  I can see that difficulty.  Before we come to the Committee Stage of this Bill, I would ask the Minister to get some idea from the Department of Health of the commitments in that direction and of the possible impact which this Bill will have when it is enacted.</P>
      <P>Again, there is the restriction on the supplier of milk to a town or village.  As far as we know, at least as far as my knowledge of the milk-producing areas goes, the milk produced is mainly summer milk.  The supplier of milk to towns and villages must go at a certain time of the year to neighbouring farmers who have cows calved early to supplement his milk supply.  Under the provisions of this Bill, he may not now do that because the supplier of a milk vendor or the man who supplies milk to a town may not now purchase milk from farmers to supplement his supply in the lean period unless those farmers have put their premises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not do that.  I can see difficulties arising in respect of the supply at a certain time of the year.  I can even see a shortage of milk in certain towns at that time.</P>
      <P>I think there is a provision that such a supplier of milk may go to the creameries and supplement the supply there.  I cannot see much sense in preventing a farmer adjoining a town from sending ten or 15 gallons of milk to the usual supplier of that town and then allowing him to purchase the milk at the creamery where he may purchase a mixture of milk provided by a number of suppliers.  The risk of infection from milk purchased at a creamery is much greater than from milk purchased through an individual farmer adjoining a town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important question that arises is: what will be the impact of the Act in regard to the provisions of the T.B. testing scheme?  The Minister is aware that all over the dairying areas in the South and elsewhere many farmers know, after a test, that they have a number of reactor cows in their herd.  As far as we know generally, <Col N="147" /> there is no provision made for the elimination of these cows.  So far as this Act is concerned, the supply of any milk from known reactors is, in fact, milk within the terms of this Act.

      <P>I wish I were in a position to say to Deputy Moher that this Bill was designed to provide for a situation arising out of the immediate attestation of every cow in Ireland.  God speed that day.  Under His Providence, I hope to make whatever modest contribution towards the expedition and the realisation of that aim that I can.  I certainly do not want any Deputy to believe that this Bill is designed to persuade Dáil Éireann that any such event is around the corner and I think we will find on the Committee Stage that Deputy Moher's interpretation of the Bill is unduly optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the House will allow me to go back and follow as best I can the points raised in the debate.  Deputy Dr. Ryan said he wondered if the functions and duties of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture were properly segregated in regard to legislation in relation to milk and dairies. By a strange chance, there was open before me on the desk &ldquo;Statutory Rules and Orders 1947, No. 417, Agriculture and Health.  Transfer of <Col N="148" /> Departmental administration and Ministerial Functions Order, 1947. Transfer to the Minister for Agriculture of Certain Functions of the Minister for Health.&rdquo;  Who do you think signed the Order?  Would you ever guess?  It was not Deputy Dr. Ryan; it was not Deputy Smith.  It was Eamon de Valera, the Taoiseach, given under his official seal of the Government on the 19th day of December, 1947.  Now, is it not a mercy that Deputy de Valera is not here to shake his gory locks at me and rebuke me for carrying out the functions that he transferred to me under his seal and signature on the 19th day of December, 1947?  If the poor man were here, it would result in his embarrassment three times in one day and I would not wish even him that trial.</P>
    <P>It was thought well at that time to transfer certain functions from the Department of Health to the Department of Agriculture, and I remember in February, 1948, when I took up office, that the transfer was actually in progress.  But the Minister for Health still has considerable functions in connection with this matter and when I furnish Deputies with the note that Deputy Dr. Ryan asked for, by way of elucidation of the sections of the Bill, I will indicate the sections in which the Minister for Health is concerned, in which the Minister for Agriculture is concerned and in which both Ministers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to strike any peculiarly controversial note and I am very happy indeed to oblige Deputy Dr. Ryan and his colleagues by preparing the kind of explanatory note he seeks, but it is preposterous for Deputy Corry to say it was the invariable practice of the House to provide such a note.  Nothing is further from the truth and I am obliged to confess that frequently from the Opposition Benches I made the same representation as Deputy Dr. Ryan made to-day. Whenever I made it, I was brushed off by an indignant Minister who rebuked me for being too lazy to look up the references myself.  Now that the Opposition makes that representation to me, I will be glad to meet it to the limit of my resources in good time for the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> Deputy Moher knew well the significance of Deputy Corry's outspoken and disinterested contribution to this debate.  He was trying to say, under parliamentary privilege, what he was afraid to say in public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is like Deputy James Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he wants to make these observations, let him go down to Cork and get up there and make them in public.  Deputy Corry describes himself as being the chairman of a public health authority and he can go down to Cork and say in public there what he is trying to say here, by innuendo, under parliamentary privilege.  If he has any complaint or allegation to make, he should be man enough to go and make it where people are in a position to challenge him and nail his ear to the post, if he is slandering them, as I believe he is.  He says he is the chairman of the public health authority and he says he knows that the poor, for whom he professes to be responsible, are being unjustly treated. It is his duty to see that they are properly treated and if he is afraid to do his duty, he ought not come slinking in here to make allegations by innuendo.</P>
      <P>I understand the anxieties that Deputy Moher mentioned and I see the point when he asked why should you prohibit a man supplementing his milk supply from a neighbour, if you allow him to go to a creamery.  I would agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general aim all the way since 1935 has been to try and build up the level.  Be that as it may, Deputy Dr. Ryan said it was necessary at one time to give a general exemption in respect of the farmer who sold less than two gallons a day.  The furthest we are going in this Bill is to cancel general exemption and to put a duty on the Minister for Agriculture to satisfy himself that, unless he gave exemption in a particular area, there would not be milk available from any other sources of supply.  I think we ought to try and reach the aim and persuade everybody who wants to sell milk for human consumption to avail of the farm buildings grant and to build his <Col N="150" /> cowshed up to the very modest standard that the local authority requires to register him as a milk supplier.</P>
    <P>It is not a very high standard.  I dare to say that it is almost the minimum, and it is not harshly enforced. Everything is done to help a fellow improve his cowshed.  He need not build a new cowshed and very often can get a reconstruction grant if he does want to build a new one that will enable him to bring up his existing cowshed to the minimum standard required.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is substance in Deputy Moher's apprehension that creameries at present under contract to supply hospitals and institutions will find themselves unable to do so under the provisions of this Act.  Certainly I would wish to have&mdash;and I am sure in fact I will have&mdash;power to avoid creating a situation in which creameries would be obliged to break their contracts or to leave institutions without milk.  I do think the time has come when we ought to say to creameries who wish to set up a separate business of bottling pasteurised milk for human consumption that they ought to take that milk in on a separate platform, that they ought to take it from suppliers who have brought up their cowsheds to the standard fixed by the local authority and that the milk should be treated quite separately from the ordinary commercial creamery milk which, as the Deputy says, may suffer contamination owing to the supply being mixed without regard to what farm it may have come from.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, no serious objection has been offered to this reform by the dairying industry.  I do not mean to imply that some people have not regarded it with some apprehension, but in fact two or three creameries have applied to me for facilities to set up pasteurising and bottling plant to distribute liquid milk for human consumption, and I have availed of every such application to say to them: &ldquo;This Bill is coming before Dáil Éireann and if the Dáil approves this Bill and the Oireachtas passes it, you would be required to have a separate receiving platform, separate premises and the kind of equipment that the <Col N="151" /> Bill will provide, if you are to continue with this pasteurised bottle milk business.&rdquo; Any creamery which has discussed this matter with me, however, has readily accepted that and has taken steps to that end, so that I do not think it will create any insuperable difficulty for any creamery that intends permanently to get into this business.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputies who have spoken that this is largely a Committee Stage Bill.  I do not believe we should find in it any matter of a controversial character &mdash; certainly no matter of high principle&mdash;which we should not be able to settle by our common counsel but I shall certainly put in the hands of Deputies a memorandum which will explain the various sections to them and, armed with that, we should be able to have a more informative discussion on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend to the 31st March, 1960, the period within which the erection, enlargement or improvement of a building must be completed in order to qualify for the two-thirds remission of rates for seven years provided by Part II of the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> Part II of the 1954 Act provided for the granting of two-thirds remission of rates for a period of seven years on the valuation of buildings and on the total increase in valuation of existing buildings that are enlarged or improved, where the work on the construction, enlargement or improvement was begun and completed in the period commencing on 27th July, 1953, and ending on 26th July, 1956.  The remission does not apply to houses erected by local authorities under the Labourers Acts or the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and owned by a local authority, houses in respect of which grants or rates remission were given under the Housing Acts, or under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, farm buildings receiving relief from rates under Section 14 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, or premises in respect of which a local authority has decided to remit rates under Section 9 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  Subject to these exceptions the remission applies to all buildings including hotels, shops, factories, offices and dwelling-houses. Where a building is enlarged during the prescribed period and in the revised valuation following that enlargement earlier improvements or additions are taken into account the remission also applies to those earlier improvements and additions.</P>
    <P>In the years 1920 to 1939 all buildings of the type covered by the present Bill received rates remission.  Between 1939 and 1953, however, the remission was confined to dwelling-houses.  The 1954 Act, which was introduced by my predecessor, restored the concession of rates remission to buildings other than dwelling-houses.  The intention of this Act was to expedite projects of a building or constructional character.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the task of compiling statistics of the number of buildings which received this remission would necessitate the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time and labour.  On a rough estimate, however, it would appear that about 1,500 premises per annum receive the benefits of the Act.</P>
    <P>When the previous Bill was being debated many members of the House felt that its period of application was too <Col N="153" /> short and my predecessor indicated that the question of an extension could be considered when the period of application of the Bill expired.</P>
    <P>All rates remissions must be met either from taxation or by other ratepayers. The concession given by the 1954 Act is met by other ratepayers, but I feel that it is a desirable one and that it does tend to accelerate building projects.  This Bill, therefore, proposes the extension of the concession for a further period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We of this Party naturally have no objection to offer to the extension which is proposed here of the remission of rates provided in the Act of 1954.  When we were informed that this Bill would come before the House to-day, I just glanced through the discussion that took place here some two years ago and I was amused at some of the criticisms which were then offered to the proposals at the time, and especially amused by a colleague of the Minister who is now also a member of the present Government. He gave the House then to understand that his Party had a scheme for the relief of rates and for meeting the problem which the existing Act was designed to solve or meet in some limited way.  He complained of the title of the Bill at the time&mdash;Remission of Rates Bill&mdash;and he pointed out that while, as he called it, this miserable concession was being given to those who undertook improvements and extensions of their premises, the increased valuation would be used against them in matters of income-tax and in a number of other ways to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister did not take part in the discussion on the original Bill but it is an extraordinary thing that, in a period of at least two years, the Fine Gael Party of which the present Minister is a member did not have time to propose amendments to the existing legislation along the lines that were then suggested as possible and along the lines then suggested by the present Minister for Health as part of the policy of the Party of which he was a member.  I suppose suggestions made in such circumstances by Deputies who have not the responsibility <Col N="154" /> of Government, even although they are responsible members of their Party, cannot be taken at their face value but there is no doubt that the Minister's Party have had a history over the last number of years, when in opposition, of giving expression to proposals of one kind or another which, when they came face to face with them as members of a Government, they did not seem to make even the slightest attempt to implement.</P>
    <P>The Bill was originally introduced to encourage the extension and renovation of premises so that employment would result.  There never was a time when it was as necessary as it is now to give further concessions along the lines of the existing legislation in order to stimulate employment in the building world in rural areas and, indeed, in the city.  I cannot resist reminding the Minister that, in spite of that necessity, the same proposals which were described by the Minister's colleagues, when conditions were very good indeed in the matter of employment, as mean and miserable, are being offered again although the situation to be met now is 100 times worse than it was then from the point of view of employment.</P>
    <P>As a result of Government action of one kind or another, the building business has in the last six or seven months received blow after blow from which it will not recover as a result of a proposal such as this but, to whatever extent this Bill is helpful in the matter of giving employment, then, just as we designed this measure originally and had it enacted for the purpose I have stated, we now, naturally, will support the Minister in having it extended for a further period of three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much indeed what Deputy Smith has said but we should bear in mind that the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government deserves some credit for its encouragement to builders.  Before Deputy Corry or I came into this House they, first in 1925, introduced a Bill which became an Act for the remission of rates, and they followed that up in 1927 with a somewhat similar Act.  I give credit to my predecessor <Col N="155" /> for the Bill he introduced some few years ago.  I am merely trying to give effect to the desire which was expressed here by a number of Deputies when they said that the period was too short in the 1954 Act.  It is for that purpose that I am now introducing the present Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith has made a very sweeping statement.  He says that the building trade has received many severe blows.  It is very, very easy to make these statements.  I hope to see the day when we will have no further building in this country, when we will have reached saturation point, when we will have sufficient dwelling-houses for all our people, when we will have sufficient factories for all our people to work in.</P>
      <P>I have heard many speakers from the Opposition Benches and read their speeches down the country where they said that the building of schools, vocational and primary, is at a standstill but, in reply to a parliamentary question to-day, the Minister for Education, General Mulcahy, stated that £250,000 more was being expended this year on the building of vocational schools than was spent last year and £220,000 more was being expended on the building of national schools than was spent last year.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine to make these sweeping statements to the effect that less building is being done.  There are as many houses being built to-day by Dublin Corporation as there were this day twelve months&mdash;just as many houses being built.  I question if some local authorities have not reached saturation point in this building business.</P>
      <P>I hope to do what the Tánaiste explained to-day in regard to rural electrification&mdash;to taper off gradually our building programme, and that we will not reach the stage when all building will cease on one day when we reach saturation point.  Let us taper off gradually.</P>
      <P>I am glad indeed of the manner in which Deputy Smith met the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Part II of the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954, provides for the granting of two-thirds remission of rates for a period of seven years on the valuation of new buildings and on the total increase in valuation of existing buildings that are enlarged or improved, where the work on the construction, enlargement or improvement is begun and completed during the prescribed period.  This remission does not apply to a cottage or house erected under the Labourers Acts or the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and owned by the local authority, a house in respect of which a grant or rates remission was given under the Housing Acts or under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, farm buildings receiving relief from rates under Section 14 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1952, and premises in respect of which a local authority has decided to remit rates under Section 9 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is threefold.  Firstly it incorporates in permanent legislation certain powers in connection with the fixing of prices for pigs which have hitherto been provided by Emergency Powers Orders; secondly, it continues certain prohibitions in regard to pigs of a colour other than all white, which also were provided for by an Emergency Order; and thirdly, it amends the Pigs and Bacon Acts in a number of minor respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the fixing of prices for pigs, the Pigs and Bacon Acts of 1935 and 1937 established a system of fixed prices for pigs purchased by bacon curers, the price being fixed by the Pigs Marketing Board up to the end of 1939 and by the Pigs and Bacon Commission thereafter.  This arrangement lacked flexibility, and experience showed that it was not in the long-term interests of producers, especially those who marketed the best pigs.  In 1943 the system of fixed prices for pigs was suspended by an Emergency Powers Order, and instead the Pigs and Bacon Commission was required to prescribe minimum prices for pigs purchased by curers.  In practice, however, pig prices were allowed to find their own level and that position obtained up to April of this year, when the export price guarantee scheme for grade A bacon was introduced.  In connection with that scheme it was arranged that producers should receive a minimum price of 235/- per cwt. dead weight for grade A pigs between the weight ranges of 1 cwt. 0 qr. 8 lb. and 1 cwt. 2 qr. 0 lb., and 230/- per cwt. dead weight for grade B 1 pigs between the weight ranges of 1 cwt. 2 qr. 1 lb. and 1 cwt. 2 qr. 7 lb. delivered to bacon factories during the period up to 31st March, 1957.  So as to ensure that these minimum prices were observed by all curers, it was decided that a minimum price Order applying to grade A and grade B 1 pigs should be made by the Pigs and Bacon Commission and in order that this might be done without interfering in any way with the <Col N="158" /> prices for other grades of pigs or for pigs purchased by curers on a live weight basis, which cannot be graded, the 1943 Order had to be amended.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Deputies were not present; House counted, and</i> 20 <i>Deputies being present</i>,</P>
    <P>What the Bill now proposes to do is to continue the power of the Pigs and Bacon Commission to fix minimum prices for factory-purchased pigs, i.e., pigs purchased by curers on a dead weight basis.  The Bill also continues the suspension of the system of fixed prices for pigs established by the prewar Pigs and Bacon Acts, but provides that the suspension may be removed and reintroduced at any time by order of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>As regards the prohibition in connection with pigs of a colour other than all white, only Large White boars have been eligible for licensing in this country since 1936.  This licensing requirement was introduced on the recommendation of the Live Stock Consultative Council and was endorsed by the Commission on Agriculture in 1939.  In 1951 coloured, that is, black or black and white pigs, which could only have been smuggled or else have been the progeny of pigs smuggled from the Six Counties, were appearing here and the Pigs (Unsuitable Types) Order, 1951, was made so as to counter the damage that could be done to our pig stocks by those pigs.  Occasional coloured pigs are still being detected and it is necessary to continue the powers provided by the 1951 Order.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendments of the Pigs and Bacon Acts, the Bill provides that the Pigs and Bacon Commission may transfer moneys from its general fund to its stabilisation fund.  The need for this provision arises in connection with the export price guarantee scheme for grade A bacon which is being partly financed by a levy on all pigs used for bacon production.  At present the receipts from such a levy must be paid into the commission's general fund but export subsidy may be paid only out of the stabilisation fund.  The Bill also provides for the payment into the stabilisation fund of <Col N="159" /> any moneys contributed by the Exchequer from time to time towards meeting subsidy on bacon exports.</P>
    <P>The other amendments of the Pigs and Bacon Acts are all designed to facilitate administration.  Two of these concern registered pork butchers.  The accounting period in connection with the payment of fees by such butchers is being extended from one month to six months.  The total amount of these fees is very small and the extension of the present short accounting period will facilitate administration without inconveniencing pork butchers.</P>
    <P>The second amendment in relation to pork butchers is that provision is being made for the cancellation of the registration of a pork butcher on the application of the registered person or where the business of pork butcher has not been carried on at the registered premises during the whole of the preceding 12 months.  Registered pork butchers have asked from time to time that their registration be cancelled and some registered premises are either no longer in existence or are being used for other purposes.  At present, however, nothing can be done in such cases as the registration of a pork butcher may be cancelled only if the butcher is convicted of certain offences.  Finally the Bill amends the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1939, so that the Pigs and Bacon Commission will not necessarily have to fix a rate of export subsidy on bacon before the date of export of the bacon.  This amendment also is required in connection with the operation of the Export Price Guarantee Scheme for Grade A bacon.  Under the scheme curers are guaranteed a minimum export price and the rate of subsidy depends on the average market prices realised but as matters stand the commission would have to declare the rate of subsidy before the exports took place and the rate could not be varied in accordance with the actual prices realised.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention to the House that on the Committee Stage of the Bill I propose to introduce a further amendment of the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The bacon curers have represented to me that some curers are confining <Col N="160" /> their selling activities to the home market only and they have suggested that it should be made obligatory on all curers to export a proportion of their output of Grade A bacon.  This would spread the burden of competing in the export market and would also have the very desirable result of ensuring continuity of supplies to the export market, an essential factor in the development of a successful export trade.  I have asked the curers voluntarily to operate an arrangement whereby each curer will export a proportion of his production of Grade A bacon.  The curers themselves feel, however, that there should be power to compel any curer who is not prepared to co-operate in this matter to export his due share.  At present the Pigs and Bacon Acts enable export quotas to be fixed but only for markets other than Britain and the Six Counties.  Accordingly on the Committee Stage of the Bill I propose to bring in an amendment which will enable export quotas to be fixed for any market.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to refer briefly to the grading of pigs and to the minimum prices which have been fixed for top quality pigs.  Since the introduction in August, 1955, of a uniform grading system for all pigs purchased on a dead weight basis, pigs are being marketed at more suitable weights for bacon production and there has been a steady improvement in the proportion of grade A pigs reaching the factories.  In the period August-December, 1955, the proportion of pigs in the weight range 1 cwt. 0 qr. 8 lb. to 1 cwt. 2 qr. which qualified for grade A was 54 per cent; in the period January-March, 1956, the proportion was 58 per cent. while, in the period April-June, 1956, and again in the quarter ended 30th September, 63 per cent. of the pigs graded were of grade A standard. Indeed, the position has now been reached that we are hearing suggestions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in increasing the price of home-produced wheat offals to that of imported offals, thus imposing, since September, 1954, an additional burden on pig feeders of over £600,000, to the detriment of the pig industry.&mdash;(Deputy Corry.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing that an important motion of this nature should have dragged out for such a lengthy period.  There has been an interval of over seven months since it was last discussed in this House.  It is a most important motion and, in dealing with this motion, the Government have something very serious to consider-that is, if they are consistent in their appeal for an expansion of agricultural production.  I take it the Government are sincere in that appeal, but I feel they have not approached the matter in the proper manner.  This is one of the instances to which we can point wherein the Government, and the Minister for Agriculture in particular, seem very lax and remiss in encouraging the agricultural community to increase production.</P>
      <P>The Government should ask themselves certain questions when they find that production of any commodity, be it agricultural or industrial, has diminished, and the first question the Government and the Minister for Agriculture should ask themselves is: Is pig production a worth-while element in our agricultural economy?  It is agreed by everybody with any knowledge of agriculture and the general position of our economy that pig production is a very vital part of our agricultural economy, particularly from the point of view of the small farmers. If that is so, there is no reason why any burdens or impediments should be placed on the essential requirements for the expansion of that product or commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consciously, or otherwise, a tax has been put on pig production by charging to pig producers an increased price for home-produced wheat offals, thereby bringing up the price to the level of the price paid for imported wheat offals.  Pig production, in my opinion, can be made profitable, provided the proper steps are taken.  The <Col N="163" /> best profit of all, in a sense, as far as the farmer is concerned, is not altogether the amount that he nets in gross profits, but the fact that the money is collected periodically about every four months.  We know that, in recent times, for a considerable number of years back, it is possible to put out a set of pigs in a period of four months.  That money comes in regularly and is of very great assistance to the farmer in helping him to pay some pressing bills.  It also enables him, of course, to increase the number of young pigs he undertakes to fatten in the succeeding period.</P>
    <P>Is it desirable then to impede expansion along that line of our agricultural industry?  That has been done; there is no denying the fact that it has been done.  So far as I know, there has been no denial of that.  The Government should examine the reason for the decline in pig production from the period September, 1954, to September, 1955.  Statistical returns show that in that short period of 12 months there was a total reduction in our pig population of over 80,000.</P>
    <P>Why did that occur?  Surely it is not suggested that this decline was as a result of our farmers getting lazy, careless, or disinterested in pig production? In my opinion, the reason is quite obvious.  The reason is that the feeding stuffs required for pig production have not been kept at the level at which they could and should have been kept.  This imposition, and it is an imposition, whereunder the farmer is charged for wheat offals a price equivalent to the price of imported offals is, in my opinion, a very great mistake.  It was a very retrograde step to take.  However, it seems to be in line with a considerable amount of Government policy in the past.  That policy was, of course, sponsored by the present Minister for Agriculture, who showed what I could term only as callous indifference to the problems and difficulties of the farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister showed that indifference very clearly when, on certain pretexts about what he called wheat ranchers and all the rest of them, he struck at the price of wheat and reduced <Col N="164" /> it in the 1955 harvest by 12/6 a barrel.  On top of that, he did something which, in my opinion, was even more fatal as far as curbing production was concerned: he increased the bushelling of wheat from 60 to 63.  Perhaps this is all beside the point, but I should like to ask why should the farmer not get the benefit of having the reduced price of wheat related to the price of offals?  Such a benefit might have encouraged farmers to make further and greater efforts to produce not only the requirements within the country but requirements for export as well.</P>
    <P>There was no great sense or reason in giving the benefit to certain people &mdash;I do not grudge them provided they get that benefit without injuring the farmers.  Some people who got it would not go within a half mile of a pig sty.  These people talk a great deal about how we could increase production of pigs and bacon by more efficient methods and by reducing our costs of production.  The farmers, I feel sure, would be very anxious to apply more efficient methods and also to reduce their costs of production, but they have not the determining of that.</P>
    <P>The efficient methods can perhaps be brought about by the farmers being educated into that position, but no matter what education a farmer gets &mdash;the same applies to industrialists&mdash;it is of little use, unless a considerable amount of capital expenditure is made in order to bring the efficient methods about.  The farmers did not get the benefit of a reduction in the price of wheat offals.  Some heed may be paid to what the experts and the theorists tell us and to what they put on paper, but when a Government make an appeal for greater production and at the same time take steps to curb that production by a deliberate policy of placing an impediment and a burden on the producers, I doubt if the appeal for greater production will get the heed we would all like it to get at the present time and that we all hope it will get.</P>
    <P>Plans for higher production, we are told, are now being formulated.  Consultative councils have been formed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> Perhaps they are all right in their own way, but our experience of such commissions and councils in the past has been that they put things very much on the long finger.  What we want is something that will give immediate results.  I believe the handing back or the discontinuance of collecting the higher rate for wheat offals from pig producers would be an indication on the part of the Government that they are sincere in their appeal for greater agricultural production.</P>
    <P>It was stated here last March, when this motion was before the House, that the amount taken by the Exchequer from the pig producers was £617,000.  That would be at the rate of about £40,000 a month.  If we calculate it for the period that has elapsed since then, over £1,000,000 has been taken.  That is a very big setback to the farming community.  They have had many things to contend with.  This very harvest they have to contend with the elements; the weather was almost as bad as in the terrible harvest of 1954.</P>
    <P>Despite all that, I did not hear many words of sympathy for them expressed by members of the Government during the period, nor did I hear of any steps being taken to organise some assistance for the farmers.  It is idle to say it could not be organised.  I believe that in this country at the moment we have about 31,000 tractors&mdash;a tractor for every ten farmers.  It would not have been so difficult&mdash;and it should have been attempted&mdash;to organise help in such a way that every advantage would be taken everywhere throughout the country of every hour of sunshine.</P>
    <P>I have said that pig production is a vital part of the small farmers' economy. It applies to the small farmers in fact even more than the larger farmers. It absorbs their unused potatoes, their skim milk, and, if they have land capable of growing barley or oats, they can use those as well.  However, wheat offal is a very essential part of pig raising.</P>
    <P>I have also mentioned the necessity for periodic income for farmers.  Small farmers particularly are severely handicapped if they have to depend entirely on what they get for their <Col N="166" /> live stock in October, again in April and again in October.  They have to survive very long periods.  They are spending money all the time or incurring debts by way of getting credit over those periods.  The rearing of pigs, even in a small way, provided a very handy periodic income for small farmers.  The small income over the shorter period is of very great value and advantage to the small farmers; it is of far more value than the larger income that comes in the other way. The small farmers require that periodic income.</P>
    <P>Progeny testing and research are very important matters, but at the same time I think something should be done to give a speedy return to the farmers, particularly in the circumstances of the prevailing financial crisis.  This is one of the ways in which it can be done, and it would be an indication of the sincerity of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government.</P>
    <P>A debate on the lines to which I have often listened and which has often disgusted me in this House is the one in which there are interjections like &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;, and in which the mistakes of previous Ministers or Governments are pointed out.  That will not get us very far, and I think that something practical is much better and will give better results and give the people greater confidence in democratic government.  Arguing about the merits of the Landrace and the White York is all very well in its own-way, but in a situation such as the present, it is largely, in my opinion, a waste of time.</P>
    <P>The terms of the motion before us state:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in increasing the price of home-produced wheat offals to that of imported offals, thus imposing, since September, 1954, an additional burden on pig feeders of over £600,000, to the detriment of the pig industry.</P>
    <P>That has been directed at the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I doubt if he should be arraigned at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> I think the person who should defend the agricultural community and say that they will not be deprived of what, in my opinion, is their just right is the Minister for Agriculture or, at least, he should be arraigned as co-defendant with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with this motion and I think the Government should accede to it now and do something in a practical way to give the people confidence and give confidence to the farmers' organisations in advising their members as to the line they should take up.  I would appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he is the person solely responsible &mdash;but I do not hold him solely responsible in this case&mdash;to agree to this motion.  It would be a good gesture on his part and other things will follow in due course.  Here is something that can give a very speedy return as far as the pig producers are concerned.  After all, pig producers are a very important section of the community, a section which is prepared to do work of a pretty arduous nature.  They are not work-shy, and they have to give great attention to their stock.  Even if they have only one pig, it demands great care as regards housing conditions, feeding and everything else.</P>
    <P>If we want bacon for export we should, in the first place, ensure that we have sufficient for ourselves and then if we can export it, we should be in a position to do so as cheaply as possible in order to compete on the foreign market; but by putting a burden of this kind on the farmers, we are not giving them a fair deal.  It is up to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Minister for Agriculture to humble themselves a little and say: &ldquo;Through my fault,&rdquo; and at the same time be big enough to do the proper thing and at least restore to the pig producers the £1,000,000 of which they have been deprived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As, no doubt, you will have observed, A Cheann Comhairle, the discussion on this motion has rambled over a very wide field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> Progeny-testing has been raised: the best diet for pigs has been discussed. The number of pigs in the country has been the subject of profound observations. The birth rate of pigs has been discussed from a variety of angles and the Statistics Office has been brought into the forum by one speaker to prove that pigs are a dying race, the same statistics being used by another speaker to prove that, far from being a dying race, pigs are a really flourishing tribe at the moment.  All this has been hung on a motion which has been submitted to the House in the name of Deputy Corry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to wander over that wide field in discussing this motion because many of the matters raised are completely outside the functions of my Department and are clearly and unmistakably identified with the work of the Department of Agriculture.  Indeed many of the observations made on this motion are observations which might usefully be made in a discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture. Nobody seriously attempted to say that I had anything to do with the matters raised.  In fact, Deputy Corry's motion is based on a deliberate falsehood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry's motion accuses me of increasing the prices of home-produced wheat offals.  I did no such thing and I propose to do no such thing.  I think I shall prove to any fair-minded member of the House that, so far as I am concerned, I come into this matter in the most incidental and accidental way.  I come into it from the standpoint of fixing the price of offals as food for animals, not from the standpoint of deciding what kind of food pigs should eat.  I come into it purely from the point of view of making sure that people do not get money twice over.  I come into this matter only from the angle of regulating what should be paid to the millers as subsidy, I have nothing whatever to do with the fixation of prices of offals, either imported or home-produced, but judging by the speeches which we have heard, one would think that I had deliberately set out on a policy of making the prices of animal feeding stuffs high.  I did no such thing.  No such <Col N="169" /> thing has been done and this whole motion is based on a complete misconception of the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>My function in this matter is to operate in one rôle only, that is, to supervise a simple bookkeeping transaction affecting millers and to see that the public interest in respect of that bookkeeping transaction is fully protected against the possibility of the indiscriminate use or waste of public money.  What are the facts?  Nobody has attempted to describe the facts in this House; instead this motion has been looked at from the standpoint of what political propaganda could be squeezed out of it.  Here are the facts: the total user of wheat offal in this country is approximately 160,000 tons.  Of that, 90,000 tons, or 45 per cent., is home-produced, and the balance of 70,000 tons is imported.  The imports that come in here from Britain come in free of all duty.  If anybody thinks he can buy offal in Britain cheaper than he can buy offal here or in any other part of the world, he can buy all the offal he wants at the price prevailing in Britain, if he thinks that is a good bargain for him.</P>
    <P>Imports from other countries are permitted, subject to licensing, but licences are freely granted to anybody who wants to import offal from any country in the world.  In other words, if a pig feeder believes that he knows a place in the world where he can buy offal cheaper than he can get home-produced offal in Ireland, all he has to do is to apply for a licence to the Minister for Agriculture and then he can buy that offal at the lowest possible price, and will not be coerced, as was alleged by those sponsoring the motion, into buying Irish offal at a higher price than he wants to pay for it.</P>
    <P>There is no price control over offal. Price control over offal existed between 1943 and 1951 and it was abolished in 1951.  I do not fix the price of offal, either native or imported. Here there is a free market for offal for our own home-produced offal and a free market for the offal that comes from any other part of the world.  Is it not as clear as daylight to anybody who is not blinded by prejudice <Col N="170" /> that if you have a free market for offal here, it is the world price of offal that will determine the price on the Irish market?</P>
    <P>Nobody will attempt to deny that. The world price of offal determines the price which can be got for Irish produced offal on the Irish market and offals here to-day as last year, the year before and the years before that, have been sold at any price they will fetch on the market.  What price can they fetch on the market?  Is it not clear that the price they can fetch on the market will be determined almost exclusively by the price at which foreign offal is imported?  Is there any other way in which the price of home produced offal <i>vis-a-vis</i> imported offal could be determined?</P>
    <P>Let us take an example.  In the case of the miller here trying to sell Irish produced offal above world prices, would the goods not be left on his hands?  If, for example, a miller here wanted £25 per ton for Irish produced offal when you could buy world offal at £20 per ton, is it not clear that world offal would be bought and that the miller would be left with the offal at £25 per ton on his hands?  Let us take the opposite to that.  Suppose he sold the Irish produced offal here below the world price, is it likely that his action in doing so would confer any benefit on the consumer here?  Is it not much more likely that if a miller sold offal here below the world price, the offal would go to a wholesaler or some other middleman and would probably be sold by him at the world price, the middleman or wholesaler probably selling native offal and imported offal in the same store at the uniform price?</P>
    <P>As I said, I have nothing to do with the fixation of offal prices, but the receipts from the sales of offals are an important factor in relation to the profits of flour millers and it is only at that point that I come into this transaction. In computing the flour subsidy, we have to take into consideration the variations in the price of offal.  Offal prices may change two or three times a year and in calculating what amount should be paid to the miller in the form of subsidy, we have to ascertain <Col N="171" /> what he gets for the offal which he sells in the Irish market.  What is the best way in which we can make that calculation?</P>
    <P>We know from experience that the price which the flour miller gets for offal in this market is determined by the price at which the imported offal is sold.  Therefore, we say to the miller: &ldquo;Look here! so far as the offal from Irish wheat is concerned, you get for it the world price on the Irish market.&rdquo;  We, therefore, say to him that, in calculating the amount of subsidy to be paid to him, we must take cognisance of the fact that he gets the world price on the Irish market.  Does anybody suggest that we should say to him that he gets £5 less than the world price, when we know, in fact, that he gets the world price?  Why should we only debit him with getting, say, £15 per ton if, in fact, we know he is getting £20 per ton?</P>
    <P>To do that would be to make an unjustifiable grant to the miller, and, so far as the Department of Industry and Commerce are concerned, we simply say to him that on the Irish market this year he, according to his own records, sold X tons of offal and we assume&mdash;this assumption is accepted by the miller.  He does not question it.  He does not quarrel with it because he knows it is true&mdash;he gets the world price on the Irish market for the offal.  Therefore, in considering what amount of subsidy he gets, we debit him with the fact that, by his sales on the Irish market, he has got into his own exchequer a sum of money related to the world price of offal.</P>
    <P>Would anybody attempt to deny that these are the facts?  These are indisputably the facts and they cannot be denied.  This whole arrangement is discussed with the Millers' Advisory Council.  This whole arrangement is known to the millers.  They know that we debit them with what we know they get for the offal on the Irish market, and that is the world price.  Why should we make a gift to the millers by charging them £5 less than they get for offal on the Irish market?  If we were asked in the House to approve of a proposal of that kind, I imagine that <Col N="172" /> I should see Deputy Corry in his well-known affection for millers cast in a role different from the role he is cast in, so far as this motion is concerned.</P>
    <P>Why should we assume that the miller gets less for the offal on the Irish market than we know he gets?  If we assume he gets £3, £4, or £5 less than he does, that is an uncovenanted benefit we are giving to the miller and I am not prepared to give it to the miller.  I should like to know if Deputies want that money given to the miller.  Unless we do what we are doing now&mdash;I will come back to the origin of the scheme in a minute&mdash;and continue to debit the miller with what he gets on the market, we are going to put substantial cheques in the pockets of the millers.</P>
    <P>I am not going to do that nor am I going to be dissuaded from doing what we are doing by the misrepresentation contained in this particular motion. Our whole calculation rests on the basis that we must make the miller pay or we must take credit on behalf of the State for what the miller gets for his offal.  In a situation in which 50 per cent. of the offal used in the country comes in at the world price, is it not clear that it is the world price that determines what the miller will get on the Irish market?</P>
    <P>The very substantial subsidy which we pay to the miller is based on the assumption that he gets a certain price per ton.  Why should we let the miller say that he gets less than he does? He does not want to say it&mdash;that must be said in his favour.  He has never pleaded for this.  Those who are supporting the motion are saying: &ldquo;Do not charge him.  Do not charge him what he is getting.  Hope that he will be able to sell it at this lower price.&rdquo; If you have wholesalers and middlemen in the country and if the imported price of offal is £20 a ton, if you go to look for a ton of Irish offal from them for £15 per ton, do you think you will get it?  Do you think you will have a uniform price or an Irish price and a foreign price in this respect?  There are simple people still extant in this country if you imagine that.</P>
    <P>Even if the miller were allowed to sell offal at £1 or £5 below the price which <Col N="173" /> he could get for it, that would never reach the consumer.  There are a lot of gentlemen in between the miller and the consumer who would live by working their heads and, in the long run, the consumer would pay the uniform and international price for offal of that kind.  That fact, of course, was not thought of or adverted to by the people stampeded into putting down a motion of this kind without giving any thought to it or to any consequences of the way in which they would dissipate the State's money and make to the millers a present which they themselves&mdash;to their credit, it must be said&mdash;never asked for.</P>
    <P>The net position is this.  For the purpose of estimating more precisely what is due to be paid to the miller in the form of subsidy, for the purpose of making sure that the State does not pay twice, for the purpose of making sure that the public's money is adequately safeguarded, we say to the miller: &ldquo;If we have to pay you a subsidy on flour, because you mill wheat, then we are entitled to take into account all you get in the form of an income from the offal you sell.&rdquo;  That is all we do in this matter and that is all the Department of Industry and Commerce does in this matter.  As I said earlier, it goes into this whole transaction simply from the point of view of ensuring that the nation's money is not wasted or dissipated as it would be if we were to take the advice of some of our friends opposite.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan was right when he said he does not think the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the responsibility in this transaction.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce comes into this thing purely from an accountancy point of view to say to the millers: &ldquo;If you get £25 a ton for offal, you pay that into the kitty.  That will be taken into consideration when the subsidy is being paid to you.&rdquo;  To let him pay in anything less, as presumably this motion wants him to do, is to deprive the Exchequer of money in the interests of giving a benefit to the miller.  To allow him to sell or presume he can sell offal at a price below the international price and that that sale, passing through a few <Col N="174" /> hands,, will ultimately confer a benefit on the consumer&mdash;well, the person who believes that is a strong rival of Alice in Wonderland.  It would not happen, and everybody knows it would not happen.</P>
    <P>Listening to the speeches opposite, one would think that all this was something that happened last week, last year, in 1954, or that it was devised in 1948-49, 1950 or 1951 when the inter-Party Government was previously in office.  This is a Fianna Fáil formula. It was devised by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It saw the light of day under the Fianna Fáil Government.  It has been administered by Fianna Fáil Ministers.  Yet we get an attitude of injured innocence put on here by Deputy Corry and the now missing Deputy Allen, who say this was some Machiavellian thought of mine that deprived the pig feeders of £617,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I altered no prices of offal.  My predecessor, Deputy Lemass, who discharged the same function as I do, altered no prices of offal.  No prices of offal have ever been altered or have ever been fixed.  The miller has been asked: &ldquo;Pay in, lad, what you have got.&rdquo;  He has never disputed that that is a right method and he has paid in what he got.  Every one of the Deputies opposite should bear in mind that when they go to the Division Lobby on this motion they are voting against a piece of machinery that was conceived and given birth to by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It first saw the light of day with Fianna Fáil parents standing beside it. It was used by the Fianna Fáil Government every year since it was first introduced and it was operated by the Fianna Fáil Government the last day it was in office.  Let us have some honesty in political life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not wonder at your laughing at the mention of honesty: you do not know what the word means.  I bet that half of you could not spell &ldquo;political honesty&rdquo;.  However, the notion of all these brothers opposite going into the Division Lobby against this practice which was conceived and operated by the Fianna Fáil Party down through the years is a circus act which would have done a trapeze artist a good deal of credit.</P>

      <Col N="175" /> It is quite a good act to be able to go into the lobby to-night and vote against this piece of Fianna Fáil work. Deputy Corry forgot all about the fact that this was a piece of Fianna Fáil machinery.  We are operating it. Fianna Fáil conceived and operated it. This is one of the things they did all right.  This would be a different country if they were as right in a whole lot of other things as they were in this. They wanted to prevent the millers from getting money twice and I want to do the same thing.  I am operating it with the same purpose.  It does not matter to the miller if he sells the offal for £1 a ton or for £31 a ton.  The miller is quite unconcerned with the price he gets for the offal.  It has nothing to do with him at all.  We deal on this basis&mdash;whatever you get, put it into the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo;.  If he gets a high price, well and good.  If he gets a low price, he says to us: &ldquo;Remember I got very little for the offal&rdquo;.  As far as the miller is concerned, he gets nothing out of a low or a high price, so far as the offal is concerned.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is purely an accountancy transaction.  A lot of the arguments made on this motion were in favour of providing the pig feeders and the cattle raisers with feeding stuffs at special prices.  There may be a case for that.  It has got to be argued on its own merits.  I can quite see that somebody might want to discuss the wisdom of subsidising pig-feeding or the question of making offals available at lower prices for farmers.  That is a case that could be argued and argued on its merits.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to do with the fixing of offal prices.  The millers get what they can on an open market and whatever they get they put into a &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; and we take cognisance of what they get, and the payments of subsidies are based accordingly.  If we did not take full cognisance of what the miller gets, then he would be putting concealed profit into his pocket.</P>
    <P>This scheme operated in 1948 and from 1951 to 1954, and I think it is a good scheme, designed to prevent waste of public money.  If there are <Col N="176" /> people in the country who think this scheme is not working fairly or that they would get better value by buying offal elsewhere, then there is a simple answer.  The whole world is open to them.  They can go to any place from Poland to Peru and buy offal at the lowest possible price and import it here and they will get a licence to do so. There is no compulsion to use the Irish offal.  Five continents are available to the pig producers in which to buy their offal, if they think it is better to buy it in any part of the world instead of in Ireland.  They can buy wherever they think the price is lowest, if they are not satisfied with the value here in Ireland.  If they want to take this course, then they can get their feeding stuff anywhere in the world and they need not buy Irish produced offal, the price of which they decry so much.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, however, that the arrangement now operating here is a good one, even though, I concede, it is a Fianna Fáil arrangement.  It is one way of ensuring that the public money is utilised to the best possible advantage. As far as this motion is concerned, anybody who permits himself to think freely and intelligently must, in the light of the facts I have given to the House, realise that it is a silly and inappropriate motion put down for the purpose of trying to get petty Party political advantage from this discussion.  I think that there is a red light on the horizon for the Irish people, and for the farmers, if, in face of the facts which I have disclosed, people allow themselves to be deceived by a motion of this sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who now acts as Pontius Pilate, of his words on this matter.  Speaking in this House on March the 23rd, 1955, in Volume 149, column 515, the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It was originally calculated that the reduction in flour and bread prices as from the 1st May, 1954, would add approximately £900,000 to the bill for subsidy for the financial year 1954-55.  In actual fact, the reduction will cost £927,000, against <Col N="177" /> which, however, can be offset items amounting to about £555,000, leaving a balance of £372,000 to be provided for under this sub-head.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The chief offsetting items, of which I shall give details in a moment, are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) Increased receipts by flour millers from sales of wheaten offals over and above the amount originnally estimated;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister then goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Increases in the price of offals, from £20 to £23 per ton in September, 1954, to £24 10s. in December, 1954, and to £26 a ton in January, 1955, account for increased receipts by millers of approximately £170,000. These increases followed similar increases in the prices of imported offals reflecting changes in the world price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's statement on that date.  In that very short period, the millers had collected from the pig feeders of this country a sum of £170,000, by the simple expedient of bringing the price of home offals up to the price of imported offals.  I was rather curious to see the position over a longer period and I went after it.  I asked a question in this House on 15th February of this year, and, due to the manner in which the reply was made, I was compelled to raise that part of my question on the Adjournment. It was due to the fact that the acting Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that the information was not available in his Department.</P>
    <P>The information given there by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in March, 1955, was not available in February of 1956.  However, we squeezed out the following information from the Minister for Social Welfare, who was deputising for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in column 494 of the 15th February, 1956, the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Adopting the same basis as that used in estimating the probable amount of subsidy payments in the financial year 1954-55 the increased receipts by millers from sales of <Col N="178" /> wheaten offals from September, 1954, to August, 1955, have been calculated to amount to £431,000; and for the period from September, 1955, to the 1st February, 1956, to £186,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That makes £617,000 which has been dragged out of the pockets of the unfortunate pig feeders in this country by increasing the price of home offals, as the Minister says, to the price of imported offals, and as a result that much money has been extracted from the pig feeders of this country and we have the results in pig production.</P>
    <P>On the same basis, since the 1st February, 1956, to the present day he has extracted at least £320,000 more. That is 1,000,000 of money contributed by the pig feeders of this country to pay the flour subsidy for the Minister for the past 18 months.  Let us see the class of people from whom this money has been taken.  I happened to be a member of the deputation that called on the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the Minister who has a mind like a sewer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Withdrawn.  If the Minister has any doubts of what I think of him I can tell him another time.  When that Minister reduced the price of feeding barley to the farmers by £4 per ton he was waited on by a deputation from the Beet Growers' Organisation and this is what he told us: &ldquo;The small farmer in the west, the man with the ten acres and the wife and six children, feeds pigs.  Am I going to increase the price of feeding stuffs to him for the big farmer with the two motor cars who grows barley?&rdquo; That was his statement, but the same Minister now sits as mute as a mouse while his colleague comes along and <Col N="179" /> robs those pig feeders of over £900,000 in 18 months.</P>
      <P>What have been the results of the activities of this Minister on production? Mark you, it is rather an extraordinary thing that whole wheat is bought at the present day from 60/- to 65/- a barrel while offals, bran and pollard are at present £28 10s. per ton in Cork, £27 10s. per ton in Dublin, £30 per ton in Dundalk, and £28 10s. in County Sligo.  The economic price of those offals is somewhere around £17 per ton.  If they were worth £20 per ton in September, 1954, when this Minister came into office and when the price paid for Irish wheat was £32 per ton, what are they worth to-day? What are they worth to-day when we have the penal taxation on home produced wheat in this country of £5 per ton imposed by that Minister and his colleagues?  By increasing the price from the economic price of £17 per ton to the £28 per ton paid to-day, this Minister has collected, by dragging from every hole and corner in this country, every penny he could gather. The Minister says it would not go to the pig feeders anyway and he says this is a Fianna Fáil proposal.  I wish to tell him it is not.  It came in with himself.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;100,000 tons of wheat brought in here to feed the Irish people and the price of which was borrowed from the Canadian Government. Why do you not get out?  A handful of beggars! Those are some of the activities that we hear all about.  What is the result of that extraction from the Irish farmer?  You had a reduction last year of 159,476 pigs in this country. That is the &ldquo;increased production&rdquo; caused by the Minister as a result of this penal tax on pig feeders.</P>
      <P>On top of that activity we find, in June of this year, a further reduction of 58,700 pigs.  That is 200,000 pigs&mdash;a drop in production of 200,000 pigs as a result of penal taxation on the unfortunate pig feeder in this country. Then the Minister comes along, like Pontius Pilate, and says: &ldquo;It is not I.&rdquo;  Is there any decency left over there at all?  Is this nation, for which our comrades died, to be bankrupted by a parcel of lawyers and a parcel of nitwits?  Is that what we are coming to, or are they going to get out decently? I understood that when a Government looked to a nation for credit in the shape of a loan and when that nation had not trust enough in that Government to give the loan that, as a result of the lack of confidence shown, the least those gentlemen would do would be to go out of office.</P>

      <P>I cannot help the disorderly remarks of the Minister.  One would expect that, when attention was called to the facts, those people who go out shouting &ldquo;more production&rdquo; to the unfortunate farmers would remove this penal tax of £8 a ton.  When this money is collected by the millers, as the Minister pretends, there should be a very simple way of utilising that money for the reduction of the price of offals for pig-feeding.</P>
      <P>If imported bran and pollard are to-day costing £28 10s. a ton&mdash;we were told last year that wheat should not be grown in this country because it could be imported cheaper&mdash;and if they are importing wheat cheaper than £28 10s., why buy the skin of the wheat for £28 10s.?  That is a very simple question if there were any brains at all over there but there are not.  That is only one item but it is in common with the whole policy of those people over there as regards agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary farmer in this country working on any basis whatever does not know where he is from morning until night.  When he grew wheat this monstrosity of a Minister came along and slashed it by £5 a ton.  When he grew feeding barley he was slashed £4 a ton on that.  Then we go over to the Canadians with our hat in our hand and ask for 100,000 tons of wheat and the Canadian Government had to guarantee the price of it, to feed the Irish people to-day.  That is what we are brought to.  These are the &ldquo;better times&rdquo; that we heard all about and this is the &ldquo;cheaper food&rdquo;.  The townspeople and the city people have told you to get out.  The country <Col N="182" /> people of Leix-Offaly have told you to get out.  Cork City has told you to get out.  When are you going out?  Even the pigs are emigrating now; 200,000 of them have emigrated in the last two years, through the activities of our Minister for Industry and Commerce. We got nothing for them.  That is the worst of it.</P>
    <P>There should not be the slightest difficulty in transferring that money, when collected, from the pockets of the miller or rather the bottomless pocket of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, into the pockets of the pig-feeders. It, should not be beyond the wisdom of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; it should not be beyond the ability of all the civil servants in his Department to devise a scheme by which, if imported offals are costing £28 and the economic price of the home-produced offals is £17, one could be placed beside the other and a dividing line arrived at and that price be charged all round.  Instead of that, we have the activities of those gentlemen over there who are concerned only with where they will get money and do not give a hang whom they rob to get it.  That is not what I think but what every decent-minded man in this country thinks of them to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong the debate or to hold up the House.  I am prepared to have the decision of the House now, knowing that there is a majority of five there but I promise you there will not be a majority of five there this day month.</P>

    <P>As regards part (b), the State contribution towards the social insurance scheme is related to the excess of expenditure over income of the Social Insurance Fund, out of which all benefits under the scheme are payable, and is not related to any particular benefit. Similarly, the ordinary rates of employment contributions payable by employed contributors and their employers are not referable to any particular benefit.  It is not possible, therefore, to furnish the additional amounts paid to date towards unemployment benefit by (i)  the State and (ii)  contributors as a result of the recent increases in the rates of employment contributions and benefits.</P>

      <P>I have received a compulsory purchase order from the Limerick Corporation.  The order is dated the 27th February, 1956, and covers the acquisition of land at Upper Carey's Road, Limerick, for the erection of 50 houses.  Objections against the order having been lodged with me, I am arranging for the holding of a public local inquiry in the near future.</P>

      <P>The cost of road reconstruction is dependent on so many factors (such as foundation, drainage, availability of materials), that it would be impossible to give an accurate and representative estimate of general application.  Some figures have however been taken out in the Department and they may be regarded as comparative.  They refer to the provision of a road with a carriageway of 18 ft. carrying a reasonable amount of traffic.  The figures are:&mdash;(a)  concrete, reinforced £9,400 per mile, (b)  tar or bitumen macadam £4,000 per mile, (c) water-bound macadam surface dressed £4,000 per mile.</P>
