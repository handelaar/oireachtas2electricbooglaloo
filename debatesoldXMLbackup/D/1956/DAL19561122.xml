No. 2 is to be resumed immediately after questions, which will be taken at 3 o'clock, and, when No. 2 is completed, the order will be resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to put before the House a point of view which has occurred to me and which has been submitted to me by certain people who were concerned with the constitution of the board.  As the Bill reads at present, under Section 5 the board would consist of a chairman, a managing director and three ordinary members.  The point of view has been put forward with regard to boards of this type that a more effective and more efficient organisation would be acquired by having a board with a chairman and a manager and not a managing director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are quite obviously two points of view on a matter like this.  I do not purport to be in any way particularly experienced or to have any special knowledge as to which is the better arrangement.  It seems to me, however, that the main disadvantage in an organisation of this description of having a managing director is that you will have one person on the board of directors who, by reason of the fact that he is also responsible for the day-to-day running of the insurance corporation <Col N="1355" /> and by reason of the fact that he is the only person who is in day-to-day contact with all the facts and all the figures and statistics on which the running of the insurance organisation exists, will have too great a preponderance in the policy-making of the board.  In other words, whilst it may be desirable that the man who is ultimately responsible for the day-to-day administration of the organisation should have a say in policy, that is outweighed by the danger that, notwithstanding even a good board or a board of strong personalities, you will end up in a situation in which he is running the thing on his own.</P>
    <P>My suggestion in these amendments is that the board will remain without the manager as a member of it, that it will have the responsibility for policy decisions and that then the manager will have the responsibility of carrying out the decisions.  That has got the undoubted advantage that the ultimate responsibility for the running of the insurance corporation will rest on the board&mdash;and it will rest on five people.  Under such circumstances, there can be no danger of a manager, no matter how forceful or efficient he may be, as it were, controlling both the policy and administration.  His function will be to administer and to administer in accordance with the policy laid down by the board.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, in the ordinary way be obvious that he would have audience of the board and his views would be considered carefully by the board.  It seems to me that the method which I suggest is inclined to be, for this particular type of organisation, more efficient and less likely to lead to the organisation being run by one person, which would not be desirable.  If it were a question of running a profit-making organisation, possibly the managing director system is wise, but in this case I think possibly the proposal I make would be more desirable.  It is not a matter of tremendous concern or principle, but I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of doing more in that way or considering the possibility of framing this section so that the board could decide on either method, but certainly <Col N="1356" /> not to tie them down to having a managing director on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that in relation to a matter of this kind there are two points of view.  I have had some examination made as to the practice adopted in relation to similar types of boards over the years and, frankly, there does not appear to be any settled practice.  In relation to some boards there is a managing director and in relation to others, such as Fógra Failte, or An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, there are managers.  The one matter that does impress me in relation to what Deputy Finlay has said is the fact that there may be some merit in keeping the policy-making part of the board's activities divorced and separated from its administrative work. If there is a managing director who runs the board in a full time capacity he, in effect, will become also the policy maker for the board because his prestige inevitably will be so great that his views would sway the members of the board.  Unless any other Deputies have views on this matter, I think the best thing I can do is to consider the matter further between this and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question seems to be whether the chairman would be whole-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not imagine so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If he were whole-time, it is quite obvious you would have two heads and it would then be better to have the manager system. If his position is such that he can give constant attention to the organisation but would not have the actual administration of the organisation, then it seems to me that you would want at the board somebody who is fairly constantly in touch with the work as a whole.  Whether the chairmanship and managing directorship could be put together and have the other persons as a council is another point.  In general I would be in favour of having, not a managing director, but a manager.  A great deal would depend on the position of chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new sub-section:-</P>
      <P>()  A member of the board shall hold office on such terms (other than the payment of remuneration and allowances for expenses) as shall be fixed by the Minister at the time of his appointment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this is to add a sub-section. Deputies will see, in the section as it stands, that in sub-section (3) the term of office of a member of the board shall be such period not exceeding five years.  But there was no provision in the section referring to the terms upon which a director may be appointed.  For instance as the section stands at the moment, when it obviously was not intended, the Minister could not provide for part-time or whole-time directors and the purpose of the amendment is to give that power and to make it clear that on appointment the Minister may define terms upon which a director may hold office.</P>

It is available in the report of the advisory body and in collecting and accumulating that matter actuaries and other matters were considered.

      <P>The usual provision is that they are in for a definite number of years.  I do not know the position with regard to the E.S.B.  I remember we had some case long ago for that.  It is nearly always a matter for the Dáil when that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that Section 7 is similar to the section in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, the Sea Fisheries Act, which establishes An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and the Opticians Act.  In the case of Bord na Móna and the E.S.B., the power of removal rests with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better to have it with the Government? There will always be the suggestion that if a member of a board is removable by the Minister directly, the board is under the Minister's thumb and that its independence to a large extent is interfered with.  I know there is a difficulty on the other hand that if somebody is quite unsatisfactory and you want to get a satisfactory person in his place you have to wait for a period of five years.  You have to choose between two evils so to speak. I think it would be safer if a matter like that was a governmental action and that a member be removable by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a fixed period of office and if the person was removable only by the Government, it might give the board greater security and independence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made an analogy between this board and the Fisheries Board.  There are two differences, <Col N="1360" /> I think, that should be noticed. One is that the period of appointment in the Fisheries Board is two years. This provides for a period of five years. There is another very important difference and it is that the board administers the powers conferred by the Act in the matter of the Fisheries Board.  Here the Minister is taking powers under Section 4 to specify what benefits may be granted by the board. I think these are two important differences which do not make the analogy as precise as the Minister seems to think it is.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 14, to delete &ldquo;not be present during any discussion by&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;take no part in any deliberation or decision of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with a matter raised on Second Reading by, I think, Deputy Barrett.  Section 10 of the Bill, did not prevent a member of the board taking part in a decision relating to a contract in which he is interested although it did prevent him from taking part in a discussion upon the contract.  It is more usual in the case of statutory powers to refer specifically to a decision as well as a discussion. The amendment is for the purpose of bringing it more in line with the usual practice.  The purposes of the section are better achieved, I think, by the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is an important section because it is one of <Col N="1361" /> the sections which, in fact, determine the amount of the premium.  Section 4 of the Bill says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board shall so fix the subscriptions provided for by schemes under this section that taking one year with another the revenue of the board from subscriptions together with its other revenues (if any) shall be sufficient, but only sufficient (as nearly as may be), after the board has made such allowance as it thinks proper for reserves, depreciation and other like purposes, to meet the charges (including repayments of loans to the Minister) properly chargeable to revenue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I assume that the capital charges on the sum of £25,000 will not be excessive. In fact, as I indicated, when speaking on the Money Resolution, it is doubtful whether the board will be called upon to repay and that this so-called loan will not turn out to be a grant.  It is very difficult to see this scheme being a success as sub-section (4) of Section 4 is to determine the basis upon which the payments are to be made.  It is very relevant, therefore, in connection with Section 13 to bear that in mind, because among the charges which will naturally fall to be defrayed out of the premium income will be the amount to be paid by the board to its officers and servants out of the funds at its disposal.</P>
      <P>The House will note that this is left entirely to the discretion of the board. Again, we are going to set up here a sheltered employment which is not going to be subject to any control by the Government or by the House in so far as the financial implications of that employment are concerned.  I do not want the Minister to get up and allege in his usual way that I want the Government to run this board.  I do not because I think the Government would make as much a mess of the affairs of this company as it did of the country.  Having regard to the Minister's obligations to the Oireachtas and to the policy-holders, if any people do take out insurance policies under this scheme, he should exercise some sort of control over the manner in which the board will spend the funds which it secures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> There is nothing in this section to show the Minister will do that and we are probably going to be faced with the situation in which, whenever a statutory undertaking like C.I.E. or the E.S.B. cannot pay their way because, among other things, they have to meet the charges for the remuneration of their employees, then the Dáil is going to be asked to come in and save this company from collapse.</P>
    <P>The plea will be made that the Dáil is asked to come in on behalf of premium holders.  What in fact will happen is that they will be asked to come in here on behalf of the employees of this company and to subsidise the officials of this company.  I suggest the Minister should consider whether, in order to ensure that the company is being operated efficiently and economically, the scale of remuneration at least in the formative years of the company will be subject to some sort of supervision or veto on his part. I am certain that that veto would not be unreasonably exercised, but so long as the company owes money to Dáil Eireann, to the Government or to the Central Fund, surely there is a case for ensuring that the affairs of the company will be administered as economically as possible and that we will not have the demoralising spectacle we have in the case of other public bodies of ex-civil servants and others being paid salaries which are not at all commensurate with the salaries paid to civil servants in the service or even to members of the Government for directing the affairs of the country, indeed salaries which bear no relation to the remuneration which would be given in ordinary private employment for the same sort of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this matter.  I am aware, as was pointed out by some Deputies already, that if this Bill is subject to criticism it certainly is liable to criticism on the grounds that it has been thought necessary to retain ministerial control in relation to quite a number of matters dealt with by the board. That is unfortunate but it has been found necessary because the object of the board, the conduct of health insurance, <Col N="1363" /> is largely a new venture which must be experimental for some time. Being a new venture it is dealing with a matter of deep interest to the people and a matter in respect of which the Minister for Health has a deep responsibility.</P>
      <P>That refers to the activities of the board in carrying out what will be their statutory obligation.  The section that Deputy MacEntee has questioned refers to the internal working of the board, its employment of servants and officers to carry out its statutory undertaking.  To my mind it would be quite wrong that there should be Civil Service control over the employment and over the discipline&mdash;because that would be entailed&mdash;of the officers and servants of the board.  It would be quite wrong, in my opinion, and it would also be exceptional, because in relation to no other board I know of is it suggested that the Minister, who may be responsible to the Dáil for the board, exercises any scrutiny or power in relation to its purely internal matters.</P>
      <P>I agree, of course, it is obvious that any of the necessary expenditure of the board must have some effect on the premium the board will find it necessary to charge.  That is perfectly obvious.  That matter was taken fully into consideration by the advisory body in considering what premiums might be charged.  In fact the percentage they considered, the percentage of 30 per cent., is perhaps erring very much on the generous side in relation to the administrative expenses.</P>
      <P>I would draw Deputy MacEntee's attention to the fact that in Sections 19, 20 and 21, safeguards are provided in a proper way to ensure that this board will not act in any irresponsible manner in relation to its expenditure.  It must keep accounts.  It must have its accounts audited by duly qualified auditors.  The Minister must table here in the House the yearly accounts and audit of the board.  In addition, the board must make an annual report, and finally, the board is under a statutory obligation to furnish the Minister with any information he may require with regard to its proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I think those provisions are wide enough to ensure that the members appointed to this board will operate the machinery envisaged here with common sense and with the idea of making the scheme a success.  I am quite certain they will do so.  I have no reason for thinking otherwise and I do not propose to consider the improbable. The men appointed to this board will be asked to carry out their statutory obligation and I am quite certain they will be interested in doing so.  With the provisions in Sections 19 to 21 care is taken to ensure that the proceedings of this new board will be subject to general scrutiny, that their financial affairs will be examined yearly and that the resulting information will be available to Deputies.  If it is found that the board is acting irresponsibly and not doing its job, there is provision in the Bill for dealing with that and the Minister for Health will be responsible to the Dáil to ensure that that will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just told the House that he has very definite powers of control in relation to this board but that these powers of control relate only to the external affairs of the board.  In that connection he has referred us to Sections 19 and 20.  May I dispose of those first of all?  He says it will be seen from Sections 19 and 20 that great care has been exercised in order to ensure that the proceedings of this company on its financial side will be kept under careful scrutiny.  One would think we were having novel provisions, in the formulation of which a great deal of midnight oil was burned, included in this Bill for the first time.  The contrary is the case.  These are the usual provisions which appear in most of the Acts of the Oireachtas, in fact, in all the Acts of the Oireachtas in which it is proposed to set up, under the authority af the Oireachtas, boards to engage in undertakings which involve the expenditure of funds to be provided by the Oireachtas, and in many cases involve the expenditure of funds which are not provided by the Oireachtas but by the general public.  An instance of that is the Irish Racing Board.  We get the accounts of that body and they are made available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> The point I am getting at is that I want to show how ill-considered many of the privileges in this Bill are when the Minister is driven to refer to Sections 19 and 20 in order to show that this Bill has not been hurriedly drafted and with the idea of giving the public the impression that it has been carefully considered and not that it is being introduced by him for no other purpose than as a piece of election propaganda.  Sections 19 and 20 appear in every Act of this Oireachtas under which a statutory or a semi-statutory body has been set up.  They appear in the E.S.B. Act, in the Bord na Móna Act, in Córas Tráchtála, in Córas Tionscal and in a whole caucus of legislation of that sort.</P>
    <P>We are now asked to believe that the mere fact that Sections 19 and 20 have been included in the Bill indicates that a great deal of thought has been given to ensure that the affairs of the board will be efficiently and economically administered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also said that he has endeavoured in this Bill not to interfere in the board's internal administration of its affairs and that he proposes only to try to control the board in relation to its acts in regard to its relation with its policy holders. But what about Section 15?  That is the section which follows almost immediately after Section 13.  Section 15 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board may, with the approval of the Minister, make a scheme (in this section referred to as a pension scheme) for the provision of pensions or gratuities or pensions and gratuities, for or in respect of such officers and servants of the board as it may think fit and any scheme so made shall be carried out by the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of the same section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board may, with the approval of the Minister, at any time by a subsequent pension scheme (in this sub-section and in subsequent sub-sections of this section referred to as an amending scheme) amend a pension scheme or a previous amending scheme, and any such amending <Col N="1366" /> scheme may be expressed to operate retrospectively.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is not the formulation of such a pension scheme and the making of provisions for pensions and gratuities an internal matter for the board?  The Minister has seen fit to take control of such matters.</P>
    <P>In relation to Section 13, which is the really important section, the Minister has not taken any such precautionary steps in relation to the conduct by the board of its affairs.  I wish to make my position quite clear in this matter.  If this was an undertaking which was firmly established, which had proof given of its success and proof that it was being efficiently administered, I would be the first member of this House to decry any attempt on the part of the Minister or of the House to interfere with the internal administration of the company. This board is still almost entirely in its conceptual state.  All we know about it is that it is going to have five directors, an actuary and a staff.  We have no idea as to what the benefits or what the premiums will be or how much the board is going to charge in respect of its benefits.</P>
    <P>If the Bill goes through the House the board will only be in its early formative stages.  There is only the germ of an idea here and how long that germ is going to be in the gestation stage we have no evidence.  All during that period of gestation, the board is going to have a free hand in relation to the expenditure of money placed at its disposal by the Oireachtas.  When the scheme is being formulated, the Minister, in his own interests and in the interests of the public, ought to take some care to regulate the manner in which the board will determine the salaries to be paid to its officers and its servants.  The board should not be given a free hand in the initial years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also said, and I am now going back to Section 4, that he does not propose to interfere with the internal affairs of the company. If that is so how is the Minister going to operate Section 4?  Section 4 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board shall make and carry out a scheme of voluntary health insurance <Col N="1367" /> for defraying, to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify, the cost to persons paying subscriptions to the board in respect thereof, and to dependents of such persons, of such medical, surgical, hospital and other health services as the Minister may from time to time specify.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board may make and carry out such other schemes of voluntary health insurance as it may think fit, subject to the consent of the Minister in regard to the scope and extent of the benefits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of what the Minister has said, that is a position which must be related to the provisions which are contained in Section 13.  So far as I can see, the Minister has not taken any power to regulate the position of the board or to say to them that they pay such and such benefits.  Having regard to sub-section (4) of Section 4, it does not appear as if the board is compelled to formulate a scheme of premiums and relate such a scheme to the benefits which the Minister shall specify.  If that position is to be allowed to continue I think it will be highly detrimental to the scheme.  The premiums will bear no relation to the benefits and the scheme will not be the success which we would all like it to be.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that the Minister ought to give some further consideration to the provisions of Section 13 between now and the Report Stage and at least take the power to compel the board to submit the salaries which it proposes to pay to its officers and servants for the approval of the Minister. That is done in relation to other insurance societies and I think it is a very salutary obligation to have imposed on them because it did mean, among other things, that there was a general degree of uniformity on the basis of equality as between those who were compelled to be members of the societies on the one hand and those who were the servants of the societies on the other hand.</P>

      <P>Of course, that was Deputy MacEntee yesterday, not being helpful.  I do not know whether Deputy MacEntee is still playing the rôle of hatchet man here to-day or not but what would Deputy MacEntee as a hatchet man say if Section 13 of the Bill said: &ldquo;The board shall, with the consent of the Minister, appoint such officers and servants as they think proper&rdquo;?  Deputy MacEntee would say: &ldquo;Look at this.  This is an effort now that the Minister will appoint actually the servants of the board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see that a case could be made, although so improbable as scarcely requiring consideration; but, testing all these things by improbabilities, I can see that the board, if it appointed <Col N="1369" /> an undue number of officers and servants, might conceivably put the expenses so high that the resulting premium might not sell.  That, I consider to be entirely improbable, but I suppose it could happen if people behaved in a very irresponsible manner. Certainly, I would be prepared to consider that possibility between this and Report Stage, but I would ask Deputy MacEntee if the provisions of Section 19 are in similar Bills, does that fault them?  If, in previous legislation, successive Ministers in different Governments have found provisions such as are contained in Sections 19 and 20 to be necessary, is not that the greatest proof that they have considerable merit?  Remember that under Section 19 of this Bill the public can see each year what element in their premium is attributable to administrative costs and the board is under a statutory obligation to sell its policy.  That is the effect of Section 4. If, in fact, the board is not selling its policy&mdash;and from its yearly accounts it is clear that it is not selling because its administrative expenses put the premium too high&mdash;it means that the board is not doing its job and that would be a very proper ground for the Minister or the Government to remove the board.</P>
    <P>But, on the assumption that Deputy MacEntee is trying to be helpful, I will certainly have this matter further examined between now and Report Stage.  If I felt that it might be necessary to provide some ministerial scrutiny or examination in relation to officers and servants, I think it should only be for the initial period, such as, for example, the period during which a loan may be provided by the Minister. We will be coming to that later, but I will examine it from that point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it has been suggested from this side of the House that there should be control after the initial period during which the board would be liable to repay the advance to the Government.  One of the things I am uneasy about, particularly with regard to sub-section (2), which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An officer or servant of the board <Col N="1370" /> shall hold his office or employment on such terms and conditions as the board from time to time determines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>is that these terms and conditions might include provision for a pension or gratuity or some such thing on retirement from the position.  I believe that &ldquo;with the Minister's approval&rdquo; is not anything like as wide as the Minister himself now suggests.  One of the things that the Minister should guard against is any provision for a pension or gratuity for the officers or servants of this board until it is proved that the scheme will work.  One of the reasons why I approve so much of this Bill is that it is trying to put into effect the principle of co-operation between people.  If these servants and officers are given straight away the privilege of a guaranteed pension and gratuity, these pensions and gratuities have to come out of the premium moneys that will be received and cannot come out of any other fund.  The original loan has to be repaid over a period, so that any provision for gratuities or pensions will have to come out of the premium money and it is the belief expressed by Deputy Hillery and others, who have experience in these matters, that it will take a wholehearted effort on the part of everybody inside and outside this House if the scheme is to be a success and that it will take at least five years before we can know definitely one way or the other whether the scheme will be a success or not.</P>
    <P>For that reason and because it is a matter of co-operation, the people who are employed as officers or servants of this board should be told straight away that they are asked to co-operate in an effort to put voluntary insurance on a sound footing in this country and that they will not be given pensions or gratuities until it has been abundantly proved that a satisfactory scheme has been devised and that it shows every sign of being permanent. If what the experts say is true and it will take three to five years as a minimum period before we know one way or the other, it is no great hardship on the people who, in the meantime, as Deputy MacEntee said, will be given fairly fat remuneration out of moneys <Col N="1371" /> provided by this House, to be asked to forgo the prospect of a pension or gratuity on retiring until such time as they have done the work which will make it permanent.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the people who may be appointed might be taking a slight risk in that matter&mdash;I do not think so&mdash;but if we are to succeed in establishing the principle in the Bill, we must look at it from the co-operative point of view and not from the point of view from which too many people seem to be looking at life nowadays, that is, that if they are not secure in a position they will not take it.  There is far too much of that atmosphere in this country at the present time.  We should do nothing to encourage it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to agree with Deputy Flanagan's general principle.  Section 15 would prohibit the creation of any pension or gratuity scheme except with the approval of the Minister, which would probably be sufficient safeguard unless&mdash;and this is the point I would like the Minister to consider; it is really only a drafting point&mdash;it were considered that sub-section (2) of Section 13 should read, &ldquo;on such terms and conditions except conditions of pension and gratuity&rdquo;.  Reading Sections 13 and 15 together, almost certainly, the only power of the board to grant a pension or gratuity to a servant or an officer is under Section 15 and you could not read Section 13, having regard to the terms of Section 15, as meaning that, under that section, without the approval of the Minister, a pension or gratuity could be given.  That is a question of drafting.  I may be wrong about that.  Perhaps the Minister would consider whether it is necessary to put some special proviso in Section 13, preventing it being operated as a pension or gratuity section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put another point of view to the Minister in that regard.  If you appoint people who are entirely inexperienced and who have had no previous contact with this type of work, that is one thing but, if you want to get experienced people working this scheme from the <Col N="1372" /> very start, who may have established positions, whose experience would be beneficial in operating this scheme, I think some provision must be made for pensions or gratuities.  I do not think we will get the best type of candidate if you impose restrictions of that kind at the very outset.  Such people are not likely to transfer from established positions.  Undoubtedly, in a scheme such as this, it is essential to get experienced people and every inducement should be held out to them. That is just another point of view but all points of view should be considered when we are dealing with a new project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite conscious of the fact that, in order to get this scheme working successfully, certainly the manager or managing director will have to be a man with particular qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would suggest itself that he would need considerable managerial experience in business, particularly in insurance business.  Obviously, a man who would be considered as suitable might already be in a position which he could not forfeit unless there were some particular safeguard for him.  That is inevitable. I think that would appeal to the good sense of most Deputies.  As Deputy Finlay has said, in relation to Deputy Flanagan's fears, it might be more relevant to consider that in regard to Section 15, but the general pension scheme will require ministerial approval and, of course, would not go into operation unless, in fact, the board could afford it.  &ldquo;Affording it&rdquo; means that the board's administration must be such that it can put on offer a policy of health insurance at a premium so low that it will sell and be attractive to a large number of people. The effect of a pension scheme on the finances of the board would have to be considered very carefully and I would not imagine that it would be possible to have a general pension scheme until the insurance scheme is pretty well established.  However, that is a matter that we might consider again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he has taken power to remove the board, but once the board has created a superstructure of administrative costs, he would have created a position which he could not readily alter.  He has given himself power in Section 4 to prescribe benefits.  The income of the board will certainly be affected by the administrative costs.  The Minister's decision on benefits must be related to the income of the board and, if the income of the board is, in turn, affected by an unduly high scale of administrative costs, is not the power that the Minister has taken in Section 4 greatly reduced and, quite apart from a pension scheme, in giving independence to the board, will not the Minister have in fact adversely affected the chance of a scheme of voluntary health insurance recommending itself to the public?</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to have a doubt in the back of his mind as to the genuineness of the adherence which we have expressed to the principle of voluntary insurance.  We are perfectly genuine in saying that we wish well any scheme of voluntary health insurance and we feel that it is a pity that there should be any fault in the mechanism which is being provided to give effect to it which might obstruct it for a very long time and it is that consideration we want the Minister to take into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there is an initial period of four or five years in which nobody can be certain as to the permanence of this scheme and that during that period you have to build up a suitable staff in the hopes of success?  You cannot enter into a definite contract for the future. In the first four or five years it seems to me that you might have to give higher remuneration over the initial period, instead of the usual thing, a superannuation scheme, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I think you will have to deal with the scheme in two parts, the initial tentative period of four or five years in which you may have to give <Col N="1374" /> larger salaries than would be usual, and endeavour to attract into the service the people that are necessary to make it a success, and then deal with permanency afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Finlay that you cannot properly bring in Sections 13 and 15 together, but the point I was making was that Section 15 should be taken out altogether for the very reasons that Deputy de Valera has given.  This matter, in any event, is a matter of psychology.  The board is going to be under an intolerable burden from its employees, during the period when the staff think the insurance scheme is going well.  After two years, they will be saying: &ldquo;What about Section 15? What about the other provisions?  What about gratuities, bonuses, etc.?&rdquo; I think that should be taken out altogether until the Minister is satisfied that the scheme has achieved a permanent basis.  As has been pointed out, we want to know how things will work out.  We may have to give more by way of salaries to the officers and staff.  If this section is included, it will be waved in front of the board and the Minister by the servants of the board and constant pressure will be put on, whereas, if it is cut out altogether, Section 13, with the amendment that an officer or servant of the board shall hold his office or employment on such terms and conditions as the board, with the approval of the Minister, from time to time determines, would settle the whole thing.  Cut out all reference to pensions, gratuities and so forth.  That would be a better approach and, as Deputy de Valera said, it would be far more realistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said and what has been said by Deputy MacCarthy and others emphasises the need for the Minister to exercise some sort of control over the remuneration, terms and conditions of employment which the board may offer to its officers and servants.  Now, it may be difficult to attract the person of a particular calibre whom the board envisages as being essential to direct and head its organisation.  If that is the case, that will put a degree of <Col N="1375" /> temptation in the way of the board which may have repercussions elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Some of us have had experience over the past three or four years of the way in which some statutory bodies bid against those engaged in private undertakings for persons of a particular type.  What happens then is that the highest bid, which is offered by the statutory undertaking with very little responsibility to anybody for the manner in which it spends public money, immediately becomes the standard of remuneration in other undertakings. While everybody appreciates that it will be necessary to get a man of the essential capacity to initiate and formulate the scheme, nevertheless, in trying to get that man, there should be some regard to the needs of the general body of the taxpayers who, themselves, have to try to keep their businesses afloat and to earn a profit which they have, of course, to share with the State and the community through the operations of the corporation profits and income-tax.</P>
      <P>That is one of the reasons why I am really concerned that the Minister in the early stages of this company, certainly during the first five years of its operation, should require the terms and conditions to be subject to his approval.  That, at least, would be one of the ways in which his position as Minister would be safeguarded.  I hope that between now and the Report Stage the Minister may see his way to include a proviso of that sort.</P>

      <P>On the general terms of the section itself, it seems to me very probable that it could be construed to permit the board to operate in either of two ways&mdash;through a whole-time servant employed throughout the entire week and paid a salary or through a part-time servant employed part of the week and paid a salary.  Probably in its early stages the board would want to do what so many insurance companies do, namely, get together with other companies for the purposes of claims investigation, claims settlement or selling insurance.  These companies employ agents who act as agents for more than one company in different lines of insurance.  It seems likely, though not absolutely certain, that the board would from time to time find it convenient to use the existing insurance organisation of an ordinary company for one particular function or one particular branch of its functions.</P>
      <P>An obvious example is the question of settlement of claims.  In this type of insurance, they will not be of great difficulty since it is really a question of vouching more than anything else. It is not like unliquidated claims in accident insurance.  One can conceive where, in a particular area, there might be a certain amount of health insurance&mdash;not a tremendous lot perhaps&mdash; and it would suit the company to engage in a contract with an existing commercial company and ask that company's inspector in that area to look after its interests for, say, six months or three months.  In such circumstances, I do not think the inspector would become an officer or servant of the board.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly approve of Deputy Finlay's submission in connection with this section.  If the <Col N="1377" /> section were to include &ldquo;agents of the board&rdquo;, that might cover what Deputy Finlay has in mind.  Obviously, we should do everything we can to encourage the board to reduce the cost of collection of premiums, settlement of claims investigation or anything else.  All these things involve expense and, if we can do anything to cut down expense, then we should do it.  I think the Minister will find this suggestion well founded.  The board will have the goodwill of existing companies, because, as I have already said, they do not themselves engage in this kind of insurance except on a very limited scale.  The board would not, therefore, be in competition with them.  Cooperation on the lines suggested by Deputy Finlay would help to keep down expenses and make the premiums attractive.</P>

I had not adverted to the point raised by Deputy Finlay or Deputy Flanagan that possibly under Section 14 there might be a suggestion that the board might be precluded from using, by agency agreements or commission agreements, other bodies or organisations, and I shall have it examined from that point of view.

      <P>On this section we had some discussion, as was inevitable, on Section 13.  I just want to make my position clear with regard to that.  It is always the belief that when you are introducing legislation of this kind you should try to provide for all possibilities.  You may, of course, know that some time later amending legislation may have to be passed but you still try when establishing a board of this kind to give it whatever powers are felt to be necessary.  For that reason, Section 15 provides the board, <Col N="1378" /> subject to the conditions set out in the section, with the power to provide a pension scheme for its staff.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies will appreciate that the staffs of all these semi-State boards, just as the staffs in the State service do, enjoy and are entitled to enjoy the benefits of a pension scheme. Naturally, the pension scheme that will be operated by this Health Insurance Board will be such scheme as it can afford because it will be related to whatever finances it has available having provided health insurance on terms that will sell to the public.  As I indicated, it may be some time before it is possible to provide the staff with such a scheme but I think it would be quite wrong if it were then necessary to come back to the Oireachtas with a proposal to amend this Bill when it becomes an Act in order to give the board power which, in fact, we should give them now.</P>
      <P>They cannot exercise this power without the approval of the Minister and, as I have indicated in relation to a number of matters already discussed, care will be taken by me and also, I believe, by the board, to ensure that whatever expenditure they engage upon will not have any harmful effect upon the success of the scheme.  Accordingly, before a scheme would be approved I, or any other Minister for Health, would have to be satisfied that it would not jeopardise the discharge of the main statutory functions of the board.</P>

      <P>No, I am told it would not.  I am told that in relation to a board of this kind, if they are to have a specific power such as that required to provide the pension scheme, it must be contained in the Bill itself. You must arm them with the power to do these things.  It could not be implied merely from power to employ servants or officers on terms they may determine, but I do agree with Deputy de Valera.  It is quite correct that this scheme could not be considered as a possibility until the board is established, and we can all well understand that there will be a probationary or trial period which under the Bill is thought to be five years.  It might be shorter, of course.  It might be that in two or three years' time the scheme would be well established, but certainly, until it is established, a pension scheme could not be operated.</P>

      <P>The object of this section is to enable the board to start.  It gives power to the Minister to provide such a sum of money as may be necessary for the initial expenses of the board, the expenses of equipping premises, engaging staff, drafting the schemes and so on.  It is obviously necessary that the board should have some fund on which to start preparing a scheme for sale to the public.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by a Deputy yesterday&mdash;and unfortunately it was headlined in one morning paper to-day, and I want to correct the impression that may thereby have been given&mdash;that the purpose of this £25,000 was to provide payment for the directors of the board. Of course that is not so.  The £25,000 is to cover the general initiation expenses of this board and Deputies can well appreciate the kind of expenses that would be involved.  The starting of a new board, engaged upon a very important public activity, will have a whole variety of necessary preliminary expenditure that must be met from somewhere.  Here it is proposed that it be met by an initial loan to the board which will have to be repaid, and I do not think it is unreasonable.  I particularly do not think it is fair to suggest that the object of it is to make enormous payments to directors.  It is not, and I hope no Deputy will think that is so.</P>

      <P>I think we could consider both of these sections together.  With regard to the second loan, or the loan to cover initial losses, I hope in fact that loan will never be called upon.  However, it is there as a power in the event of the board offering a scheme to the public and having the ill fortune of running into bad risks, say, in its first two years, or incurring a loss which might be evened out over a longer period.  If it had that ill fortune in the initial years its income would not be sufficient to meet the calls upon it and the object of Section 17 is to empower the Minister to help the board over that hump.  I hope it will never be called upon.  If the board get a fair break it should not be called upon.  The first loan will be needed because it will start the board off.</P>

It is not easy to see <Col N="1382" /> at present why it should be necessary to do this, but it is quite easy to see how there could be such a form of borrowing because the public might be quite willing to subscribe to it on a fixed debenture basis as distinct from a profit sharing basis.  It would not affect the non-profit earning basis of the organisation.  Circumstances might arise in which the board would run their business all right provided they were backed up by a certain amount of capital which the public might be prepared to subscribe in the manner I have suggested.</P>

      <P>(5)  The Minister shall, at least 21 days in advance, give notice of his intention to revoke a licence to the holder thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and amendment No. 10 might be considered together. <Col N="1384" /> As I indicated on the Second Reading, I felt it would be necessary to provide in this legislation for a control over the number of bodies engaged or proposing to engage in this form of health insurance.  The position is that there is a limited market available for this class of insurance.  It is limited by a number of factors but it is large enough to provide, I think, a worthwhile service. However, it is not so large that it could bear unlimited competition.  Up to the stage at which the advisory body, having examined this problem carefully over a period of 12 months, issued their report, the position was that no commercial insurance company in this country was prepared to provide this form of cover for the people.  One company had provided it for a short period of, I think, two years, but it found it uneconomic and pulled out. Accordingly, when the Advisory Body reported, there was, in effect, no cover of any kind being provided or proposed by any company entitled to operate insurance in this country.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of this Bill, I became aware that it was reasonable to believe that an outside syndicate which, for a particular reason, was entitled to carry out this type of health insurance in this country proposed to use the material collected and contained in the Advisory Body's report and to put such a scheme of insurance on offer here.  If it did so, it might well mean that, by the time this board was in operation, a fair portion of the limited market available would have disappeared and this board then would start its activities under considerable disadvantage.  I felt that that was not a prospect conducive to the success of the scheme.  I felt it would be regrettable if this form of insurance were operated or controlled not only without public scrutiny through our Parliament here but also from sources outside the country.  Accordingly, as I indicated, I propose to safeguard that position and the purpose of these amendments is to carry out that intention.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with both amendments together.  It will be provided in amendment No. 10 that, in effect, no <Col N="1385" /> body or organisation may carry out health insurance here without a licence from the Minister for Health.  Care is, however, taken to safeguard the position of a whole variety of existing insurance schemes which, in effect, do not interfere with the market intended for this body.  These schemes are set out in amendment No. 10.  First of all, the prohibition would not apply to benefits provided by a Minister of State, a trade union or society registered under the Friendly Societies Acts.  That would refer to the health insurance, say, carried out by the Department of Social Welfare.  It would also refer to the activities of some 30 friendly societies which disburse sickness benefit of one form or another to their members.  Certain trade unions also carry on a form of sickness benefit or sickness insurance. It is not intended that any of that class of insurance should in any way be interfered with.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is proposed to exclude from the prohibition &ldquo;a contract which is attached to or dependent on a contract of assurance on human life and under which the assurer has no right of cancellation and which also provides for the payment of moneys in case of sickness, injury or disease of the insured....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That class of contract is a contract which is provided by some insurance companies whereby you assure your life but, added to the life assurance, there is provision for certain payments in the event of sickness or accident, as specified in the policy.  It is not proposed to interfere with that class of insurance.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to interfere with &ldquo;a contract of insurance under which benefits are payable in respect of sickness, injury or disease of an amount calculated by reference to the duration of the sickness, injury or disease and not to the nature or cost of any hospital, medical, surgical or other health service, provided in respect of the sickness, injury or disease...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a particular form of insurance under which a person can insure, under a contract provided, for a certain weekly or other payment to him if he <Col N="1386" /> has an accident or gets sick but the payment has no reference to his hospital or medical expenses.  It is a contract for a fixed weekly payment if a certain contingency arises.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to interfere with &ldquo;a contract of insurance against or otherwise in relation to any accident causing or being a contributory cause of sickness, injury or disease to the person insured thereunder or to any other person under which benefits are also payable in respect of such sickness, injury or disease...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These exemptions are insurance policies which also provide cover against the medical and hospital expenses arising from the accident. Cases in point are ordinary insurance policies, motor insurance policies and employers' liability or public liability policies.  Again, it is not proposed to interfere with such forms of insurance.</P>
    <P>Lastly, the prohibition will not apply to any contract of insurance made before the passing of the Act.  In other words, if anyone has taken out a contract of health insurance, as defined here, with any insurance company entitled to engage in the business here, such contract will not in any way be interfered with.  As I indicated, the prohibition with regard to health insurance is provided for in amendment No. 10.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 9, there is the machinery with regard to licences.  It is provided that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant or refuse to grant to any person a licence to carry on this form of insurance.  There is a provision that the licence may contain conditions and, if the licensee does not act in accordance with these conditions, he will be guilty of an offence.  There is provision that a licence granted may be revoked at any stage.</P>
    <P>Generally, the effect of the two amendments would be that the activities of the new board would be safeguarded. The market would be retained for them without interfering with the kind of smaller schemes that have traditionally been in operation. I feel that, if power of this kind were not provided, the idea of health insurance <Col N="1387" /> could not possibly operate because this board, operating on limited funds&mdash;as I think it should operate&mdash;would at best find itself engaged in a sort of cut-throat competition with large syndicates controlling large moneys outside the State and the end, I think, would be the disappearance of this kind of scheme and this kind of experiment.</P>
    <P>I have quite naturally an aversion to monopolies of different kinds.  I think, generally speaking, competition is desirable and initially I was disposed to provide for competition in relation to this form of insurance also.  On closer examination I was compelled to the view that, if these safeguards were not provided, the whole idea of health insurance would fail, with results which I do not think would be desirable.  I am moving both amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate, generally speaking, the necessity for the amendments. Whilst one is normally very reluctant to see a monopoly I think the Minister has made a case justifying it in this instance.  The Minister may be able to give us some information on amendment No. 10.  I do not know if it is intended to terminate the existing provision for health and medical service provided by some firms for their employees.  Under the terms of this amendment I think it would be out for ordinary employees to contribute to a fund in the firm unless it was registered as a friendly society.</P>
      <P>An example is C.I.E. which has a scheme where, apart from any pension or gratuity scheme, a weekly contribution is made by an employee and in return he gets the cost of medical expenses defrayed.  In amendment No. 10 I think that would be prohibited.  I presume it would be a matter of licensing.  I know the Minister has power to license them.  It may be possible to contrive an amendment covering such benefits provided by an employer for his employees, as a result of payment by the employees, and being a scheme which continues only so long as the employment continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> Another matter, and I may be wrong, is in regard to sub-section 3 of paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) of the new section, in other words sub-section 3, (b) with &ldquo;three&rdquo; in Roman numerals. The Minister has mentioned that it is the intention to save from the prohibition such provisions for medical, surgical and hospital insurance, as is already contained in accident contracts, including motor accident contracts. That sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a contract of insurance against or otherwise in relation to any accident causing or being a contributory cause of sickness, injury or disease to the person insured thereunder or to any other person under which benefits are also payable in respect of such sickness, injury or disease, or&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware the commonest form of comprehensive motor insurance provides for hospital expenses being paid to the insured for any injury caused to him whilst he is driving a car and for any hospital or surgical attendance required by that injury.  It also provides for about five specified types of injury benefits but it does not provide for any general injury or general sickness or incapacity benefits. In other words, the normal scheme provides that if you lose an eye or a limb you get certain fixed payments. In addition to the two or three injuries I mentioned, is included a great number of injuries not coming within that class, for which hospital expenses are paid up to about £20 in most policies.  Under this sub-section, I do not think that form of insurance will be lawful any longer.  I am not making a drafting point but I think there is no doubt that it would be out, but I know the Minister intends to leave in the existing form of policies.  I would ask the Minister to have that point considered.</P>

      <P>The sub-section referred to is intended to exclude any form of motor insurance policy in respect of the cover it provides arising from an accident.  But if a company offers, as some of them do, a policy which also covers the cost of ill-health, not arising from an accident, it must be licensed.</P>

      <P>I gather from what the Minister says that he may have to license certain people who are carrying on business of this type.  If he licenses them, he has very drastic powers in regard to withdrawing the licences.  In fact I think it would be too drastic.  I know that there is a good deal of existing legislation in which Ministers have power to withdraw licences, but I think that power is always dependent on an offence being committed.  The Minister has absolute discretion.  I would like the Minister to look into the question and consider it before the next stage.  In amendment No. 9, sub-section (4), the Minister has absolute discretion to withdraw a licence.  I think if the Minister inserted the words &ldquo;where a person is convicted of an offence&rdquo; it would be quite all right, but it is a rather frightening thing that the Minister should have power to withdraw a licence in a commercial operation of this kind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 deals with the question of the preparation of the report, the council having already decided to make a declaration.  It is a machinery section.  It would appear from this that the council must put up a whole scheme and the Commissioners of Public Works as a result of that will proceed to further examine the matter. This is a justification section for the Commissioners of Public Works to proceed further.  That is all it means but why put the council to the expense of providing all the necessary information that is in that section in order that the Commissioners of Public Works will send down their engineers to further examine the scheme?  I want to put that to the Minister in all seriousness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the council in their wisdom and judgment, under Section 2, declare that the promotion of a coast protection scheme is expedient they will naturally not declare such a thing expedient unless they are aware it is expedient.  The council are being put to a great deal of expense.  They would probably have to call in an outside engineering staff to prepare the scheme on that basis.  It seems all waste to say that the next stage is that the Commissioners of Public Works will send their staffs down and the council must undertake to pay the Commissioners of Public Works for all they do in further examining the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> It might cost the local authority a considerable amount of money to put up all the data asked for.  If the council declared that it was necessary to promote a scheme for a certain section of the coast, that should be sufficient without having to provide all the technical data asked for in this section.  They will have to provide that information at their own expense and will probably have to call in an expert engineer to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain to the House exactly what is visualised.  Under Section 2 the consideration will be of a very general nature.  If the council or local authority concerned knows that there is a problem in general, then they will deal with the matter as visualised in Section 2.  Section 3 is not for the purpose of deciding on the best method of dealing with the matter but to ascertain the extent and the nature of the problem.</P>
      <P>I do not visualise that it will be necessary to go outside the ordinary engineering staff of the local authority to get the information that is visualised in Section 3 because it is not information as to the method of prevention of erosion, which might be, perhaps, of such a technical nature to require a consultant and so on, but it is more to see exactly what the nature and extent of the problem itself is.  It is when that information has been provided under Section 3 that the county council are in a position to take a more affirmative decision under the next following section, Section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Minister would read line 16 in Section 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the promoting authority shall cause a report to be prepared on the nature and probable causes of the relevant encroachment of the sea.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very technical matter, anyway. If it is to be strictly adhered to, it appears that the Commissioners of Works will not move until they get that technical information.  That is information which, I believe, no authority in the country could provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> Why put the council to all that trouble?  They would need highly qualified technicians to give them information of that kind and prepare a report.  Somebody would probably want 1,000 guineas for a report like that relating to a large area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the matter again and consider whether it is necessary to have all that data prepared at considerable cost.  Certainly in preparing a major scheme where there was no previous experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the preparation of a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  The probable cost is asked for.  No engineer will send in a report without examining the probable cost.  I can see what will happen.  The county manager or county engineer will say: &ldquo;You must get an outside engineer to do that job; our staff are incapable of doing it.&rdquo;  The council will know, even before they come to Section 4, that it will cost something like, say, £6,000.  The county manager or county engineer, or whoever is charged with the responsibility under Section 3, will not advise the council without going into all the details.  They may say right away: &ldquo;We have not the technical knowledge or experience of doing such a job&rdquo; and advise that an outside engineer be brought in.  That does not seem to be necessary where the facts are already known.  They are already known under Section 2, otherwise the council would not act under Section 2 at all.  They know there is a particular portion of the coast which requires attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read Section 2, it is really for the purpose of the local authority deciding that there is a problem to be dealt with.  That has been the great trouble we have had to meet all along&mdash;that it has been impossible for the local authority really to do anything about it or to make any contact with the central Government whatever.  Section 2 is simply leading up to Sections 3 and 4.  Section 2 makes it possible for the local authority to say there is a problem. Surely it is conceivable that the <Col N="1397" /> engineers of a county council would be in a position to produce a rough draft just to state that a problem exists. They are not asked, as Deputy Allen seems to imagine they are, to prepare a report; they are asked only to state that there is a problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was listening to Deputy Allen discussing Section 2.  If he is allowed discuss it, I should be allowed to do so also.  Section 2 is the section leading up to Sections 3 and 4.  The great difficulty so far in trying to deal with erosion has been that, even if the local authority decided that this trouble existed in part of the county, there was nothing they could do about it.  Section 2 enables them to do something now and it leads up to Sections 3 and 4.  I think it is eminently desirable and without it the Bill would be a total failure.</P>

Is it not a fact that this has been going on for hundreds of years and no Government before did anything about it?  Something is being done about it now.  I have experience of the problem.  The same thing as is happening in Rosslare is happening in the village where I live.  We have coast erosion in Laytown and it is a serious cases can be dealt with in the big problem there.  I believe the really <Col N="1398" /> manner suggested by the Bill.  If the local authorities are to take cognisance of the fact that the danger is there, surely if they do anything at all they will be doing better than has been done up to now.</P>

      <P>Up to the stage of the report, the whole expense in relation to this is under Section 3.  The whole regulation for the preparing of the report is in Section 3.  The expense of that is going to be pretty considerable as it will cover a lot of ground and I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am concerned about is that I see no need to put the council of a county to the expense entailed in Section 3, of providing all the technical data that must be provided. I can see no necessity for that, seeing that the Commissioners of Public Works are going to further examine the whole thing.  A much simpler form of information should be submitted at much less expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>After the general declaration has been made, as set out in Section 2, Section 3 is then meant to provide the general information as to the nature and extent of the problem on foot of which the Commissioners of Public Works can later go in and <Col N="1399" /> examine the problem in their capacity of specialist consultants.  Under Section 3 the general basis will be provided for the consultants to come in, the consultants in this case being the commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section would seem to me to be more a provision in respect of the minor schemes because the Minister and the commissioners already have a knowledge of the major schemes and there should be no need of going to any expense when they know where the trouble exists.  There should merely be an invitation that they ought to go back and examine the provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see duplication throughout this whole Bill.  It would take the local authority at least six months to get the technical data which is provided for under Section 3.  Delays in this instance are undesirable and it seems waste of time and money to have the local authority spending six months in getting the information that is required.  I think it should be possible to leave out Section 3 altogether and come along to Section 4 where the council would then invite the Commissioners of Public Works to come in and do the job.  As the Minister has said, the whole objective behind all this seems to be that the council will have to bear the major portion of the cost.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 states that after consideration of the report under Section 3 the promoting authority shall declare that a coast protection scheme is not to be proceeded with.  Under Section 3 it simply means that the report is furnished.  Under sub-section (c) of Section 4 it is stated that, if advised that the preparation of a coast protection scheme appears to be practical and desirable but that the works involved are of such difficulty or magnitude as to be incapable of successful execution by the promoting authority, that authority shall request the commissioners to undertake a further examination with a view to determining whether the preparation and execution of a coast protection scheme is practical and desirable.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see under Section 5 the commissioners can come down anyway and examine a scheme.  It is bad enough to have to pay 50 per cent. of the cost but in sub-section (2) of Section 4 it is stated that the resolution by which a request is made under this section to the commissioners to undertake a further examination shall include a declaration that the promoting authority will pay to the commissioners the costs and expenses incurred in carrying out such examination.</P>
      <P>This Bill ensures that the State will not have to pay more than 50 per cent. and that the local authority will be liable for the other 50 per cent.  In addition to being liable for 50 per cent., the local authority will also have to pay the Commissioners of Public Works for their expenses in coming down to inspect any scheme.  That is altogether apart from the 50 per cent. and I suggest that that expenditure should be included in the capital charge of 50 per cent. that the local authority has to pay.  Under this section as it stands, it is safe to say that in very many cases the local authority is going to be mulcted up to 75 or 80 per cent. of the total cost of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, the majority of such schemes should be paid for by the State because the State, in the person of the Land Commission, is largely responsible for the present <Col N="1401" /> condition of affairs.  There were estates all over the country which were compulsorily acquired under the 1923 Act.  The Land Commission had power then to withhold any portion of the purchase money it considered necessary in order to prevent erosion and encroachment.  In a large number of cases they did not do that.  They let the landlord get away with the loot.  They are coming along now and throwing the burden on to the ratepayers of any particular county to make up for their failure in that respect.</P>
    <P>The least we could expect from the Minister, under Section 4, is that all these expenses, whether caused by the Commissioners or by the local authority, should be paid by the State and that the local authority should not be compelled to pay the cost of having the Commissioners come down to examine a scheme.  I think it would be very unfair to put that cost on to the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that, under Section 4, when the local authority receive a report with the technical data required under Section 3, they will then have to bear the expense of the Commissioners coming down to examine the scheme and going over the same ground that has already been gone over.  Although the particular job visualised in Section 2 is an urgent job, the authority, knowing as a result of advice from their technicians that the financial burden will be heavy, will probably act under paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) and declare that a coast protection scheme is not to be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>They might go a little further and act under paragraph (c), if it is a major scheme, and may ask the Commissioners to undertake a further examination.  The resolution asking the Commissioners to undertake a further examination must be accompanied by a solemn declaration by the promoting authority that if the Commissioners undertake further examination the promoting authority will pay the costs.  That seems childish.  If it is not passing the buck, I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> The taxpayers have already provided that there will be Commissioners of Public Works with staffs and technicians and everything else.  The taxpayers have already provided for the payment out of the Exchequer.  I cannot recall any other piece of legislation that was passed by this House where the Exchequer proposed to make a 50 per cent. grant towards a project designed to protect the property of the people where the local authority was asked to pay, out of limited funds, the costs of an examination by the State authority.  It stretches things too far.</P>
    <P>The principle that it is sought to put across there is a new one in legislation. The Minister was a member of a local authority for quite a long time and he realises what is involved.  At least, the State should send its technicians to examine and report on a scheme that is considered necessary in order to save the lives and protect the property of a section of the community. The suggestion contained in this section is wrong.  It is a mean, rotten suggestion that the promoting authority must make a solemn declaration that they will pay.  The Minister may say that, if the scheme proceeds, finally the State will pay 50 per cent. of the cost of examination but I think local authorities have a high standard of decency&mdash;and, if it is necessary to pay, they should not be required to make a solemn declaration that they will pay.  That has not been the standard set here.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  Would he give us some justification for this unheard of suggestion that the State technicians are not available to advise on a coast erosion scheme in any part of this country unless the little ratepayers down the country pay for that advice? That is a new principle that it has been sought to enshrine in legislation here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the views expressed by Deputies Corry and Allen but I must say I cannot agree with them.  Deputy Allen went so far as to say that were it not for Rosslare Harbour these provisions would not be here.  There is much more than Rosslare Harbour in this country.  Section 4 (c) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" />&ldquo;if advised that the preparation of a coast protection scheme appears to be practicable and desirable but that the works involved are of such difficulty or magnitude as to be incapable of successful execution by the promoting authority...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where do we go from there?  We have in every local authority competent engineers.  We hear a lot about Governments passing the buck, but I am afraid too often in local authorities, and I speak as a member of one, we are inclined to pass the buck.  In this case we have engineers who could do many of the jobs we are anxious to have attended to under this Bill and it is within the competence of these people to report on these works. We may differ as to the type of scheme we want and we know there may be work of major importance to be done, but even at this stage if we can introduce through this Bill some measure of improvement in relation to small jobs we will be achieving something worth while.</P>
    <P>There are more important things in this Bill than the Deputy seems to think.  I have often heard Deputy Corry say, and I agree with him, that there are too many cases of appointing consulting engineers and asking Department officials to do work instead of allowing our own officials to tackle these problems.  Deputy Corry, in respect of part of his constituency, is faced with the problem of coast erosion just as I am in my constituency of South Cork.  I am convinced our country engineers are in a position to advise us from their own experience as to what should be done, and the contribution of 50 per cent. towards the execution of these jobs which are urgently required at the present time is a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Desmond.  I am surprised at Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen.  Deputy Allen knows from the papers this morning that another portion of Rosslare has been taken away.  Therefore this is an urgent matter and there should be no playing politics in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> Recently a hotel owner in Rosslare spent over £200 in an effort to save his property.  We have the Rosslare Committee which is composed of all political Parties and members of the Wexford County Council who have been pressing to have somebody made responsible for coast erosion.  I wonder are the Fianna Fáil Deputies jealous because this Government has introduced this Bill, and is it because they do not want to give the credit to the Minister and the Cabinet that we are told the Bill is this and that?  It is what the people in my constituency are looking for.  All along the coast from Rosslare right up to Deputy Allen's door in Courtown Harbour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>And further along, farm houses and other property are in danger and are being washed away. We have been asked if the Department should send down a man from Dublin to look at the harbour and Rosslare Strand and report back.  Our own county engineers to whom we look for guidance should be able to make a survey and advise as to what should be done in an urgent matter of this kind. That is what the people along the coast are waiting for and this House should not in any way try to hold up this measure.  Deputy Allen has met the people of that area along with other Deputies and now he has a different attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are opposing here is that a declaration must be given by the county council that they will pay the expenses of the commissioners and the costs of anyone sent down by the commissioners, and they must have that declaration lodged before any official of the commissioners will go down.  I suppose nobody will leave Dublin in future unless they have a guarantee beforehand they will be paid their expenses.  That is the position despite the fact that the taxpayers of this country have to pay the whole of them here.  Is the office of Public Works for the benefit of Dublin or for the benefit of the country and if they are for the benefit of the country does it mean that before an official does a job every local authority must pay him?  If that is so, then what is the State paying for?  That is the point at issue in this section, the point as to whether in addition to paying the 50 per cent. that the Rosslare Development Association are opposing, we must also pay the commissioners if they go down to inspect, and we must give a guarantee that we are going to pay them before they come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Allen said, this is a completely new departure to my knowledge and from my experience in public life.  Is it that the Minister is no longer, in his financial straits, able to pay the civil servants but must have them paid by a local authority in this way?  If we in East Cork pay them for doing a job of reclamation apparently that will be deducted from their salaries or will be held by the Minister and go towards paying their salaries.  That is a new way of paying them as far as I can see.  Or is it that the commissioners have no longer any faith in being paid by the State <Col N="1407" /> and that they consider the local authority would be a better stake for the money than the Government.  That is what is wrong.  This whole thing is a new departure and in my view the Minister should withdraw that request for a declaration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That committee reported in 1931, just before Fianna Fáil came into office.  Fianna Fáil were in office with that report in front of them from 1932 up to 1948 and we saw no Coast Protection Bill.  Deputy Beegan was in the Office of Public Works from 1951 to 1954 and we saw no Coast Protection Bill.  During the whole of that period the line taken by the Party opposite, when they were in Government, was that this was entirely a local authority responsibility; it was entirely the responsibility of local authorities whether anything was done in relation to the prevention of coast erosion or in relation to coast protection.</P>
      <P>I come along now and I do something. I make an offer to pay and I provide machinery under which grants from the Central Fund up to 50 per cent. can be given; and we are treated by the Opposition to the crocodile tears we had last night and again this morning.  I am not surprised that Deputies opposite find it necessary to say something.  They have a great deal to excuse themselves for and they are hoping and endeavouring, by the line they are taking now, to confuse the people who are affected by this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that this is the first effort that has ever been made by the State to deal with this problem, the first <Col N="1408" /> effort to cope with this problem, to repair the damage that has been done and to prevent the damage that might be done if these proposals were not introduced now.  I do not suggest for one moment that the proposals in this Bill are the most perfect proposals. Anybody who came before this House and suggested that any Bill was a perfect Bill would be a fool.  Nothing that one produces in connection with a problem like this&mdash;and, despite that Deputies opposite have said, the extent of the problem is not known&mdash; could be a perfect Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, we all know from our own experience that, no matter how much we may try to make Bills satisfactory during their passage through the House, it is nevertheless necessary to come back and amend them subsequently.  I do not claim that this is a perfect Bill.  But I do say and I do claim that this is the first time that there has been any approach by any Government to the problem. Because of that approach now we will be able to get a reasonable survey of what needs to be done in the various areas.  The provisions towards the cost of such schemes as may arise are reasonable having regard to other commitments of the State.</P>
    <P>There is always of course&mdash;I can quite understand it on the part of those who have not the responsibility of providing&mdash;an anxiety, as Deputy Desmond said, to &ldquo;pass the buck&rdquo; to somebody else.  It is the duty of the Government fairly to distribute the load.  Bearing in mind the approach that existed hitherto, that no part of the load should be borne by the Central Fund, I think I am making a reasonable proposition when I make the arrangements and put forward the suggestions that are included in this measure to meet whatever need there may be, a need which, as I say, we cannot completely determine in its accuracy, in its exact extent and in its exact nature in relation to the country as a whole until such time as we have got the surveys and the detailed examinations which have, so far, never been attempted.</P>

      <P>I do not want to have to deal with Deputy O'Leary's interruptions at all.  I do not think we are unreasonable in asking the Minister to do one of two things.  Those officials are being paid by the State now.  I think they should be at the service of any local authority that requires them, cooperating in the joint action which is envisaged in this Bill.  If the State pays its own officials and we pay our own, we shall arrive somewhere.  But if we have to pay our own officials and the State officials as well, that will be an undue burden on the ratepayers.  In view of that, I ask the Minister to give us some guarantee that that sub-section will be removed from Section 4.  I do not think I am unreasonable in that.  If the Minister wants information as to what was done in regard to coast erosion when the Fianna Fáil Government was in office, he will not have any difficulty if he does a bit of <Col N="1411" /> poking.

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one question in relation to a scheme prepared by the local authority engineer&mdash;assuming that Deputy Corry will not be shouting to get somebody down from Dublin.  Provided a scheme is prepared by the local authority engineer and submitted to the Department for examination, if an official of the Department wishes to go down to that locality and examine the plans as prepared by the local engineer, in view of the fact that the local authority is not making a request for the commissioners to prepare the scheme, if he goes down solely to check on the scheme as prepared by the local authority, is there a charge then imposed on the local authority for that trip or inspection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I might perhaps make one thing a bit clearer to the House.  Section 19, if I may just jump to there for a second, is the section by virtue of which moneys are provided for the carrying out of the scheme and by virtue of which there is provision of the 50 per cent. grants running right through the operation. It is a matter of drafting.  I think it might be better, rather than relying on Section 19, merely to deal in Sections 4 and 5, not with the total cost, but with the 50 per cent., rather than that it should come back to Section 19. It would mean, therefore, in effect that <Col N="1412" /> the local authority would be only through Section 4 and 5 convenanting to pay 50 per cent. in the first instance, instead of offering to pay 100 per cent. and then having another provision by which 50 per cent. of what they had paid might come back to them.  I think that might be clearer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister said &ldquo;might&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would rather have the word &ldquo;would&rdquo; I am always quite obliging.  The point that Deputy Desmond has raised, I gather, concerns a promoting authority in the case in which it has decided that it is going to go ahead with the coast protection scheme itself and that it does not want, shall we say, the consultative services of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I presume it will be a case in which they will be looking for a grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not imagine it was a case which would be dealt with without a grant.  If a local authority was not looking for State assistance at all it would not be necessary, of course, to introduce any inspection by the Commissioners of Public Works but if there is no request made under sub-section (2) the Deputy will see that it is in the request that the undertaking as regards payment eventuates whereas the scheme that the Deputy has in mind is one under 4 (b) rather than under 4 (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to make it perfectly clear.  If, for instance, a local authority decides to build a certain number of houses they may submit plans to the Minister for Local Government.  If the Minister and the officials are not satisfied they may send down an inspector and that is that.  In this case if the local authority engineer prepares a scheme, and if the local authority, as such, composed of the members with the manager agree that that scheme is feasible and if it is submitted in this instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Nevertheless I am still coming to the point I want to make.  I maintain that where the local authority&mdash;naturally they are looking for a grant; we need not bother with this Bill if there was not a grant&mdash;is not asking the commissioners to prepare the scheme, where they prepare it themselves, should it happen that an official here may wish to find fault with certain aspects of the plan as prepared by the local authority engineer, I maintain it should not be within the jurisdiction of the commissioner to charge the cost of their inspector going down to examine, not the scheme, but the plans in detail, as prepared by the local engineer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will see, under the terms of the Bill, the promoting authority in those circumstances can prepare the scheme, decide to carry it out themselves, exhibit it, and ultimately, it is confirmed by the Commissioners of Public Works, but if the promoting authority has done that work themselves, then there is no question of paying the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get clear on one point.  A scheme has to be sent up to the Commissioners of Public Works. Does the Minister suggest they will pass it without examination and without sending anybody down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy has misunderstood the two paragraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am afraid I have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Under paragraph (b) the local authority does the work itself, or says it is going to do it.  That is the case put to me by Deputy Desmond.  When that happens, when it is prepared and exhibited and so forth by the local authority, there is no question of the local authority being responsible for 50 per cent. of the charges for the commissioner's inspection. The case where the 50 per cent. of the charge for the commissioner's inspection is borne is where the local authority declare they are not going to do it themselves and send <Col N="1414" /> up a request to the commissioners to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5: &ldquo;A certified copy of the resolution by which a request is made under Section 4 for further examination ...&rdquo; That takes it for granted that an examination has already been made by the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reference to paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 4.  The case that Deputy Desmond put up is under paragraph (b) of sub-section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That a coast protection scheme is to be prepared and executed by the council.  When they decide on that they then apply for 50 per cent. and is that scheme going to be passed without any inspection by the Minister's Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of its being passed without an inspection. It is where the commissioners prepare the scheme under a request contained in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) that the 50 per cent. of the cost comes in.  Obviously a grant will not be paid without the State satisfying itself it is going to get good value for any money spent in this way.  We will not charge for that inspection. That question arises under paragraph (b).</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <P>Whenever you exceeded a couple of thousand pounds in the past the Department of Local Government always insisted on your employing a consultant.  I feel sure the same situation will arise under this Bill.  What I am objecting to is the insult offered to local authorities by telling them they must sign a solemn declaration that <Col N="1415" /> they will pay the commissioners the cost and expenses incurred by the commissioners before they carry out any examination.  There must, under this Bill, be a pre-guarantee of payment. Under sub-section (2)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems there is some little erosion in that bench opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been suffering from rapid erosion recently.  I am afraid he will be washed away entirely the next time we hear from him. He should now try and make a deathbed repentance.  The local authorities are being insulted in this by being asked to make declarations beforehand that they will pay.  Why should officials already paid by the taxpayers in their wholetime capacities be paid again by the local authorities?  That is the underlying objection to this provision. These are wholetime officials, paid by the taxpayers, contributed to by everybody in the State.  Now, even before they leave Dublin to go down the country to examine a scheme, they must be guaranteed by the local authorities that their return tickets will be paid, plus whatever additional expenses they incur.  That is the declaration local authorities are asked to make under this section.  It is going far beyond the bounds of common sense.  I suggest that the Minister would give the House a definite assurance that he will do something to remedy that situation before Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He talked about all he did for the nation.  I am afraid the nation does not appreciate all he has done.  He talked about a report that came in in 1931.  I happen to have a copy of a report of an advice given from the commissioners' office to the then Government.  The report advised the Government not to undertake any work or to spend any money in Rosslare. That report was furnished by an eminent engineer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter what it proves.  I just mention it in passing. Since the Minister talks about all he is going to do I should like to point out the danger that it will be many a long year before anything can be done under the provisions of this Bill. I want to say that coast erosion schemes were dealt with by the Office of Public Works under Fianna Fáil Governments.  Substantial sums of money were spent by the Fianna Fáil Government on the foreshore between Dublin and Wexford.</P>
      <P>For as long as I can remember, the C.I.E. railway line has been frequently washed away near Kilcoole and the Government have had to provide funds to erect groynes on the seashore at Kilcoole.  I distinctly remember that, after a very bad storm about 15 years ago, Courtown Harbour, my own native place, was in imminent danger and a considerable sum of money had to be spent on it.  The local authority made a small contribution.  The total amount of spent was something between £5,000 and £10,000.  The point I am making is that a State grant could be made towards arresting erosion at Rosslare without the aid of this Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If £15,000 were made available out of the Employment Schemes Vote to put up groynes in Rosslare, a good job could be done and there would be no need for the Bill at all.  It was done in Donegal when Deputy Beegan was in charge of the Office of Public Works.  To-morrow <Col N="1417" /> morning the Minister could get his Government to make a substantial grant towards this work.  It is a very urgent work and I think that the laying down of groynes would make a good job of it.  The county council are agreeable to put up £3,000 or £4,000 towards it. On the principle that State expenditure is in the neighbourhood of £140,000,000 a year and that the Wexford County Council's expenditure is in the region of £350,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that if Wexford County Council got a State grant in proportion to that expenditure a good job would be done in Rosslare.  Another point to which we object is the provision requiring local authorities to make a declaration that they will pay certain sums towards the expenses of the officials carrying out examinations.  I think the thing is wrong altogether.  There is provision for that in Section 5.  You should leave out this provision about a solemn declaration altogether.  It is an insult to any local authority.  The mind that put it into the Bill is a peculiar mind and it is alien to this country.  No State Department should be allowed to do so and the Minister should not allow that to be enshrined in legislation. He should not allow it to be said that they do not trust a local authority.  They have always paid in the past, without declarations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will appreciate that the remedies for coast erosion can be very expensive and that the coast erosion project requires specialised engineering. I just wonder what the response will be on the part of local authorities in relation to such projects.  If a local authority sponsors such a scheme it will naturally try to keep it as cheap and as small as possible.  We shall then have the difficulty of the Office of Public Works coming in and saying that that is not sufficient, that they cannot sanction that scheme and then, if it is necessary to have a project in a particular area, there will be a further set of plans and the whole thing will have to be started all over again.</P>
      <P>We have sufficient examples in the case of projects of a different nature of where the local authority are prepared to go ahead with a certain scheme but are told that the scheme is not big enough and that therefore the project cannot be carried out.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the same thing again in this section but in a worse form, if at all possible.  You can actually see the hand of the Minister for Finance in this; you can see him standing up at the end of a court case and saying &ldquo;Costs please.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of this section states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the commissioners have completed an examination under this section, they shall serve on the promoting authority by post a notice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" />&mdash;despite the fact that they already got a solemn declaration that they will be paid&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;stating the amount of the costs and expenses by the commissioners in respect of such examination and the amount so stated shall be payable to the commissioners by the promoting authority and, in default of payment, shall be recoverable as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the poor county council, if they refuse to pay the boys, can be taken into court and decreed for the money.  The Minister is making himself ridiculous.  Can the Minister visualise any one of those cases and visualise the cost of inspection and preparation of the case?  He will find in a very large number of them that, between the consultants and the engineers and the Office of Public Works consultants and the Office of Public Works engineers, and the two inspections, the paper plans will cost more than the actual job.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister is prepared to pay only 50 per cent. of the actual job&mdash;not 50 per cent. of the total cost. The engineers, the consultants and everybody else must be paid by the county council or the local authority, in addition to the 50 per cent.  If the county council themselves prepare a scheme, will their 50 per cent. of the cost of their engineers and their consultants be paid in the 50 per cent. grant?  Is the Minister prepared to have that included?  That is one of the things which we should like to know on this section.</P>

Can the Minister yet give any justification to this House as to why, in the case of a permanent official of his Department who goes down and examines an erosion scheme in any local authority area, the cost <Col N="1420" /> of his expenses and fees should be charged to that local authority and paid for by that local authority?</P>

      <P>That is what is proposed under this sub-section.  I suggest to the Minister that that is going a little too far.  I have never heard yet of a local authority&mdash;and all local authorities have borrowed to the extent of millions of pounds from the Commissioners of Public Works for loans&mdash;being sued by the commissioners for default of payment and I will be 30 years here soon. Why then bring in this contemptible Bill, a Bill which the Minister knows he has rendered unworkable already? He knows it is only waste of time and that he will have to pay nothing under it.  The local authority is expected to pay 50 per cent. plus the expense of having the scheme examined, plus the <Col N="1421" /> expense of having an examination by the commissioners, which could very easily mean 80 per cent. being paid by the local authorities.  The Minister knows the Bill is not workable.</P>

But nothing can be done unless the Minister is reasonable.  This unreasonable attitude, this lawyer attitude, is sticking out all the time.  This kind of conduct in legislation is an insult to the local authorities of this country who have never defaulted in the payment of 1/- in the millions of pounds they have borrowed and repaid to the Commissioners of Public Works.  Why bring in a Bill bristling with those insults to the local authorities, which the Minister is enshrining in this Bill?

      <P>I think it most unfair that the council, having had to take advice already on this scheme, and knowing that the people were so much affected that they would be justified in asking for it, the commissioners can then say that the scheme is not worth proceeding with.  There is a means of collecting the cost and expenses through a court of competent jurisdiction.  That is often stated in Bills and why that old formula, which was first introduced by the British over 100 years ago when they trusted nobody in this country, should be continued often intrigues me. I suggest that the Minister should start a campaign to get this system eliminated and to trust the people, and their elected representatives in local authorities, more.  I remember reading this sort of thing in old British legislation dating back 100 years, and it should not be continued.  I have nothing further to say except that it is a formula brought down from former days when the Government of that time did not trust any local authority.  They were on a par, as far as trusting the people, with any State Department or ministerial Department of the present day.  This machinery should be taken out.</P>

      <P>The county council should know that.  Before the council signs the bill, they are entitled to know how much it will cost.  The Minister should now send down to the local authorities a statement as to how much it will cost for travelling expenses, so that, when we are asked to sign the declaration, we will at least have some idea of how much we are signing for.  You cannot expect a local authority to make a declaration in the dark.  We would like to know approximately the size of the bill and I think we are entitled to that information.  I suggest the Minister should send down to each local authority a statement of the charges per day in respect of each engineer sent down, and if a higher degree &ldquo;joker&rdquo; has to be sent down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If any higher degree engineer is sent down, we are entitled to have that information.  We have often got frights before in connection with consultants' fees as distinct from engineers' fees.  Are all the experts in the Minister's Department and the Office of Public Works consultants, or are we to consider them as engineers? Those are the things we would like to find out before we sign the bill and those are the things, as I said earlier, <Col N="1424" /> that are going to make the Bill unworkable.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, a proposal brought in by Deputy Desmond to have a certain amount expended to prevent coastal erosion in the Crosshaven area.  I have another scheme of the same type.  Two schemes of mine are for about £150,000.  We are clubing together in connection with this matter.  He has eight members in his area and I have six, which is 14 out of the 68.  The rest of them are the boys who have to pay without getting anything out of it.  I know the play they are going to make with the probable cost of those commissioners coming down and inspecting the scheme.  They will ask us what happened in regard to the consultants on the regional hospital.  We will be asked if we know what happened in respect of the fees which had to be paid for the regional hospital, the fees that had to be paid in respect of Youghal Bridge and the fees paid to consultants on such and such a scheme.</P>
      <P>Principles are being enshrined in this Bill under which every local authority is looked upon by the Government as a collection of rogues and thieves who have to sign beforehand a solemn declaration that they will pay and who are threatened with proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, if they do not pay.

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a determination by the commissioners.  Having examined the proposal and having been paid for it, they can determine that the circumstances are not such as to justify going on with any scheme.  In other words, the local authority having examined the technical advice they got and having decided they should apply to the commissioners, the commissioners at this stage have power to torpedo completely any scheme, to say that no scheme is worth while going on with.  I think the Minister should look into this matter again.</P>
      <P>It should not be left to the Commissioners of Public Works, no matter how responsible they may be.  It should be left to somebody else, and I would be satisfied if it were the Minister for Local Government who would be closely in touch with local affairs. Somebody else, whoever he might be, should come in at this stage rather than a group of civil servants to determine whether a village, a piece of land or something else should be saved. Some other final determining authority must be brought into this.  When the particular local authority has made application, has obtained technical advice and knows it has to pay the Commissioners of Works for the examination, is it to be then told the job is not worth while going on with?  They are the final body to decide that, and I believe that provision is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No local authority will propose spending the ratepayers' money in the first instance, or ask the commissioners to examine a scheme, unless they believe the scheme is necessary for the protection of property or the lives of a section of the community within their area.  I would like if, between now and Report Stage, the Minister would consider the advisability of bringing in a final determining authority in cases where the local authority ask for a further examination. That could be done without any harm to anybody.  We know that most <Col N="1427" /> of the machinery of this Bill has been lifted out of the 1940 Arterial Drainage Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the machinery was lifted out of that Act and, without having looked it up recently, I would say that this section is mainly taken from it.  The commissioners may decide whether an arterial drainage scheme is worth proceeding with or not; but that does not apply here because the local authority has nothing to do with determining whether or not an arterial drainage scheme should go on.  The local authority is charged with the responsibility of applying under this scheme and some body other than the Commissioners who have examined the scheme should be the final determining authority as to whether the scheme shall proceed or not.  I should like to hear the Minister on whether or not he would consider bringing in the Minister for Local Government, or some other determining authority, in the case of a county council appealing against a decision.  I believe there should be some individual or some board of persons to whom they can appeal for a final ruling as to whether or not the scheme shall go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen suggested there should be some appeal board, but, if we were to have an appeal board in circumstances such as this, we would have to have a board of experts.  As I see it, this section is for the purpose of preventing local authorities from producing, shall we say, hare-brained schemes.  Do not imagine for a moment that I am suggesting any of the schemes along the east coast would be hare-brained.  A considerable period has elapsed during which something should have been done and has not been done.  Deputy Allen's argument is that if the local authority produces a scheme, the commissioners <Col N="1428" /> can then decide it should not be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No; this is a scheme the commissioners have examined themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the promotion is a reserved function of the county council.  The scheme has been promoted by the promoting authority, which is the county council.  As I understand the Deputy, if the commissioners decide not to proceed with that scheme, he wishes to make it mandatory on the Minister to introduce someone else to decide, to be an overriding judge as to whether that decision on the part of the commissioners is correct or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the council at that stage appeal against the decision of the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, exactly; they are the promoting authority.  The commissioners decide that the scheme is not a suitable one to proceed with. The Deputy's suggestion is that if the promoting authority, which is the county council&mdash;in all cases the county council is the promoting authority&mdash; decide they should go ahead with the scheme and the commissioners do not consider it is desirable to do so, they should have an appeal to someone else.  Is that the Deputy's point? There might be something in that, but, if they are to appeal, they would have to appeal to someone with knowledge of these matters.  As I envisage it, if you introduce an appeal like this, the county council or local authority may say it would be a good idea to institute a scheme for the purpose of giving employment.  I feel such schemes should be confined to extremely necessitous cases of which there are many in the State already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen suggested there should be an appeal.  If you look at it in another way, there is already a considerable source of appeal.  If a promoting authority were to put up a scheme and if it were to be turned down, I take it it would be quite feasible and proper for any Deputy representing that constituency to make an appeal to the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1429" /> who is the Minister concerned in the actual Department.  Perhaps I am wrong in that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination that is visualised in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) can, for example, be a determination on purely engineering grounds.  It might be found when the scheme was being examined that it was not possible to do what was necessary. In various cases, it has been found in dealing with the wind and the waves that you can have all sorts of the most extraordinary results, results the reverse of what were anticipated. It might well be that, although the scheme might prevent erosion at point A, the effect might be to create erosion at point B.  That is a technical matter, on which, with all respect, neither Deputy Allen nor I would be competent to express an adequate opinion.  That would be a matter which would have to be determined by those qualified from an engineering point of view.  Therefore, in relation to that type of technical engineering quality in a scheme, I do not see what great advantage there would be in the suggestion of another layman coming into it.  Of course, for such a purpose anybody&mdash;the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance or anybody else&mdash;would be a layman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties which I mentioned when I was speaking on the Second Reading is that there has not been such an examination of these problems around our coast as would enable us accurately to judge the exact extent of the problems and the best means of remedying them.  We will not be able to get accuracy in that judgment until we have got the information that is necessary to lead up to Section 6.  The determination that is there in the commissioners is probably the best method of dealing with the matter.  Deputy Allen knows, just as well as I do, that when a determination <Col N="1430" /> is made by the commissioners, and it is an adverse determination, he will raise the matter in the House and that there will be consideration of the matter.  From a statutory point of view, I think it is best to have this method.  It will be largely on technical grounds that consideration of any scheme will be given, on technical reports probably couched in technical language.  I do not think that any people, other than those who are themselves technicians, would be more suitable for dealing with these matters than people who are dealing with technical problems every day.  Such people are the best people to deal with technical problems of that nature.  The matter is not one of great principle either way but it seems to me that the problems will be so technical that the commissioners are the best people to decide on them.</P>

      <P>I can agree with the Minister up to a certain point.  I have an area in mind in the vicinity of Valentia and I doubt if any protection could keep the Atlantic breakers away from that area.  I can understand that side of it all right and I can see that the cost of protection to 20 acres of land might be such that it would not be justified.  I can see such things arising but I would make this suggestion to the Minister&mdash;that assuming (a) comes into operation and the commissioners decide that the preparation is not justified they should then give their reasons to the promoting authority.</P>

That is just the point.  I think they should.  If the local authority, with the technical advice at their disposal, desire that the commissioners should still undertake the scheme, they should have a right of appeal to the Minister to have the scheme carried out.

That inquiry was held in September, 1955, and the result of the inquiry has not yet come from the Department of Local Government.  It is now 14 months since the inquiry was held.  I know there are obstacles that can be put in the way and I am glad the Minister for Lands is here because he knows that, too.  In one instance, plans for rectifying coast erosion have been lodged with the Department of Local Government for the past seven months, in the expectation that the scheme would be carried out on the original basis of funds from the National Development Fund.

This section gives a person who will be affected by the works to be done under a coast protection scheme a period of two months to consider whether the works will adversely affect him or not. The works may involve a compulsorily acquiring that man's property, or they may involve dealing in a drastic manner with the bridges of a local authority in the area.  This section gives to the farmer concerned or the local authority concerned two months for the purpose of examining the plans and seeing whether they are likely to be adversely affected and the opportunity afterwards of seeing that their objections are properly considered.  I believe that is a most reasonable thing to do and I am not prepared to put a Bill through here jackbooting farmers or local authorities and not giving them an opportunity of a reasonable period to examine what is proposed.

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann.

Aviation motor spirit, etc., re-exported to Shannon Free Airport is not included in home consumption.</P>
      <P>I regret that, it is not possible to supply the Deputy with the detailed classification by type of user which he requires.  It is, however, possible to estimate roughly that in all industries and services covered by the Census of Industrial Production there were used 9,000,000 to 10,000,000 gallons of petrol and other light oils and about 100,000,000 gallons of heavy oils including fuel oil and lubricating oil. This estimate of course covers electricity and gas producing concerns.</P>
      <P>Consumption on the railways in 1955 is estimated at 100,000 gallons of kerosene, and 2,000,000 gallons of diesel and other fuel oils including lubricating oil.  The passenger road services of C.I.E. and the G.N.R. accounted for about 5,000,000 gallons of diesel oil and lubricating oil.</P>
      <P>With regard to road freight transport the only estimates of consumption are those in respect of licensed hauliers (including the rail companies). The estimated consumption in 1955 was 2,000,000 gallons of motor spirits and fuel oils.</P>
      <P>The amount of diesel and other fuel oils consumed in foreign-going ships in 1955 is estimated at 12,000,000 gallons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumption of power or vaporising kerosene in 1955 is estimated at 13,000,000 gallons and it is considered <Col N="1442" /> that practically all of this oil was used in agriculture.</P>

      <P>I am aware of this company's difficulties but, as I made it clear on the occasion of a previous question by the Deputy on the 24th November, 1954, very substantial protection has been provided by means of a tariff of 75 per cent. (50 per cent. preferential) for the industry, and duty-free import facilities are not given for the type of goods in question.  There is no further action open to me as Minister for Industry and Commerce which would help this company.  Their problem appears to arise from the fact that the overall productive capacity exceeds the immediate requirements of the market.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together. I have already referred in the Dáil yesterday to the position regarding petroleum products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards imported coal, the position <Col N="1446" /> is that under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreements of 1938 and 1948 a minimum annual supply of 1,570,000 tons of coal, coke and manufactured fuel from Great Britain is assured, and in order to avoid any seasonal shortages it has been my policy to insist that the coal importers so regulate their imports as to take up a large part of the allocation before the winter season commences.  While I am carefully watching the position in view of the international situation, I see no grounds at present for any alarm about supplies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remaining parts of the questions, I have frequently, and again within recent weeks, impressed on Irish colliery proprietors the urgent necessity of increasing coal production.  In this connection I would remind the Deputy of the tax concessions for coal mines recently announced by the Taoiseach which are designed to stimulate increased coal production.</P>
    <P>As regards turf, the production of machine won turf by Bord na Móna is a long-term project which requires considerable preliminary development work and, in view of this, and of the seasonal nature of the board's operations, output cannot be suddenly expanded. Since its establishment, however, annual production by the board has shown a consistent increase, and the Deputy may be assured that the board's capacity to produce machine-won turf has been, and will be, exercised to the fullest possible extent. I have no doubt that, should the need arise, hand-won turf production will also be increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the feasibility of again consulting with the Irish colliery proprietors in the light of the present situation and asking them if there is any possibility of a step-up in production this winter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that in the discussions with the colliery owners which took place within the past three weeks I emphasised to the colliery owners not only my desire that they should produce more coal so as to <Col N="1447" /> render us less dependent on imported supplies especially of anthracite coal but that they should now take off their coats and avail of the facilities made available to them to step-up their coal production with the assurance that substantial tax concessions would accompany an increase in their output. I shall continue to emphasise that point of view to the colliery owners.</P>

      <P>I am informed by C.I.E. that it is hoped that a locomotive which will be capable of using either turf or oil will be completed and ready for trial early in the New Year.  Bord na Móna are aware of the steps taken by C.I.E. in the matter and have been consulted specifically in relation to the size and quality of the turf to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change-over to diesel traction on the C.I.E. railway system has <Col N="1449" /> already resulted in a substantial saving to C.I.E. in expenditure on imported coal.  The need, in present circumstances, for exercising rigid economy in the use of imported oil fuels applies to C.I.E. in common with other concerns. C.I.E. are at present considering the best means of effecting economies with the least inconvenience to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of the poor reception, of Radio Éireann broadcasts in the London area, and if, in view of the fact that this is the only link with Ireland for numerous Irish nationals in that area, he will take steps to improve the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The poor reception from Radio Éireann in the London area is mainly due to the fact that a number of foreign broadcasting stations are transmitting on or near the same wavelength as Athlone.  This cannot be helped because there has been a big increase in the number of broadcasting, stations in recent years and there are now far more medium wave and long wave stations operating in the European area than there are wavelengths available for them.</P>
      <P>The maximum power permitted for broadcasting transmitters under the international wavelength plan for Europe is designed to provide a service of good quality within the national territory of each country.  We would like very much if Irish people in London could get good reception from Radio Éireann but I regret that we cannot do anything to improve the position there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that a large number of persons have been refused unemployment and disability benefit during the current year because they have less than 26 contributions on their insurance cards, and that the small number of contributions results from the abnormal amount of unemployment at present prevailing; and, if so, if he will take steps to alter the regulations with a view to allowing claimants with 15 contributions and over to qualify for benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit or disability benefit are:&mdash;(1) that a <Col N="1459" /> total of 26 contributions have been paid in respect of the claimant and (2) that in the contribution year preceding the benefit year of claim not less than 48 contributions have been paid or credited.  As credited contributions may be obtained in respect of weeks of sickness or unemployment, I presume the Deputy's question relates to the first condition.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that an abnormal number of claims have been refused because of non-fulfilment of that condition, which would affect only those who have not accumulated 26 contributions since entering insurance.</P>

Details of the conversion offer were contained in Press and radio announcements made on 1st June, 1951.  Holders of stock were personally notified of the conversion offer by a notice dated 8th June, <Col N="1461" /> 1951.  I notice the Deputy is not listening.

      <P>They were further reminded by a Press notice published in the four morning dailies on 5th July that applications for conversion were to be lodged not later than 7th July.</P>
      <P>(d) The terms of the conversion offer were, briefly, that holders of the stocks concerned were allowed an opportunity of exchanging their holdings in whole or in part at par into 3½ per cent. Exchequer Bonds, 1965-70.  Holders who accepted the offer received a cash bonus at the rate of £1 for every £100 of stock converted.</P>
      <P>(e) The total amount paid on foot of the cash bonus was £163,264.</P>
      <P>(f) The amount of stock outstanding at 15th July, 1951, in respect of the four loans called for redemption at that date totalled £20,662,400.</P>
      <P>(g) The offer of conversion was accepted in respect of £16,326,396 of stock.</P>
      <P>(h) The amount of stock for which cash payment was requested was £4,336,004.</P>
      <P>(i) The statutory authority for the various heads of expenditure involved in the conversion operation was provided by the Government Loans (Conversion) Act, 1951, the Appropriation Acts and the Central Fund Acts.</P>
      <P>(j) A sum of £2,205,926 was made available from sinking funds and the balance of £2,328,680 from the Exchequer to meet the liability arising in respect of repayments, the cash bonus and the expenses of the operation. Does the Deputy want me to read the reply again?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the date on which the holders of stock in the Conversion Loan were given notice of the intention to redeem was 1-6-'51?  The Minister has said in the course of an aside during his reply that this was not the reply I had expected. Is the Minister suggesting that I ought to have discarded the undertaking of my predecessor?  Would the Minister say in reply to (h) of my question where did the Exchequer get the funds to meet a liability which arose out of an offer made by my predecessor?</P>

      <P>In reply to the first of Deputy MacEntee's supplementaries, it was extremely lucky that his predecessor had made arrangements to have this conversion put into operative effect before Deputy MacEntee made his extremely damaging speech in this House on the 19th July, 1951.</P>
      <P>So far as the matter raised in (j) is concerned, the balance of £2,328,680 was no doubt raised&mdash;though I have not the exact details here&mdash;by the Deputy by means of Ways and Means Advances obtained by the Exchequer out of the £20,000,000 Marshall Aid Loan Counterpart Fund left by Deputy McGilligan.</P>

It also appears that the greater portion of our imports will continue to be obtained from British refineries, although those refineries will probably import more crude oil of dollar origin than they do at present.

The practice is to place a general contract from year to year which provides for supply, cutting, sewing, lifting and laying, and to order from the contractor appointed such quantities and types of carpet as may be required during the year.  This general contract is advertised in the public Press.</P>

    <P>(1) The grants above are exclusive of the special allocation of £500 in each case (£1,500 in the case of Cork County Council) for works ancillary to land project.</P>
    <P>(2) In the case of any particular local authority, all schemes are not necessarily submitted for approval at the same time.  Similarly, approvals to schemes included in any one submission do not necessarily issue at the same time.  Between submission and approval correspondence with the local authority may be required in connection with some scheme or schemes. The reply, therefore, gives the dates on which schemes were initially submitted and on which formal approval issued.</P>
    <P>(3) Urban authorities are not included in the statement as a general allocation, as in the case of county councils, to these authorities has not yet been made: it is at present in course of issue.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following question: &ldquo;That Section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it occurred to the Minister that the word &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; has not been mentioned at all in this section, which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Simultaneously with or as soon as may be after the sending of a copy of a coast protection scheme by the promoting authority pursuant to paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 10 of this Act or by the commissioners pursuant to paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) of that section, the promoting authority or the commissioners (as the case may be) shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) serve on every person named in the scheme as a reputed proprietor, owner or rated or other occupier of any land proposed to be compulsorily acquired or substantially interfered with or of any easement, fishery, water-right, navigation-right or other right or of any private road or bridge proposed to be compulsorily acquired....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It appears to me that there is no definition section in regard to land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the Interpretation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that having regard to the construction of this section if buildings were interfered with, the owners would be left high and dry in my opinion.  The Minister might look into that matter between this and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter under this section that I object to is the provision made for serving notice by post on the people <Col N="1484" /> who may be concerned.  I know we have had experience of this matter under the Electricity Supply Acts and similar legislation in which provision is made for service by post.  On quite a few occasions it has happened that this notice has not been received by the addresses and people have found their land invaded by these bodies without any prior notice whatever.  Sometimes the reason may be that there are a number of families of the same name in the same townland.  That is common in the west of Ireland.  On many occasions, service by post has proved to be a weak form of service.  I have had experience of local authorities on a number of occasions when there was a loose provision like this providing for service by post.  They went ahead without the people concerned getting notice that their rights were to be interfered with.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in a scheme of this kind, which will obviously interfere with property rights, the Minister might consider ensuring that the people would be served personally.  In my view, that should be done.  I realise that in most cases the people will be aware of what is happening, but it is the odd case the Minister should provide for.  Certainly from my experience I have no confidence in providing by statutory legislation for service by registered post in matters vitally affecting property rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's first point, he will find that where &ldquo;land&rdquo; is used in this context, by virtue of the general provisions of the Interpretation Act, it would include buildings, but I will make certain that that is so.  As far as his second point is concerned, sub-section (4) is the standard section that has been used all through in the Arterial Drainage Act, and in similar circumstances the commissioners would in such a case obtain certificates of posting.  It would not be like the ordinary case of just dropping the letter into the letter box&mdash;formal certificates would be obtained&mdash;but I could not accept under any circumstances the suggestion made by the Deputy of personal service.  I think that would be <Col N="1485" /> unnecessary and unsatisfactory.  In the meantime, I will consider whether it is necessary to strengthen the sub-section otherwise in any way.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seems to be torpedoing the Bill.  By furnishing a report to the commissioners, as is requested under Section 12, there is a delay of roughly two years.  First of all, the commissioners have to examine the report; then they have a public inquiry by a person appointed by the commissioners.  When they have completed the examination under the sub-section and considered the report of such an inquiry, they have to consult the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and such other Ministers&mdash; I do not know how many Ministers they have to consult.  We had the example a while ago of one inquiry which is to report to the Minister for Local Government, but it is 14 months ago since the inquiry was held and we have not heard the report yet.  If it takes 14 months for each of the Ministers to consider the reports in connection with this matter, I suggest there would be time to have three or four different Ministers sitting over there before there will be any report or before anything will be done.  Section after section of the Bill seems to be there simply for the purpose of preventing anything being done.  I defy even the biggest optimist in this country to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy, judging by what he was saying earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to take any section of this Bill, study it, and, no matter how anxious he may be to get an erosion scheme through, to find that he will be able to get it going within ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is under Sections 2 and 3. Under Section 4, there is the same thing all over again.  As soon as the notice has been served, the Commissioners <Col N="1486" /> have to examine the observations and hold another public inquiry. When that public inquiry is finished, the Commissioners have to present a statement of the alterations which they consider should be made and this has to be confirmed by the Minister for Finance.  The whole thing might be called a delaying action.  I wonder how long it will be between the time a local authority notifies the Board of its intention to proceed with the scheme and the time that scheme comes into operation under this Bill. I defy the Minister to say that it will be less than a minimum of three years and a maximum of 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would call this section a torpedoing and delaying section. There are at least three opportunities in the section for schemes to be torpedoed and it winds up by saying that, after everything has been done, the local authority pays.  Would the Minister tell us if he considers it necessary to have all this interminable delay which is bound to arise?  In no other Act here has there been such opportunity for delaying as there is in this. As Deputy Corry says, a scheme can be done only after a minimum of three years and a maximum of ten to 15 years.  If it gets into the hands of the local solicitors and into the hands of the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be careful when talking about solicitors to look behind him as well as in front of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I could look in front and I could lay my finger on the Minister at one period in his life.  I could say he was the person I was referring to or that he belonged to the profession I was referring to.  But, in all seriousness, I have spent a considerable time studying this Bill and I have made marginal notes here.  Under this section alone, there can be delays of up to 20 months.  I speak from experience of local authorities and working with the Department of Local Government and other Departments for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the whole scheme can be torpedoed three times under this section; and it winds up by saying that the local authority pays for any expenses <Col N="1487" /> incurred by the commissioners up to that stage.  All the cost of these inquiries and of the local attorneys who may be employed by persons owning affected property will have to be met.  There is no doubt about that. In every local inquiry, it is either the local authority or the State that pays the full costs on all occasions.  They pay the full costs of holding the inquiry and the full costs of both sides to the inquiry, so that the longer these inquiries go on the better.  We have here the very same tortuous problem as we have in the acquiring of land and in the acquiring of rights.</P>
    <P>Coast erosion may be a matter of extreme urgency and many of the problems may have to be tackled within 48 hours.  Still, the Minister comes before the House to promote this Bill which, he says, will tackle the problem expeditiously.  I cannot for the life of me see how he makes that out.  I can see the situation arising in which the Minister for Finance finds the Exchequer confronted with having to pay out £500,000 or £750,000 for protection schemes and I can see these schemes being hung up.  We can see these schemes being stalled and we all know what stalling in Government Departments is when it comes to a question of money.  I would like the Minister to quote any piece of legislation which has gone through this House in the past 20 years which contains as many delaying tactics in every line of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I agree largely with what my colleagues have stated on this section of the Bill.  I have not seen a more cumbersome type of section than this for a very long time.  It would appear to me, from the manner in which this section is drafted, that there can be no end to the postponement of what may possibly be urgent schemes.  To start off with, under the previous section, there is the necessary notice which must be given to an owner whose property may be affected.  That is a period of two months.  After that, you have the inter-departmental reports and inquiries, and it appears to me that there is no end to the amount of <Col N="1488" /> time that can be wasted in having a scheme go from one Department to another.  These reports will of first to the commissioners and then from them to one, two, three or four Departments.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that in a case where an inquiry will be necessary it should be quite obvious within a period of two months that it will be necessary.  In that instance, the matter could be proceeded with quite simply, without the cumbersome procedure that is now laid down.  Immediately the objections are received from the interested parties, it will be quite clear whether an inquiry is necessary or not.  Such an inquiry is provided for here and I do not see why, if an inquiry is necessary, it should not be set on foot immediately the objections are received.</P>
      <P>I assume that, like all other such inquiries, both sides will be represented to put their different cases and I do not see, under the circumstances, why these inquiries cannot take place at once.  I do not see why a scheme could not be put into operation within a reasonable time.  It appears to me that the schemes contemplated under this Bill will be of an urgent nature. Coast erosion, in any case, is as urgent matter, and I am satisfied that, if the machinery contemplated in Section 12 is left in, it might be three, four or five years before a scheme could be implemented.  If every &ldquo;t&rdquo; is to be crossed and every &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted in the passing of these reports from the commissioners to the Departments, I think that a man seeking relief under this Bill would be out in the middle of the Atlantic before he would get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to the fact that the local authority has to pay for the cost of holding these inquiries, but it would appear to me that there is no provision made here for the people who are mainly concerned in the inquiries. I am taking the case of people who would be interested in valuable property rights and who would have to be represented legally at these inquiries in order to protect their rights. It would appear to me that what is provided for here is the cost of the inquiry and the cost of the gentleman <Col N="1489" /> sent down to preside at it; but there is no authority given here to pay the costs of the people who have to be legally represented and whose rights may be affected by the inquiry. I think it is only fair that, should these people be represented, provision should be made for the payment of their costs.</P>
    <P>Taking the section as a whole, I entirely agree with what has already been said about it.  To my mind, the section is unworkable and most cumbersome and one that will provide whatever Minister is in power at the time with unlimited opportunities for exercising delaying tactics.  There is no reason in the world why the Minister and his advisers cannot slash the time provided under this section by 60 or 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why this cumbersome machinery is provided for and I think the matter could be dealt with in a much simpler and more expeditious manner than is provided for here.  I think it will be found that whoever will have to operate the section will be confronted with the position that, wherever you have an urgent case, some private rights will be involved and the whole business will be strung up and delayed.  He will find that nothing can be done for years if this cumbersome machinery is left in.</P>

      <P>I will guarantee one thing, that there was more money spent under that Act in 12 months than will be spent under this Bill in ten years, if the present Minister for Finance is in office.  Can the Minister tell me how it was that miles and miles of rivers were cleared and cleaned and land of various owners was affected under that Act and there was never a law case?  I did not hear of any owner of property suing anybody in connection with that Act.  I did not hear of any of these matters that have been mentioned cropping up under it.  About £600,000 or £700,000 was spent in the first 12 months under that Act.  How was that done?  Now we are presented with this Bill.  Whom is it meant to benefit?  What is it brought in for?</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran, who is a member of the legal profession, has told us that it will take about two years to get through what is required in these sections. What hope have we of having anything done under this makeshift Bill?  Can anything be done in this section to limit the periods or to cut out some of the red tape the Commissioners of Public Works seem to be so found of using?  Everything must be watertight, trebly examined and examined by 15 or 16 of them before anything is done.  Is the Minister prepared to do anything to shorten the period specified in this section so that something may be done within the next five years under this Bill to end coast erosion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said just before we reported progress to deal with Questions, there is a fundamental principle involved here.  I made it quite clear where I stand.  I believe that, where private property is being expropriated in the public interest, there should be adequate opportunity given to the owner to make his case to the authority concerned.  I believe that, where the property of a local authority is being similarly dealt with, again, there should be adequate opportunity given to that local authority to make its case to the acquiring authority or the disturbing authority, whichever one prefers to call it.  I believe that this section gives a reasonable opportunity, and <Col N="1491" /> no more than a reasonable opportunity, to the owner of private property whose land may be acquired in the general national and public interest, but I am not prepared to provide that private property would be expropriated without that proper opportunity being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose nobody will dispute that the rights of private property should be respected.  There is no doubt about that.  The Minister should consider making provision in this section, or in a new section, whereby, in case of emergency, the work might be done beforehand.  That would be all-important in operating a Bill like this.  Without such a provision, the owner of half an acre of land and his legal adviser would have power to hold up work for an indefinite period.  There is no time-limit specified for any of the operations.</P>
      <P>The Minister should provide, by a new section or otherwise, that when the commissioners declare a scheme to be one of urgency or emergency, all the machinery of this section and similar sections can be brought into operation after the work is carried out. There is nothing to prevent that.  It will not make any difference.  If there is compensation to be paid, which is the main idea in this, it can be paid after the work has been done.  The work should proceed.  That is all-important and that is the burden of our argument from this side of the House.  If the Minister will undertake to consider that, visualising a serious emergency where delays would be disastrous, it would satisfy us.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister considered this question of navigational rights which I assume are some of the most difficult considerations to arise under this Bill?  There is this question of having an inquiry or not having an inquiry.  The Minister suggests an inquiry will not be necessary in many cases.  I have seen where, for instance, when a causeway was proposed to be built by the Board of Works between one island and the mainland, they suddenly found themselves up against an objection by a couple of fishermen living on a remote island who claimed that if this causeway was built, their journey with their boats would be much longer than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that is the kind of difficult objection that may arise under this measure and from the point of view of ascertaining rights and for compensating for the disturbance of such rights, it would be simply impossible under the machinery provided in this Bill to cover what I have in mind.  For instance, if you are going to serve people with notice who may <Col N="1494" /> have navigational rights somewhere beside the coast, you would want to have a great number of notices scattered across a great number of islands and a great number of people both on the mainland and off the mainland to deal with this kind of right. There is no provision in the Bill for the provision of any general notice that might bind these people and I suggest the Minister should have second thoughts on that aspect.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there is power here to guard against frivolous claims to an arbitrator under this section?  Is there any power to limit the number of claims that may be made?  I think more thought should be given to that. Members of local authorities are aware that, for instance, in the acquisition of water rights people probably 15 miles from the river will be claiming for some reason or other that their water rights were interfered with, although what was being taken was little or <Col N="1495" /> nothing.  You can have this kind of claim coming before the assessor and the local authority having to pay the costs in every case.  Even the costs of all the legal people must come out of the public funds.  Not one shilling comes out of a private individual's pocket as a result of these inquiries, and the Minister is aware of that also.  In respect of frivolous claims, there should be some saving clause to safeguard the public purse whether it is the local public purse or the central purse.</P>

      <P>Under paragraph (a) of this section, the Minister for Finance may contribute such amount, not exceeding one-half of such costs and expenses, as he considers proper.  The Minister is bound not to pay more than 50 per cent.  We had the views to-day of other people who appealed <Col N="1498" /> to him here in relation to this.  We had the views of the Rosslare Development Association.  Their opinion is that it would be most unlikely that the schemes envisaged under the Bill would ever be implemented if the proportion of the Government contribution is not greatly increased.</P>
      <P>Let us take any scheme under this and examine it out.  I will take a town with which I am very familiar, the town of Youghal.  The principal attractions there are the strand and the castle.  They are being wiped out because of coast erosion.  The estimated cost of combating that erosion is £46,000.  Fifty per cent. of that under the provisions of this Bill would be £23,000 and one penny in the £ brings in £46.  Now, one can envisage the temptation to the people of Youghal&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to make up the funds for that and to find the money.  We can see what hope there is under this Bill of that particular erosion problem ever being dealt with.  The estimated cost of the scheme at Ringabella in Deputy Desmond's constituency is somewhere around £400,000.  That would mean, provided the loan is got through, and all the rest of it&mdash;I do not know where it would come from now&mdash;something between 9d. and 10d. in the £per annum on the ratepayers of Cork to pay for the sinking fund on that loan.  Deputy Desmond has eight or ten country councillors and even if they clubbed in with my area, that would only mean 14 county councillors out of 68&mdash;the other 42 being the boys who would have to pay.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary who comes from a North Cork constituency can envisage the county councillors in the Millstreet area being asked to pay 9d. in the £ for the next 30 or 40 years in order to remedy the coast erosion at Ringabella.  Can he imagine those councillors voting for that?  Can he imagine a councillor, having voted for it, ever hoping to get into the Cork County Council again?</P>

Between South and East Cork, we have somewhere in the neighbourhood of £800,000 worth of reclamation schemes, essential schemes, and coast erosion schemes waiting.

The Departments of State, mainly the Department of Lands, are responsible.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we have to find this money to-day and the reason we have these embankments unprovided for, and I am suggesting the reason is that the sections of the Land Act which provided that money could be withheld from the landlord for the purpose of keeping out encroachments of the sea, for the purpose of maintaining the embankments, were not availed of by the Department and the Land Commission. The result is we have now in this section power to compel the unfortunate <Col N="1502" /> people who are living on that land to contribute to the payment for those embankments.  That is a worse condition still.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To day I asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that, as evidenced by public reports of a meeting <Col N="1504" /> in Kilkenny on the 13th instant, there appears to have been a breach of the principle of the inviolability of Cabinet proceedings in relation to the decision to provide £1,000,000 for the relief of unemployment and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter. To that question the Taoiseach replied in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The suggestion contained in the Deputy's question is unfounded and the answer to both parts of the question is therefore in the negative.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reply which I have quoted, given to me by the Taoiseach, immediately puts in issue the substance of my question.  It is necessary for me, therefore, to call attention to the evidence on which the question is based.</P>
      <P>In the daily Press of the 13th of this month there was published a report of a meeting at which the Tánaiste was present.  Not only was the Tánaiste present on that occasion but he also spoke.  Another Deputy, Deputy James Larkin, also spoke, and spoke in the presence of the Tánaiste.  According to the Press report on which my question was based, here is what Deputy James Larkin said at that meeting in the presence of the Tánaiste:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Larkin explained that a Labour Party deputation had approached the Taoiseach about providing £1,000,000 for relief work. Cabinet difficulties. ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mark the term &ldquo;Cabinet difficulties&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...were developing and Mr. Norton had made it plain that if the money was not forthcoming there would be sharp and bitter division within the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, mark the significance of the phrase &ldquo;there would be sharp and bitter division within the Government&rdquo; Quite obviously these statements of Deputy James Larkin related to the difficulties of which he had knowledge, difficulties which had arisen between the factions within the Coalition Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Otherwise, why speak of Cabinet difficulties, why refer to &ldquo;sharp and bitter division within the Government&rdquo;? <Col N="1505" /> According to Deputy James Larkin these difficulties had arisen between the Tánaiste on the one hand, as representing Deputy Larkin's Labour Party and the Minister for Finance as representing the Fine Gael faction on the other.  The difficulties spoken of must have been very marked. &ldquo;Sharp and bitter&rdquo; was how Deputy James Larkin described them.  But sharp and bitter as they may have been, that is not the aspect of the matter to which I wish to call public attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Larkin's statements were either true or false.  I cannot say which they were but I doubt if Deputy James Larkin, in the presence of the Tánaiste or indeed elsewhere, would make a statement which he knew to be untrue and, in the words of the Taoiseach himself, unfounded.  So, unless the statements which he made were contradicted by the person who, according to Deputy James Larkin, had threatened to create sharp and bitter division within the Government, we are entitled to assume that Deputy James Larkin's statement was true and that the suggestion contained in the question which I put to the Toiseach to-day was well-founded.  I can only approach the matter on the basis of <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    <P>How did the Tánaiste, who was on the platform with Deputy James Larkin, deal with that Deputy's statement? How did he deal with the statements made by his own Party's member? You will note I am not dealing with the merits of providing £1,000,000 for the relief of want and destitution which, for the first time in 24 years, will be widespread this Christmas.  I am dealing only with one narrow aspect of the matter, an aspect of it which is the special responsibility of the Taoiseach.  Under the Constitution, the Taoiseach is responsible to this House for the Government as a whole and for the behaviour inside and outside the Cabinet, in relation to public affairs, of every member of that Government.  May I say again that I am dealing only with the narrow question as to how it came to pass that Deputy James Larkin was in a position to broadcast that the Labour <Col N="1506" /> Tánaiste had got the better of the Fine Gael Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat again what Deputy James Larkin said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Norton has made it plain that if the money was not forthcoming there would be sharp and bitter division within the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to express a view as to whether or not the £1,000,000 would be forthcoming or where the Minister for Finance would get it from, whether by borrowing or out of normal taxation or by special taxation.  All I want to know is, not where the Minister for Finance will get this £1,000,000 but where Deputy Larkin got his information. What I might say in the next three or four sentences may be a matter of surmise.  We have seen the Tánaiste in this House.  We have seen his conduct, his aggressiveness, sometimes his offensive conduct here towards members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am going to say might be a matter of surmise, but we can imagine the Tánaiste&mdash;surely I am entitled to imagine, surely it is not now beyond the bounds of order to imagine the scene which took place when the Tánaiste met Deputy James Larkin and his colleagues in the Labour Party after he had threatened the Fine Gael Minister for Finance that there would be a sharp and bitter division within the Cabinet if the money were not forthcoming.  I can imagine what the Tánaiste said: &ldquo;I showed Sweetman where he got off.  I told him not to be daft.&rdquo;  That is a favourite expression of the Tánaiste here in the House.  &ldquo;I told him if he did not give this £1,000,000, this Government of Mr. Costello, the whole Coalition Government would be rocking <Col N="1507" /> and rolling,&rdquo; to use an expression which the Tánaiste himself used yesterday.  I said that, unless Deputy James Larkin's statements were contradicted by the person who must have given Deputy James Larkin some ground for making the statements, then we are entitled to assume that the statements of Deputy James Larkin were true and that the suggestion contained in the question which I put to the Taoiseach to-day, contrary to the terms of the Taoiseach's reply, was well founded.</P>
      <P>What did the Tánaiste say on this occasion?  He did not contradict what Deputy James Larkin had said.  He carefully avoided referring to his very extraordinary statements.  He did not endeavour to defend the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;That is not so.&rdquo; He did not say: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance is a member of my team and he was not overawed or intimidated by my threat to create sharp and bitter division within the Government.&rdquo;  Not at all.  He got up&mdash;and what did he say?  I cannot quote <i>in extenso,</i> with the short time available to me, what the Tánaiste did say in relation to the statements made by Deputy James Larkin on that occasion, but there is one gem which I think should go on the records of this House.  When he was asked: &ldquo;What did you do for the Post Office workers?&rdquo;, Mr. Norton actually threatened his heckler with violence and said: &ldquo;I will hammer something into your thick head before I have finished.&rdquo;  But there was no reference at all to what Deputy James Larkin had said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important matter.  No country can be effectively governed, and no country can enjoy good government, if there is not unity within the Cabinet and if there is not, as between one member of the Cabinet and another, the fullest trust, and if the strictest confidence is not preserved between Ministers as to what one or the other may say or have said.  It is different perhaps when members of the House are not in the Government, when they are outside the Government, when they are not members of the Government&mdash;I want to be quite clear&mdash;when they do not hold portfolios <Col N="1508" /> in the Government, when they are speaking on Opposition benches, when they are in the House as Independent members.  Then, of course, what they may say about themselves between one another, while it is not very desirable from the point of view of Party unity and Party loyalty that it should be canvassed, nevertheless it might not be classed as highly reprehensible by some.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Browne, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally would regard it as highly reprehensible in any circumstances in which the trust or confidence or the loyalty that should prevail among people working for the same objective was imperilled.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Government, however, it is very different because there is a principle which is enshrined in the Constitution and upon which our Governments are based.  Article 8, Clause 4, paragraph 2 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by members of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is to say that the Tánaiste is just as responsible and must be just as responsible as the Minister for Finance if the Minister for Finance cannot provide all the moneys the Tánaiste demands.  Similarly, the Minister for Finance is responsible for the Tánaiste, even if the Tánaiste as Minister for Industry and Commerce is guilty of certain foolish acts.  So long as the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;the Tánaiste&mdash;are in the one Cabinet confidence must be preserved between them, and the discussions which take place in the Cabinet or between members of the Government, whether in the Cabinet or outside the Cabinet, should be regarded as inviolable, should take place under a solemn seal of secrecy. Otherwise you cannot have collective responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot have collective responsibility if one member of the Government is entitled to go out and say: &ldquo;We would not have got that £1,000,000 only <Col N="1509" /> that I threatened that there would be sharp and bitter division within the Cabinet.&rdquo;  You could not have any free and frank discussion at any council table or at any Cabinet table unless every Minister there, whether he belonged to this or that Party, felt himself free to speak his mind and knew that whatever he might say inside the Cabinet would not be used against him outside.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat again that I do not believe Deputy James Larkin thought that statement of his out for himself. I would not for a moment believe that Deputy James Larkin imagined that scene within the Cabinet.  I would not think he would use a figment of imagination relating to such a matter for the purpose of political propaganda. I do not believe he would.  If there was not substantial foundation for that statement of his I am quite certain indeed that Deputy James Larkin would not have uttered those words on a public platform unless he had good reason to believe they were well founded.  If I am correct in this, then Deputy J. Larkin must have secured that information from some member of the present Coalition Cabinet.  If he did, then that is the end to the principle of collective responsibility. The doctrine of collective responsibility is the cement which binds a Government together.  It is the very sinew that knits a Government together and contributes the framework within which it works&mdash; even perhaps within which a Coalition can work&mdash;as a team.</P>
    <P>I think that, so far from trying to evade the grave and serious issue which was raised by the statements made by Deputy James Larkin the Taoiseach would have done a greater public service if he had said&mdash;and I am suggesting a way out for him&mdash;&ldquo;I think it is highly undesirable and contrary to the conventions of our Constitution, and even to the very Article of the Constitution itself, that <Col N="1510" /> differences which arise within the Government should be canvassed outside by members of the Government with other people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In reply to the question put down to me this afternoon by Deputy MacEntee, I gave a most categorical and unequivocal denial of the suggestion contained in his question. He has had the effrontery to state just recently in the course of his remarks that that statement is untrue.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on that allegation that I, knowing the responsibility I have, as Head of the Government, would deliberately state in answer to a question, however awkward it might be, something that was not true.  I propose to confine myself to just one or two points of a positive and unequivocal character in reply to the Deputy's remarks.  There was no division, sharp or otherwise, or at all, in the Cabinet on the question of the £1,000,000 for productive work for the unemployed.</P>
