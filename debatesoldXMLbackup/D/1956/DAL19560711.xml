    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stressed the vital importance to us as a small nation, in common with all other small nations, of the maintenance of world peace and I have emphasised my conviction that it is our duty to do what lies in our power to promote the acceptance of Christian principles in international relations.  I would like, with your permission, to quote just a few sentences from a speech that I made to the National Press Club at Washington where my views are summarised. I stated there certain principles and wish to quote them to the Dáil as my own here to-day:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The object of Irish foreign policy is to use such influence as we possess to promote the spirit of justice, Christian charity and goodwill on which the hope of peace must ultimately depend.  Within the broad scope of that purpose we seek in common with all other small nations our own survival, the welfare of our people and the preservation of peace and of the rule of law in international relations.  We have our own special object of policy in full harmony with our general purpose of <Col N="621" /> promoting justice in international affairs, namely, the restoration of the territorial unity of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The next cardinal point of our policy is our opposition to atheistic Communism.  Communism, in our view, is a creed which confronts the established order of society with the most uncompromising challenge in our history and one to which we are implacably opposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The maintenance of world peace, the establishment of the rule of law and Christian principles in international affairs and opposition to Communism, summarise the cardinal points of our policy so far.  We have, I think I am entitled to say, no quarrel with Russia or with the Russian people as such. What we do object to is the policy of atheistic Communism and, particularly, the consequences of the steadfast adherence to a policy of disseminating that policy throughout the world.  That is so important that it is our duty, in my view at all events, in fulfilling our function in world affairs, to see that the forces making for its disintegration are in no way weakened. The primary consideration for us must be to see that the forces of atheistic Communism are repelled and that we do not allow ourselves to become tools to serve Communist imperialistic interests no matter how carefully they may be camouflaged.</P>
    <P>When I spoke, as I did speak on any occasion when I addressed any assembly in the States in respect of Partition, I made it quite clear that the removal of Partition would strengthen the West and strengthen the forces against disintegration.  On a subject of this kind the subject of the Partition of Ireland inevitably must be dealt with, at least to some short extent.  I have been accused of making statements in America which were contradictory of some of the statements I made elsewhere but I think that I kept, in all the speeches I made, to a consistent line.  I spoke at the Georgetown University and referred to our position there.  I spoke to the members of the National Press Club at Washington and dealt with the subject of Partition.  I said there, and I repeat here, that while our <Col N="622" /> objective to survive as a nation is paramount and that while world peace is, for Ireland, a paramount national necessity, Ireland can never pursue adventurous policies and the risk of war which would therefore hazard the nation's survival.</P>
    <P>I emphasised everywhere that our special object of national policy is the abolition of Partition and the establishment of full national unity for the whole of our island territory; that we could not, because of our preoccupation with that problem, enter into any military alliances however some friendly nations might urge us to join such alliances and that no Government in this country could contemplate any such alliance while Partition existed.</P>
    <P>Those principles were accepted with understanding and sympathy everywhere I went.  I did say, and said most deliberately, in the course of a reply that I made to a question put to me by one of the United Nations Press correspondents at a lunch that they gave to me in New York, that while Ireland would raise, at an appropriate time and on the proper occasion at the United Nations, the question of Partition, that would not mean that Ireland would be a sore thumb in the United Nations on the subject of Partition.  Anybody who has had experience of international affairs and of attendance at international organisations must have seen how particular countries and particular individuals who are constantly putting forward their own interests and their own particular grievances to the exclusion of all other interests lost all influence and came to be regarded as nothing but a mere nuisance.</P>
    <P>We have, unfortunately, due to the fact that we have been kept out of the United Nations for nine years, lost the valuable experience that we would have gained in that time of the mechanism of the diplomacy of that organisation.  Again, anybody who has been at international gatherings knows of the behind-the-scenes activities, the conferences and subterranean agreements and the back-door conferences which take place.  We have not been able to test the feelings and assess the manner in which diplomacy <Col N="623" /> is carried on in the United Nations behind the facade of the Assembly.  It will be the task of our representative to find all that out and that is why, as I said yesterday, it is so important and necessary for this country to ensure that we have friends.  Partition cannot be solved without the help of friends and friends cannot be obtained if we pursue an entirely selfish course.</P>
    <P>It is a question of timing, a question of discretion, a question of making friends, a question of doing good turns for other nations so that they will do good turns for us.  That is a common form of activity.  Trade is obtained through international contacts and friendship, through representatives of one nation doing good turns for another, and, in return, seeking help which that nation can give. It is along those general lines that we should operate on the problem of Partition.  I am convinced that it is along those lines we will secure results. The official policy of the American State Department is that America will not interfere between us and Great Britain on the question of Partition. I believe that if we play our part and secure a standing influence in the kind of part that we play in the U.N.O. we can secure friends, powerful friends, who, without any formal <i>démarche</i>, will help us in the struggle to end Partition.  I believe that it is in this respect that our membership of U.N.O. can be best used to secure the ending of Partition.</P>
    <P>I believe that if we play our cards well, as I believe we shall, and if we seek the influence which can be secured by independent action based on some of the principles enunciated during the course of this debate, then we will secure powerful help, not merely from the Irish in America but from Americans not of Irish birth or descent.  There is a lot of goodwill, an invaluable measure of goodwill, towards this country among all sections in the United States.  All those sections of people are looking to us now with eagerness to see how we will perform and see how we will achieve results.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I said yesterday <Col N="624" /> that our acceptance of membership of the United Nations imposed on us grave duties and high responsibilities I do not think that they are going to involve us in war or in intervention in any part of the world with whatever armed forces we may have, but our responsibility is to do our duty as a Catholic Christian country, to act justly, and with the kind of independence that I described yesterday, making friends for ourselves, securing respect for ourselves and ensuring that we have an influence which will count in international affairs.  This country has made an impact on practically every part of the world.  We have our relations and kith and kin all over the world.  I believe that all those people, and particularly Irish-Americans in the United States, are looking to us to do something which will increase their prestige and their pride in their own Motherland.  I hope we will be able to fulfil that expectation.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that, I think, I should refer to in passing. Certain suggestions, if not criticisms, were made as to the amount of expenditure on the Department of External Affairs.  I should like to pay tribute to our representatives abroad and to our officers in the Department of External Affairs.  I think their credit and reputation abroad stand high and that everywhere they go they do honour to themselves and to their country.  So far from these people being overpaid they are in my very serious view underpaid.  They are, in fact, struggling most of their lives with the almost impossible task of making ends meet.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made that we were expanding too much.  I think Deputy MacBride answered that yesterday.  So far from expanding we have fine-combed the Estimate for this Department. I think every penny that is spent is necessary expenditure.  We have tried to cut out anything unnecessary. We have had to stave off demands that have been made upon us for further representation.  I will mention only one type.</P>
    <P>I have been pressed very frequently, indeed, by lay people and by bishops, <Col N="625" /> priests and ecclesiastics of all kinds to have some sort of representation in the East.  We have our missionaries abroad in Africa and in the East and there is nobody to look after their intersts except possibly when we have a representative in Australia and the distance from Australia to the East is very vast indeed.  I have been pressed very strongly by people in South Africa because of the situation in which Catholic and Christian schools are there at the present time for some representatives of this country to whom people of Irish descent and Catholics can look.  It should be a cardinal point of our policy to the extent we can secure it to look after our people and missionaries in the East but it will not be a very easy task.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies appear to be under the delusion that we ought to go to U.N.O. and, as I think the phrase was, not bother ourselves with other nations' problems but deal only with our own.  What an absurd position we would be in were we to go into U.N.O., talk about Partition and nothing else and walk out when there was any other problem affecting world peace and the interests of the various other nations where justice required consideration and give an example of an entirely selfish policy.  I think that would bring down upon us criticism&mdash; just criticism&mdash;and make the big expenditure relevant to our resources that we are making on the United Nations entirely futile.</P>
    <P>I should like, just before I conclude, to express and put upon record my appreciation and sincere gratitude to the President of the United States of America, to the American Government and to official America for the extraordinary welcome they gave to me as head of an Irish Government.  I quite appreciate, to use the expression I used at one meeting in America, that I went to America officially as the unimportant representative of a very important country, and it was to this very important small country that the President of the greatest nation in the world at the present time, the most powerful nation, the nation that is carrying the <Col N="626" /> greatest weight of international responsibility, paid such tribute and respect.</P>
    <P>To the people of the United States whom I met in the course of my journey I should like also to record my thanks&mdash;official America and unofficial America.  Native Americans, if I may use that expression, Irish-born Americans and Americans of Irish descent, all vied with each other to do honour to this small nation.  In the tribute I wish to pay here and put on record, I should like especially to record my appreciation&mdash;I hope I will be entitled to say that I do so with the consent of this House and the people of Ireland&mdash; in regard to the University of Yale which is Puritan in its origin.  It honoured this Catholic country by inviting me, in my capacity as head of the Government for the time being, to take part in the deliberations of the student body and to meet the professors, fellows and lecturers of the Law School and of the Timothy Dwight College.  From the President of Yale and the fellows and lecturers of Yale I received nothing but the utmost friendship, cordiality and hospitality.  To meet the students of Yale was a perfect joy.  They were interested in nothing but in Ireland.  They wanted to talk about nothing but Irish affairs and learn about Ireland and Irish affairs.  Very few, if any, of those I met had any Irish origin.</P>
    <P>I think it is also proper and incumbent upon me to pay the highest tribute in my power to Mr. and Mrs. Wilmarth Lewis who from their own funds put at my disposal a scholarship to be granted to an Irish citizen to visit Yale for post-graduate studies in any course I select.  That was a gesture of great friendship from a distinguished scholar and a very well-known personality not merely in Yale but in the United States.  I think it is right and proper that we should record our thanks for that generous gesture.  It was a gesture which in itself was substantial not only from the point of view of money and value but from the point of view of its friendliness towards this country and its interest in this country which was beyond measure.</P>
    <P>I want once again to emphasise, as I did at the start, that Ireland has a <Col N="627" /> great opportunity.  I think we will grasp that opportunity.  Certainly whatever Government may be in power from time to time will do the best it can to see that our duties and obligations are carried out in the United Nations.  If we do that, we will enhance our own prestige here and we will, I believe, secure friends who will help us in a very powerful way to solve Partition.  We will also ensure that the respect which foreigners have for us and particularly the respect which America has for us will enable them to have such an esteem for us that they will be inclined to trade more with us and invest more money with us, to put it at its lowest possible level.  If we rise, as I believe we will rise, to the opportunity, I think Ireland will become a very vital factor for good in world affairs in time to come.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach did not mention the name of the Deputy who was supposed to have said that in taking part in the deliberations of U.N.O. we should confine ourselves entirely to the issue of Partition and take no interest in the problems of other nations.  I do not know who is supposed to have made that statement but, perhaps, from Deputy Declan Costello's speech, one would gather that the statement is attributed to Deputy Aiken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  The actual thing I had in mind is at column 220, Volume 159 of the Official Report where Deputy McQuillan rather seemed to criticise me for saying we would not make a nuisance of ourselves in U.N.O.  Then he said we should not go to U.N.O. for the sake of listening to other nations protesting about their problems, having first said that we should lose no opportunity to speak about Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Taoiseach.  I am glad I raised the matter, and I did so because Deputy Declan Costello, when he spoke a few days ago, criticised Deputy Aiken because of what he alleged to be the attitude taken by Deputy Aiken&mdash;that we should regard the attitude of <Col N="628" /> countries to Partition as the yardstick by which we would measure them.  I read Deputy Aiken's statement and I found nothing to justify Deputy Declan Costello's criticism and nothing to justify his view that Deputy Aiken's remarks could be interpreted in that way.</P>
      <P>I think&mdash;although I do not like to say it&mdash;that there were portions of the Minister's opening speech which were silly and pretentious.  Whether it was the desire to get headlines in the newspapers or not I do not know, but his statement that his Department at all times is keeping a detailed survey of events in Russia and the Middle East and Africa is just silly and, as I said, pretentious.  I imagine it is not true.  I imagine that the Department of External Affairs does not concern itself at all times and in detail with the things that are happening in the countries and areas mentioned.  I think I would recommend instead the attitude of Deputy Boland who, in a short clear speech, pointed out that he would like our representatives in the Council of Europe to use their influence in an attempt to make the bigger Powers understand that great changes have taken place in Africa and in the Middle East, that the people in these areas have realised their right to self-determination and are determined that they will have their freedom, and that our representatives should use all their power in the Council of Europe and, indeed, elsewhere to get these big Powers to realise for their own sake that time has marched on.</P>
      <P>That is a sensible point of view.  It is a fact that these changes have taken place; it is a fact that the people have the right to determine their own future; it is a fact that the Cypriots are now in the process of finding their freedom.  They will get their freedom and the British will not stop them getting it, but, in the meantime, the British should cease playing into the hands of Communism and the Communists and do something practical towards ensuring the peace of Europe by giving the Cypriots what they will have to give them in the end anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> Deputy Barry and others here expressed themselves as not being clear on the situation, but I do not see that anything could be clearer.  I do not think we should waste our time talking about ideals and religion in a matter which is as clear cut as this.  As I say, we do not have to waste the time of our Department keeping a detailed survey of events in the Arab and other worlds when the situation is just as simple as Deputy Boland pointed out in his statement a few days ago.  I agree with Deputies MacBride and McQuillan that as members of U.N.O. we should not be afraid to criticise any Power which in our belief is abusing our position.  I say &ldquo;Power&rdquo; because it is normally the Great Powers that do abuse their positions, because they are able to do it.  I think Deputy MacBride and Deputy McQuillan are right when they say that we should not just confine ourselves to criticising atheistic Communism.</P>
    <P>In my opinion far too much has been said of this subject.  I think it goes without saying that we are Christians, that we are against Communism.  We do not have to get up here to make long speeches about our implacable hatred of Communism and our implacable determination to resist it.  Of course we will resist it but we are not afraid of it.  We were not afraid of Britain before; we are not afraid of her now.  Even though our future of them now.  Even though our future may be tied up with her, it is not as the Minister says indissolubly tied up with her.  It is as much tied up with the peoples of Poznam and East Berlin who revolted against Communism because it is something which is evil and contrary to the spirit of humanity.  It is something which will not last and cannot last.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, instead of talking about it, I suggest we do not have to talk about it, and that we should go on in our own way, secure in our faith and in our principles and determined to stand by them.  As I say, our history and our tradition have proved that we are not afraid of dungeon, fire, sword and death, and that is about all Communism can do to anybody.  It has all been done to us before, and I do hope we shall play our part in <Col N="630" /> U.N.O. in the same way as we have already played a significant part in the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Convention on Human Rights which has been adopted by the Council of Europe is in a form which owes much to the work, in particular, of Deputy MacEntee.  Most people now know that when the convention was originally drafted, it did not contain what came to be described afterwards as &ldquo;the three Irish R's&rdquo;.  It was Deputy MacEntee's insistence in committee on the importance of these three rights which he thought should be added to the convention and his refusal to let the convention go forward without them that caused these three Irish R's, as they had been called, to be inserted in the convention, and to be ultimately adopted.  I suppose most people are aware that these are conventions which deal with the right to private property, the inviolability of the person and the right of parents to decide the form of education of their children.</P>
    <P>These are things which the best brains of Europe had not thought about.  They represent a very significant contribution towards the most important things done by the Council of Europe since it was established.  I think Deputy Boland deserves great praise for his attitude in the council at all times.  Like here, people are inclined to be long-winded, verbose and anything but clear.  Deputy Boland is always concise, perfectly clear and always, I think, gives the impression of wisdom as well as being wise.  He has consistently pointed out to the representatives there that the rights of small nations will have to be met and that the Great Powers will have to face that.</P>
    <P>One of the friends I made there was a Labour M.P. from Britain.  The last time I met him was about 12 months ago.  We fell to discussing the situation in Cyprus.  On many occasions previously we had discussed all sorts of subjects, but we only had about two sentences on this one.  He said: &ldquo;What are we going to do about Cyprus?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;You have to get out.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;We cannot get out.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;You have to get out.&rdquo;  And <Col N="631" /> that was full stop to the conversation. Deputy Boland has pointed out to them what is a fact: that they have to get out, and they might as well get out with prestige and with credit to themselves now, rather than have to get out later on when they have done a great deal of damage.</P>
    <P>While pleased that we have been admitted to the United Nations, I am a little sceptical about the value of our membership at the present time.  The United Nations, as Deputy Aiken pointed out, is dominated by the Security Council, which, in turn, is dominated by the permanent members, who have the right of veto.  The great hopes which were entertained when the United Nations was founded some ten years ago have not been realised, and that has been due to the abuse by the Security Council members of the excessive powers they were given in the first instance.  These powers were given at a time when all the members professed their determination never again to involve the world in war and when, for instance, Russia, America and Britain were allies, fighting a common cause.  That situation changed very rapidly and caused the United Nations from the very beginning to be less successful than it was hoped it would be.  I hope that Deputy Aiken is right when he says that that situation will not last. I honestly believe that, if it does last, the days of the United Nations are numbered&mdash;the days of its real usefulness as an organisation for the promotion of world peace.</P>
    <P>We can, of course, gain valuable experience and much knowledge from membership of an association with other sub-committees and sub-organisations. In the same way we have gained, or should have gained, valuable experience from our association with O.E.E.C. and other bodies in the past few years.  I do not think that we have benefited from our association with O.E.E.C. in the way that we should have.  I think that the recommendations which have been made by O.E.E.C., instead of being accepted by this country, have been rejected, and that we have not <Col N="632" /> fashioned our economic policy in accordance with what appears to be first-class expert advice by international economic experts.  Without being catty, I should like to say that I believe, if the Minister could say that his Department were at all times keeping a detailed survey of the documents coming from O.E.E.C., he would be saying something far more important than that they were keeping a detailed survey of events in Russia and Africa.</P>
    <P>That brings me, if only briefly, to the question of Partition.  For a long time, people have found it easy, and perhaps popular, to say that the solution of Partition is the biggest remaining problem in this country.  For perhaps a less long time I have thought that the solution of Partition&mdash;I do not like to use that expression&mdash;that the unification of our country is not the most important object of our policy.  Our primary object now should be to make a success, economically and otherwise, of the Twenty-Six Counties we have.  I believe the greatest contribution we could make towards the eventual unification of our country would be the solution, not of the problem of Partition, but of the problem of the serious economic dislocation in our Twenty-Six Counties; in other words, that we have yet to prove that, even with the Twenty-Six Counties, we have laid a solid foundation for the future.  We have yet to prove that we are worthy of the Twenty-Six Counties we have, and until we do, while we know we are entitled to them, we may not prove worthy of getting back the six other counties which were taken from us.  I do not propose to go into the matter of how they were taken from us, and I do not think any useful purpose can be served by going back over the history of what happened 30 or 35 years ago; but I should like to say that the people of Ireland, by the mere act of passing the Constitution, which expresses itself to be the Constitution of the whole 32 counties of Ireland, have repudiated any claim to the Six Counties, whether made by a Government in this country or an outside Power, or anybody but the people of this country itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> I asked a question of the Taoiseach about a fortnight ago about conditions in Birmingham.  Unfortunately, I was not here for his reply.  I understand that a Liberal organisation in Birmingham wrote to the Taoiseach, and had a copy of their letter sent to the local paper, in which they said the squalor and filth in which the Irish people were living in Birmingham were so dreadful that the Taoiseach should take measures to see that Irish people did not go there any more.  The Taoiseach's reply was very carefully phrased.  He had to try to avoid the statement that everything was perfect in Birmingham lest anybody would accuse him of trying to send people over there and, at the same time, to indicate that what the organisation said was not true.</P>
    <P>I think, perhaps, I am in a less difficult position than the Taoiseach in this matter.  I have gone into it carefully; I had some doctor friends of mine report to me on it, and they say it is not true that Irish people are living, for the most part, in squalor and filth in Birmingham.  Large numbers of them are in the process of buying their own houses, most of them are quite well housed, most of them are being looked after, from the spiritual viewpoint, by the Church and, generally, I understand, they are a credit to the country.  They have kept their traditions and religion and outlook in life as one would expect good Irishmen to do.</P>
    <P>Of course there will always be exceptions where there are a large number of people living.  You will always find the few, who, through their own fault, will live in squalor and filth.  There will always be the few who will let their country down, but I think it is not true to say that, as a whole, the Irish people are not a credit, or that they are not living in reasonably good conditions in Birmingham at the present time.  That is not, of course, to say, that we are encouraging them to go.  Indeed we are not.  We would like them to stay here, but if they must go, we would like to know they are being properly looked after.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I think our representatives <Col N="634" /> in London have done an excellent job looking after the interests of the Irish people over there. The Ambassador there has always attended the Irish games of hurling and football played in London.  He keeps in contact with the Gaelic organisations and has been associated with the establishment of the Irish Club and the University Club.  All round, Irish people have been well looked after by our representatives.  It has been a difficult job and our representatives deserve great credit for the way in which they have done it.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to say that any of our representatives abroad have not done excellent jobs.  In my limited experience, they have done wonderful jobs for the country, and, in matters of trade and tourism, particularly as regards tourism, I believe they have done excellent jobs in bringing this country to the notice of the people with the money, interest and time to travel over here to see us.</P>
    <P>I should like to agree with Deputy Declan Costello regarding a suggestion that our representatives in the Council of Europe should be assisted and briefed before attending.  I think that is vitally essential.  I was there for only one session and unfortunately, due to a little bit of gerrymandering by the Opposition who got there before us, some of us were not put on any of the committees.  This, I understand, never happened before.  It made things very difficult indeed.  I do not wish to reopen old sores, but, as I say, it made things very difficult not being a member of any committee. The only things I could take part in were the general debates in the Assembly.  I found it very difficult, ploughing through an enormous mass of documentation; it was like taking a ship out on an uncharted sea and wondering whether you were going to reach port.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Declan Costello's suggestion that our representatives should be briefed is a very good one. It would help considerably if the general trend of the debates in the previous session, and certain matters of principle, which one will eventually find out, anyhow, were made clear to <Col N="635" /> them before they went.  I also agree that the Council of Europe, as such, appears to be falling on very lean times.  I am astonished to hear that anything such as the suspension of the Convention on Human Rights by Britain in relation to Cyprus should have escaped the Council of Europe. If that is so, the council is becoming moribund.  We should do anything we possibly can to help the Council of Europe, but frankly I think we cannot do anything.  I believe the importance of the Council of Europe is largely reflected in the attitude of the British to it and that their failure to identify themselves in a true sense with European movement has been the root cause of the failure of the Council of Europe to realise the dreams of, among other people, a very important Englishman, Winston Churchill.</P>
    <P>I believe that until the British are prepared to do what their own leader wanted them to do, the Council of Europe will not be or become the organisation it was hoped it would be. Of course, they have done much good work in regard to the simplification of frontier formalities, refugee organisations, and all sorts of other things. These, however, are side issues, though very important ones, and I am glad to say that our country has played its part in the council's committees and that at least some of the progress that has been made has been due to the efforts of our representatives.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that too much emphasis is laid on our implacable determination to resist Communism. We are not able to resist Communism, except through our spirit and faith and Christian outlook.  If we are Christian, it goes without saying we are anti-Communist, and it also goes without saying we should be anti-oppression, no matter where we find it and that, when we take our part in U.N.O., we should not be afraid to stand up for principles of justice, honesty and truth, no matter who is hurt in the process.</P>

      <P>The House ought to be very grateful to the Minister for his comprehensive survey of international affairs.  After all, anything that <Col N="636" /> happens, even in the remotest part of the world, has repercussions all over the world and Ireland has representatives, whether as missionaries or lay folk, scattered all over the world.  It must be a consolation for them to know that the Minister who is looking after foreign affairs here has an interest in everything that goes on in the world.</P>
      <P>We must accept that we belong to three world organisations: O.E.E.C., the Council of Europe and now we have entered into the world arena of the U.N.O.  O.E.E.C. has served a very useful function.  It is a collection of experts who are trying to heal the economic ills of the world and put them before the people and the Governments concerned, so that they may direct their energies in the proper directions and secure the best conditions for their people.  I should like to make one little criticism of O.E.E.C.  In the extensive report the organisation produced recently, covering all the member countries, it saw fit to devote only a few pages to agriculture whereas 25 per cent. of the total gross population the organisation represents are mainly concerned with agriculture.  I feel sure that the vital interests of that 25 per cent. should have been dealt with at greater length than three pages out of 300.  This is a vital point so far as we are concerned because we are predominantly agricultural, dependent in our economy on the produce and the markets of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy MacBride said is very true, that the great difference between the Council of Europe and the United Nations is that the representatives of the Council of Europe representing this or any other country go out as spokesmen of their country.  In the majority of instances, they go out as authorised deputies elected by the people of that country and they are free to express their own sentiments, and the sentiments they are expressing are not necessarily the sentiments of their own Government.  Several speakers here have said that it should be possible for the members of the Council of Europe, when they are going abroad, to be briefed by the Department <Col N="637" /> of External Affairs.  I do not think there is any difficulty in any Deputy obtaining whatever brief he wants at any time from that Department. Whenever I have gone to the Department of External Affairs or to any other Department, before travelling abroad to attend a meeting of some committee, I have never had the slightest difficulty in getting all the necessary assistance and information.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe may have its ups and downs but it serves a very useful function.  The General Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe some 12 months ago issued a report in which suggestions were made in connection with the drafting of the Paris Treaty, the successor of the one that had failed, and the suggested draft was practically identical with the treaty that was ratified by the Powers concerned a short time afterwards.  I make this statement to show that the representatives on the Council of Europe are representative of the various Parliaments; they are representative not only of the Government side of the House but of the Opposition as well.  They are, in effect, the democratic voice of Europe, and they must serve a useful function when they are able to come to almost unanimous agreement in the promulgation or preparation of the suggestions and ideas that ultimately inspired the Ministers who drafted this final treaty.</P>
    <P>Anyone who travels abroad on behalf of his country, being a member of an organisation or a public representative, is serving a useful function for his country.  An Irish representative is in a strong position to put the case for Ireland, from the point of view of tourism, trade and of our cultural or, if you like, spiritual outlook, before the other nations of the world.  I agree that we should not spend all our time voicing the fact that we are opposed to Communism.  We have no need to do that.  Our history is such that everybody in every country of the world knows that we loathe brutal atheism and tyranny, no matter where they may be met.  I feel, however, that Ireland has a great opportunity in the United Nations of showing to the world that we are unflinching and unchanging <Col N="638" /> in our principles and, no matter what discussion may come up and no matter what groups or blocs may be formed, our members will always maintain that the individual has the right to freedom and to determine his own future.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are joining the United Nations and that, as the Minister has asserted, we will stand by the principles adopted by the free nations of the world, does not mean that we will become anybody's &ldquo;stooge&rdquo;.  It means that we are simply asserting the rights and the principles that we have always had and always will have in any international assembly wherever we may be.  Yesterday the Taoiseach told us how one issue was decided in the United Nations by one vote.  The time may come when that one vote to establish some historic principle or something we may believe to be right may rest in the hands of the Irish representatives. I welcome the fact that we are a member of the United Nations. The benefits that will accrue to us from it, even though it may cost us a little more in our annual budgetary returns for the Department of External Affairs, will be immeasurable.</P>
    <P>In relation to Partition, what strikes me is that most things settle themselves ultimately in this world by force of economics.  No one will gainsay the fact that the Six Counties is an uneconomic unit.  That is borne out by the fact that some time ago a member of the British Parliamentary Opposition went over to Northern Ireland and interviewed people there with the idea of trying to deal with the unemployment and the economic stress arising in that part of our country.  The net result was that the British Government was forced to provide special aid and to treat the Six Counties as a special area.  Following on that, they found themselves faced with claims from Wales and Scotland for the same reason.  It will be seen, therefore, that economics have the last word in everything, that if the Imperial Parliament, which is not in the happy financial position it was in in days gone by, finds it is repeatedly faced with a charge to maintain and sustain an uneconomic unit, the growing pressure <Col N="639" /> brought to bear by other parts of the country will bring it home to her that it may not be good economics to continue this anomaly that exists to-day under the forced régime of the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay my tribute to our Embassies abroad.  It has been my privilege in the last few years to be abroad a good deal as a member of the Council of Europe.  I have been to a good many Embassies and I have met most of our public representatives abroad.  We may hold our heads high in the knowledge that the servants of the State who represent us in the different Embassies are a credit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that they are not carrying out their full functions with regard to tourism and trade. Let me say that I have never been to an Irish Embassy anywhere abroad, in Europe anyway, where I have not seen every evidence of those Embassies trying to sell to the countries they are in the benefits of holidays in Ireland. I believe that a lot of our tourist trade that comes here from Europe is due entirely to the devoted efforts of our servants in those Embassies.  Quite recently I was going through a city in Europe and the Embassy there had conducted the finalising arrangements in a trade agreement, and I know that those men were sitting up far into the night working.  In fact, they were almost worn out at the end of the hard work they had put into the negotiation of that agreement.</P>
    <P>Practically all our trade is conducted through our Embassies and Ministries abroad.  They serve us well, and to reduce or cut down any of them would not be in the best interests of the State.  Anybody who suggests that is doing a grave disservice to the Irish nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will not take me as far afield as Asia or Africa, but will refer to one matter much nearer home which nevertheless is, I think, primarily the responsibility of the Department of External Affairs. We are very often reminded by the newspapers that foreign fishing fleets show a very unwelcome interest in the <Col N="640" /> waters around our shores, and unpleasant incidents have happened on several occasions.  I should like to ask the Minister in this regard about the progress being made in applying for the benefit of Irish territorial waters the findings of the International Court of The Hague on the dispute between Britain and Norway.  I know that a good deal of the judgment refers exclusively to the facts of the case that was before the court, but, in the course of deciding that dispute, certain international principles generally applicable have been established, and, on the basis of these general principles, it is possible, I understand, for the Irish Government to extend the area of its territorial waters very considerably.</P>
      <P>I know that this is not going to solve the problem which irritates our fishermen very often.  As a matter of fact, it may in certain respects aggravate it.  The criticism may be offered that if we are not able to protect adequately the lesser area of exclusive fishery limits, how can we hope to protect even as well as we are now doing the extended area which will become our right when this decision of The Hague has been applied to our case. But there is perhaps this consideration in relation to it, that the intruding foreigner will have a bigger distance to travel to get clear of our exclusive waters, if in fact we succeed in extending their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there are Departments other than External Affairs intimately interested in it.  Fisheries, of course, is obviously one.  I understand that Defence is another, that the Revenue are interested, and Local Government, and I take it that the Department of External Affairs will be the coordinating agency in producing the new régime that will meet the viewpoints of these various national interests. One of these interests, namely, Fisheries, has drawn up a tentative map on the basis of the decisions given by the court.  Whether the map so drawn up has been accepted by the other Departments and confirmed by the Department of External Affairs, I am not in a position to say, <Col N="641" /> but in spite of the enlarged problem of protection which the increased area will provide the Fishery Protection Service with, nevertheless I think it would be a very good thing if we could establish this larger exclusive fishery area.</P>
    <P>I understand that certain agreements which were tentatively entered into before the war between certain of our civil servants and their counterparts in Britain cannot now be enforced, and in fact we are entitled to make a larger claim than apparently the officials on both sides on that occasion were prepared to agree to. I understand that the question of certain of our bays has now been rendered a much easier problem as a result of the court decision.  It is obvious that, in the first instance, we shall have to arrange with the British, but I think that, having done that, the other nations would then fall into line with whatever agreement would be made between ourselves and the British.  It is not British fishing boats which have been causing the trouble here in recent times.  They are mainly French and occasionally Spaniards, although a good spirit of <i>camaraderie</i> seems to exist on the West coast between the Spaniards and our fishermen, and, in fact, our local population.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that even after we have done the best we can in this matter, there will still be incidents, and that it will be very largely in the hands of the Fisheries Branch to fill in whatever gaps may be left; but, in any event, perhaps the Minister would say how far he has progressed in preparing the case which he will ask the British Government to discuss with him on the basis of this international decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, there is one matter to which I should like to refer as briefly as possible. As a result of a recent publication, containing many slipshod inaccuracies, a revival of a campaign of slander against Roger Casement has taken place.  In their effort to build up a case against Roger Casement, certain people have used evidence of a most questionable character.  A worse aspect <Col N="642" /> of the affair is that recently, as a result of a debate in the British House of Commons, a memorandum of the filthiest and foulest type now appears published in <i>Hansard.</i>  Following that, an article appear in <i>The Spectator</i> in which the writer suggested that a concordat had been entered into between the British and the Irish Government to remain silent on this question.  Fortunately, the Minister completely refuted that allegation.  In recent Press correspondence, we were fortunate also in having very competent people defending the character of Roger Casement.  The writer in <i>The Spectator,</i> however, said that he was strengthened in holding his opinion because of the silence of the Minister on this question.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister now to take a very serious view of this campaign. The Taoiseach, in his speech, referred to friends and the advantages to be gained from their friendship.  As a result of this recent campaign, we now know that we have very prominent people on the other side who are prepared to play their part in defending the character of Roger Casement.  I suggest that, as a campaign of this sort could cause most unpleasant disagreement between the two nations, and as the authorities in England denied Casement an opportunity of defending his character before they hanged him, and refused a very distinguished American journalist's repeated request to interview Casement on this subject, English people at the present time should at least have the decency to discontinue this foul campaign against Roger Casement.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to take serious note of this and to do what he can to stop it.  Apart from his responsibility as the Minister concerned, like myself, he represents the constituency in which Roger Casement was born and, for that reason, I make a very special appeal to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this debate has suffered from the fact that it has been interrupted on a number of occasions and, for that reason, some Deputies appear not to have followed what I said or to have interpreted it in a way different from that <Col N="643" /> which I intended in introducing the Estimate.  When opening this debate, I expressed the view that the Government welcomed the admission of this country to the United Nations.  Since that, this debate has shown that that view has been fortified by expressions of opinion from different quarters of this House.</P>
      <P>In welcoming our admission, I emphasised that we had responsibilities to discharge and that, while these responsibilities were not lightly undertaken, we could not escape the consequences of our admission or avoid the expense attaching to it.  The Government recognised once this country was admitted, that that admission would involve increased expenditure. The original decision to apply for membership was taken almost ten years ago and, on that occasion, the Dáil unanimously decided to apply for membership.  It was not possible then, and it is not possible even now, to estimate exactly what financial cost that will entail; but, on the basis of the figures available to the Department, the Estimate has been framed on the appropriate charge which would fall to be met by this country.  At the end of this year, when the General Assembly meets, there may be some slight revision one way or the other in the figure.</P>
      <P>While a number of Deputies expressed concern at the cost of this Department, few of them adverted to the fact that, in spending the money which this Department is obliged to spend, quite a considerable proportion of that expenditure is incurred in respect of membership of various international organisations.  Once the initial decision to accept membership is taken, it follows automatically that, if we are to remain members, we are obliged to meet the commitments attaching to membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here figures which show that expenditure under Vote 59&mdash;the Vote for International Co-operation&mdash; amounted in 1946-1947 to £20,173 for the then League of Nations.  There was no contribution in 1947-1948 because the league had ceased to exist. In 1948-1949, for O.E.E.C. and the Council of Europe, the figure first <Col N="644" /> placed in the Estimate was £19,499. That figure increased each year until in 1953-1954, it stood at £36,349.  There was a slight reduction in 1954-1955 and another slight reduction this year to £33,000.  These figures indicate, first of all, the fact that, once we become members of these organisations, we are liable for our contribution on the appropriate basis as between the various member countries.  Secondly, we have to provide travelling expenses for the delegates and the official missions which attend the meetings of the parent body or meetings of sub-committees under it.  Consequently, we have very little choice except to meet the expense involved and if we want to avoid the expense the only way it can be done is either by not joining initially or ceasing to remain members of it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the fact that we had a great many missions abroad.  Deputy de Valera said the Vote had now reached very large proportions, comparing the cost now and the cost pre-war and in 1947-48. He also referred to the fall in the value of the £ sterling.  In some cases, of course, that is aggravated even more so by the fact that we have got to deal in dollars in the case of the United States and Canada.  I have here a list of the various missions which were opened and the dates on which they were opened. The first mission was in London in 1923.  Then followed Washington in 1924; the Holy See, Paris and Germany in 1929; Madrid in 1935; Rome, the Quirinal, in 1937; Ottawa in 1938; Berne in 1940; Lisbon in 1942; Canberra in 1946; Stockholm in 1946; Brussels in 1947; Buenos Aires in 1948; The Hague in 1949 and Bonn in 1950.  In addition, a consulate-general was appointed in New York in 1929.  Consuls were appointed in Boston in 1930, in Chicago in 1932 and in San Francisco in 1933. The Minister to Italy was accredited to Turkey in 1951: that is a dual accredition.  Similarly, the Minister to Berne was accredited to Austria in 1952 and the Minister at Stockholm was accredited to Norway in 1950. Prior to 1947, the Minister at Paris was accredited to Belgium.  At the <Col N="645" /> end of last year, the permanent delegate was appointed to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>I think it will be seen that most of these missions were opened either before the war or immediately afterwards. Once a decision is taken to open a mission, it follows that whatever expense is involved must be met. I think anybody who has experience or who even examines the Estimates will appreciate that most of our offices abroad consist of a very limited staff&mdash; in some cases a Minister or Ambassador and additional staff consisting of either one or two persons.  There are, of course, exceptions such as in London, Washington and Paris but in a few places we have only a single person representing the country.  It will be appreciated that that makes it all the more difficult for the individual involved.  I believe that so far as our offices abroad are concerned the staff is at the minimum possible.  We have carefully examined the staffing position in a number of these places to see if any reductions are possible and some changes will be made which will enable us to provide staff for the new United Nations mission at New York.  However, when Deputies suggest that the representatives abroad should engage in furthering trade and tourism they must recognise that all that work which is already part of the responsibilities of our missions abroad entails both time and effort and needs sufficient staff to carry it out.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech, I referred to the fact that we have a number of trade agreements with foreign countries and that, excluding the 1938 and 1948 trade agreements with Britain, we have agreements with a number of European countries.  All of these agreements were concluded in 1950 or later except the agreement with France in 1948 and Sweden in 1949.  They were concluded in order to facilitate the development of actual or potential markets in Irish products. In the case of certain countries, it would have been impossible, without concluding a trade agreement, to secure specific import quotas for non-liberalised Irish goods.  In 1955, the exports to the countries concerned <Col N="646" /> amounted to £4,000,000 and that represented 28 per cent. of the value of our exports in that year to all areas other than Britain and the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The different representatives abroad, with the exception of the representative to the Vatican, are all engaged in the promotion of trade and tourism. They assist in the direct negotiation of trade agreements.  They secure information from the Departments with which they are dealing in the countries to which they are accredited and they keep our Department informed directly and other Departments either directly or through information supplied from the Department to the home Departments that are affected by it.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that substantial benefits have flowed from these trade agreements.  It is a fact that in most cases our balance of trade with the countries with which we have trade agreements is heavily against us and it is the responsibility of the representatives abroad to try to improve that position.  They have on many occasions, as a result of their efforts, succeeded in securing import quotas for goods which were not formerly available and succeeded in securing facilities for imports of commodities which exporters here were anxious to sell to the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not possible specifically to say what actual benefit is secured by the expenditure of the Department either at home or abroad.  It is easy to criticise the amount of the expenditure. It is easy to suggest that a reduction could be made but, as I have said, once the initial decision is taken to open a mission or become a member of a particular international body or organisation, financial consequences follow and if we are to remain members we have got to meet the commitments which are decided by the body as a whole, generally on a proportionate basis according to the size or population of the country or on some other accepted basis.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the case of trade.  These trade agreements have meant considerable benefits to our exporters and <Col N="647" /> to our traders who were anxious to avail of them.  Again, it is not possible specifically to say to what extent the work of the missions abroad has contributed to the negotiation of these trade agreements.  I have in the Department many tributes from people who have conducted trade discussions, or who have sold or exported goods to countries abroad, complimenting officials and officers, either of the Department at home or of the missions abroad, who facilitated them in the work and in the development of whatever particular item of trade they were interested in.</P>
    <P>The fact that a number of these agreements were negotiated at all was due to the work of the representatives of the Department in the countries concerned. It is equally true that they were assisted by representatives of the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, and Industry and Commerce, and in some cases by officials of Córas Tráchtála. All of the work which goes into the negotiating of these trade agreements has been materially assisted by the efforts which our representatives abroad have made and by their constant attention to the necessity for expanding our trade with the countries with which we have representation.</P>
    <P>The same is true of tourism.  The Department's representatives keep in touch with tourist agencies; they supply information about the country and keep in touch directly with the Department at home, and with Bord Fáilte Éireann, as well as giving, in many cases, lectures and keeping people in other countries informed generally on the facilities available here for holidays and for tourists.  It is not possible, as it is in the case of expenditure under other Votes, or on specific projects, to say that it cost so much and that there is the actual return.  In these cases, all we can do is to use our energies to the maximum extent possible and to realise that, when trade improves or when we can increase the number of tourists coming to the country, there has been secured a lasting benefit to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves the subject of trade representatives, <Col N="648" /> would he say whether he has considered sending a trade representative to Belfast and asking Belfast to send a representative here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That question has been raised before, but I think it has never been regarded as necessary. Trade carried on between here and Belfast is carried on directly by the traders concerned.</P>
      <P>In regard to our admission to the United Nations, as I explained in introducing the Estimate, it will be our aim to play our part so far as our resources permit, and, in doing so, to use our influence to see that the Charter of the U.N.O. is implemented in practice; to get other countries to accept the principles of the charter and to see that they are implemented in practice.  Some criticism has been expressed of the organisation.  Of course it is not a perfect organisation &mdash;few human institutions are&mdash;but we feel we have a responsibility to make some contribution to co-operation between States and nations.  This contribution must be based on our tradition as a Christian people, implementing the principles of justice and charity.  While we have no great material resources or strength, we have, spread throughout the world, Irish missionaries who exert a powerful influence for good.  We have the descendants of Irish people, many of whom have obtained positions of influence and many of whom are in humble occupations.  But the vast majority of them reflect credit on the country from which they have sprung and their influence is directed towards the implementation of the spirit of good will and harmony, wherever their efforts can be directed to these ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, our tradition, culture and history has manifested itself in opposition to tyranny and oppression.  I found it difficult to follow some of the remarks during the course of this debate, in so far as they suggested that what I had said at the beginning differed in any way from what other Deputies said about some of the problems which confront the world.  I referred, at the beginning, <Col N="649" /> to the movement which is widespread in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world&mdash;the growing desire for self-determination on the part of subject peoples and the rise of national feeling in opposition to systems of imperialistic domination surviving from the past&mdash; and I went on to say that it was impossible for us with our history to regard this general development otherwise than with sympathy.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the speakers during this debate, I was forced to the conclusion that either they did not hear this or they did not read the debate, if they were not present when the Estimate was introduced.  I went on to say that these ideals were the same as those which animated the Irish people in their struggle for independence.  I agree with Deputy Boland when he says that colonialism and all that it connotes is outdated.  I believe a new approach is needed.  It is, of course, I suppose, easy enough to see some of these problems when we are not directly concerned with them, but, with our experience, with our history and looking at the developments that have taken place&mdash;in some cases, in comparatively recent times&mdash;especially in the cases of India, Ceylon and Pakistan, we recognise that the developments which have occurred in these cases will be followed by some sort of similar solution elsewhere.  I agree with those who expressed the view that, to some extent, the policy being pursued in preventing and refusing the rights of self-determination, in cases such as Cyprus, inevitably weakens civilisation's defences against the spread of Communism.</P>
    <P>I expressed that view at the beginning, but, listening to portion of this debate, I am forced to the conclusion that some Deputies did not hear or read it.  In that regard, it must be our responsibility in U.N.O. to see, whereever possible, that our efforts are devoted to securing a pacific settlement of these problems.  We recognise that many of these problems are complex, that they are not all as simple as they would appear to be from a casual reading of newspaper or other reports and that, in the more enlightened modern approach to these problems, it is <Col N="650" /> obvious that the old style colonialism is dead and that the sooner ordinary democratic rights are applied to these cases, the quicker and, inevitably, the easier it will be to get a solution.</P>
    <P>If these problems are faced on the basis that a settlement sooner or later must be secured, it will prevent bitterness and resentment and avoid in many cases the bloodshed which will follow if a solution is not sought on the lines on which we have been working in many other cases.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I believe that, with our background and experience, we can play some part in the work of U.N.O.  The view has been expressed here that our contribution, to be effective, not only should be based on our traditions and culture, but that, in addition, we should adopt an independent attitude.  I said in introducing the Estimate that I think that, as a member of U.N.O., we should try to maintain a position of independence, judging the various questions on which we have to adopt an attitude or cast our vote strictly on their merits in a just and disinterested way.  I went on to say that, on the long term view, we will better serve our interests and gain more respect and influence for ourselves if, by maintaining our independence, we leave our hands free to pursue what may come to be generally recognised as a fair, helpful and constructive role, but the implementation of that policy does not mean that we should avoid contact with other groups.  We will co-operate and collaborate wherever possible with other countries who think on lines similar to our approach to the problems.</P>
    <P>Even great States and nations require friends and smaller countries probably need friends more than others.  Consequently in order to use our influence to the best advantage in U.N.O. we must have friends; we must secure the sympathetic co-operation of other countries.  Unless we get from these other countries sympathy for our point of view, it is obvious that we can have little effect or little influence.  It is, of course, a fact that many countries who are members of the United Nations as well as members of the <Col N="651" /> other international organisations to which we have referred have their own problems.  Great numbers of them have even greater problems than we have.  It is only human that these countries should be more concerned with their own problems, just as we are more concerned with our problems, but, if we are to attend the United Nations, or any other organisation, with the sole idea of raising our own problems on every occasion on which it is possible to do so and if we blind ourselves to the facts and to the realities of the situation, then we will neither help our own case nor secure for our cause the help, the sympathy and the co-operation which are essential if we are to secure support in the various organisations of which we are a member.</P>
    <P>As Deputies who have attended these bodies know, we are dependent, just as other countries are dependent, on support for the points of view to which we give expression.  There are, of course, occasions when we have got to take a definite stand on particular questions on which we have our own viewpoint, but in most cases the matters discussed are decided by the general consensus of opinion.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that the U.N.O. suffers from the defect that the Security Council has very considerable powers and that the veto which is reserved to the permanent members can be used to block action or to prevent decisions being taken, if one of the members of the Security Council chooses to exercise it.  It was, of course, in that way that our application for membership was prevented from being accepted for nine years, but, as I say, this organisation is not perfect.  We can only hope that, by using our influence in collaboration and co-operation with other countries who think as we do on some of these problems, ultimately right will prevail and the decisions which will be taken will be based on the application of the principles which we regard as fundamental.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that we will maintain so far as possible an independent line of action and that we will judge each issue on its merits, in the <Col N="652" /> light of the information supplied to us and in the light of the discussions which take place on the particular problems.  As I have said, that independence of action does not mean that we will not consult with other groups or associate with them where it would be to the advantage of this country to do so.  Naturally, we will keep in close contact with representatives of other countries who think and act on lines similar to our approach.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the work of the Council of Europe and O.E.E.C.  I am most anxious to brief delegates to the Council of Europe as fully as possible.  The officers of my Department are available to assist Deputies whenever their help is required.  I think it only right to say that, whenever assistance has been requested, it has been made available as fully and as freely as it has been possible to do so.  We are only anxious that Deputies should approach the Department whenever they feel that either documentation or information on any particular matter is available in the Department which would be useful to them.  They are most welcome to it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the meetings of the Council of Europe.  I cannot say definitely, but I believe that the Committee of Ministers has rarely met more frequently than it has met in recent years.  Generally the Committee of Ministers meets twice a year, but sometimes it meets more frequently. Within the past 12 months, the Ministers have met on three occasions.  I do not know whether the calling of more meetings would promote more interest or persuade countries to take action where they are reluctant to do so.  Frequently references have been made at the General Assembly to the fact that the Committee of Ministers does not take the assembly's views sufficiently into account.  It is a fact that the assembly has no responsibility for the carrying out of policies in their own countries. They can use their influence in their own Parliaments to get particular viewpoints accepted, but the responsibility for direct action devolves on the Governments concerned.  It is not <Col N="653" /> always possible to get Governments to agree to a line of action, unless they realise that some benefit is likely to accrue from it.</P>
    <P>So far as O.E.E.C. is concerned, all documentation that comes from it is examined carefully by my Department and is circulated to the other Departments interested.  Only to-day the Foreign Trade Committee is considering a proposal which has come from O.E.E.C.  It is well to realise that some of these proposals might well conflict, directly or indirectly, so far as our trade and the assistance and encouragement of our industry is concerned. We have already gone to a very considerable extent to meet the wishes of that organisation in so far as the liberalisation of trade is concerned. We have reached the target of 90 per cent.  Not many other countries have reached that level, and some of the countries that are most vocal with regard to tariffs and restrictions have not themselves reached the target of 90 per cent. which this country has reached.</P>
    <P>Some of the other countries have State trading to far greater extent than we have and they also have balance of trade problems, so that it does not suit their own internal economy to go to the 90 per cent. stage of liberalisation. So far as we are concerned, we have endeavoured to meet the requirements of O.E.E.C. so far as we consider them suitable to our conditions. To that extent, we examine carefully every proposal put up.  It is not in our interest to implement some of the suggestions made and consequently many of the proposals made at O.E.E.C. require very careful scrutiny to see whether they conflict with our protection policy and the measures we have taken to assist industry and protect our own economy from the point of view of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley referred to the question of territorial waters and he asked what developments had taken place. This matter has been under consideration for a number of years.  The International Law Commission of U.N.O. met in Geneva and failed to reach agreement.  A number were in favour of the extension of the three <Col N="654" /> mile limit, but the United States and Britain were against any extension.  It was finally noted that many countries had already extended beyond the three mile limit, but that many did not accept such extension and it was suggested that a further conference should be held to consider the matter.  As Deputies will appreciate, there is not much advantage in extending the range of our territorial waters, unless that extension is recognised by other countries.  Some of these other countries laid claim to a far greater distance than three miles and laid claim to the ocean bed for a very considerable distance, but unless such claims are universally recognised and accepted, there would be no advantage in them.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the responsibility for protection, as the Deputy said, of the rights of our fishermen is one shared not only by my Department but by the Fisheries Section of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defence.  We will ensure that whenever this country is represented at any conference our interests and our views are given expression to.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to the altered drawing of lines of measurement.  It was decided not to proceed until the general question has been settled.  Our case and the Norwegian case are different because of the nature of the coastline. If the suggested measurements were adopted, we would gain in some cases and in some we would lose.  It was generally thought by the Departments concerned here that to alter the method of measurement at the present time would be dealing with the problem in a piecemeal manner and that it was better to wait until the general question was settled, or until we could see some prospect of a better result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brady referred to the recent campaign to discredit Roger Casement. <Col N="655" /> I should like to assure the Deputy and the House that I have repeatedly repudiated the suggestion that this Government, or any Irish Government, had ever entered into a concordat or agreement with the British Government on this matter.  But, of course, Deputies will appreciate it is not possible for any Government Department to refute every allegation made on any particular matter.  Some of the articles on this matter have been published in <i>The Spectator</i> and in other journals and newspapers in Britain, but it is equally true&mdash;and it is not without some significance&mdash;that a lot of the correspondence on the matter was carried on in a newspaper in this country. Of course, again, we cannot prevent people writing to these newspapers. There is no censorship or restriction imposed on people, but I have no doubt that the vast majority of the people of this country recognise this renewed campaign as being merely another effort to discredit the memory of Casement, who gave his life in the service of Ireland.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £63,730 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> I propose, if the House agrees, to follow the same procedure as in previous years: that is, to have a general debate on the Estimates for which I am responsible as Minister for Justice so that specific questions may be raised.  The Estimates in question, Nos. 29 to 37, are all for essential services. They are made up mainly of salaries, wages and allowances, and, apart from changes in rates of pay, they do not vary much from year to year.  Accordingly, I do not think it necessary for me to go into a detailed explanation of the figures.  The Estimates have, of course, increased in recent years on account of increases in rates of pay, but I can assure Deputies that every effort is being made by way of reorganisation and simplification of procedure to reduce expenditure to the minimum.</P>
    <P>The aggregate amount of the nine Estimates is £5,469,650, an increase of £147,260 as compared with the year 1955-56, which represents an increase of 2.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The first Estimate, No, 29, is for a total of £95,530 for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  It shows an increase of £3,908 as compared with last year.  This is entirely due to increases in remuneration for all civil servants which were awarded with effect as from 1st November, 1955.  The cost of the increases in remuneration is estimated at £6,750 per annum, but this sum, for the year 1956-57, is offset by the retrenchment of a clerical post, non-recurring provision amounting to £1,000 which was made last year to purchase equipment for the Film Censor's Office and the fact that there will be only 52 weekly pay days in 1956-57 as compared with 53 in the year 1955-56.</P>
    <P>Last year, reference was made to the Adoption Act, 1952.  The administration of this Act is proceeding smoothly. During the year 1955, 787 adoption orders were made as compared with 888 in 1954.  At the end of 1955, there were 15 registered adoption societies. These societies placed 66 per cent. of the children in respect of whom adoption orders were made.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate, No. 30, is for £4,740,940 for the Garda Síochána.  It <Col N="657" /> shows an increase of £125,072 as compared with the Estimate for 1955-56. This increase is due to two main causes: (1) An increase in Garda pay with effect as from 1st November, 1955, and (2) Increases in rent allowances with effect as from 1st July, 1955.</P>
    <P>The increases in pay and allowances which total £211,452 are offset by a reduction of £87,985 in the provision for pensions and gratuities, etc. to members of the force and the dependents of deceased members.  The reduction in the provision for pension and gratuities is due to the fact that retirements in the year 1955-56 were much less than anticipated.  It was estimated that about 480 men would retire in that year and receive awards under the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders.  The actual number was only 233 and the wastage from all causes during the year totalled 313.  The decrease in the number of retirements from the force may be attributed to the raising, under the Garda Síochána (Retirement) Regulations, 1955, of the ordinary age of compulsory retirement for all ranks up to the rank of chief superintendent to 63 years.  Provision has been made for awards under the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders to 270 members of the force during the year 1956-57.  On 31st March last, 1,369 members of the force had 33 years' service or over and they are entitled, should they so wish, to retire and receive full pension awards.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Garda Síochána as set out in sub-head A of the Estimate is estimated at 6,970, which figure includes 150 recruits to be enrolled during the year.  The actual strength on 1st May, 1956, was 6,794, an increase of 114 as compared with 1st May, 1955.  The overall strength of the force has fallen by 716 during the past eight years.</P>
    <P>The Prisons Estimate, No. 31, at £185,740 is £3,720 less than last year. The daily average number of persons in custody has fallen over the past ten years from 683 to 396; the latter being the figure for 1955.  When introducing the Estimates last year, I stated I was considering whether it would be possible, in consequence of the steady fall in the number of persons in <Col N="658" /> custody, to close some of the prisons. As the number continued to decline in 1955 it was decided to close Cork and Sligo Prisons.  The daily average number in custody in the former had not exceeded 15 and in the latter eight over the past five years.  Cork Prison was closed on 31st March and Sligo Prison on 1st June.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 30 for the District Court is for £91,940 and shows an increase of £6,090.  This increase is due to (1) the award by the arbitration board of improved salary scales to District Court clerks as from 22nd October, 1955; and (2) the general revision of Civil Service pay as from 1st November, 1955.  The increased expenditure resulting from the foregoing has been offset by a saving of £1,500 in the provision for clerical assistance in provincial offices.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is need for me to say anything about Votes Nos. 33 to 37 for the Supreme and High Court offices, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Public Record Office and the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The Estimates for all these offices show increases which are due to the increase in remuneration awarded to all civil servants in November, 1955, to which I have previously referred.</P>
    <P>It has been customary for the Minister for Justice, when introducing his Estimates, to give a brief review of the volume of crime.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that the decrease in the number of indictable offences reported to the Garda Síochána in the year 1954 continued into 1955, although the decrease in the latter year was small.  The actual decrease was 133, the number of indictable offences being 11,784.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Division there was a decrease of 264 in the number of indictable offences but there was an increase of 131 over the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The decrease in indictable crime, although small, is a move in the right direction and I trust that it will continue. The number of indictable offences is, however, very much in excess <Col N="659" /> of the pre-war average of about 6,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>There was a slight increase in juvenile crime during the year 1955. The number of persons under 18 years of age known to have committed indictable offences was 2,654, an increase of 126 as compared with 1954.  The number charged in court was 2,146, being 89 more than the number for 1954.  It will be noted that 508 juveniles who committed offences were not charged in court.  They were children under 14 years of age who were cautioned by district officers instead of being prosecuted.</P>
    <P>There was a reduction of nearly 11,000 in the number of prosecutions for summary offences.  The number of these prosecutions in 1955 was 99,489 as compared with 110,286 in 1954, and 104,188 in 1938.  Deputies will note that prosecutions for summary offences have now fallen below the pre-war figure. Road traffic offences accounted for 52,979 of the prosecutions; offences under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts at 17,116 being the next highest, followed by 5,681 for unlicensed dogs; and 3,916 prosecutions under the School Attendance Acts.  Road traffic prosecutions at 52,979 show a decrease of 9,031 as compared with 1954.  This, as I suggested last year, is mainly due to the fact that there have been fewer prosecutions for trivial offences of a technical nature.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, these nine Estimates are all for essential services which vary little from year to year. This year's Estimates do not present any unusual features and I trust that the House will have no hesitation in approving of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is no unusual feature in this year's Estimates.  They do not vary very much from year to year, and his is not a Department in which very much can be done in the line of economies. I am, however, surprised that the Minister did not make some reference to the Courts of Justice Act passed in 1953, under which it is provided that both District Court and Circuit Court arrangements could be reorganised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I returned to office in 1951, the <Col N="660" /> Department had almost completed a survey of the court areas and the officials were satisfied that, as far as the District Courts were concerned, possibly seven district justices could be dispensed with, or five at least.  It seemed that in the Circuit Court, we could have at least one Circuit Court judge less; that the number remaining would be adequate.  The Act of 1953 also extended the jurisdiction and we decided to wait to see how that worked out and whether it would mean a greater volume of work in the District Courts which might alter the situation. If that were so, we had to consider whether it would mean a decrease in Circuit Court work.  Against that, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was also increased and it was possible that more work might come from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  In any case, that was three years ago and, while no immediate saving could be made then&mdash;it was only when the district justices retired or died that that could be done&mdash;I think we ought to be told now something about that provision in the 1953 Act, whether it has been scrapped altogether or whether any effort is being made to give effect to it.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us something about that before the debate ends.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand that a delay was necessary to find out what the actual position would be, having regard to the increase in jurisdiction, but I have been making inquiries from people who practise in the courts and they tell me that the position is very much the same and that there has not been much change.  It would seem, then, that the case of having fewer district justices and at least one Circuit Court judge less is as strong as ever it was.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not tell us what is going to be done about the Conroy Commission.  I am not advocating legislation, but I think people are entitled to know if anything of significance can be done or not.  I was given a very bad time when I was Minister because I did not do something about it, but my point was that the people whose interests were affected by this report had the right to get time to <Col N="661" /> study it and make representations to the Department and to the Minister. They have had plenty of time to do that now and I think the Minister said last year that it would come before the Government.  I am not too sure about that, and perhaps he would tell us whether or not anything has been done. I am glad to see that the Adoption Act is working out smoothly.</P>
    <P>Now we come to prison population, and we are all glad to find that the prison population is declining, but I often think&mdash;I suppose this happens especially when one comes across a case of which one has personal knowledge&mdash;that some people who escape should go to gaol.  Very near where I live, there was a case of burglary and the unfortunate people in that house, the woman especially, nearly died of fright.  The man concerned was arrested between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning and he was eventually merely cautioned.  I think housebreaking at night time is a far more serious offence than at other times and should be so regarded.  I am also told that a number of our old &ldquo;lags&rdquo; are having long &ldquo;stretches&rdquo; in England and indeed it would be no harm if all of that type emigrated.  I am told that is the case, but I do not know if it is true.  Anyway, it is good to see that, on the whole, there has been a decrease in crime, but it is too bad to find that it is still at almost twice the pre-war level.  I had thought that when the war was over we would have a return to normal, but unfortunately crime seems to be at a very high level still.</P>
    <P>Indictable crime seems to have gone down, but there is a serious form of crime now making its appearance here. It is a type of crime which has been foreign to this country up to recently. I am referring to this business of using knives, which seems to be on the increase.  I notice that in Dublin in the last two weeks two robberies were carried out by people carrying knives. I think no action could be too drastic to take in regard to people like that. We also have the new organisation called &ldquo;Teddy boys&rdquo; and I do not know whether they are the only ones who use those knives or not.  It is a new type of crime here and I am sure <Col N="662" /> the Guards will keep an eye on it.  It is certainly a very disturbing trend to find these rascals going into premises and actually threatening to kill people with knives.  That is something foreign to this country and something which is to be deplored.  Of course we cannot blame the Department or the police for that, but it does require very drastic treatment at the hands of the courts when such people are caught.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister, we had some very long debates on juvenile delinquency and I always held that juvenile delinquency was not a matter for the Department of Justice.  When juvenile delinquency went so far as to get into the hands of the police, it had gone very far indeed.  I held that the home was really the place where it should be checked.  If the parents did not do it, it was very hard to expect the police to do it.  I thoroughly approve of the new departure in regard to juveniles committing small offences. They are cautioned now by the district officers instead of being prosecuted and I think that is a very good thing.  If a senior police officer comes along and tells a young fellow off and gives him a good fright, I think it may have far more effect than if he is brought in with a lot of other young rascals, in which case he might become a hardened criminal.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very desirable departure in regard to juvenile delinquency. I hope the Minister will be able to say if he has done anything about the reorganisation of the courts or what the position is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter I mentioned in connection with another Vote but which, I think, is one which concerns the Minister's Department.  It is the matter of dealing with traffic on the roads.  Steps should be taken immediately to have patrols sent out on the roads to endeavour to make all road users, whether they be drivers of vehicles, cyclists or pedestrians, take more care.  Every morning we pick up a newspaper we read of people being killed.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the frightful blow it is and the great shadow that is cast on families, <Col N="663" /> when any member of the family is taken away by this type of sudden death.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland rightly said that the courts were taking a very light view of many offences in this country, and that they should not take such a light view.  In the case of burglaries and even robberies with violence, we find very light sentences are imposed.  I think it is about time the courts took a more serious view of that class of crime.  It is appalling to think that we have gangs growing up in this country, carrying such weapons as knives and the coshes made fashionable by the London gangsters in the past few years.  It is not just a matter of saying casually that this should be discouraged; it should be stamped out.</P>
      <P>Even though it is not a matter about which the Minister can do anything, I think it is a matter for some comment that, when detectives had to arrest two known and desperate gangsters in Dublin in the past eight or ten days, the solicitor employed by these gangsters said in taunting fashion that his clients had been arrested at the pistol point.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is, Sir.  It is over in England now.  It is connected with the &ldquo;Jack Spot&rdquo; case now.  There is a whole section of namby-pamby people in this country who would like our officers, Guards and detectives, to go up to these desperate men perhaps at the risk of their own lives.  I think that the officers were right, and that they should take every care of their own valuable lives in dealing with ruffians like these who come to this country.  I do not think they do anything wrong by arresting them at the pistol point, aye, or even at the bayonet point, when they are <Col N="664" /> dealing with creatures of this sort.  I find fault with the courts.  When the Guards bring such people before them, the courts should take cognisance of the kind of people concerned and of the kind of offences concerned.  If it is a case of robbery with violence, or if violence of any sort is shown to people, and especially to old people, by young men, severe sentences should be imposed.</P>
      <P>We have a very fine police force in this country.  The Department of Justice has recruited a whole new batch of police.  There was a bit of confusion last year about the number required.  I believe 250 were to be taken in.  An examination was held, an enormous number of young men sat for it and a very large number of them passed the examination but the 250 young men who were first home were selected.  I believe that that was right. However, many of the applicants thought that, because they had passed the examination, they should be accepted.  When there are 250 places and the Department are recruiting, I believe it should be made perfectly clear that it is the first 250 who pass the examination will be recruited.  I understand that with the 400 young men who sat for the examination the standard was very high.  Since we are recruiting such a fine type of man, I think there should be greater respect for the Guard's evidence when he brings a case to court.  I have noticed that in many courts all over the country the Guard's evidence is more or less discounted and not a lot is thought of it.  That is not fair to such very fine servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people will come in here and say the popular thing, but I do not care whether what I am going to say now is popular or not.  The Minister should take powers to deal with itinerants in the country at the present time.  I shall not start crying about the small farmer, but every farmer, small and large, every man who owns a bit of land in the vicinity of which these people are in the habit of camping, knows his place is laid waste and his fences are torn down. They cut the wire fence, roll it up, take it away to other areas and sell it. <Col N="665" /> They remove gates, they go in and graze the new grass, and in the harvest time they go in and steal from the fields.  This thing will have to be stopped.  Matters have come to a frightful stage in the city in which I live, as indicated by the fact that 64 horses were counted near one of these encampments.</P>
    <P>Statistics say, and results show, that in grazing, two horses are the equal of five bullocks.  That is a fair herd to be putting on the local farmer.  These horses stray into the new housing schemes in Waterford.  These schemes were beautifully landscaped.  High railings were not put up there because it was maintained they would shut out the light, and also because they do not look as well as low copings.  These beautifully landscaped housing schemes at Cork Road, Ferrybank and Ballytruckle have been laid waste by these people's horses.</P>
    <P>There was a time when these travelling men were supposed to be poor people.  I do not think they ever were. But now they are in the horse-meat trade and a whole lot of other trades, and there is hardly one of them who is not able to pull out £500 or £600 in ready money.  They are going around in their motor vans and station wagons now.  This nuisance is increasing.  I have read newspaper articles saying how wonderful these people are.  I would like to find out the gentlemen who wrote these newspaper articles because I would like to know what they would do if they had a lot of these itinerants camped around their homes.  In about a week or two they might change their tune.  These people are impudent and ill-mannered.  In outlying districts they go in and threaten the farmer's wife and daughter, if they happen to be alone when the men are working in the fields.</P>
    <P>In a very bad year I had to get in some barley.  I employed as many local people as I could get, but in the evening I went to the cross-roads. There I saw seven or eight able-bodied men of the itinerant class.  I offered twice the usual amount, a good dinner and a couple of bottles of stout but they were not interested.  These people <Col N="666" /> are useless.  They are no good to themselves or to anybody else.  I think the Minister should take power to protect the farming community from the damage they do.  People in the suburbs of our towns and cities also suffer from the ravages of these people who travel round the country.  Until they travel in an orderly fashion the Minister and Department should take powers to control them.  I do not want the country to be turned into a police State, but I think the courts, when these people are brought before them, particularly on charges of terrorising old people, should deal very severely with them.</P>
    <P>I should like also to draw the Minister's attention to the number of stray horses round the country.  They do considerable damage to farmers' places at night.  These horses appear to be straying but in actual fact they are put into farmers' property.  I think the Minister is aware of what hardpressed farmers in Galway did about this problem when the law failed to give them adequate protection.  The Minister should take power to ensure that these horses would be taken and impounded until sufficient fines were paid.  In fact I would go so far as to suggest that these horses should, in certain circumstances, be sold and exported to England, and the proceeds should go into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Not alone do the horses do considerable damage to farmers' property but they often ruin picturesque stretches of country roads.  There are two or three places outside Waterford which are now a disgrace because of these horses.  I hope the Minister will introduce legislation to deal with this matter in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the last speaker on what he has said about the knights of the road.  In Dublin county, particularly around the city limits, they do considerable damage every night.  Their horses break into newly laid gardens and cause considerable damage to the vegetables of people who have gone into new houses and who are trying to make new homes for their families.  I <Col N="667" /> have been in communication with the Dublin County Council and with the city manager in an endeavour to rid the area of this nuisance.  I went out to Ballyfermot the other evening and found that local councillors have been in touch with the city manager about the problem.  There does not, however, seem to be any law on the matter. These people and their horses are wrecking the homes of countless people in the newly built-up areas around the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I think we are too soft-hearted altogether in dealing with these people. It is the duty of the House and the Minister to see that the people we represent who are trying to make new homes for themselves are protected.  It is all right for soft-hearted people to talk and write sympathetic letters about the poor men of the roads but the unfortunate man who goes into his new home is being hurt very badly by them.  I should like the Minister to come and see the damage that the horses of these itinerants do night after night.  I have received letters from people in Walkinstown, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Santry and other such places who are continuously annoyed by wandering horses.  I hold that we should protect our people against them. If these itinerants cannot be put into homes or made to work, there should be some remedy for the people who suffer from their invasions.  I would particularly urge that the courts would be much more strict on these itinerants when they come before them on charges of having threatened old and infirm people.  Some of these old people are afraid to give information to the Guards in case the intinerant who threatened them might come round again and take revenge.  When such terrorism arises, drastic action is needed so that decent people will be protected in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that you have now, particularly in Dublin, a type of youth at large who has a new-fangled idea of banding himself with other youths of the same type.  They are known as Teddy boys.  I believe that the Guards do not like arresting these people, who are invading dance halls, in case the <Col N="668" /> charge of wrongful arrest might be made.  Lack of parental control is the whole cause of the trouble; parents let these boys out to make a disgrace of themselves.</P>
    <P>I hold that the Department should put 40 or 50 policemen into plain clothes to clean up the city and county of these brats and bring them under control.  There is no use in using plámás when dealing with these people.  It is a terrible thing that a decent boy and girl cannot go to a dance hall without having a knife or bottle pulled on them by people going around in gangs.  These youths are now going into the country because they have been banished from a lot of places in the city.  They have a special haircut and a kind of uniform.  The Minister for Justice should ask the Commissioner of the Guards to put some plain clothes men on the work of cleaning up these gangs.  Pampering and petting such individuals should not be tolerated.  I am not casting any reflection on the Gardaí.  They are doing their duty, but there are not enough of them to do what is necessary. These boys would be good citizens if the authorities dealt with them and prevented them from carrying knives and bottles and making a public nuisance of themselves.</P>
    <P>In regard to child delinquency, there are two types of child delinquent.  One is the ordinary criminal and the other is the child who commits an offence but who needs treatment rather than punishment.  I have often asked this House to consider having a psychiatrist in the court to diagnose the child's mental condition in order to find out whether he was an ordinary criminal or was suffering from a mental disease and therefore not responsible for the crime he committed.  If he is not responsible, he should be given treatment and if he is a criminal, there should be some other way of preventing him from repeating the offence. Unfortunately, we put the two types of delinquents into the same place, which is most undesirable.</P>
    <P>Again we come to the point that the parents are not fulfilling their duty in controlling their children.  We have <Col N="669" /> many Puritans writing to the papers about school teachers punishing children.  While I do not agree with undue punishment of children at school, they should be kept under control, as all of us were kept under control in our young days without any undue harshness.  Much of juvenile crime can be attributed to parents who fail to carry out this duty.  Where the unfortunate teacher discovers that a child is wayward and corrects him, the parents object.  The teacher is put on the spot immediately and they bring him to court.  There is an old philosophy, and it is true, that sometimes you must be reasonably harsh with some people to be kind to them. It is in the child's interest that he should be kept under control, until such time as he is able to distinguish between right and wrong and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>I was late for the first part of the Minister's speech, but I understand that superintendents in the Garda with I.R.A. service have got an extension to their period of service.  I think the same extension should be applied to sergeants.  I do not see why one officer should get it and another officer not get it and I would ask the Minister, if he has not already done so, to make provision for that concession.  I hope the Minister will consider the few points I have made.  I have a great deal of information and personal experience in relation to many of the matters I have raised.  We should be more firm in this House and provide protection for the people who need to be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question I should like to deal with is that of legal costs.  We have four courts in the country: the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court.  Many of the ordinary folk outside this House and many Deputies have no idea as to the amount of legal costs.  I presume the courts are there to be availed of by citizens of the State who feel they need to go before them on one question or another.  Whilst it is true that we have a reasonable idea of the costs, so far as the District Court is concerned, <Col N="670" /> that is not so in relation to the other courts.</P>
      <P>I have advised many people to keep as far away as they possibly can from court proceedings and suffer whatever grievance they have rather than go before the courts.  I have done so because I could give them no estimate as to the probable cost of whatever proceedings they had in mind.  It is peculiar that we have no scale of court costs.  If I or any other Deputy wants to come before the High Court in the morning in an action of one kind or another we do not know what we are in for.  If you inquire, some people will tell you it may cost you £1,000; others will tell you it will run into hundreds. These courts do not serve the purpose they were established for, as many of our people down the country cannot avail of them.  It is rather strange that if an action comes before the High Court in Dublin, it cannot proceed without having eight members of the legal profession involved.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the position or function of the Minister for Justice is in this matter, but it should be clarified. I asked a question in the House before about the scale of court costs, or whether any scale was laid down that a solicitor, barrister or senior counsel employed in the courts could charge, or whether they could charge any fees they wished&mdash;20 guineas, 100 guineas or 200 guineas.  That is one point that is not clear at all to people down the country, and were it not for personal injury claims where usually insurance companies pay the piper with fees from the big sums collected from motorists and others, the courts would be practically idle.  The opportune time for dealing with this question is the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  If the Minister has no function in the matter, he should say so, but, if that is the position, it is a rather peculiar one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had occasion to advise a number of people, where possibly there would be a Circuit Court action, to keep away from those places, that it was very bad business to have any recourse to the courts as they would not know what fee they would have to pay later on.  My primary purpose in <Col N="671" /> intervening on this Estimate is to get some information on that point, because the Constitution gives equal rights to all citizens and, if it should so happen that a man has a grievance against his neighbour or any other party, and it is his intention to bring it before one or other of the courts of justice, as he is entitled to do, it is unfair that this question of excessive costs should prevent him from doing so.  Everyone knows that those engaged in the courts, as in any other type of business, are entitled to fair and reasonable remuneration for their services; but we people in provincial centres believe that these costs are excessive, and, because of that belief, we do not avail of our rights and bring our grievances before the courts.</P>
    <P>In making these comments, I want to make it quite clear that I have nothing to say adverse to the courts of justice.  I believe they are fair and impartial, and doing good work.  The only issue is the prohibitive cost of availing of their services.</P>
    <P>Another item relative to these courts is the one I referred to here some few years ago&mdash;this system which was left to us and to which we have held on since the days of the British régime, of counsellors and judges wearing wigs and gowns.  I stated here on another occasion, and will say it again now, that many of our people not familiar with courts are definitely unnerved when they enter a court of justice for the first time, particularly the High Court, and look upon these people in wigs and gowns.  I do not see why our judges, barristers and senior counsel should wear them.</P>

      <P>We have been <Col N="672" /> governing our own country now for more than 30 years.  We should change the British system and adopt an Irish one.  In a country which is possibly the most important in the world, the United States of America, there is no such tomfoolery as wearing wigs and gowns.  That type of nonsense was never adopted there.  We could manage very well without that regalia in our courts.  I should like to make it quite clear that I do not want to comment adversely on the personnel. I have no fault to find with them individually or as a profession, but I am faulting the system.  Improvements in that system should be brought about by the State.</P>
      <P>The two improvements I advocate are: first of all, that the public should be made aware of what the legal costs are likely to be, and given full information on that question; and secondly, we should do away with the system under which our Irish judges, barristers and senior counsel have to dress themselves in wigs and gowns when they appear in court.  It is very undesirable that we should follow the British custom to such an extent, and we should cease to do so forthwith.</P>
      <P>It is pleasing to learn that the number of indictable offences is steadily decreasing.  That is a very bright outlook, save in the case of young offenders.  There has been a slight increase in juvenile crime.  We are all pleased to see the marked decrease in crime, and a good deal of thanks for that situation must be given, first of all, to the State, in that over the years, since we established our own Government, it has looked to the interests of the people.  There is no need now for a man to go out and steal.  Benefits are being provided for him, if he is not in a position to earn a livelihood and, if he has to incur expenditure because of sickness or hospital treatment, or for any other reason, benefits are also provided.  The position, therefore, is entirely different from what it was a number of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also thank the Garda Síochána for the present position. Having regard to the figures, I doubt <Col N="673" /> if there is need now to have the Garda force kept at its present strength.  Here in the City of Dublin, where there is much juvenile crime and so on, and where more than one-fifth of the population lives, it is necessary to have a substantial number of Guards, but the same position does not obtain in rural centres.  When this State was founded 30 years ago, we had come through a war with another country and a civil war.  There was a great deal of strife amongst people living in proximity to each other, and it was undoubtedly necessary to have a substantial number of police stations and of Guards.</P>
    <P>That is not necessary now because the position is completely different.  We have got over the effects of those wars and we have no political strife.  During a general election, or at any other election, people will vote for whatever Party they think fit, and agree that their neighbours are equally entitled to vote for the candidates they favour. There is, therefore, no trouble or strife. It is a grand thing to have that position, so different from what it was in the twenties and thirties.  As I say, there is no need now for a Garda station in almost every parish, with three, four or five Guards in each station.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that when he endeavoured to close stations in rural centres he got protests from a number of Deputies and from different people that, if the stations were closed, that would tend to an increase in crime in these districts.  I do not believe that position would arise considering we now have a mobile police force, centred in some of the big towns.  This mobile force will pay visits to these rural areas and that will impose a certain check on any individuals who may have criminal tendencies.  I can assure the Minister that in West Cork there are very few with criminal tendencies.  I take it the same can be said of the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The main work of the Gardaí in these country districts at the present time is watching local publicans.  Now, we have to uphold the law and the licensing regulations, but I think it is no great crime for people to have a <Col N="674" /> discussion on their week's work and plan for the week ahead after Mass on Sunday, and to have a few pints during the discussion.  That is the only opportunity vouchsafed to people living in country districts to forgather and discuss their problems.</P>
    <P>As well as having a police force living in the Garda station in these districts, two or three Gardaí come in periodically in motor cars.  Where is the need for going to the expense of having both a mobile force and a stationary force in these districts?  One or other should suffice.  If the Minister does not like the idea of closing these country stations, I suggest that a good case can be made for at least reducing the personnel.  Two members of the force should be adequate to meet the requirements of these districts in full. It may be argued that, if that suggestion is adopted and the force reduced, it will have an adverse effect on the employment position.  That should not enter into the picture at all because it is not the function of the State to provide non-productive employment.  It would be better to have men engaged in productive work.  I appeal to the Minister to take cognisance of these points.  In making them, let me say I have nothing but the highest regard for the members of the Garda Síochána.  The vast majority of them are conscientious and capable men and they do their work well.</P>
    <P>The Minister's advice to new recruits made pleasant reading.  I was particularly impressed with one piece of advice, namely the advice not to bring people into court for trivial offences. When people break the law by committing a minor offence they should get a warning before they are brought before the local court, which would involve having their names in the local Press and so on.  All these minor offences should be dealt with by means of a warning in the first instance; if that does not have the desired effect, then the culprit can be brought before the local court.  I think the Minister's advice in that regard is being carried out now.  Certainly we are not receiving the same number of complaints from people brought to court for the most trivial offences.</P>
    <P>I do not want to strike an unpleasant <Col N="675" /> note but I must bring one matter to the attention of the Minister.  Allegations are made, whether rightly or wrongly, that in certain districts a particular member of the force discriminates as between one party and another.  That usually arises in the case of publicans.  One publican will complain that he is carefully watched whilst no notice is taken at all of another publican.  I am glad to state that complaints of this nature are very few in West Cork.  In the whole of that area such complaints have arisen on only two occasions to my knowledge. My argument is that they should not arise at all.  If an officer discriminates as between one party and another he should pay the full penalty if he is found guilty of such discrimination.  It is the duty of the State to ensure that the law is impartially administered and there should be neither favouritism nor discrimination.</P>
    <P>To some extent the Minister is handicapped in dealing with these matters because the Garda Síochána is more or less a State-sponsored body now.  The Minister has no direct control. I believe he should have direct control.  I think the 1926 Act was not a wise piece of legislation.  I understood that if a Deputy received a written statement from a person making an allegation against the force there was an obligation on the commissioner to investigate that complaint. Indeed, I understood that an individual could complain direct in writing and that complaint had to be investigated.  I hope the Minister will impress on the commissioner the desirability of having the law impartially administered, thereby obviating complaints, which crop up in isolated instances, of favouritism and discrimination.</P>
    <P>The only other matter which I should like to mention for the Minister's attention is that the practice seems to be growing among children in this country to play in the streets, particularly in important busy streets in towns.  Passing through many towns in this country week after week, I feel the Gardaí are lacking in their duty in that respect.  These children put <Col N="676" /> motorists and other people at a great disadvantage by reason of the fact that they have to exercise supreme caution when passing through some towns.  The Minister should suggest to the Commissioner of the Garda that where this practice is prevalent&mdash;and it is prevalent in many towns that I know of&mdash;the Gardaí should issue a warning to these children to keep at least in the side streets, or to get some other place in which to play.  It is a fairly big problem and it imposes a certain amount of hardship on motorists and other people.</P>
    <P>I want to express my appreciation of the manner in which the Minister has discharged his duties.  He took certain steps when he came into office. For instance, he refused to consider removing the penalties on people convicted of drunken driving who were disqualified for a time from holding a driver's licence.  When Deputy Boland was Minister for Justice, some people who were convicted by the courts of such offences were able to have these penalties removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question of mine, the Minister stated that Deputy Boland removed these penalties in almost 200 cases, while he was Minister for Justice.  Of course, Deputy Boland was exercising powers vested in him and I am not finding fault with him for that.  I take it for granted that Deputy Boland looked into the circumstances of these cases. Nevertheless, if you and I are before a court on a particular day and if both of us are disqualified from driving for 12 months, and then, if the general public see you driving around in a few weeks' time, while I have to stay put for 12 months the likelihood is they will say the law is not administered impartially.  I am not finding fault with Deputy Boland for removing these disqualifications: it was the law of the land.  I feel sure he dealt with each of these cases on its merits, in accordance with the individual circumstances that arose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I should like to express my agreement with Deputy Lynch and other Deputies who said that strong action is called for to deal with the itinerants' menace.  It has now reached a stage when it can be described as a national menace, as we have 6,000 of them on our country roads.  Every year in my area, we have quite a large influx of holiday-makers, but unfortunately we also have an influx of undesirables, of beggars, and they give our visitors a very bad impression.  I hold that extra Gardaí should be drafted into areas to deal with this question alone.</P>
      <P>These beggars operate under the guise of selling small religious objects, but that is only for the purpose of covering up.  It gives a bad impression to foreign visitors and it is harmful to our religious outlook.  Then, if people are not prepared to come across and grease their paws, they will be abused in filthy language&mdash;language which, probably, the English do know.  In my area, almost every boreen at the present moment is choked with tinkers' caravans, so that the public cannot use them and have to make detours.  I feel that this is a matter on which the Gardaí should take action.</P>

I do not think the Minister for Local Government would have powers to deal with these gentlemen such as the Minister for Justice has at his hands.  I should like this question of begging to be dealt with rather severely and I am expressing the view of many people in my area when I say so.</P>
      <P>Another matter which requires attention is the use of airguns by boys.  They are a great danger to the public and it should not be tolerated.  You will see daggers for sale in shop windows. I do not know why they were made because they serve no useful purpose. They are only helping to make &ldquo;Teddy boys&rdquo; out of a lot of our youth in the near future.  It should not be allowed and the parents who purchase them have a lot to account for.</P>
      <P>A ridiculous situation arose some time ago as a result of a lorry crash. We had quite a traffic jam for a considerable length of time, despite the fact that a Garda station was situated only a very short distance from the scene of the crash.  The Gardaí at that station could not take action and had to await the arrival of Gardaí from the actual area station.  On such an occasion, I think power should be given so that action can be taken by the nearest Gardaí in the area, thereby avoiding the holding up of traffic for an undue length of time.</P>
      <P>I trust that the beggar and itinerant nuisance will receive strong action on the part of the Minister.</P>

    <P>I want to take Deputy Murphy to task for his statement that there was a kind of partiality by the Guards in <Col N="679" /> administering the licensing laws. Deputy Murphy should look before he leaps.  The Guards have a most difficult task in administering these laws. A mother or father, sisters or wives write confidential letters to the commissioner about the conduct of a certain public house which is being kept open until maybe 2 o'clock in the morning.  Side by side with that public house, there may be others doing the same thing, but doing it in a less open fashion.  They are not so much before the public eye and there may be fewer people going into them, or perhaps the people going into them may have bigger purses and the effect on the home may be less.  The Guards must act on such information conveyed to them.  If there are raids, they are carried out in the interests of those who write to the Guards.</P>
    <P>The whole solution of the problem of after-hour trading is a question of closing half the public houses.  That does not need legislation; it is embodied in the statutes of this House. Governments have examined it from time to time and found it expensive, but in the national interest it would do a great deal of good if they put the Act&mdash;I do not know whether it is the Act of 1925 or of 1926&mdash;into force.  The Minister should also take cognisance of the fact that where it was put into force, it resulted in the position that arose in Mullingar.  Somebody there bought a ten-roomed house and got an hotel licence for it, and the good that had been achieved by the closing down of two or three public houses was undone. The other people who had to go into competition with the new venture had to induce the youth, and other people, into their premises after hours in order to make a living and pay their licence and rates.  We have too many public houses all over the country and everybody should be able to get a living without keeping open after hours.  If Deputy Murphy examines the question again, he will find that the Guards are not being partial to anybody.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the fact that the <Col N="680" /> previous Minister exercised certain rights which he had under the Act in regard to shortening the length of time for which the courts took a driver's licence from him, and he enumerated the number involved&mdash;a couple of hundred.  Deputy Boland intervened and said he never wanted that right. Whether he exercised that right in 200 cases or whether the present Minister exercised it in two, I think it is wrong. It should be taken out of the Minister's hands altogether.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the closing down of Garda stations and there appears to be unanimous opinion about the matter.  It is a matter with which I am in complete agreement.  The Minister might inform us, when winding up this debate, what has been the success of the one-Guard station equipped with telephone, such as in Clonmellon.  I think it has been a success.  I know that when an effort is made to close a Garda station in any town, the people who get money from the Guards, such as shopkeepers, are all brought together, and there is a furore.  The endeavour to economise is frustrated in many cases and the idea is to leave us with as many Guards as we had R.I.C.  The R.I.C. were as much a military force as a police force.</P>
    <P>I think it was an awful mistake to do away with the L.S.F.  The L.D.F. was kept on under its new name An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil, and the L.S.F. was disbanded.  We all know that during the war these elderly men in the L.S.F. gave great assistance to the Guards in helping on the day of a procession, or a meeting, or other gathering to regulate the traffic.  It should not be beyond our powers to reorganise that force or to get the F.C.A. to act in that capacity.  The L.S.F. got very little remuneration for the work which they did&mdash;they did not look for it&mdash;but they worked day and night.</P>
    <P>The F.C.A. is a well-bolstered up force and they have every amenity possible for a voluntary force.  They are not like the original L.D.F. who had to rough it.  They have cars at their disposal, area officers, amenities in regard to their uniforms and other amenities.  I do not begrudge them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No; but I am going to suggest that they should do the work which the L.S.F. did.  They could help the Guards and everybody else in fostering the civic spirit which is gradually growing among our people. It would help to do away with the inheritance from the R.I.C. of regarding policemen as enemies of the people. We want to bring that about as quickly as we can.</P>
      <P>Certain Deputies have dealt with the problem of itinerants and it is really a problem.  Nobody has under-emphasised the matter.  One Bishop in the West of Ireland recently dealt with the matter and said it was a problem which had to be tackled. Itinerants were more or less banished out of the Six Counties and they all came in here.  We must have some humanity in our approach to the question. To give them their due, some of these men worked on the drainage of the Brosna; some have settled down in the Kilbeggan area.  We settled one family in the Mullingar area.  The question requires a national approach, for these men are not used to continuous work.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies said that itinerants are no longer a down and out class, that they have motor cars and motor vans.  We do not begrudge them these things.  In many cases, they have a number of horses the value of which would exceed the stock on a fair-sized farm.  A neighbour of mine had his gate broken down and his meadows destroyed by some of these people and in another case posts were pulled up and broken.  They intimidate the people into giving them food.  In one case a youngster got bread and butter in a house and flung it into a drain ten yards away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has been referred to generally and I have given specific instances.  If one travels 20 miles in any midland county one meets groups of these people.  They are not like the old beggarman, the bacách, who went about and got a few pence at a house and a bit of bread.  Now there are able-bodied men and women going about and the drag that they represent <Col N="682" /> on the community is too much.  The number has increased recently as a result of the action taken by the authorities in the Six Counties.  They have been unloaded on to us.  A commission is needed that would examine the whole problem and find a solution. These people are a menace and a danger to the smallholder and the farming community in general.</P>
    <P>I note that the retiring age for Gardaí is extended.  I hope there will be no more extensions or any more softness about that matter.  A Guard must be very active and efficient. There are reasonable pensions provided for members of the force and they are generally favoured when they retire.  In the filling of responsible positions, as for instance, keeper of a racecourse, the Guard gets preference. There is the problem of emigration and the more jobs we can find for young men the better.  By extending the retiring age limit for Guards and particularly for Garda officers you restrict the number of outlets for young men and block promotions in the force.</P>
    <P>We are very rigorous about certain things, such as continuing in employment Old I.R.A. men in non-pensionable jobs.  An Old I.R.A. man may be an usher or he may not have the status of usher; he may be a cleaner in the Department and it is a difficult matter to get an extension for him for one year when he reaches a certain age.  I would retain him as long as he was able to walk.  We are so rigorous on that point that we should not go any further in the matter of extending the retiring age limit for Gardaí.</P>
    <P>As I said in Irish, I am glad to see retrenchment in the Department and I hope that there will be further retrenchment.  I do not know whether to compliment the Minister or the heads of the Department or both but it is very desirable that this Department and other State Departments should economise even to the point of mechanisation that would reduce the number of staff required.  With a population that is dwindling at the rate of 40,000 a year we cannot afford elaborate expenditure on a very large Civil Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> It is good to know that the prison population is decreasing and that the Minister was able to close Cork prison and Sligo prison during the year.</P>

      <P>The Department of Justice has been running smoothly for a long number of years and we must congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he has carried out his work as head of the Department.  I should also like to congratulate the former Minister for Justice.  This country has been blessed in that we have had two very level-headed men as Minister for Justice in the last few years who served the country well and for which the country may be very thankful.  This is perhaps as peaceful a country as there is in the world.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention one point in regard to economy.  I believe in economy.  It is only right that the Department should economise but in County Meath there is an economy to be carried out of which I could not approve.  It is in connection with the superintendent's office in Trim.  The superintendent is retiring in the course of a week or two and it is rumoured that the station will be closed down and that the area will be superintended from Kells, Navan or Drogheda.  That would be an injustice to the county town of Trim.  The Circuit Court and the District Court sit in Trim.  I cannot understand why that economy should be carried out there.  I would ask the Minister to see that that economy will not be carried out.  Let it be carried out in some other town but do not take from the county town of Trim the little prestige that it has.</P>
      <P>The county council have transferred offices from Trim to Navan and I do not want to see the Department of Justice doing likewise.  I would ask the Minister to see that the superintendent's office is not closed down.  If it is closed down, it will be a very serious matter and the people will resent it very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the last few years we have witnessed the departure of the old Gardaí and the coming in of new men.  I must compliment the <Col N="684" /> Minister and the Department on the splendid type of young men who are coming into the force.  They are a credit to the country.  I hope they will start on the right lines and will be policemen in every sense of the word and that there will be plenty of work for them.  There is nothing as bad as to see policemen standing around street corners with nothing to do.  There could be a paring down of the police force.  We do not want as many Gardaí as we did ten or 20 years ago.  It is quite sufficient to have three men in any station and they would have plenty to do.</P>
    <P>We must congratulate the old police force on the manner in which they carried on in very difficult times over a long number of years and brought peace to the country at great personal sacrifice.  We wish them well in their retirement and long life and happiness. They laid the foundation of peace in this country and deserve every credit from the nation.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the itinerant menace.  It is a menace that is growing year after year and the Minister and his Department must do something about it.  I am not referring to the type of beggarmen who travel the roads or the mentally-afflicted people.  They are God's children and they have always been with us and always will be.  There is a new class of itinerant growing up now, a gipsy-tinker class, with motor cars and hordes of goats, mules and jennets blocking the roads.  Many of them have come from the North in recent years.  I would ask the Department to do something about them.  They are a menace to the farmers and to the housewives.  I know that we cannot drive them off the roads&mdash;they must live somewhere&mdash;but there should be some consultation between the Department of Justice and the Department of Local Government as to the possibility of building houses for some of these people and getting them to settle down.  The Church also has a duty in this matter.  Many of these people are savages who do not believe in God or man, who cannot read or write. That should not be tolerated in a <Col N="685" /> should stop this menace before it reaches alarming proportions.</P>
    <P>It is only a few months ago since there was a violent scene at Trim Court where some people were brought up for knife-stabbing.  When the court was in session and hundreds of people sitting around and the judge was on his bench these people got into a complete brawl with knives and inflicted severe wounds on one another. That was one of the ugliest scenes that ever took place.  It happened because of the squalor in which these people live, the amount of drink they consume and the bitterness and hatred which they have for one another.  It was a horrible thing and should never have been allowed to happen.  It was real gang warfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister should do something about it and break up these gangs. When these people are only in small gangs they can easily be controlled but when they are in large gangs they are a complete menace.  You will find their mules, jennets and old horses lying across the road and walking along the roads.  They will not give way and it is the driver of a car who must almost get up on the ditch in order to get by.  If you meet these people on a lonely road at night the men and women will jeer and sneer at you and the children will throw stones at the people passing by. This kind of thing has been going on far too long without anything being done about it.  It is time now to lay a foundation and get these people off the roads, and get them permanently settled down in houses in the towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke was quite right in what he said about the Teddy boys. That is another threatened menace. There is not a large town throughout the country where you have not got 20 or 30 of them with their clipped hair, pants made in a certain style, going around among the people with their lady friends in slacks, and causing a great deal of trouble.  They are nothing but a pack of brats but where they can get away with it they can become as much a menace as the itinerants. They are a menace to the people and, if the forces of the law do not do it, the people will take matters into their <Col N="686" /> own hands and deal with them themselves. There is no use in allowing the people to be intimidated.  You find separate groups of these fellows going around who never did a day's work in their lives and never have a bob in their pockets but if they can intimidate people they will do so.  It is time that an end was put to this menace.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Department is being well run and I congratulate the present and the past Minister for keeping level heads and doing their work so well.  They have used great judgment in dealing with certain matters and it is something to be proud of that the two men who have last occupied this position have used good, broad judgment.  I congratulate the present Minister on the stand he has taken against drunken driving. The nation is behind him in that and I hope he will keep to that stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the information which we were given here to-day with regard to the economies that have been made during the past year gives us hope that some retrenchment in public expenditure is being effected. Unfortunately, while we can see from the figures the Minister has given us with regard to the closing of prisons, reductions in the cost of clerical staffs and the closing down of outlying stations there has been some improvement, the unfortunate position still is that the overall figures show an increase. That is the feature of the Minister's statement on the financial provisions for his Department that we do not like.  We can congratulate him on some of the good things he has done in the interests of economy but we must express our anxiety that the overall figures of expenditure are keeping in line with the other public services in the country to-day.  The figures are increasing year after year and this increase, if allowed to continue, in common with all other branches of the public service, surely must bring about our economic downfall and probably our downfall as an independent State also.  That is the disturbing feature about it, even though we can congratulate the Minister and the Department on what they <Col N="687" /> have done to try and bring down some of the expenditure.</P>
      <P>There are a few other little things that they might have tried to tone down.  Deputy Boland has already mentioned the question of the reorganisation of court areas and the possibility of reducing the number of serving personnel in our courts.  I think the Minister would have power to do this under the Act passed through the House some years ago, the Courts of Justice Act.  I am sure the Minister is aware of what I am talking about and I feel that, where he has that power, that reorganisation should take place.  Despite the fact that the powers of District Courts were widened to embrace a wider field of offences or crimes, I believe that the volume of business they have to do is less than it was.</P>
      <P>That would lend great strength to the argument that a reorganisation of the court areas should be considered with a view to reducing the number of District Justices as they become redundant or come up for retirement.  I do not mean that he should pay off a number of them summarily.  The Minister has a certain power and he should avail of it.  Possibly it may not mean very much but, added to the things he has been doing, it would help to reduce the increase that we see here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item which would come within the heading of economies has to deal with the Garda.  I understand that in the Garda Síochána the procedure is that, for various reasons, some of them no doubt very good reasons, Gardaí and sergeants are transferred from district to district.  I believe one of the reasons is that, being human, and if they are left a long time in a district, they may become too familiar with the people with whom they have to deal.  Being very human, they may not, as a result, be impartial in their duties.  These transfers cost quite an amount to the State.  I understand that where a transfer is made in the ordinary way all the costs are borne by the Department, including the carriage of <Col N="688" /> furniture where the member transferred is married.  It is only where the person concerned seeks the transfer himself that no question is raised as to his paying the cost himself.  I understand that even in that case there is a likelihood that he will get some of that cost paid for him.</P>
    <P>I have a suggestion to make which would, I think, reduce costs and have a much wider effect in regard to the danger of there being any question of showing favour as a result of long residence in particular station.  My suggestion is that instead of moving the ranks around it is the officers or superintendents who should be moved and moved more frequently.  These people are made of the same stuff as all of us and they are likely to make their contacts.</P>
    <P>You may find that they cannot help showing some discrimination possibly in the bringing forward of cases.  I do not blame them.  Any of us would be likely to do the same thing.  If they were moved around, the Gardaí under the new man, would have to toe the line.  The question of partiality or impartiality would not really arise in many of those cases.  Instead of changing a couple of thousand ranks, the change of 20 or 30 of the officers or superintendents would cover just as big an area and it would cost infinitely less to move these people from one place to another.  That is something, apart from the economics of the matter which I have already raised, I would commend to the Minister for his consideration. I believe it would be a better thing to change the officers and leave the men where they are in most cases if they are satisfied.</P>
    <P>Might I disagree with what I heard some Deputy say earlier in the discussion when he maintained that something should be done by the Minister to bring about a change where he complained that the evidence of the Guards is very often discounted in the courts?  Not only do I want to disagree with him but I want to take the absolutely opposite view.  All too frequently the evidence of the Guards in the course of their duties in regard to prosecutions is taken <i>in toto</i> and to the exclusion of the chances of the <Col N="689" /> persons prosecuted who also have a word and whose version of a story could be just as true.</P>
    <P>I am not at all suggesting that the Gardaí will perjure themselves in order to get convictions but, as everybody knows, there are always two sides to every story.  My complaint is not that the evidence of the Gardaí is discounted in the courts but that their evidence is taken into account far too strictly in very many cases and it is in the reverse direction I would suggest the Minister should bend his mind.</P>
    <P>There is another matter upon which I should like some information from the Minister in his closing statement. It concerns the mobile patrols on our roads and particularly the newly constituted force of traffic cops as we might call them.  How have these people and this new section got along?  What good or bad effect has it had?  A year or so ago I used to see much more of them than I see nowadays. Are there fewer in operation or have any more been added to them? Have they been sent further afield or what are they doing?  They were more in evidence on the roads leading in and out of Dublin some time ago than they are now.</P>
    <P>I believe that many more of them would do a very good day's work not only in and around Dublin but in and around many of our other big centres of population.  That is possibly a viewpoint of my own without anything to support it.  Possibly the Minister has got some evidence to show that might be so but, on the other hand, he may have evidence that they are not a success. They could be made a success and the way to secure that is to have more of them, particularly relating to traffic offences which are very much in evidence these days.</P>
    <P>I believe that these Gardaí mounted on motor bikes are the only people who are in any position whatever to deal with traffic problems and offences that are daily, hourly and every minute being committed in ever so many places all over the roads of this country.  More of them should be brought into commission.  They are the people who go out the roads leading <Col N="690" /> from our cities and towns and see in evidence, what they will not have an opportunity of seeing elsewhere, the careering of people in cars, not necessarily because they are speeding but because of the recklessly negligent manner in which they drive.</P>
    <P>As one who has to come a long distance along these roads, the greatest danger I see is not on the blind corners, the bends or the bad roads but on the absolutely straight stretches where you can see for a mile.  Those are the places where you find a car coming towards you and quite suddenly, when it is only 100 yards away, you hardly know there is a driver in it until you blow the horn.  Then you find there is a driver in it but it may be too late.  The most dangerous places in my opinion are the straight broad roads where people speed along at 60, 70 and 80 miles an hour. Apparently they do not mind where they are going.  Because the road is wide and straight and because there are no bends to negotiate, the driver may become bedded down in his seat and be inclined not to be too wide awake.  The one section of the Gardaí that can keep them awake are the Gardaí on motor cycles&mdash;the traffic cops as we call them.  Not only would they observe those drivers but they would help in waking them up before they put somebody else permanently to sleep.</P>
    <P>There is also another little item which I feel comes only partly within the ambit of this Department but the part that comes within it is the part I am interested in.  It is in relation to the dance-halls in the country and, I suppose, in the city for that matter but that does not arise.  What I have in mind is that we had a Dance Halls (Licensing) Act introduced here in the 1930's.  That Act, without any question, was very much needed.  However, since then and as a result of it, we have had the ramshackle buildings of the old days, the barns and sheds utilised for dances and amusement replaced by properly constructed halls with the different amenities required.</P>
    <P>To-day in our District Courts we have all sorts of people coming in and <Col N="691" /> getting a temporary licence for all sorts of ramshackle buildings, buildings on which there is no licence duty payable and which have no amenities of any kind.  In many places it is questionable whether they are even structurally sound.  This is going on to an increasing degree in my own county. I feel that not only is it unfair to the owners of properly licensed and equipped halls but it is also a throwback to the years prior to the introduction of the Dance Halls (Licensing) Act, when special regulations were laid down to ensure that the health of the young people would not be endangered.  Insanitary buildings, overcrowding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would that not be a matter for the Minister for Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Chair stated is quite right or part of it is.  But the provisions of the Dance Halls Act which would be appropriate to the Department of Local Government do not apply at all in the case of temporary licences granted by the District Justice for a few months of the summer or during some particular period in a district.  No provisions at all, apparently, apply to those people.  The Gardaí are asked if they object and if they do not object, and no member of the public comes along to object, these licences are granted.  We then have a position which is unfair to the present dance-hall owners and proprietors and we also have a renewal of the dangers of the early 1930's in regard to insanitary and unsafe buildings being used.  I ask the Minister, so far as it concerns his Department, to go into this matter and also to take it up with his colleague in the Department of Local Government, with a view to having something done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have a reduction in the number of summary cases concerning traffic offences, the smaller offences, we still have not gained a proper grip on the more serious offences that are being committed in regard to traffic laws.  That applies not only to what I spoke about earlier&mdash;the main roads serving our cities and towns&mdash;but also <Col N="692" /> to the general application of the laws to motorists and those using the roads generally.  Too many cases of a trivial nature are still being checked up by the Gardaí in certain districts.  While that is going on, and while so much time is being wasted on trivial matters, other things are going on involving offences of a much more serious type on the roads, and of which we hear nothing whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister and everybody in the House must be pretty well aware of all the abuses and recklessness associated with the use of the roads, to the detriment of the more careful users who are frequently involved in great loss as a result of these abuses.  I feel that a renewed and even more vigorous attempt should be made by the Gardaí to deal first and foremost with the drunken driver.  A fair amount is being done, but it is not sufficient, and the penalties imposed on these people when they are brought to book are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>That bring me to the second point, that is, the lack of uniformity in the penalties imposed.  Again, I suppose, it is a matter which is open to some difference of opinion as between one man and another.  Consequently, we have no uniformity in the penalties as between one district and another for these various offences.  One district justice may be lenient in one direction and regard a traffic offence as a small thing within his area of jurisdiction, while a few miles away, in another District Court, you may find the district justice who takes a really severe view of the same offence.  Naturally the man with the serious view will treat the offender more severely than the justice with the lenient view.</P>
    <P>There should be no question whatever about it; no matter what court is concerned, if a driver is convicted of drunkenness, he should &ldquo;get the hammer, good and proper&rdquo;.  There is only one &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; to give people who drive vehicles in that fashion, and first, last and all the time, their licences should be suspended, no matter what other action may be taken. The suspension of a licence for anybody using the roads to-day is the <Col N="693" /> greatest deterrent of all and I know Christian country.  Church and State nothing more likely to lead to better driving and to less driving while drunk.</P>
    <P>There are other types of offences in regard to traffic laws and again if efforts are being made in one district to stamp out such offences, these efforts will not have full effect if in other districts there is no similar effort. While the Gardaí in one area may have some direction from the Minister or the commissioner, or from some public pronouncement of the Government, and may be endeavouring to give effect to that in regard to a particular type of offence, whether driving or otherwise, it is frequently found that in one case the district justice will help by applying the severe penalties, while another district justice or judge will not be severe.</P>
    <P>The result will be that the Gardaí who have gone to the bother of bringing the cases to the notice of the court and who have secured a reasonable penalty with the conviction will be satisfied, while Gardaí in another district who have taken the same trouble and have secured the conviction without a penalty are not satisfied.  The Gardaí who got the conviction but no penalty will not take the same trouble again and the value of a direction of the commissioner or the Minister is therefore lost.  Various instances of that sort of thing can be quoted.  It all boils down to the fact that in regard to these offences on the roads it should be brought to the notice of the courts and the Gardaí, especially where dangerous, reckless, or drunken driving is concerned, that these types of offences should be dealt with uniformly and severely.  Unless we do that, we are only doing half the job that all of us would like to see done.</P>
    <P>There is another item I wish to mention in regard to the Gardaí.  It is but a small thing and it has already been mentioned here.  I should like to ask the Minister to give consideration in future to the matter of the Garda examinations.  I am not referring to the type of examination, how easy or hard it may be, because I am not interested in that.  What I have a grievance about, and what I feel quite <Col N="694" /> a number of young lads have a grievance about is that, having done the examination, they are duly notified that they have passed, and then, months later, they are still waiting at home, not looking for another job, feeling that they are going to be called up because they have passed the examination.  Suddenly, they wake up one day to be informed that they were number so-and-so and that only so many can be taken in at a time.  If they still wish to enter the Garda force, they will have to wait for the next examination.</P>
    <P>That would not be so bad except in the case where the candidate concerned has almost reached the upper age limit, and when that happens, he cannot sit for the next examination and has no hope of getting into the Gardaí in the future.  I think there could be some improvement in the arrangements in regard to these examinations.</P>
    <P>It is most disappointing for a young man, having done the examination, having been notified that he has passed it, and having great expectations that he is going to get into the force and do the job which he has chosen for himself, to find after all that, because of something he could not foresee, he cannot succeed in his ambition.  God knows what the consequences of that disappointment to lads of this type may be.  That should not happen and something should be done to ensure that it does not happen.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I wish to raise, that is, the manner in which the licensing laws are being administered at the moment.  We feel that we may entertain great hopes that in the near future the commission that is about to go into these matters will remedy all the outstanding grievances, and, by so doing, make it possible for the Gardaí to enforce the licensing laws and have them actually carried out.  At present, there is absolute chaos in rural Ireland in regard to the licensing laws.  It is only necessary to say, I think, that the laws are not observed or, to use a hackneyed expression, they are more observed in the breach than otherwise.  While that may be true in regard to one little town, there is no <Col N="695" /> uniformity in regard to the breaking of the laws.  In one small town the sergeant is tough.  He will see that every publican is closed on time.  But in another town the sergeant does not bother and the publicans are open all night.  The result is, of course, that the town in which the sergeant takes the lenient view attracts all the business from the surrounding towns and there is no business for the publicans in the towns where the Guards close them up at the proper time.</P>
    <P>You cannot blame the publicans nor can you blame the people in the country, because the laws at the moment in rural Ireland are unfair and unjust in regard to this matter of opening hours.  Until something is done to remedy that situation, I feel the Minister should try and have some uniformity in the application of these laws.  I do not think the Minister wants the Guards to be too strict, and I do not think they should be too strict, but we should not have the position of one public house being open half the night and the other closed on the dot.  That is not fair.</P>
    <P>All in all, in regard to this Estimate, I feel that, while admirable moves have been made to bring about some economies, further economies could be effected.  The upward trend we see may in some further way be arrested but, taking the broad view, the trend is upward and that, in conjunction with the cost of other services, means that our people will be further taxed during the coming year.  That is the one thing that none of us, no matter on what side of the house he is, will approve of.  No matter what we may find good in the Estimate or the Minister's statement, it ultimately comes back to the fact that the cost is increasing and that our people are unable to bear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is essential, first of all, that we should direct our attention to the extraordinary situation, so noticeable in Dublin and Cork, in regard to juvenile delinquency. While we may complain, perhaps rightly, of the conduct of certain groups of people of adult age, I think <Col N="696" /> it is most deplorable that the youngsters, who are running wild in our cities at present, are to be the men and women of the future.  It is for that reason that this matter must be tackled in a very serious manner.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister, the Minister's Department and the judiciary, have always considered it wise to refrain from having the names of these children published in the papers because they think that that might constitute a blot against them in the future.  I am wondering if that procedure is giving us the right result. I am not blaming the children so much at all; I am blaming their parents.  Are we right to shelter these parents, who seem to be in no way ashamed themselves that their children are being brought into court here in Dublin day after day for serious offences?  While it can easily be understood that, because of the age of the children&mdash;there is a certain amount of wildness peculiar to little boys in particular&mdash; they may not understand the seriousness of what they are doing, I consider that in some way or other it must be brought home to their parents that what is essential is a true sense of parental control.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on us in this country that we have to admit it takes the full weight of the law to try and keep a large number of little boys within the law.  Therefore, I would seriously suggest to the Minister to consider the aspect I mentioned.  I believe we are sheltering neglectful and careless parents, who are in no way ashamed of what is happening simply because they know that the names of their children will not be published in the papers.  I believe it may be of assistance to us if we publish, not the name of the child, but the fact that he is son or she is daughter of So-and-so, and mention the names of the parents.  Perhaps the Minister would consider something on that line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney mentioned the question of the commission in relation to our drinking laws.  I should also like to mention our anxiety lest there should be any delay in dealing, through the commission, with the question of leaseholders.  That problem has been <Col N="697" /> going on for years and, unfortunately, ground landlords have robbed thousands of people here.  I know the Minister is most sympathetic towards this problem.  I believe too many years have elapsed, too many words have been spoken, inside this House and outside of it, and not enough action has been taken.  Let us be quite frank.  Sections of every type of the community, whether they be absentee landlords or the fellows at home, are concerned in this, and it is about time that their wings were clipped in relation to the present system under which tenants of a house, who have a lease of a small plot of land, are being fleeced.  The sooner we can remedy that the better, and I would ask the Minister to do all he possibly can in urging the people dealing with this to try and give us a report as soon as possible.  I would also be anxious for a report in regard to the item mentioned by Deputy Blaney, but I believe that the report in connection with leaseholders is the more important.</P>
    <P>There is another item which must be seriously considered.  Perhaps it concerns rural areas more than Dublin or Cork.  It is the question of the common practice now of allowing licensed bars in every dance-hall.  Indeed, I am not speaking as a person who abhors drink or the people who take drink, but I cannot understand why it is we have come to the stage when people will leave the cities of Dublin or Cork, not for a night's dancing but because of the fact that they can go into the bars attached to certain dance-halls.  Perhaps the Minister might deal with this matter during the next 12 months? Undoubtedly, it is closely connected with the shocking state of affairs in relation to accidents on roads caused by drunken drivers coming from these places.</P>
    <P>Many members, including myself, have previously spoken about an extraordinary comission.  While every car must be fitted with a dimming device, the law is such that the driver of a car fitted with a dimming device may drive the roads like the devil and keep his lights glaring full on without making use of the dimming device.  That is a small matter that could be tackled.  It <Col N="698" /> is about time it was examined closely because the trend in the newer types of cars on the road is to have more powerful headlights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported, I was dealing with the problem in relation to the dimming devices on cars which do not have to be dimmed.  Another problem which I should like to raise is that in relation to rear lights on cycles.  I know that if a Guard holds up a cyclist for not having a rear light, that Guard is supposed to be a tyrant.  All motorists have the same terrible experience of meeting the gentleman at night who will not dim his lights and of fearing that there is a cyclist in front who may not have a rear light.  I would much prefer to meet a cyclist without a headlight than to pass a cyclist who has no rear light.  In spite of the very high prices people must pay for new bicycles, the rear light on these machines is most unsatisfactory.  While the Minister answered a question in this connection in the Dáil some weeks ago, this matter should be taken up with the manufacturers to see that, for the very small cost involved, they will provide these new machines with an adequate rear light device.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Year after year, we have been speaking on the problem of parking which now affects not alone Dublin but many provincial towns.  While it may be said that this matter is more appropriate to the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, I <Col N="705" /> believe that, since the Garda are involved, it is only through the fullest measure of co-operation between the Departments of Justice and Local Government and the local authorities that we will solve this urgent problem. With the enormous amount of car traffic on the roads for some time back, we are reaching a stage of complete chaos in many of the provincial towns, where, because both sides are being used for parking, nobody can traverse the main streets.  I ask the Minister to examine this question and see what progress is being made in relation to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy spoke on the closing of barracks, and I fully agree with him.  Very often in many areas you will hear people expressing the wish that the Gardaí were 100 miles away, but when it is suggested that a local barracks should be closed down, you have everyone of importance in the parish rushing to the local Deputy who must call on the Minister in this connection.  It seems that suddenly the people have become afraid that a group of Mau Mau will come and attack them in their little village if their local Gardaí are transferred. There are many areas in rural Ireland where the people are decent, God-fearing and sufficiently law abiding to be able to continue without having a barracks in their village.  Therefore, whether it is for economy or other purposes, where the Minister considers it advisable to close down a local barracks, the House should give due consideration to that aspect rather than plead on behalf of people who want a man in uniform amongst them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of motorcycle patrols mentioned by Deputy Blaney, I am convinced that, while it may not apply to Dublin City or Cork City, the system of patrol cars going around has been a complete failure, because clearly visible on the hood of the car is the warning &ldquo;Garda&rdquo;.  It is for all the world like a Garda calling on a local publican and saying: &ldquo;I am a Garda and I intend to raid this house.&rdquo;  If any drivers wish to be careless or negligent, if they have good sight and particularly on straight roads, they will see the Garda car a <Col N="706" /> long way off and suddenly become very good boys.  The proper approach would be to improve the system of motorcycle patrols, because a Garda can easily pull his machine into the side of the road and keep an eye on some of these would-be killers who are travelling our main and country roads.  That, in my opinion, would produce more beneficial results than the Garda motor cars.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which reference has been made by many members is the number of drunks behind the steering-wheel of cars on the road. Instead of the situation improving, I am afraid it is becoming worse.  We have the gentry who leave the city and enter a public house as <i>bona fide</i> travellers, stay there for a few hours and, when they leave at about 12 o'clock and meet anyone on the road, act as if that person had no right to be there.  We all realise the benefit of refresher courses and even politicians must go through such courses. Each and every one of us at various times must go through an election which can be termed a refresher course, and if we do not make the grade, that is too bad for us.  It would be very helpful if the members of the judiciary had refresher courses in relation to the problems&mdash;and they are very new problems&mdash;which confront us in respect of these drivers.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of speaking of any individual case, but it is well the Minister should know that the average person in certain parts of Ireland, owing to certain recent happenings, is wondering whether he is safe on the roads at all and whether it is safer for a driver to have an accident while drunk than to have an accident when he is sober.  Every time I read the decisions in a certain court I say: &ldquo;God bless that district justice.&rdquo;  It is true he is a Cork man and I refer to District Justice Gordon Hurley in Clare, who is a credit to his profession.</P>

      <P>I have mentioned it now.  I am delighted to see people, when they are in a position to dispense justice, dispensing it in a proper <Col N="707" /> manner.  I would say to the Minister that such refresher courses are long overdue so that there will be no disparity between one part of the country and another.  Whether we have Garda barracks closed or open, if we continue dispensing justice as it has been done on different occasions up to the present, I am afraid the people in this country must adopt some other system of protection for themselves on the roads or must get off the roads completely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have every reason to thank the Garda Síochána and our courts of law for the very peaceful civilian life enjoyed in the Republic by our people.  From the Minister's statement, it seems that one of the problems requiring immediate attention is our road traffic problem.  In the Minister's statement, it was indicated that more than half the number of prosecutions issued during the past 12 months was in respect of road traffic offences.  In fact, the Minister pointed out that there was reduction in other classes of offences.</P>
      <P>The Garda, in my opinion, have been too lenient and reasonable towards road users, particularly in Dublin City and in the more populous districts.  I was glad to see recently that the Garda are beginning to examine the possibility of coping with the very difficult problem which is arising in the city regarding the control of all kinds of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone have the Guards the problem of controlling motor and horse vehicular traffic in the city, but of course they also have the duty of dealing with cyclists and careless pedestrians. Much of the obstruction in city traffic is being caused either by jay-walkers or by cyclists who are doing nothing less than wriggling in and out through the traffic, a danger to themselves and to other people desiring to use the streets.  It has become so bad that it is even suggested that before long motor users will find it necessary to leave their vehicles somewhere outside the city and come into the city on foot or by means of <Col N="708" /> public transport in order to get through our streets.</P>
    <P>Our Guards have the power to control and manage traffic.  It is a very big problem and has got into a very confused state in this city, but I feel myself that if they are not so lenient and are more strict with all classes of road users we will before long have order restored and have a situation where there will not be the prolonged standstills we have at the rush hours at present, particularly on Church holidays.  The country people very often come into the city to do business on Church holidays, and the result is that the existing traffic system in the city is unable to cope with the much larger volume of traffic that has to be dealt with on such days.  It compares only with the rush hours we see on various days of the week here.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we have not yet a system of driving licence tests. At the present time any motor vehicle owner, or one who does not own a motor vehicle, can purchase a driving licence and get into a vehicle whether he knows how to drive it or not, whether he is proved to be competent or not.  There are plenty of persons who know how to drive motor vehicles but are not efficient and competent to manage them.  I feel that the Department of Justice would be doing a good day's work if they ensured that tests would be applied before driving licences are issued.</P>
    <P>In many cases, too, we have vehicles on the road which are not road-worthy, which are, as is said, without a screed of a brake.  They have bad steering, and some of them have tyres in a very bad state, and generally, they are vehicles which could not pass as being road-worthy.  Still we have the situation where those vehicles are allowed to use the roads and cause considerable damage to other traffic and other road users.  I hope that something will be done regarding the use of vehicles on the roads which are not fit to be used on them.  I know that the Civic Guards have power to stop a vehicle, get into it and test it, and in fact they do frequently exercise those powers in relation to commercial <Col N="709" /> vehicles.  But there are many private motor vehicles which are very badly equipped to use the roads on which there is so much traffic.</P>
    <P>We have noticed with pleasure in recent years the very firm attitude adopted towards drivers of motor vehicles who have been proved to be intoxicated.  However, I feel that there should be uniformity in the matter of the penalties imposed, because in some areas you will have a court imposing penalties which may be unreasonably severe and which are certainly very much more severe than the penalties imposed in other courts.</P>
    <P>Drivers of motor vehicles, especially persons who own and use them in connection with their livelihood, whose licence is suspended for a period of 12 months and even longer, suffer a very severe punishment.  I feel that such long suspensions should not be imposed on those people.  It may be that the person who was accidentally found to be intoxicated has not done any harm though he could have done harm, and very often he has to suffer the same punishment and penalty as a person who, in fact, did harm in driving a motor vehicle.  The period of suspension of driving licences should be much less than six or 12 months in many cases.  It is very difficult, I know, when a decision has been reached regarding a period for which a licence ought to be suspended, to alter that decision.  There have to be very good grounds, and usually the case put forward is not sufficient to have that decision altered, and the person who has had his licence suspended for a specific period must put up with such suspension.</P>
    <P>I am advocating that there should be such a thing as a degree of punishment in that respect, because even a month's suspension of a driving licence is a very severe penalty for some people who would require to use a motor vehicle in connection with their livelihood. Most of those people who are found intoxicated and are punished will never be caught again and will never be drunk again when using a motor vehicle.  Having got the first punishment, it is unlikely that they will be so <Col N="710" /> careless as to use a motor vehicle again under the influence of drink, but when they offend only once, maybe, in a lifetime, they have to suffer a very severe penalty and lose their employment as a result although, as I say, they have not caused any injury or damage. They may have been found in a position in which they were going to use the vehicle, perhaps having stepped into it about to drive home.  That is why I advocate that all suspension of licences should not be for such a long period as 12 or six months, because the punishment would be just as bad for certain people if it was only one or two months' suspension.</P>
    <P>In connection with the use of rear reflectors on bicycles, I feel that we are rather lax in this country in not insisting on a proper rear lighting saystem. In Northern Ireland and, I believe, in Great Britain an actual light has to be shown on the rear of the bicycle, and a rear reflector is not sufficient.  But here even the rear reflectors which are provided are so small and put in such a position on the bicycle that any kind of mud or lack of cleaning leaves the reflector useless in connection with motor traffic.  At present, especially in connection with dazzling lights on a straight road, the cyclist is in a very dangerous position if his rear reflector is not reflecting properly.</P>
    <P>I feel, too, that the courts should be more strict with people crossing the streets.  There are bylaws there which could be imposed by Dublin Corporation at any time requiring people who wish to cross the streets to cross at certain places.  If any of us take the trouble to look up O'Connell Street, or any of the main thoroughfares here in the City of Dublin, he will see people stepping out from the footpath anywhere and everywhere along the street, all anxious to get to the other side, instead of going to a recognised crossing and achieving their object of getting to the other side by using that crossing.  If they did that, there would be less confusion and a freer flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of tinkers and some control of their activities.  There may be some sympathy for tinkers because <Col N="711" /> it may be held that they are harmless and more or less abandoned. Let us look for a moment at the other side of the picture.  Many of them are robbers and thieves.  They go out at night to rob.  They open farmers' gates and put their horses in to graze on the fresh grass and they take the horses out before the farmer is up in the morning to catch them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There are also robbers and thieves who do not live in caravans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some control should be exercised over tinkers.  After all, these people are not completely abandoned.  When a tinker reaches 70 years of age, he can claim an old age pension from the State.  Possibly the widows are entitled to widows' pensions.  They come to the State for a certain measure of assistance and, if they wish to live as ordinary citizens and make some contribution towards the maintenance of the State, then some measure of control should be exercised over their activities.</P>
      <P>They are notorious for spoiling annual festivals.  These festivals are held in many areas.  As soon as a festival is about to take place, all roads leading to the festival are packed with tinkers and their caravans, coming in to cause annoyance to the patrons by their begging activities.  Organisers of these festivals take a great deal of trouble to make these events a success and to popularise them.  Their aim is naturally to get as many people as they can to attend, but these people are so annoyed by the importunities of these tinkers that the festival is spoilt both for them and the organisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed some years ago to discover that the Department of Justice had decided to lower the physical requirements for recruitment to the Garda Síochána.  That was a retrograde step.  It is desirable that the physical standards should be the highest possible and it is only right and proper that we should keep them as high as possible.  There are numbers of very fine young men who are anxious to enter the force.  When we <Col N="712" /> have an opportunity of picking the cream of these, we should, I maintain, keep the physical standards as high as possible, within the limits in which we can get a sufficient number to man the force.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that there is a move at last to reduce the number of stations.  That, of course, will be a long-term policy.  If we tried to bring about a reduction too rapidly, we would definitely cause hardship to many of the members who are located in different parts of the country.  As a long-term policy, it is highly desirable. I agree with Deputy Desmond that the community in general interferes too much with the Department of Justice in relation to the location of stations and the transfer of personnel in the different areas.  I think the present policy can be implemented slowly and carefully, without hurting anybody and still achieving the ultimate object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are mixed opinions in relation to the closing of Garda stations.  The present policy may be a good one, though I personally have not seen very much difference.  If the barracks are not required in small rural communities, possibly it is better to centralise the force, though, in the past, I have advocated that that is an unwise step.  However, I have more or less an open mind on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to the policy in so far as it entails a reduction in numbers.  When we remember that further closings may take place in the future and, at the same time, there will be a reduction in numbers, it is only right that we should have second thoughts in the matter.  We all know that, during the emergency and since the emergency, extra duties have been thrown on to the Garda Síochána.  They have undertaken these extra duties willingly and they have carried them out efficiently. Despite that extra work, we now find that it is proposed to reduce the numbers rather than increase them.  The results of that policy are to be seen everywhere.  It is unfortunate that the time of these men in the villages, towns and cities should be taken up with road traffic cases and breaches of the <Col N="713" /> licensing laws.  These two items occupy a large percentage of the time of the Gardaí, with the result that there is no time left in which to enforce all the other laws and regulations.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the Gardaí have to help the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Agriculture.  The compilation of statistics for the Department of Agriculture is thrown over on the Gardaí.  The filling of forms for the Department of Social Welfare in relation to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is thrown over on the Gardaí.  Various other duties have fallen upon them.  Yet, we find now that the Minister and his Department have adopted a policy of reduction in numbers.  That is not as it should be. The numbers should be increased rather than reduced.</P>
    <P>When a large number of retirals took place recently, the Department decided to recruit a certain number to fill the vacancies.  When the change of Government took place, that number was reduced and young men who did the examination and who expected, from public statements of policy, that a certain number would be required, found, after the lapse of a year, that they would have to sit for another examination all over again.  Not alone had they passed the most recent examination, but they came well within the number required.  They were notified, however, that not more than 160 would be taken, that they would have to do the examination all over again.  Even then, there was not very much hope that they would be successful because the number required this year would be very small.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who sat the last exam and especially with regard to those after 160th place and up to 250th place, a grave injustice was done. The least the Minister could do would be to see to it that those who passed should not be required to undergo a further exam.  It is fortunate that, of that number, only a very small percentage&mdash;I think about nine candidates &mdash;will, on the occasion of the next exam, be over the age limit.  I maintain that none of them should have to <Col N="714" /> do any exam as, after all, they have already passed and qualified in every way.  Subject to the usual medical test, they should be allowed to become members of the Garda Síochána and there should be no cutting down of the force.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one thing that is neglected&mdash;not through any fault of the Gardaí but just because their other duties are so numerous. School attendance enforcement is practically a dead letter.  No Garda barracks can take two or three Gardaí on a particular day and send them out to the schools in the Garda sub-district.  It just cannot be done. Some of the schools are situated in remote areas and in most Garda districts there are, say, five or six schools and about an equal number of Gardaí. Therefore, proper school attendance supervision and check-up cannot be carried out, with the result that the enforcement of the School Attendance Acts in most areas is a dead letter.  It is not enough for a Garda to go to a school once every six months and take a few cases to court.  The fines are very small and it will be another six months before offenders are hauled over the coals again, or possibly longer, which makes a farce of the whole Act.</P>
    <P>In order to have the School Attendance Acts enforced properly, it is necessary to have regular visits by the Gardaí to each individual school and a warning to the defaulters.  I agree with the Minister's policy that, for trivial offences, it is better to issue warnings than to have prosecutions.  In this case, it would be more effective if the Gardaí could visit the school, have a talk with the children and also, perhaps, with the parents.  The trouble is that there is no time for that.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of tinkers, and that class, who go around the country in caravans parked here and there.  I do not know whether or not we should put them off the roads altogether.  There is one feature of it to which I object and the remedy lies in the hands of the Gardaí.  When from ten to 20 caravans arrive at a particular place, especially in the summer time and in warm weather, and remain there for anything up to a month, it <Col N="715" /> is a danger to the health of the community and the Gardaí should not allow these people to remain for so long in any place.  I am aware that there is an administrative difficulty there.  Whereas, I think, it is specified in some of the older Acts that they can park in a place for only 24 hours and that, after that, legally, they must move along, the snag is that they can move 10 yards further down the road and continue to park, which defeats the purpose of the section of the Act. If that is the case I urge an amendment of the provision.  I would not just confine them to 24 hours at a particular spot, but I would very much curtail the practice that has grown up among those people of remaining put for as long as a month.</P>
    <P>Complaints are made in nearly every district about damage to and destruction of property.  The Gardaí find it difficult to bring the culprits to justice and it causes endless headaches in towns and villages and even in country places where such damage is done.  While I feel inclined to urge that the Gardaí should be on the alert and should in each district make an example of anyone found carrying out destruction either to private or public property, I am loathe to do that, because I know well that the Gardaí have not the time.  The force is so depleted that it is impossible for them to go chasing all over the countryside after people who carry out destruction to private and public property.  However, it is a matter which is annoying people in small towns, villages and country districts.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the Minister made statements in connection with the licensing laws.  A commission has been set up to go into the whole question of licensing as it exists to-day, but it may take some time before the commission has gone into the matter thoroughly, drawn up a report, submitted it to the Minister who then submits it to the Government after which legislation may be drafted and introduced into this House by way of a Bill.  All that will take some time.  The fact that this House set up such a commission and gave it certain instructions&mdash;as a <Col N="716" /> matter of fact, asked it to go into the whole licensing laws of this State&mdash; means that the laws do need overhauling. Nevertheless, because it will take at least up to two years and possibly more before a Licensing Bill is brought in here, I would urge, like Deputy Blaney and other Deputies, that some instructions on the matter should be issued to the Gardaí, the sergeants and the district justices.  It is annoying, peculiar, and so on, to find that one cannot have a drink after certain hours in a certain town, but that one can have it three miles away.</P>
    <P>A publican does not mind if he has to close at eight o'clock on Sunday or at 10.30 on week-nights if he knows that everybody else, in every town within a radius of 20 miles, has done the same thing.  But when he finds himself in court together with a few of his customers he discovers a publican not three miles away breaking his heart laughing at him and pulling his leg because he had not acquired a knowledge of the after-hour trade.  There is an after-hour trade in the country and the question is whether there should or should not be.  We cannot have a halfway stage because it is unfair to one group of publicans.  We should have some definite instructions sent out now, pending legislation.  Instructions should also go to the justices, if that is possible&mdash;I do not know whether it is or not.  Where publicans are brought to court we have variations in penalties. The same variations apply to offenders on the road.  The point I am trying to make is that we should have a better adherence to the law and the law should be evenly administered.  I am not saying it is unevenly administered through any particular fault of those administering it, but people may say: &ldquo;Legislation is coming out on this and we will take it easy,&rdquo; or one officer may adopt a certain attitude and another may take quite a different one.  It would be as well if we had uniformity on these things.</P>
    <P>One thing which I can never understand is why all the traffic regulations are left to the Minister for the Local Government&mdash;although he is a Donegal man I am not trying to lessen his burden. I think that it would be reasonable <Col N="717" /> to expect that the drafting of regulations should be a matter for the Minister for Justice, as he is the person who has to enforce them.  I suggest that it leads to the point where one Minister can say: &ldquo;That is not my job&rdquo; and another can say it is not his job.  That means that we do not get uniformity.  Now that there is a new Traffic Bill in the offing, I understand, to be introduced by the Minister for Local Government, this would be the time to see that at least the Minister who will be responsible for the carrying out of the regulations made under that Bill will be the person to undertake the drafting of the regulations especially in regard to traffic.</P>
    <P>We have a state of chaos here in the matter of traffic.  That is not the fault of the Minister or of any of his servants. It is due to the fact that the number of vehicles, especially motor vehicles, has increased very considerably since the war.  While we may be worried about the drunken driver and about the other kind of drivers, I am worried particularly about uninsured drivers, people who drive cars which are not covered by insurance.  Accidents will happen; they are happening every day and some of them are very serious.  How much more serious is it when we find that the culprit has no insurance and that the injured person cannot get any compensation?  In some cases compensation is no good because a person may have received an injury for life, but it is the next best thing. Uninsured drivers should be debarred from driving for a lengthy period and if a second offence occurs they should never be issued with a driving licence again.  I have known cases where death has resulted where an uninsured vehicle was at fault and untold hardship for the victim resulted.</P>
    <P>I would say that part of the trouble is not that the person does not wish to have his vehicle insured but that the insurance companies are putting endless difficulties in the way of motorists.  In some cases they are making it practically impossible to have a vehicle insured.  They are increasing the premium and charging extra penalties as well.  Seeing that these companies, some of which operate from outside the State, are licensed by the <Col N="718" /> Department, we should see that they do not impose prohibitive conditions on the granting of insurance for a vehicle.  Such conditions are causing a lot of people to evade insuring their vehicles.  In the first place they may not get insurance under any conditions, no matter how much they pay.  In the second place there are cases where the insurance is prohibitive.  It is well known that there are companies who do not want to engage in motor insurance at all.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on the note on which I began, that for all the extra work which the Gardaí have to do at the moment I would query the Minister's policy of reductions in their numbers. If they are to do all the work that is required of them they will be able to do it efficiently only if they are above their present strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure every Deputy in the House will be pleased to note from the Minister's speech that there has been a decrease, under all headings, for indictable offences.  I should like to support my colleague from Donegal, in view of the fact that we have set up a commission to enquire fully into the licensing laws, that there should be some relaxation in enforcement, without allowing flagrant violation of the law as it exists.  I understand that that has been done in the case of road traffic offences of a trivial nature because under the heading of road traffic prosecutions there is a very notable decrease.  That is is mainly due to the fact, as the Minister stated, that there have been fewer prosecutions for offences of a technical nature.  That has reduced the figure under that heading very considerably. I agree with Deputy Cunningham that, while we should not give <i>carte blanche</i> to any publican to violate the laws, in some cases, there is over-strict supervision.  I have no hesitation in stating in this House that I know that in some towns and villages of West Limerick certain publicans are overawed and are subject to overdue supervision as against others.  I hope that discrimination will disappear.  I have a particular case in mind that I will not mention, but which I will convery to the Minister in the very near <Col N="719" /> future.  Such discrimination is very wrong and unfair.</P>
      <P>We should be very proud of the new Gardaí.  They are a grand type of men who have been recruited, as we all know, from every section of our people. The atmosphere in which they have been recruited is very different from the atmosphere which prevailed in the initial stages of recruitment for the Garda Síochána.  At that time, members of the force were recruited in the height of a civil war and were partisan to a great extent.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that in concert hall ditties and little stories one can find Irish life truly reflected.  I was listening to a very great Connacht man in my home town where, some months ago, a concert was held in aid of the Brigade Memorial Fund.  He told us a story about a young man who came to Ardfert, which was his first assignment. He was under the jurisdiction of a hardened old warrior of the 1922 days.  On a Sunday evening, the sergeant said to the young recruit: &ldquo;Go down to Mrs. Harty and listen if there is anything going on.&rdquo;  The young recruit went down to Mrs. Harty's and came back to the sergeant and said: &ldquo;There is a terrible noise there.&rdquo;  The sergeant said: &ldquo;Go down and try if you can hear the noise of the exchange of coins.&rdquo;  The young Garda went down, returned and said: &ldquo;They are still there.  I can hear the sound of corks being drawn, but I cannot hear the jingling of coins.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;forget about it.  They must be some of our own lads.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that we should be very proud of our young Gardaí.  They have been recruited from every section of our people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the matter of patrol cars.  There is serious objection to them.  People do not like them and say that it is wilful waste of public money that Gardaí should come out in a patrol car to serve a summons on a farmer, or cottier, or somebody else for not having a licence for his dog, that a Garda could come on a bicycle to serve these summonses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter to which I wish to make special reference is the closing of <Col N="720" /> Garda stations in small towns and villages.  The officials of the Department of Justice may have their own ideas in regard to this matter.  We have been told by country people that departmental officials carry their brains in their brief cases.  One must come down to terra firma and judge these things as one finds them.  A Garda station may close down at 4 p.m. and a notice is put up to the effect that &ldquo;Garda So-and-So can be found at his residence,&rdquo; which may be out in the country.  I want to remind the Minister of the great tragedy in Rineanna when a big Dutch airliner crashed into the mudbanks.  If there had been a Guard on duty in the Garda station at Pallaskenry to receive a phone message and convey the information to the people at Malin Point, who had a boat, the boat could have crossed the Shannon and the lives of a number of people could have been saved.  Contact could not be made with the Gardaí in Pallaskenry and there was a horrible tragedy as a result.  The closing down of Garda stations at 4 p.m. is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>We were often told that what we require is a system something similar to the English system of having a villarge constable.  There is no use in providing a Garda station and paying rent, rates and maintenance costs for it, if it closes down at 4 p.m.  There would not be any hardship involved in having one Guard always in attendance.  We had the specific case in Pallaskenry. If there had been a Guard in the station that evening in Pallaskenry many lives could have been saved, a boat could have been taken from Malin Point to the mudbank where all these people lost their lives.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the Minister's attention to the question of traffic control.  It is all very well for the Minister to tell us that there have been fewer prosecutions for offences of a trivial nature.  The Minister may not be responsible for the making of traffic regulations&mdash;I think that is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government&mdash;but the two Departments should coalesce and would have an interest in doing so.  More use should be made of the Garda force in the matter of traffic control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> I was at the final between Cork and Tipperary at Limerick recently.  All the side streets of Limerick run at right angles to the main street.  The Garda regulations prescribed that the inflow of traffic from the south and west should go down by the Shannon. That evening, when traffic was returning from the match, the Cork people, West Limerick people and Kerry people were coming at a right angle to the main Limerick-Killarney line and there was not a single Garda on duty at any of the junctions.  It was ridiculous.  I witnessed four cars abreast on the road trying to get into the line to get to the main road.  That would not have happened if there had been a Garda on duty.  It was providential that there were not crashes.</P>
    <P>Gardaí could be used to a greater extent in traffic control, pending the introduction of traffic regulations which the Minister indicated, in reply to a parliamentary question, will be introduced. The Garda force could be occupied in preserving life under the heading of traffic control to a greater extent than has been the case.</P>
    <P>In my home town, there is very heavy traffic to the coast in summer, especially to Ballybunion.  I say, as an appreciation of the sergeant there, that, were it not for him and for the common sense that he displays and that we expect all members of the force to exercise, and for his posting Guards at danger points, anything could happen.  It should be a matter of universal concern that Guards should be used to a greater extent in the control of traffic.</P>
    <P>I have a special interest in traffic.  I hesitate to mention it, but my brother was a commissioner in the State of Washington for traffic control, where he had seven districts.  A few years ago, he was in this country and compared, to our disadvantage, the control of traffic in Washington and Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I should like to call to the Minister's notice.  He has set up a commission to go fully into the licensing laws and I understand that, when such commissions are set up, they are presented with terms of reference.  This <Col N="722" /> commission has been set up to inquire into the licensing laws and its terms of reference should include the fact that a number of people in rural areas have only six-day licences.  In West Limerick, in Rathkeale and a number of other places, several publicans have only six-day licences.</P>
    <P>The history of that goes back to the time of the old landlords.  In those days, the landlords were justices of the peace and when people applied for licences, they said that, on Sundays, the rustics would congregate and that, for the peace and safety of the district it would be better to have the public-house closed on that day.  That is the history and the background of the six-day licence and I would like to bring it to the notice of the Minister and to the notice of Deputy Boland.  Deputy Boland was for many years Minister for Justice and he earned congratulations from every section of our people for his work in that office.  The present Minister is carrying on on the great foundations and standards laid down by Deputy Boland, but I should like to remind both of them that, when this commission is inquiring fully into the licensing laws, they should bear in mind this penal imposition which was placed on our people by the landlords and the justices of the peace.  I hope that this imposition will be removed in any legislation that may be introduced.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with two of the points that I wanted to make.  Another point is the use of the Garda cars, which is, being severely criticised by our people. I will give an instance of the use of the Garda car in Newcastlewest.  Suppose a summons is to be served miles away on the Kerry border.  If a car goes from Newcastlewest to serve a summons on some unfortunate who might have forgotten to licence his dog, the people say that that is too much.  They say that it would be perfectly natural for the Garda in the local barracks to get on his bicycle and cycle to serve that summons.</P>
    <P>School attendance supervision is falling very far below what we would like it to be.  It is not up to standard.  I am speaking from personal knowledge of the fact that there is an inclination, in <Col N="723" /> recent years, for the Gardaí to be a bit careless in that respect.  If they are bound by regulation and by law to do this work, then they should do it.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned tinkers and said that they should have no part in Irish life, that they should be ostracised and that regulations should be made to confine camping to certain limits.  I believe they are God's own people.  During the Black and Tan days, when we were on the flying columns, the second best friends we had, next to those who gave us homes and shelter, were the people of the road.  From the time of the old R.I.C., these people were bludgeoned with the wrath of the Crown and of the R.I.C. itself.  I think they are a part of our history and that we need not be ashamed of them.  When Puck Fair comes in August, they congregate there from all over Ireland and visitors from many countries come there for the purpose of seeing the congregation of the tinkers.  I see nothing wrong with them and I do not believe that they are robbers.</P>
    <P>They have a life of their own and what men of high cultural and literary standard, such as Brian MacMahon, of Listowel, have written about the tinkers, is something that we should be very proud of.  We do not like them to break the law, but I would not suggest to the Minister or the Gardaí that they should be hard or severe on these people.  They are part of Irish life and they go to make up the glory of the past, along with our traditions, our language, music and culture.  I would rather see a crowd of tinkers than many millionaires from foreign countries.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that this debate has been conducted in a very calm atmosphere, although various suggestions were made with regard to matters with which the Department has nothing to do.  I will endeavour to reply to some of the very important points made and I assure the other Deputies that, if I overlook their points, it does not mean that they will not have attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland raised a very important <Col N="724" /> matter regarding the reorganisation of the District and Circuit Courts. He very rightly pointed that, when the extension of jurisdiction was given to these courts, it was decided to wait and see how things would work out. It is not the Department's intention to shelve the matter in any way.  We are just waiting for some time to see the effects on the various courts of the working out of the increased jurisdiction. We do not wish to rush the matter.  We want to give plenty of time to see how the increased jurisdiction will operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think three years is a good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it is going on since 1953 or 1954.  We are allowing plenty of time to see how matters will work out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland and other Deputies were interested in the matter of rents. This is a very contentious matter and I promised last year that I would shortly have something to introduce in connection with the Rent Act.  I can assure the Deputy that, before the Adjournment of the Dáil for the recess, I will introduce a Bill dealing with the reversionary leases as mentioned in the Conroy Report, so that Deputies will have an opportunity of reading it during the recess.  It will be a short Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. Lynch and other Deputies raised a very important matter in connection with what they called the tinkers of the country.  I would ask Deputies to use their influence with the public bodies of which they are members to get these bodies to provide more pounds throughout the country. I know one tourist county from which there were many complaints about tinkers, but, when they provided a pound, they were able to solve the problem, by putting the horses into the pound and by compelling the people to pay for the trespass of the horses before they would release them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated that there are 6,000 tinkers in the country and that we should take action to deal with them, but what are we to do with them? They are homeless people.  Can we put them in a concentration camp?  There <Col N="725" /> were complaints about tinkers in Waterford.  Outside the city there is a by-road, not used by the public, which is being used as a camping ground by these people.  The Garda appealed to the county council to close up that road.  It was the recognised camping ground in Waterford for a large number of these people.  The county council refused to close the road.  The Gardai co-operate as much as they possibly can.  Deputies should realise that we cannot round up 6,000 people and put them in a concentration camp. What will become of their wives and children?  They would be homeless.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch and others referred to recruiting for the Garda Síochána and Deputy Cunningham complained about men being disappointed.  We had expected to call up more men.  Entry to the Garda is the same as entry to the Civil Service and those who were disappointed will have the right to submit themselves for the next examination to be held at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney had a complaint to make in regard to the height required. I want to assure the Deputy and the House that the standard is five feet nine inches which is the very minimum. That has never been interfered with.  Other Deputies had complaints to make in connection with the licensing laws.  Deputies are aware that a commission is now being set up. I should like to remind the House that last year I was reprimanded here and attacked very severely, because I said I did not consider it a criminal offence for a labourer or farm labourer to be found a few minutes after the prescribed time in a public house.  I am certain that the majority of the Guards are men with common sense and that they will take the view expressed by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>I receive complaints, as also do Deputies.  I have to send these complaints to the Commissioner and I cannot deal further with them.  We are told that the Guards in some cases take an undue interest in certain houses and do not bother about other houses.  The Guards deny that, but, after all, human nature is human nature.  We hope that the commission <Col N="726" /> will not take two years to submit a report.  I am going to appeal to it to forward its report within six months. We are all aware of the defects in the licensing laws and these the commission will endeavour to remedy. Ninety-five per cent. of the people of Ireland could, without haying to wait a year, give their views on the defects in the licensing laws.  I am sure the commission will submit a very comprehensive report which will enable the Government to bring in a law which, though it may not satisfy everybody, will meet the wishes of the majority of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea when the commission will start?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be very soon.  We are trying to suit the majority of the principal Deputies of the House in connection with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke and others spoke about extending the age limits for members of the force.  We have extended the age in respect of all ranks up to the age of 63 while the retiring age of superintendents and chief superintendents, having certified pre-Truce service, has been extended to 65.  All Deputies agree in insisting upon a certificate and a medal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy compained about the excessive costs charged by the legal profession in West Cork, but I am sure that everybody has a complaint against the legal profession, whether in Cork or anywhere else.  If you go to court, you will pay for going there.  The scale in respect of the District Court and High Court is fixed and solicitors are expected to comply with that scale.  Any person who feels he is being charged an excessive sum can have his costs taxed.  Naturally enough, lawyers and professional men endeavour to get the largest sum they possibly can, but that is the position in all professions and trades.  In regard to the District Court and the Circuit Court, there is a special scale and lawyers are not allowed to charge more than that scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies made complaints in regard to the transfer of Guards and one Deputy complained about an area which was going to be left without <Col N="727" /> a superintendent.  Under legislation passed in this House, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána has full control and authority over the Garda and all the Minister can do in regard to complaints or representations he may receive is to forward them direct to the Commissioner.  With regard to transfers, non-commissioned promotions and so on, the Minister has no control whatsoever.  The law passed in this House gave the Commissioner full power and authority over the administration and working of the Garda Síochána.  That is the Commissioner's responsibility.  If he fails in that responsibility, the Minister and the Government will have the right to deal with him.  Up to the present, I do not think he has acted in any way other than to meet the wishes of the majority of the people of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputies spoke about the closing of barracks, but I should like to point out that, since 1953, only 32 barracks were closed in the Twenty-Six Counties and the Commissioner assures me that, as a result of so doing, areas are being patrolled better.  There is no call for alarm, as the Commissioner assures me that, with the motor and motorcycle patrols, bigger areas will be patrolled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney referred to the motor-cycle patrols.  We have eight of them.  These are the &ldquo;courtesy cops&rdquo; and they operate on the approaches to the cities at peak periods of traffic. Speaking of traffic, I should like to point out that the making of traffic by-laws is entirely a matter in Dublin for the corporation.  We have only to administer the by-laws passed by the local bodies.  Public bodies pass their own by-laws and exercise their own control.  Possibly, they will be able to remedy the complaints Deputies made in regard to caravans parking for months on the side of a road.  That is purely a matter for the public body concerned because they make the by-laws. We promise to give the public bodies every support we can in connection with that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy put forward the suggestion that another force, in the <Col N="728" /> form of the old L.S.F., should be brought in.  I do not want to make the excuse that that force would not be under my control.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputies have discussed this Estimate in such a calm and free manner.  I wish to thank them on all sides of the House for the co-operation they have given to me not alone here but on other occasions when I have tried to meet them.  It was not always possible to do that but they have recognised my difficulties and have understood them.  I wish, therefore, to thank Deputies on all sides for the help they have given me in dealing with a very complicated Department and in doing what, for any Minister for Justice, is a very unpopular job, trying to administer the law.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to thank Deputies for their co-operation and to assure them that I will continue to help them in any way possible.  I can also assure them that I shall do my best to have remedied all the grievances that have been mentioned.</P>

      <P>There are three Estimates for my Department.  The net amount provided in the three Estimates for the present year is in the region of £21,250,000. Only some £550,000 of this is for administration expenses, the remainder being required for the various benefits and assistance services administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>Deputies will note that the Estimates now before the Dáil make no provision for the increases in the rates of unemployment benefit, disability benefit and widows' contributory pensions which were the subject of recent legislation.  The Exchequer contribution towards the cost of these increases will be provided by means of a Supplementary Estimate later in the year.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for 1956-57 for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, which provides for salaries and other expenses of administration, shows a net increase of approximately £4,000 over the provision for these services in 1955-56.  The net increase in the payment sub-heads of this estimate is about £58,000 which is mainly due to increases in Civil Service pay under conciliation and arbitration machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for Social Insurance in which provision is made for the <Col N="732" /> Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund, from which the various insurance benefits are paid, shows a reduction of £618,000 as compared with the provision for last year.</P>
    <P>The reduction is due principally to a decrease of £454,000 in the provision for unemployment benefit and an estimated increase of £182,000 in the income from contributions.  These figures are based on experience in the previous year in which the expenditure on unemployment benefit proved to be less than the amount provided and income from contributions considerably exceeded the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The estimated expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund in the year 1956-57 on insurance benefits and their administration is approximately £7,957,000.  This is made up as follows and does not include any increase in expenditure arising under the recent legislation.</P>

    <P>The income from contributions is based on the existing rates and takes no account of the proposed increases in rates as from 3rd September next.</P>
    <P>The difference between the expenditure of £7,957,000 and the income figure of £5,843,000, that is £2,114,000, is the amount that has to be made good by the Exchequer.  To this amount must be added the sum of £2,000 due from the Exchequer in respect of late payments under the former insurance schemes.  Accordingly, the total sum provided under sub-head A of the Estimate is £2,116,000.</P>
    <P>It will, owing to the passing into law of the Social Welfare (Amendment) <Col N="733" /> Act, 1956, be necessary to provide a further sum for social insurance this year by means of a Supplementary Estimate.  As I stated when speaking on the Bill it is proposed to increase the rates of the insurance benefits by approximately 25 per cent. as from the beginning of September next.  After that date a man with a wife and two children will, when sick or unemployed, be entitled to 61/- per week instead of 50/- as at present, and a widow with two children entitled to a contributory pension will receive 46/- per week instead of the 38/- which she now receives.</P>
    <P>I might mention, while dealing with the social insurance Vote that a matter which had given rise to some dissatisfaction has been dealt with recently.  Under the regulations relating to the payment of marriage grant and maternity grant the time within which these grants could be claimed was limited to three months with power to extend for a further three months only.  Amending regulations have recently been made which enable these grants to be paid when the circumstances warrant at dates more than six months after the event to which the grants relate.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for social assistance there is a total net provision of £18,523,000 for the current financial year, an increase of £97,500 on the provision for social assistance for 1955-56, including the Supplementary Estimate of £844,000 in that year.  The House will recall that this Supplementary Estimate was mainly to cover the cost of the increases from July, 1955, in the rates of old age and blind pensions and widows' (non-contributory) pensions. The cost of these increases for a full year has to be provided in the Estimate for the current year, hence the increase in the amount required.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the beginning of my speech, the cost of social welfare to the Exchequer in the current financial year is estimated at approximately £21,250,000.  This large sum is paid out in many small sums mostly at weekly intervals to persons who are unable to work and maintain themselves and their dependents owing to advanced age, illness or inability to obtain work. <Col N="734" /> The sums being provided to-day on these three social welfare Estimates also assist workers to provide for their young families and widows to maintain themselves and their children after the death of the breadwinner of the family.</P>
    <P>The importance and value of the many payments in the form of social welfare benefits made to persons during times of difficulty cannot be over-stressed.  The money required to make the payments does not all come from the Exchequer.  Employers and workers contribute substantially to the fund from which insurance benefits are paid and I think it is a matter of much importance that, where possible, our social welfare schemes are on a contributory basis.  It enables them to be improved as in the recent Act without any of the participants feeling too much the added burden imposed on them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a golden opportunity for a young Minister like the present Minister for Social Welfare to do a good day's work for the cause of the language in this comparatively young and new Department.  As I said here a year ago, we expect a lot from him in this respect.  I suggested that one of the things he should tackle right away was the accounts branch.  When I was there for a short period, with the permission of my Minister, I tried to interest the Department in this, but I did not get very far.  There is much more progress in the county councils and in the urban councils than there is in the Department of Social Welfare. The accounts branch will have to take off the blinkers and wake up to the fact that, side by side with the economic progress of the nation, must go <Col N="735" /> the Gaelicisation of the nation.  Otherwise, Pearse and his comrades went out in vain, and it was in vain that Pearse stood over the grave of O'Donovan Rossa and enunciated the principle of a Gaelic Ireland&mdash;&ldquo;not merely free but Gaelic as well; not merely Gaelic but free as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many Departments have done a great deal in helping to revive the Irish language.  I do not expect them all to put up Fáinní or to do all their work through Irish, but surely they could begin in a small way?  A county council worker can have his pay order either entirely in Irish or bilingual, but the odd time he falls sick and gets a cheque from the Department of Social Welfare it should be in the language of the country.  He would be well able to cash it and he would not kick up any row about it.  I again appeal to the Minister to do something about this matter.  I am not one of those who say that the civil servants are doing nothing for the language revival, nor do I say that the language revival must come through the Civil Service; but I say that, if the ordinary citizens of the State did one tenth of what the civil servants are doing for the language revival, then that revival would come very rapidly and would come in a period of 50 years.  I have a small knowledge of this Department and I believe a lot more could be done there.  That is the reason I am making this plea here.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that there have been further savings and economies in the Department.  I do not think that any Department has carried out more economies than this Department.  I said in regard to the previous Vote, the Vote in respect of the Department of Justice, that we were a nation losing 40,000 people a year.  We cannot afford elaborate Departments.  Any saving we make is all to the good, because the more we leave in the ordinary citizen's pocket, no matter who he is, the better for the country. The more he has to spend, the more he will turn the wheels of industry and the more ploughshares he will set moving to produce food for himself and his family.  On the other hand, if we overburden him with officialdom, we make <Col N="736" /> life impossible for him and he will pack up and go where the burden will be less.  Therefore, economies, such as we had in the previous Estimate and such as we have in this Estimate in regard to personnel and the working of the Department, are all to the good.</P>
    <P>It was also desired at one time, and the hope was expressed, that this Department would be centred in Galway or somewhere else.  In his statement&mdash;I do not know exactly when he made it&mdash;the Minister gave certain reasons for not doing so by saying that the present building accommodated all the staff.  There may be a very legitimate reason for not decentralising this part of the Government, but I think the next best thing to be done is to have economies in the staff.  Unfortunately, we have one big city growing, with resultant loss to the country as a whole.  While Dublin grows and spreads, rural Ireland is becoming a wilderness.  I pay tribute to the fact that certain economies in the personnel were effected; but whereas there have been economies in some sections of the Department, I notice that there has been a slight increase in other sections.  In establishment, for instance, we have had, since last year, the addition of one assistant principal and one additional staff officer.  There is to be an increase in staff in one of the accounts branches.  We should like very much to know from the Minister why this has been found necessary, with all the labour saving devices we have in accounts offices, such as adding machines and other machines that do not come to my mind at the moment.  In the first case I mentioned, the salary is very big.  Coming down to the lower staff, there could be economies in the messenger service.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject&mdash;I do not know if the Minister's approach would be sympathetic&mdash;I should like to deal with the Old I.R.A. men employed in the service.  I mentioned this in connection with another Vote.  To them, more than to any other group, we owe the fact that we are speaking here in Tigh Laighean to-day.  Their endeavours and sacrifices have put us here. Their reward is very small.  They are non-pensionable, being employed generally <Col N="737" /> as messengers and cleaners.  I want to make a plea, that as long as they are able to work, irrespective of their age, they be kept on as messengers and cleaners.  I know there are certain former members of Cumann na mBan employed in the Minister's Department even though they have passed the age limit.  I know the Minister has done the right thing there.  I want the same thing done about the Old I.R.A. men.  As long as they are able to do any work, even if they are over 70, I should like to see them kept on.  There can be economies in the messenger service because their places need not be filled when they fall vacant.  I hope the same attitude to Old I.R.A. men will apply in every other Department.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point.  I want to know from the Minister what progress has been made in the building of labour exchanges.  The centres that come to my mind are Ballina, Tralee and Westport.  I think we are all agreed that it is very necessary to have a central employment exchange and not to have the individual who wants to sign or draw benefits going from Billy to Jack, as applies in Westport. In Westport recipients of social benefits would need to be athletes to get to all the places.  One office was on the quays, another was up on a mountain top and the other was in a valley.  That was the worst case I met during my time.  Certainly the people were not getting a proper service there.  I do not believe in having ramshackle places, or a glorified Aras Mhic Dhiarmada, in country centres but neither do I want holes in the wall.  We should have proper exchanges everywhere.  These exchanges give the people the greatest service and consequently we should have places worthy of the name.</P>
    <P>At one time the Department hoped they would be responsible for the building of these exchanges and for the carrying out of the architectural planning.  That, however, was passed back to the Department of Finance and we all know the bottleneck there is there.  At the same time, the Minister should press on for the building of exchanges in all the important centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> In his introductory statement the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Employers and workers contribute substantially to the fund from which insurance benefits are paid and I think it is a matter of much importance that where possible our Social Welfare Schemes should be on a contributory basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is the workers' and the employers' money that is being administered and it should be in the workers' interest and in the interest of all citizens that there should be no abuses in dealing with that money.  There should be a civic spirit created against abuses of the fund.  Over the years there has been negligence in the certification of illness.  Certificates for illness were given out automatically in many cases without an examination.  That did not occur in the majorty of cases but in a sufficient number of cases to lead to abuse.  We have had cases of men signing in the emploment exchanges and going to work afterwards with the full collusion, in many cases, of their employers.</P>
    <P>Most of these cases are due to a bit of &ldquo;smart aleckism&rdquo;.  Every one of us should combine to put an end to these abuses.  Sometimes it is impossible to get a man at a particular hour, occasionally at a busy time like harvest, until he had first signed at the labour exchange.  Every Deputy knows that happens.  If this country is to progress and if we are to build up an Irish nation worthy of the name we must turn our faces against that.  We do not grudge the workers the benefits they are getting; we do not grudge them the increases they will get next September or even better but the continuation of these benefits and of a good social welfare code depends on the citizens, workers and employees, setting their faces against abuses such as I have mentioned.  I raise that point on the Minister's statement, that this fund is an employers' and a workers' fund.</P>
    <P>I have said enough on that matter. Everybody has a pet theory of his own. My pet approach to the question of labour exchanges has been that they should be as near as possible to the <Col N="739" /> other public buildings in the town. That applies to Athlone where you have the post office, the Garda station and, in fact, all the municipal buildings grouped together.  The citizens can get a better service in that way. Not only the men and women coming into the town but the lay-out of the town itself benefits from such a scheme.</P>
    <P>There are Votes here for footwear and other things like firewood.  I think it is high time we examined this question afresh.  I wonder would I be transgressing on the rules if I advocated that, in consideration of an improvement of future social benefits, we would consider the abolition of such grants and give them in some other form such as increased children's allowances?  In relation to old age pensions, I should like to see when a man or woman reaches 80 years of age, the old age pension increased by 50 per cent. and, if they go beyond 90, it should be doubled.  They become more and more of a burden on the home as they grow older.  The tendency is to put them into the county home or, worse still, the mental hospital.</P>
    <P>Whatever way this generation is developing, people are regarded as respectable when a member of the family is sworn in as mad to the mental hospital but they are disgraced when he goes into the county home where he will be with normal people. The possibility of giving increased benefits to people when they reach 80 and 90 years of age would perhaps do away with that and it should be considered in the future.  I was at a consultative council on Monday and I am very glad that the Minister for Health has agreed to give a medical card to old age pensioners who are in full benefit.  It should be given to every one of them whether they are in full benefit or not, because it might obviate the tendency to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>That is the only contribution I can make to the concise statement of the Minister on this Estimate.  On the whole, the cost of administration is not very high but in face of the existing <Col N="740" /> economic situation the drive for economy should be carried on by him as well as by other Ministers.  When you cease to have that drive the human tendency to open the gates to increased staff arises again, and then comes the flood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absent for the Minister's statement and perhaps the answers to some of the points I wish to raise have already been given.  The people who set about the establishment of this State had as one of their aims social justice for all our people and from the time the State was founded various Acts have been introduced. Widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances, unemployment assistance and the other social welfare Acts have all tended towards fulfilling the promise made in the Proclamation of 1916.</P>
      <P>For many years I was interested in the co-ordination of the various social welfare activities, national health insurance, unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance.  The 1932 Act, to a great extent, has made that effective but there are still some threads to be tied up.  I happen to be a home assistance officer and wish to make an appeal to the Minister to devote some of his attention to eliminating the overlapping that occurs between different departments.  I hope the time has come when a special effort will be made to recruit highly trained officers qualified in the social sciences.  One of the desires expressed by various Governments was to wipe out the stigma of the old poor relief system and that to a certain extent has been successful.  The old title of relieving officer has been changed to home assistance officer and the substitution of cash payments for food or food vouchers has been brought about. I would ask the Minister to proceed on the same lines during the coming year and see that a proper scheme is put forward for the recruitment of the very best types into the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to old age pensioners, I think when the Minister introduced the temporary provisions for the old age pensioners at Christmas he had in <Col N="741" /> mind that this year he would be in a position to introduce increases in the pension.  I do not know whether the Minister has that still in view but, if not, I would press very strongly that the old age pension of 24/- a week would be further increased or at least that some amelioration should be given to these pensioners.</P>
    <P>While the increase in unemployment benefit is welcomed by every Deputy&mdash; it is certainly an advance on the position last year&mdash;it exaggerates the difference between old age pension and unemployment assistance recipients.  Is it the Minister's intention in the immediate future to increase the rates of unemployment assistance?  As the Minister is aware, in very many cases those in receipt of unemployment assistance are forced to have recourse to the assistance officer for a supplementary allowance.  If at all possible, allowances given to people in receipt of unemployment assistance should be increased.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the attention of the Minister has been drawn to the position of old people who have been in receipt of unemployment benefit of 24/- and who from September next will be in receipt of 30/- unemployment benefit.  When they reach 70 years of age they will lose on the transaction and the position will be worsened for a married man whose wife is also over 70 years of age.  As he has been in receipt of unemployment benefit for his wife, he will lose much more than if he had been single.  I would ask the Minister what proposals he intends to put forward to cover such cases.  The same thing applies in respect of persons who are in receipt of pensions from C.I.E. and similar organisations. When they reach 70 years of age they also will lose.  I should also like to refer to the position of widows who are in receipt of unemployment benefit under the Social Welfare Act.  They are allowed a rate of only 12/- unemployment benefit or 12/- national health insurance.  Those people should be given this benefit at once.  It means that a married woman who becomes unemployed will be eligible to receive 18/- unemployment benefit whereas a widow <Col N="742" /> on the widow's pension will receive only 12/-.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to make some statement on the position as regards the Richmond Institute for the Blind&mdash;whether he intends to see that the corporation takes over control of that institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy mentioned the provision of labour exchanges in certain parts of the country.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, in both Finglas and Ballyfermot, people have to travel very long distances to go to the labour exchanges at Werburgh Street and Gardiner Street, at a cost of something like 6/- or 7/- out of their unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I take the opportunity to thank the officials of the Department. I have heard complaints in this House as to delay in dealing with cases, but I must say that my experience of dealing with the officials of the Department in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada has been very good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should keep in mind the difference there is between conditions in this country and conditions in Britain, especially when he has any proposals for the benefit of social welfare classes here.  In this country, we have a small number of insured workers in comparison with our population, and a large number of self-employed persons and of very small farmers, with the result that the recent Social Welfare Bill does not cater for a very large section of our people.  Any benefits which were given in the recent Bill&mdash; and I do agree that those benefits under present conditions were necessary, and that even further benefits are still necessary&mdash;were given solely to insured workers.  That is a change in policy.  Up to now, when it was felt that further increases were required, as a result, say, of an increase in the cost of living, such increases were given all round, to all persons who were receiving payments from the Department of Social Welfare.  This is a change which is modelled on the British system, and which caters only <Col N="743" /> for a very small section of our people, the insured workers.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefit at a higher rate is needed, but unemployment assistance at a higher rate is also needed.  Contributory pensions, that is, pensions for insured persons or the widows of insured persons were increased, and that increase was desirable; but non-contributory widows' pensions also require increases, and the same applies all round.  I think that in a country like this the Minister is going along a road which is not for the benefit of the majority of the people who are in receipt of payments from his Department, and it is a move with which I do not agree.</P>
      <P>I am very much more against it for this reason, that recently there seems to be in operation an all-out drive to reduce the number in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Having gone into the thing fully, I deliberately say that a drive is on foot to get as many people as possible off the unemployment assistance register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>On last Saturday, there were 6,000 fewer working than at the same time last year.  In other words, there were 6,000 more unemployed; and that has been the position for the last few weeks.  If there have been reductions in the number of unemployed, it is due, I think, to a drive that is afoot to get very many people off.  It had been the practice that, where there was a small mountain farm of, say, around £5 valuation <Col N="744" /> and the owner was living there with his son who was married and perhaps sometimes working on the road when such work could be got, and perhaps also with a small plot of potatoes and so on, he found that he did not have enough insurance contributions to qualify for benefit and had to fall back for a large period of the year on unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>What is happening now?  Every one of those cases is being investigated or re-investigated.  Social Welfare officers are going out, and if they find a married son on a farm of that type, the full benefit of that farm is put against that person and he is immediately swept off the unemployment assistance register.  That is happening, and I think it is happening deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am protesting against it.  Some people whom I know who have been during the winter months and other slack times drawing unemployment assistance because of the fact that work was not available in the locality, and who have been doing that for years, are now being deliberately cut off.  Investigations are taking place, and in every case where such an investigation has taken place, these married men who have no property of their own and who are living on a small patch of a farm in the congested areas, are being cut off from all benefit. I recommend to the Minister that that is a field where some intervention on his part is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While agreeing that he has improved the lot of the insured worker, there are numbers of part-time workers, who have never been insured or who have been insured only for such a short period that they do not qualify for unemployment benefit, who suffer all the time.  That is something to which I object.  The situation is different from that which exists in an industrialised country where there is full employment. The non-insured worker, the unemployment assistance recipient, the old age pensioner and the non-contributory widow are all entitled to increases.  No increase has been given despite the fact that the cost of living has increased. <Col N="745" /> The Minister mentioned a figure of a 25 per cent. increase in benefits to insured workers.  A similar increase should be given in the benefits of non-insured persons who are social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In connection with old age pensions, what happens in the case of a small farmer is that he has a son, or perhaps two sons, working his farm.  The farm is under £30 valuation.  Where the farmer does not want to transfer the farm, as he is allowed to do by the Department, the deduction from gross income is calculated in a manner with which I entirely disagree.  Remember, the farmer does not do any work himself. He employs his son, or perhaps two sons, to do the work for him. When he applies for the old age pension the deduction is entirely too small.  If he employed a farm labourer instead of his own family he would be entitled to a deduction in gross income commensurate with the rate of wages paid over the year to that agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>I know one case in which an old age pension applicant was only allowed a deduction of £30 in respect of his son, even though that son was in full-time employment with his father.  Again, I came across a case in which no deduction was made in relation to a boy of 16.  The boy was supposed to be working free for his father, but that boy had to get certain expenses out of the gross income of the farm.  He had to have his board and lodging and pocket money for pictures and cigarettes.  The county council allows an abatement of rates in relation to a son employed on a farm when that son is 16 years of age, or over.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to raise is in connection with branch managers of employment exchanges.  In some cases these people have to provide their own premises.  As the Minister knows, the cost of running such an office has gone up considerably.  The branch manager has to provide heating, light and other facilities.  The cost of these has increased steeply over the last two years.  He has to employ staff, and wages have gone up.  He must carry out repairs and supply furniture.  The <Col N="746" /> cost of furniture and repairs has gone up.  There has, however, been very little increase granted to these people. They are the officers of the Department who have benefited least as a result of wage increases.  If the Minister looks at the records in the Department he will see that in some cases these managers are in receipt of as little as £3 per week.  He should look into that matter and have it remedied.</P>

      <P>The Deputy expressed himself as being greatly perturbed at the number of people who are being deprived of unemployment assistance in his county.  Certainly that is the inference I drew from his remarks.  I will regard it as an improvement when the Minister and the Government bring about a situation in which no one will be in need of unemployment assistance.  Unemployment assistance is the last resort for any man or woman.  It is the clearly laid down policy of the Labour Party and of other Parties, or some of them at any rate, that we must aim at reaching a stage in which unemployment assistance will be a thing of the past.  Deputy Cunningham knows just as well as every other Deputy that unemployment assistance is, at best, a palliative and is, to some extent, demoralising.  It was introduced because of exceptional circumstances; there was mass unemployment and some pittance had to be provided for those who could not take out any type of livelihood for themselves.  It is, as I said, a last resort.  I hope that when the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare comes up for discussion next year Deputy Cunningham will have even more cause for complaint because of a still further reduction in the numbers drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <P>In what way? In relation to those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability benefit and so on, we must all appreciate the work that has been done by the present Minister.  He has indeed been most mindful, since he took office, of those sections of our community.  Those who oppose him, like those who are favourably disposed towards him, must admit that he has done everything possible to cater for these people.  He has given us several instances of that. Deputy Cunningham referred to the recent one increasing the benefits for the contributory widows and those in receipt of disability and unemployment benefit by 25 per cent.  I do not believe any Minister or any Government could do more than that at the present time.  We all like to hear of these benefits, particularly old age pension and widows' and orphans' benefits, being increased.  However, Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party must bear in mind that, during their 20 years of office, they did not give much thought to the people in receipt of any of these benefits.</P>

      <P>Now that Fianna Fáil are out of office they suddenly become very conscious of the plight of the people in question.  The policy of Fianna Fáil to get those people to apply for home assistance allowances to supplement their inadequate old age pension allowance is not now with us.  During the two terms of office of this Government, from 1948 to 1951, and from 1954 until the present time, it has been clearly indicated that they are much more mindful of the needs of the old age pensioners than Fianna Fáil.  For that reason, I cannot understand why the present Opposition complain of the plight of these people seeing that they had an opportunity over a very long period to do something themselves for them and that they failed to do so and, as a matter of fact, completely ignored them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My main reason for intervening in this debate is to mention a few items about which I am not quite satisfied.  I should like some clarification as to the means test for old age and widows' and orphans' pensions. I know there is necessity for a means test and that it is the duty of the officers of the Department to do their utmost to administer the law as they find it, that is, the officers in Store Street, Dublin, or the social welfare officers down the country.  At the same time, I am not satisfied with the manner in which many of these claims are dealt with.  I feel that some social welfare officers deal too rigidly with applications and, unfortunately, whatever decision they come to is usually upheld in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind cases somewhat similar to one mentioned by the previous speaker.  If a farmer of £10, £12 or £20 valuation, or less than £30 valuation, applies for a pension and, due to some domestic circumstances whereby he may not be able to assign his farm to a particular member of his family, difficulties immediately arise in regard to his application.  You will find a number of instances of three or four members of a family between 30 and 40 years of age living on the same holding.  As Deputy Cunningham pointed out, the applicant himself may <Col N="750" /> be an invalid and incapable of earning any income.  The pension officer comes along and states that the income from his farm precludes him from earning any pension.</P>
    <P>Surely, if a farmer has two sons working for him on the farm, he should be allowed the minimum agricultural rate for the work of his two sons.  Any farmer who at the present time employs a man and does not pay the minimum rate of wages set out by the Agricultural Wages Board is liable to prosecution.  If there is an obligation on a farmer to pay an employed person a fixed rate of wages there is a similar obligation on him to pay or at least set aside a similar rate for members of his own family.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this country too many farmers' sons and particularly the type of farmers' sons I have referred to&mdash;small farmers' sons who are more or less self-employed on their own holdings&mdash;are not getting any consideration at all.  Apparently the social welfare officers think these people should work for nothing.  The Minister may say that to allow for two men on a particular farm would be too much and that probably instead of requiring two men to work a particular place one member of the family could do it.  I want to inform the Minister that many small farmers such as I have mentioned and such as Deputy Cunningham mentioned of less than £30 valuation cannot, for reasons outside their control, assign their farms to a particular member of the family.  These people are very dissatisfied with the rigid manner in which the means test is applied in regard to their applications.  I feel it would be well if the Minister would discuss that particular question with some of his senior officers with a view to giving some more definite instructions to social welfare officers as regards the handling of such applications.</P>
    <P>I have met a number of these cases in the past year.  Consider the position of a farmer with three or four sons living with him and with possibly one or two working on the holding and one or two others earning.  Between them, they have accumulated, say, between £600 and £900.  I do not know whether <Col N="751" /> this applies to other parts of the country but in West Cork the earnings of the family are usually deposited in the bank or post office in the name of the father or mother although this money, which is nominally the property of the father or mother as the case may be, is actually the property of the family.  It was got through the earnings of the family and handed into a common purse, which is usually deposited in the bank.  It is no use telling that story to a social welfare officer.  He will charge to the full any money held by the father or mother although it can be clearly proved that it was not as a result of their earnings.  There is also the case of the applicant for the old age pension whose valuation exceeds £30 and who, some time prior to applying for the pension, transfers any money which he has to a member of his family. Irrespective of the age of that member, the pension officers never accept such a transfer.  It is always held that the transfer was made purely for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>I am quite conversant with the position which obtains in West Cork.  It is quite usual, when people reach the age of 70, for them to transfer their money and share it out between the members of their family.  The Department of Social Welfare never accepts that view and more or less implies that these applicants are dishonest and that their statements that they have transferred the money are false.  I think the Minister should not agree to these recommendations from his officers down the country because the bulk of these applicants are honest and genuine.  If the Department of Social Welfare had a more reasonable and sane approach to the matter, and had more faith in these old people and in what they say, matters would be much more satisfactory in relation to the investigation of the means of old age pension applicants.</P>
    <P>Farmers who have worked all their lives, often under difficult conditions, are quite entitled, when they reach the age of 70, to take things easy and to draw some allowance, and the old age pension is meagre enough.  We <Col N="752" /> must bear in mind other sections of the community who do not have to wait until they are 70 to avail of retirement allowances.  It is not 24/- a week they get but several times that sum plus a nice gratuity.  I cannot see why we should have such a narrow approach in our dealings with these self-employed people who have contributed as much, in their own way, to the welfare of the State, as anybody else.  That system existed before the present Minister came into office.  I am hoping that something will be done for these people with £16 and £17 valuation who can not have very much.  I have seen farmers with a land valuation of £8 and £9 rejected for a pension.  All I can say is that the appeals officer must know nothing about farming.</P>

      <P>On this particular question I endeavoured to elicit some information from the Department relative to the activities of the appeals officer but unfortunately such information was not available.  In recent years the tendency on the part of the appeals officer, so far as my knowledge goes, is to leave things as they are. Seldom or never does he make any change in any appeal submitted to him. That is a change.  Previous appeals officers had not got that point of view. They examined closely and carefully every appeal which came before them, irrespective of what the local officer recommended.</P>

      <P>I submit that the percentage of cases changed was negligible.  We have dealt with the applications of farming people and now <Col N="753" /> I would like to deal with shopkeepers who have a somewhat similar, if stronger, grievance.  I include publicans in that category.  In the case of a small shopkeeper, a widow, applying for a pension, the appeals officer obtains from her supplier the amount of goods which she purchased during the previous year and he assesses her with a net income of 12½ per cent. of that amount.  I am completely against that assessment of the total turnover and it is unfair to charge it against the applicant. I believe no shopkeeper, particularly the smaller type grocer, selling cigarettes, bread, tea, etc., would make 12½ per cent. net profit.  However, that is the regulation that is laid down by the Department of Social Welfare.  Publicans do not fare so well.  The estimated profit of a publican is 20 per cent. of his turnover.  I think the Minister should have that position reviewed. Publicans in a big way of business in Dublin or Cork may make that profit; I am not sufficiently conversant with the position to know whether they do or not.  But I do know that publicans in provincial towns and rural districts do not make a 20 per cent. profit on turnover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case that the publican in a provincial town or village, who has to stand behind the counter all day, may not sell even ten pints.  The Minister should review the 20 per cent. assessed on publicans on turnover and the 12½ per cent. in the case of grocers and shopkeepers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section of the community in respect of whom there is a complaint which it may not be easy to remedy within the present framework. They are the wives of workers who happen to be older than their husbands.  If the wife applies for a pension while her husband is still in employment and earning over £4 a week, she gets no pension.  It is very difficult to explain the position to such people.  I cannot suggest any remedy, but the Minister should review the position.  It arises only in cases where wives are older than their husbands <Col N="754" /> and the number would not be very big. The Minister should devise some way of getting over the difficulty because some of these women receive very little out of their husbands' earnings.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Minister and the Government are doing everything they possibly can for the sections of the people covered by social welfare legislation.  I hope that the grievances I have mentioned in regard to the enforcement of the means test and in regard to the estimate of net profits of shopkeepers and publicans will be reviewed by the Minister.  I trust that he will be able to devise some means whereby the means test will not be enforced by his officers down the country in the rigid manner in which it is at present operated.  I conclude by wishing the Minister every success in his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, at least, is to be congratulated on making progress under the heading of social welfare since he took office.  The fact that he has not made spectacular strides in that direction is proof that there are certain limitations to the rate at which social services may be expanded and I am sure the Minister now realises that the expansion of social services which he advocated when he was on this side of the House is not easy of accomplishment.  In a country like this, which has a huge unemployment problem, an emigration problem, a declining population, we must of necessity set limits to the amount we put aside for those who are fortunate enough to be at present in employment.  Other problems, such as the provision of employment for those who are unemployed, the creation of extra jobs per year, should take precedence over any social welfare scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things that remain to be done but, since 1932, the strides made in the field of social services are very creditable indeed.  While I congratulate the Minister on any improvements which he has effected in his time, it is only right to point out, particularly in relation to a statement made by Deputy Murphy, that Fianna Fáil have to their credit the provision <Col N="755" /> of the major portion of all the social benefits available to the people.  If I understood Deputy Murphy correctly, he said that Fianna Fáil had done nothing in the way of social welfare. He probably did not mean it that way, but I think the statement, as recorded in the Official Report, will have that meaning.  That was the only inference I could draw from it.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the list of social services now available, it immediately occurs to me that Fianna Fáil were the sole architects of most of our important legislation in respect of social services.  I have to name only a few: unemployment benefit, disability benefit, as recently included in the Health Act, widows' contributory pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions, orphans' contributory pensions and orphans' non-contributory pensions, not to talk of various expansions of existing services which were implemented by a paltry sum up to the time that the Fianna Fáil Government first set out to expand social services.  The building trade workers' special insurance, the emergency fuel scheme and practically every worthwhile piece of social legislation that has been enacted in this country were brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government at some time or other.</P>
    <P>In those days, members of the Labour Party accused us of not moving fast enough in that direction.  I am sure the present Minister now realises that certain limitations must be set even to the very desirable work which remains to be done in the field of social services.</P>
    <P>I want to get from the general to some particular points.  I agree with the points made by Deputy Murphy in relation to difficulties placed in the way of people who seek these benefits. When civil servants are designing a questionnaire which must be filled in by applicants for any benefit, it seems to me they have in mind the biggest crooks that could be envisaged.  That may be understandable if the idea is that the form will be foolproof, but it seems to me that the trouble involved in the unnecessary red tape could be obviated by having a little more laxity, <Col N="756" /> even at the risk of exploitation by a few.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I have ever met a person in this country who fully understands the qualifying conditions for unemployment benefit.  The leaflets issued in respect of that matter are not very helpful.  I suggest that the Department should issue a simple booklet in concise form explaining in simple terms the conditions and the qualifications for this benefit.  There is the benefit year and there is the contribution year, and these vary.  The contribution year and the benefit year in respect of females is different from the corresponding periods in respect of males, with the result that many people are not fully aware of when or how they may qualify for unemployment benefit.  There are also exceptions with regard to new entrants and sometimes a new entrant qualifies with fewer contributions than an existing contributor, leaving people working in the same job not understanding why this should be because there are special conditions related to it.  That time has been extended time and again, but I do not know if the Minister has sought to clarify the position with regard to new entrants.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, if possible, to simplify the code in relation to unemployment benefit generally.  If he does so it will be a great help to the people concerned.  If it is not to be simplified, perhaps the qualifying conditions could be set out in simple form in an explanatory pamphlet.  This would save Deputies a great deal of trouble in explaining what are the conditions prevailing in each case.</P>
    <P>In the case of unemployment assistance, I am not going to accuse the Minister of taking any particular action, but the handling of cases at the moment would seem to indicate that there is a move on foot to completely cut out all unemployment assistance. Investigation officers sent out by the Minister's Department will come down on applicants time and again, reinvestigating cases without notice, and the result of the visit of the investigating officer inevitably is the discontinuation of the assistance, or a drastic <Col N="757" /> reduction in the amount.  I do not know if that is part of a campaign to put an end to unemployment assistance or to effect economies and save money at the expense of these unfortunate people who have to go on the dole.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch with the Department over the past few months about a case which I will refer to by way of example.  There was a single man in receipt of 12/- a week unemployment assistance who lived in a labourer's cottage.  He got married, but he had been employed as a fisherman for some time before he got married. When he got married, his unemployment assistance was increased to £1 per week, but after two weeks the invesigation officer came along and asked him how much he had earned for the time he was fishing salmon.  The man replied that he had earned £30, but the investigation officer added £6 to that, making it £36, and the result was that his unemployment assistance was reduced to 7/- a week.  This man is living in a rented house; he does not own a stick or stone, and yet he has to live on 7/- a week, just because this time last year he earned £30 in a small boat fishing salmon.</P>
    <P>A county council worker who resumes work and is knocked off work intermittently has no reduction made in his unemployment assistance.  Anybody who knows anything about the life of a fisherman on the Donegal coast knows that he goes out at five in the morning and works until six in the evening, and may have nothing for his week's work.  He may earn a few pounds the next week.  After working for three months, this man earned £36 and now he and his wife are expected to live on 7/- a week.  I have taken this case up with the Department but the appeals officer has upheld the verdict of the investigation officer.  I am sure that this is only one of hundreds of cases of the same kind of people who are being victimised completely by these investigations.  I submit that that is part of a campaign to effect economies at the expense of the most deserving section of people in this country.  If that is so, it is a shame.</P>
    <P>In every debate on this Estimate, the same old plea is made in respect of <Col N="758" /> pensions for the blind.  I think it is no harm to make it again this year, in the hope that some time or other it will not fall on deaf ears.  The general complaint which I am going to make is in regard to embroidery workers.  I think the condition under which one may qualify for a blind pension is that one is unfit to carry on one's usual occupation by reason of impaired eyesight. Embroidery workers are not given the benefit of that regulation, despite the fact that, in many cottages in the congested districts, embroidery work is the main source of livelihood.</P>
    <P>When the woman of the house is no longer able to carry on her embroidery work as a result of defective eyesight, she naturally makes application for the blind pension and inevitably she is turned down just because it is felt that her eyesight is sufficiently good to enable her to carry on her household duties.  That means that some of her family, at an early age, have to set off for England to earn a livelihood and to keep the home.  Embroidery workers should be accepted, as embroidery is their principal means of livelihood. The benefit of the doubt should be given in such cases.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to devote some attention to the question of employment exchange offices.  In many cases, the local offices are not suitable buildings.  I understand that the onus is on the branch manager to secure suitable premises, but I think it is time the Department stepped in, because these offices have come to stay.  They are no longer buildings which are in temporary use and which, one day, will not be required.  These branch offices for the administration of unemployment assistance have come to stay, and in many cases they are not suitable.  It is not fair to expect the branch manager, in a town where housing conditions are difficult, to be able to obtain suitable accommodation. The Minister should step in and give a helping hand.  If suitable accommodation is not available, suitable buildings should be erected. Deputy Kennedy had in mind the <i>Hotel de Ville</i> type of building.  He hoped to have erected in each town, where such offices were located a building <Col N="759" /> which would cover all the different offices in relation to local administration in the area where he would house the assistant county surveyor, the superintendent of the Guards, the investigation officer attached to pensions investigations, the branch manager of the exchange and the agent of what used to be known as the national health insurance.  Any such offices in relation to local administration could be housed in one suitable building where people could call and be attended to conveniently instead of having them scattered around the back streets in different parts of the town where they are sometimes not so easily accessible.  It would be a grand scheme.  It would also contribute its quota towards taking some of the people out of the queue outside the employment exchange.</P>
    <P>Some speakers mentioned the question of increased remuneration for managers in branch offices.  I did not think it would be necessary to stress that point to the present Minister because he is a sensible man and must realise that the branch managers on their present rate are unable to carry on.  Sometimes the job is not worth the candle to the manager of a branch employment office.  The rate is governed by the numbers registered as unemployed and certain offices may work out much more satisfactorily than others. I know that there are certain offices in which the job of branch manager is not worth bothering about at certain times of the year.  I think it is only fair that the position should be examined with a view to bringing about the necessary adjustment.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Murphy, and while nobody in this House would like to prevent the people who are already in permanent employment getting all the benefits to which they are entitled as Christians and workers, at the same time the Department of Social Welfare should not be lopsided in so far as city employment is concerned.  There is a great deal of talk in this country at the moment regarding the lack of amenities and attractions for the people who live in the rural areas.  The <Col N="760" /> depopulation of these areas, as a result very often of social as well as economic conditions, is one of the major problems confronting the country at the present time.  It is one that has been accelerated, unfortunately, in the past few years.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Social Welfare are going to have a bias towards the city worker, I think that is not a move in the right direction.  We are not spending all the money we would like to spend on social welfare.  There must be certain limitations in a country where the resources are meagre and unemployment is rife, but if we are to lean in a particular direction we should lean towards the worker in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Time and again I hear people say that unemployment assistance was the curse of this country because it created lazy men, corner boys and what not, but at the same time I have seen many families who could not have existed were it not for that particular social benefit.  Until we are in a position to say to each person: &ldquo;There is a job available for you within reasonable distance of your own home,&rdquo; the onus is upon us to provide for those people the necessary pittance.  There are people who abuse the scheme but then what scheme is not abused in this country or in any other country for that matter?  It is not the great drain on the resources of this country which some people think it is.</P>
    <P>Immediately the people get that money it goes in to the grocer, the butcher and the baker before Saturday night and helps to stimulate the circulation and distribution of goods. It is one of the principal things which keep a few shillings circulating in some of the rural towns.  The money is not quite so ill-spent as some people would like to indicate it is.  There are occasions when people could not exist were it not for the fact that that pittance is available to them.  I think those people should not be treated in the way they are very often treated.  They are useful members of the community who would, if work were available to them, contribute their quote to production in the country.  That is proved by the fact <Col N="761" /> that whenever any bit of employment becomes available you have literally hundreds of them looking for the few jobs that may be vacant.</P>
    <P>So far as Donegal and other congested counties are concerned, the Department has got sufficient easing off in these payments by the increased emigration over the past two years. That may not be relevant under this Estimate but suffice it to say that until something is done and done quickly there will not be many signing for unemployment assistance in some of the western counties in the course of the year.  The Minister for Social Welfare cannot do much in that direction.  Our primary task should be to improve the conditions under which the people live, give them employment and endeavour to create the necessary work.  Then social conditions would be improved much more easily and in those circumstances much more money would be placed at the Minister's disposal in order to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to pay attention to the few things I mentioned, particularly my reference to unemployment assistance and to embroidery workers who apply for a blind pension.  I support Deputy Murphy in his reference to old age pension applicants.  We all know the case made so frequently in this House where the old man, who has been a hard worker all his life, fails to qualify for an old age pension because he has been a thrifty, hard-working and generally useful citizen but the man who has not been just so thrifty, the improvident type, who did not work so hard and did not accumulate any of the world's comforts or wealth, finds it very simple to qualify for a pension when he reaches the age.</P>
    <P>So far as the means test operates in regard to old age pensions, it sets a premium on improvidence.  It might not be fair to describe it that way but when any of us sit down on a subcommittee of an old age pension body he realises the difficulty in getting certain people qualified for that weekly payment, people who all their lives have devoted their best years, in <Col N="762" /> toil and sweat, to producing for this country.</P>
    <P>I refer to the farmer who manages to build a reasonably good home and brings up a family who may support him and give him reasonable comfort in later years.  That is held against him in the means test when he applies for the few shillings in respect of the old age pension.  It is not right but I suppose the statutory limit must be drawn somewhere.  We may go on raising it time after time but there is a lot to be said in regard to advocating the complete abolition of the means test for, while you would give pensions to a number of people who could reasonably do without them, at the same time you would cut out all the inequity which results from the present system of means test.  You would also save the cost.  We would be saving the cost of a very big staff of investigation officers.  I wonder if the means test were abolished whether the Exchequer would stand to lose anything in the end?</P>
    <P>We have a happy knack in this country of recruiting a few thousand civil servants and we hardly ever get rid of any of them again.  We never hear of a pay-off in that quarter although we hear of pays-off in every other direction.  It might be possible if we did cut out the means test in regard to old age pensions so to arrange matters that, as the existing staff reached retiring age and no other men were taken in, the young men would find work replacing those now down in &ldquo;the glass house&rdquo; and we would have effected sufficient economy to offset any extra expense which might be incurred as a result of the abolition of the means test.  I would be all for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice of many of us when we take part in debates here not only to pick out the good points in the administration of a particular Department during the past year but also to point out some of the things with which we do not agree and those which we feel should be amended with advantage to all concerned.  I understand an increase has been given in insured workers' benefits and, beginning with that, I would like to <Col N="763" /> ask the Minister if it was because of the decrease in the real value of the allowances which had been paid in the past, due to the increasing cost of living, that it was decided that these benefits should be increased?  If that is so&mdash;and, I take it, that is mainly the reason for the increases&mdash;why is it that non-contributory allowances or pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, blind and old age pensions have not been brought into line?  If increases in benefits are justified in the case of those people who are mostly able to work to earn their own livelihood when they meet with unemployment or sickness, surely like increases would not be out of place for their less fortunate brethren who are either blind, or infirm as a result of age, or who are orphaned or widowed or unemployed?</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister&mdash;I am sure he has looked into it already&mdash;to bring these people into line.  Surely they are in a much worse position than insured workers who, generally speaking, are working most of the year and working every year.</P>
      <P>In regard to allowances paid to the less fortunate members of the community, I join with Deputy Brennan and others who have spoken here in asking the Minister very seriously has any directive been given to the social welfare officers throughout the country, or have they been given any line of procedure which it was indicated they should adopt causing them to tighten up their investigations in the assessment of income in connection with those allowances, the non-contributory allowances generally?  I feel, as far as my experience goes in County Donegal, that there has been a definite tightening up of the investigations where social welfare officers are concerned in regard to the means of applicants for old age pensions, non-contributory allowances and for non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions, and particularly in regard to applicants for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can cite cases that I have raised with the Department.  Some of these have been remedied on appeal to the Department, but I have experience of quite a few cases in connection with <Col N="764" /> unemployment assistance and in connection with pensions also, where, despite the increase in the cost of living over the past year, people whose means have in no way improved over the last two years, are being assessed since then with greater family or household income than they were assessed with two years ago.  The result is that the pensions or allowances now paid to them are reduced.  If their income has not improved it means they are no better off than they were two years ago, and certainly there is no case whatever for a reduction in the allowances that had been paid under any of these headings. Yet such is the case, and this is happening because of some arrangement made.  I am sure it is because of similar experience that other speakers have already raised the question as to whether welfare officers throughout the country have been inspired from some quarter or other to tighten up on this matter.  As we can see, there is no question but that there would be some small saving in the national Exchequer in this procedure but it would be a saving taken from the very people who can least afford to have anything taken from them.</P>
    <P>As has already been said, workers in rural Ireland are surely in a sorry plight.  While it is true that unemployment is now rife in rural Ireland, that emigration is continuing and that the congested districts in particular are being denuded of their entire population&mdash;in view of these things and in view of the saving that that emigration has made possible, in so far as unemployment assistance is concerned, surely those who still remain should at least be dealt with as fairly as they were dealt with a year or two ago. There certainly should be no question whatever in days of an ever-rising cost of living of these people having their pensions reduced.  But that is happening. I am quite sure that the Minister, while he may not be a party to this type of discrimination in regard to these people who are least well off in the community, cannot at the same time be unaware that these things are going on.  I would appeal to him to try to effect in regard to those I have mentioned what he has succeeded in doing for the insured workers.  Instead <Col N="765" /> of reducing the allowances, as is happening in many cases at the present time, he should give these people an increase also, because they must need it even more than their insured brethren.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to bring to the Minister's notice in relation to some workers who are insured or who are in insurable employment. When these workers become sick and go on sick benefit, this benefit, as I understand it, can be paid only for a period of six months.  If the worker has not got 156 contributions paid up under the regulations, apparently, after six months the benefit will cease.  In such a case the benefit may be restored should the sick person put on a further 13 stamps.  If that is done that person will qualify for benefit for a further six months, and so on.  If the person is too ill to work at all, so ill that in fact he is paid six months' benefit under the insurance scheme, and if at the end of six months he is still as ill or possibly worse, how is he supposed to get work for 13 weeks in order to qualify himself again for a further period of six months' benefit?  That is asking the impossible and it cannot, therefore, be done.</P>
    <P>There is one case I know of at the moment which was with the Department on appeal but was thrown out. It is the case of a man who is still getting no benefit after the expiration of the six months.  He cannot possibly put on another 13 stamps because he is unfit to do anything for himself at the moment and he has no means whatever. Nobody knows what is to happen to him in the future, and the fact that this situation exists certainly is not helping him to get well.  I do not know what benefit or what kind of assistance he can get now, unless we are to put him on home assistance, which is the last possible source of aid, and it is so small that it is really only a stop-gap until something better comes along.  I feel the need is there for this Department, which is spending millions of pounds and has become a very comprehensive service, to close some of these gaps and to close them pretty quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> Another matter I should like to raise with the Minister and his Department is the question of blind pension qualifications. In regard to an application for a blind pension, is the same degree or standard applied in all cases, irrespective of the occupation of the applicants prior to their blindness? The reason I ask that is rather obvious.  A man doing rough manual work who incurs a certain degree of blindness might be able to carry on his job without any great trouble; but, on the other hand, there might be a man with the same degree of blindness whose occupation was that of a cobbler or shoemaker.  In regard to female applicants, there might be the type of applicant mentioned by Deputy Brennan&mdash;embroidery workers or girls working with very fine needles and requiring extra good eyesight.  Will the same degree or standard be applied in each and every case?  If it is, then it is quite plain that it will be unfair.  I am not sure, but I feel that such is the case at the moment, and I ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>One other matter I should like to bring to the Minister's attention is a question I raised with him previously and which, I understand, he has had under consideration.  It is the situation in which fishermen at the moment, although paying approximately 2/- per week for their insurance stamps, are not entitled to any insurance benefit when unemployed.  In addition, they are not accepted by the Department for the purpose of paying the higher rate stamp of 4/- per week, or, as it will be in the future, 4/8 per week, which would entitle them without question to unemployment benefit.  The situation seems to be that they pay for the 2/- stamp and get no value whatever for it.  Many of those with whom I have spoken&mdash;and, I am sure, many elsewhere&mdash;feel that they would get a better bargain if they were accepted for the 4/- or 4/8 stamp, with all the benefits that accompany it, rather than paying 2/- a week for a stamp which is practically useless to them.  That is the attitude I found on the west coast in my own constituency. The Minister indicated in the House that there may be more to it and that <Col N="767" /> everybody may not be of like mind on it.</P>
    <P>As far as the fishing community in my own constituency are concerned, I have discussed the matter with them in groups&mdash;and not political groups, I may add.  I have discussed it with them as fishermen, as they waited at their boats or on their piers before putting out to sea.  They would gladly accept the higher stamp, with the benefits that go with it, rather than pay 2/- for the half-rate stamp and get no benefit from it.  I am telling the Minister, for what it is worth, that that is the attitude generally of the fishermen along the west coast of my constituency, and if he can bring about a change in this regard, I feel the fishermen in that part of the country at any rate will be thankful to him and to his Department.</P>
    <P>Another matter I am interested in also concerns these same people who pay for the 2/- stamp.  What do they get for that 2/-?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything except unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that there is a number of qualifications in regard to the stamps that must be put on, the qualifying periods and so forth.  Why I ask this&mdash;I might as well as say it now before we get into any arguments about it&mdash;is that some of these same fishermen I have already mentioned found that, not only could they get no benefit, but in some cases they were refused any free medical assistance.  In fact, I know one of them has gone to a solicitor, or proposes to do so, and is taking an action against the Department to test whether or not in their circumstances, they should be entitled to service.  I do not know the ins-and-outs of that case, except that it is in the hands of a solicitor for the reasons I mention.  How many stamps were on or what period they covered, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are part-time fishermen, who fish only part of the year, because of the type of weather, the type of coast or the smallness of their boats.  They are paying out 2/- every week, but, because <Col N="768" /> of the regulations, they might as well be paying nothing.  Apparently, that is their big grievance&mdash;that they pay 2/- and, as far as they can see, get nothing for it.  In the case of those people&mdash;there may be other cases&mdash;it is quite easy to see why they would prefer to pay 4/- and get the benefits that go with it, instead of paying 2/- and getting nothing whatever, as is the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for this Department as a whole shows an increase.  Some of that increase will be justified by increased payments of benefits, but, unfortunately, like all the other Departments at present, any good that may be coming in that way is offset by the fact that we have increases in the Estimate of this Department which are brought about by increases in wages to staff and by other running costs.  Undoubtedly, these people are entitled to their increased wages and allowances, but it shows the continuing trend that is evident in all such Departments at the moment&mdash;the trend that costs are continuing to rise &mdash;and in regard to this Department, the Government are giving no better headline than they are giving in regard to any other Department.  They are not giving any lead to the public generally whom they are now asking to save more, while they themselves, as a Government, out of the public purse, continue to spend more of the people's money.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any immediate answer to that problem which I raise on this Estimate, just as I raised it on other Estimates on which I have spoken and on others on which I shall speak, as an indication of the trend of things.  While they look for savings, the very same Government are themselves, whether willingly or unwillingly, adding to this overspending that they deprecate. That is very obvious here and it is a thing that we must deplore, no matter what we may say about any other part of the Minister's speech.  Anything else the Estimate may show by way of improvement in our workers' conditions we can regard as something that is worth while and something that is an advance.  However, this increasing cost of the running expenses of the <Col N="769" /> Department is a bad thing.  Need I add my voice to those of others who have spoken in the same voice in asking the Minister, if at all possible, to examine the workings of his Department, its personnel inside the Department in Dublin and outside, with a view to trying to retrench in some manner the cost of administration?</P>
    <P>If that were done, the increases that we might justly give to non-contributory old age pensioners, to widows and orphans and by way of children's allowances, could be more easily achieved.  At the moment, however, we do not see retrenchment, only further increases.  In a service as big as this, there are so many officers and so many branches that there is a considerable waste.  There is, however, a terrible lot of duplication of work and the doing of unnecessary work.  This criticism is not given in any spirit of reflection on anybody doing a good job in the Department; it is given as my opinion of a service which, of necessity, is very complicated.  It appears to me that there is still a considerable lot of unnecessary waste that must be stopped.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to look into that aspect just as closely as into the other points which I made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister rises to reply, I should like to say that the question referred to by Deputy Blaney in regard to part-time fishermen affects us very much in South Kerry.  That matter has been referred to the Department on several occasions and I should be very glad if the Minister would now clarify the matter as to whether these people could be enabled to have the option of availing of the higer rate of insurance, and as to whether there are some legal difficulties involved.  At any rate, I hope the Minister will deal with the question as early as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don Teachta Ó Cinnéide go bhfuil an oiread suime agam in usáid na Gaeilge sa Roinn agus atá aige féin.  I am afraid I am not as fluent, to my shame, as Deputy Kennedy, but I should like to say that I have still the same interest in the <Col N="770" /> promotion of the language in my Department as he has.  The Deputy should be aware of my views in that respect.</P>
      <P>The different questions that have been raised on this Vote could, I suppose, be called matters of detail.  The whole Department is one of details.  It is very hard for one to get into a long discussion about administration generally over the past 12 months.  Deputy Kennedy asked about the increase in staff, but he conceded that the increase was very small indeed.  I might say that the increase in staff does not necessarily mean the additional expenditure that the figures would, at first glance, suggest.  He did mention that there was an extra assistant principal.  I should like to explain that that extra assistant principal is in place of the assistant principal who has been seconded to the International Civil Aviation Association in Canada. While it means an additional assistant principal, it does not mean additional expenditure.</P>
      <P>He mentioned also that there is an extra employee in another section. That employee happens to be a temporary card puncher in the Accounts Branch.  I think Deputy Kennedy knows that the staff of the Department was, during his time, pruned down to the bare minimum.  It is one of the Departments that suffered tremendous reductions in staff, mainly due to the fact that the Department, which had been scattered so very widely throughout the city, was then concentrated in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody can complain very much about the cost of administration of the Department of Social Welfare.  I think it would be well for the House and the country generally to realise that in this Department the cost of administering a sum of £21,000,000 is only 7½ per cent.  If all our Departments could operate on a 7 per cent. cost of administration there would be great saving effected. I am not saying that is possible, but people are under the impression that if we had fewer civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare, old age pensions could be increased substantially and other social benefits could <Col N="771" /> also be increased.  That is not the case, because the administration cost in this Department is very small.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy also raised the question of new employment exchanges and asked for some information in respect of them.  This was referred to during the debate on the Estimate last year when I mentioned the fact that new employment exchanges&mdash;the provision of which would give a necessary boost to the building industry&mdash;were needed throughout the country.  I said at the time that the new employment exchange at Westport was practically completed and that it would be ready for occupation in the near future.  I mentioned that a new exchange was being built in Ballina and that it would be opened before the end of the year.  In regard to Tralee, I said that a site had been obtained.  Since then the new exchanges in Westport and Ballina have been completed and occupied.  The sites for the new exchanges in Tralee and Cavan have been acquired and the plans have reached an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>As I said last year, the position in Dublin is engaging my attention. Deputy Gogan mentioned the matter this time and said that the people in the outlying districts found it difficult to attend at the exchanges.  People are under the impression that it is necessary for recipients of unemployment assistance or for people who are on the register in such places as Cabra and Ballyfermot to sign at the employment exchange every single day.  Such is not the case.  Normally, if they reside within two miles of the exchange they must sign every day; if they reside between two and four miles they attend only every second day, and if they live between four and six miles from the employment exchange it means they must sign only once every week.  By and large, it is expensive for people, particularly in Dublin, to have to spend money on bus fares to come to the exchanges but I am endeavouring to have branch employment exchanges, if possible, situated in the suburbs at four, five or possibly six points.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy also talked about <Col N="772" /> the abuse of the insurance fund.  I think all of us in the House are in agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Kennedy.  Anybody who, by false pretences, obtains unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, or any of the other social welfare benefits, should not be tolerated in any way but instead should be subjected to the severest penalty for what really is a robbery of the fund which is largely the property of the employer and the employee.  As far as I am concerned as Minister for Social Welfare, I will not tolerate any clemency towards those people who obtain such benefits by fraudulent means.</P>
    <P>In that connection I might say, even though the question has not been raised here to-day, that it seems to me that to some extent what is commonly known as the &ldquo;wet time&rdquo; fund has been abused, and the abuse is not confined to workers.  I am afraid there has been some abuse, to say the least of it, by the employers.  If that kind of abuse were allowed to continue the fund would be in a very bad way indeed.  As a matter of fact, I am not satisfied that the fund can exist on the present contributions and it may be necessary in the immediate future to have the contribution increased.  I mention this because I am convinced that there has been abuse and it would be well to remind the workers and the employers that it is their fund and that any abuse of it, either by employer or employee, will react on the workers and, of course, the employers.</P>
    <P>I am very much in agreement with Deputy Gogan on the question of the home assistance officers.  Many of us and many of the local authorities are inclined to regard the qualifications for home assistance officers as the ability to count and to receive and to distribute money.  I do not think that that is sufficient and I certainly will consider the suggestion that has been made by Deputy Gogan, and mentioned by other Deputies here to-day, in regard to the recruitment by local authorities of home assistance officers.</P>
    <P>A great deal should be demanded by the local authority in respect of the post of home assistance officer when they are inviting applications for such <Col N="773" /> a vacancy.  The home assistance officer should be more than merely a person who distributes money.  He must have the right type of approach and a tremendous amount of sympathy in his approach to people whom we might regard as being the least well off in the whole country.  Many of us do know home assistance officers who have not the proper approach.  They seem to antagonise the people whose circumstances they are investigating and to whom they are distributing money or whose position they are examining for the purpose of deciding whether or not they should get a medical service card.</P>
    <P>I suppose the original job of home assistance officer was merely to distribute home assistance.  The local authority, through its members, decided whether or not a person would receive what was then known as &ldquo;outdoor relief&rdquo; and it was the function of the home assistance officer to deliver that money to a particular poor person and, of course, to report on that person's means.  Now the job of home assistance officer is much more specialised and covers a much wider field.  Thousands more of our people are dependent on the attitude and the general approach of the home assistance officer.  He is the person who determines whether or not a person should get assistance. He, in his report, advises the local authority whether or not a person should get the disabled person's (maintenance) allowance, whether or not a person should get a medical service card or a maternity cash grant, and whether or not a person should get the infectious diseases (maintenence) allowance.</P>
    <P>Many of us have had complants, as Deputies, from time to time about home assistance officers who, to say the least of it, did not have a sympathetic approach to these unfortunate people.  Therefore, a certain standard should be demanded from applicants for the position of home assistance officer.  I would go even further and say that, perhaps, we should establish a scheme whereby these home assistance officers would be taken on a special course every so often to school them, so to speak, in the administration of the various Acts which they <Col N="774" /> now have to administer in part, in any case, and to give them an idea as to what their approach should be to the poorer sections of the community who are dependent on the local authority and the State for certain assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gogan also asked me about the Richmond Institute for the Blind. Deputy Gogan is not a member of the Dublin Corporation but I think the members of the Dublin Corporation and those who are generally interested in the Richmond Institute for the blind know my particular interest in it.  Over the last 12 months I have tried to bring some degree of conclusion to this unfortunate business for the benefit of those people who are dependent on the Richmond Institute for the Blind for their employment and for their income.  As far as I can gather at the present time, the Richmond Institute authorities have made application to the courts for permission to sell the institute and there is a possibility, but not any definite commitment on their part, that the Dublin Corporation will buy the premises and carry on in a similar way to that in which the Richmond Institute have been carrying on.  As a matter of fact about two months ago I convened a meeting of those people who are interested, including the Dublin Corporation and the National League of the Blind, with a view to getting some conclusion to this whole business.  I can assure Deputy Gogan that I will maintain my interest in it and try to see that the interests of the blind workers are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham said that there was a change of policy in the granting of increases in respect of social welfare benefits.  His point was that in all cases in the past at a particular time all social welfare benefits were increased simultaneously.  On reflection I think he would now say that such has not been the case.  He possibly had in mind that in 1952 all these benefits, old age pensions, unemployment benefit, disability benefit and blind pensions were all increased at the same time or at least in the same year.  However, down through the years it has not been the policy of Ministers for Social Welfare, of Ministers for Local Government and Public Health and, where <Col N="775" /> they were concerned, Ministers for Industry and Commerce, to have a simultaneous increase in all these benefits.  I do not think such is the case.  Old age pensions, to give an example, were increased, I think, in about June of 1951, but there were no increases in respect of other social welfare benefits.  I do not think it would be possible, in any case, to increase all these benefits at the same time.  I do not think any Government or, should I say, any State, could, in the one year, increase old age pensions, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances, etc., even by the very smallest amounts.  It would cost millions in a year, and I do not think any Government would be prepared to face up to the task of doing it all at the one time.</P>
    <P>My policy has been over the past two years to increase these in stages. Last year, the old age pensioners got an increase, not a colossal increase.  I promised last year that during the coming year I would see what could be done for those in receipt of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, and widows' and orphans' contributory pensions.  As a matter of fact, I was pressed, though I did not need to be pressed, from various sides of the House to bring in a measure as soon as possible to do that.  It has been done.  I am not saying that the old age pensioners or those in receipt of unemployment assistance have been forgotten.  The old age pensions and unemployment assistance are not payable at a rate of which the country could be proud, and it will be my task to try to see that they will be increased as soon as the Government can do it.</P>
    <P>As I said in the last two debates on the Estimate, this Government was formed on a 12-point programme.  One of the points on which it was committed was an improvement in social welfare generally, and I think that over the past two years our record in that respect, to say the least of it, has not been bad.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I must say I am amused when I hear representatives of the <Col N="776" /> Opposition saying, as I think Deputy Ryan said recently on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1956, that the benefits were not sufficient, when I remember (and I do not know whether to take them at their word or not) that Deputy Ryan in the debate on my Department's Estimate in June of 1954 said that if he were in my position he would not&mdash;and he did not qualify it in any way at all&mdash;increase those benefits which are being increased now under the Social Welfare Act.  I appreciate that members of the Fianna Fáil Party may not have the same view, but, if that is Deputy Ryan's view, I assume that he still talks for the Opposition in respect of social welfare.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations by three of the Donegal Deputies&mdash;I do not know why it is the Donegal Deputies and whether it is confined to that district&mdash;of a deliberate reduction in the amounts paid to recipients of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Reduction, and cutting off altogether.  I do not know that there is any foundation for that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say for myself that no directions have been given to social welfare officers to investigate unduly any of these recipients.  As Deputies are probably aware, those social welfare officers have a particular programme throughout the year.  They must investigate a certain number during the year, and have been doing that for years and years past.  I am not aware that they have stepped up on their&mdash;let us call them&mdash;reinvestigations, and I have checked with the Department, and there have been no instructions given to them by any official in my Department.  As a matter of fact, there were suggestions by Deputies from the western seaboard, not Donegal, during the year that there were more reinvestigations in the present 12 months, say, than in the past 12 months, or in the 12 months before that.  I remember answering a question by, I think, Deputy Calleary <Col N="777" /> of Mayo, on that, and two or three other Deputies whose names I cannot remember now, and the reply was the contrary of the inference in the question asked.  There were less reinvestigations and fewer reductions than there were in the previous 12 months.</P>
      <P>I have had two experiences of changes of Government since I came into this House, and the different allegations or suggestions one gets from different Deputies are amusing.  Every one of my colleagues from the Labour Party who comes to me about unemployment assistance recipients and the application of the &ldquo;means test&rdquo; suggests to me that it is only the Labour Party supporters who are being reinvestigated.  Deputy Cunningham, I suppose, will suggest that it is only Fianna Fáil supporters in Donegal who are being reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>While that was not the vein in which the Deputy argued, I know the way we get those allegations on changes of Government, that the Government is now getting its own back on people who did not support it in different localities.  I merely want to assure Deputy Cunningham, Deputy Blaney and Deputy J. Brennan that, as far as I and the Department are concerned, no instruction in any way has been given to investigation officers to reinvestigate more cases than they normally would in any year, and they have got no instructions to try to effect any economies at the expense of those people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  If Deputies will consult the Book of Estimates, they will see that we are providing this year an increase of £50,000 for unemployment assistance.  Surely that, therefore, does not suggest that we are trying to economise in respect of that class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say that I will not tolerate any campaign to effect an economy at the expense of those people.  Many Deputies will agree, though I do not expect everybody in the House to do so, that these people who are generally regarded as the &ldquo;dole men&rdquo;<Col N="778" /> are subjected to a lot of criticism and sneers by people who should know better.  The allegation against most of those people in receipt of unemployment assistance seems to be that they would not work, even if they were offered work.  I may say that, as far as I know, there are in that group in receipt of unemployment assistance an unfortunate number who are unemployable. They imagine themselves that they are capable of the heaviest type of labouring work, but the plain fact is that employers just will not engage them.  They are not people who are ill or deformed in any way, but they are just not able to work any more&mdash;not by reason of any physical incapacity.  By and large, might I say, in respect of the majority of the people who draw unemployment assistance&mdash;I must confess that I do not know all parts of the country, but I know my own constituency and the counties of Leinster and some of Munster&mdash;there are very few in the country at the present time in receipt of unemployment assistance who would not accept employment if it were offered to them?</P>
    <P>Again, let me say that I will not allow any campaign that would be directed against those recipients of unemployment assistance if they are entitled to it.  There is no half way. The social welfare officers, in their application of the means test, are not unduly harsh, in my opinion, against those people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham also mentioned, and so I think did Deputy Blaney and other Deputies, the position of branch managers.  The branch managers receive the various Civil Service awards. It is true that there may be some of them who do not regard themselves as being well paid, but by and large I would say that they are not in as bad a position as some Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you were going to say &ldquo;as a Deputy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would have us believe they are.  As a matter of fact, they have got the recent Civil Service increase.  As the various awards come out, they get the benefit of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="779" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not cover the increased cost of keeping premises, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would cover premises because the premises are taken into calculation when computing salary. The increase given is a percentage increase and it would, therefore, cover the premises.</P>
      <P>So long as we have a &ldquo;means test&rdquo; in relation to old age and widows' and orphans' pensions, so long will we be subjected to the type of discussion we had here to-day and to the criticism of Deputy Murphy and the various other Deputies.  Whilst none of us is perfect, the social welfare officers make the best job they can of it.  Theirs is the interpretation of the different sections in the Social Welfare Acts dealing with the &ldquo;means test,&rdquo; The Minister or any other official in the Department, except the appeals officer, has no function in the giving of such decisions. The social welfare officer makes his investigation and tries to determine what the means are.  He has to conduct different types of investigation. He has to assess different items at a certain value.  If an individual is dissatisfied with the means assessed, there is an appeal to an appeals officer. That is provided for in the 1952 Act. I cannot interfere, and neither can any other official of the Department, with any decision arrived at by the appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Someone said there is a strong case for the abolition of the &ldquo;means test&rdquo; and that we could save on administration, by its abolition, an amount which would provide a substantial increase for old age pensioners and others.  If the &ldquo;means test&rdquo; for old age pensioners and blind pensioners were abolished, the saving on administration would amount to a mere £30,000.  Most people seem to imagine that if we do away with the &ldquo;means test,&rdquo; we will in consequence also do away with social welfare officers.  It must be remembered that investigation of means for the purpose of old age and blind pensions constitutes a relatively small proportion of the work of the social welfare officer.  I am all for the abolition of the &ldquo;means test,&rdquo; but, inasmuch as it <Col N="780" /> would cost £2,500,000 to abolish it, I would not be prepared to abolish it in present circumstances, because, if I could get my hands on that £2,500,000, I would much prefer to give it to the old age pensioners, who, at the present time, have a mere 24/- per week.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Brennan asked me to try to have a certain amount of red tape cut out in the filling in of official forms.  He said unnecessary information was sought in these forms and sometimes the applicants found great difficulty in filling them in.  Some time ago, I replied to a question by Deputy Casey as to the duties and general approach of officers of the Department towards the public.  I said, in reply, that it was the duty of officers to be as helpful as they could be to the public applying for or in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The officials, irrespective of whether they are local agents, managers or branch managers, clerks or staff officers in the exchanges, are perfectly willing to assist any person who has occasion to fill in a form and who finds difficulty in doing so.  In reply to a question last week, I said that if a form were sent to the Department, which happened to be an application form for some type of benefit, and it did not have sufficient information, if that information was not vitally necessary and was not information which had a bearing on the final decision, the officials always paid and got the information afterwards.  I gave the House an assurance in that regard.  I think that is the proper approach.  Do not, however, let anybody get the impression that any of the information sought in these forms is unnecessary.  Every single form, every single line and paragraph in it, is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Brennan does not appreciate the work done by my predecessor and by Deputy Ó Cinnéide when he was Parliamentary Secretary.  Deputy Brennan asked us to issue a special booklet to give the insured public and other people the fullest information possible in relation to the Social Welfare Acts and the qualifications necessary in order to receive the different benefits.  That had been done by my predecessor and his Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="781" /> before I ever entered the Department.  I understand the booklet is up to date, except in relation to one or two small items.  These booklets can be supplied to any Deputy who has not got one.  They are readily available to any member of the public who wants information.  Managers and branch managers are armed with these booklets and can and will give the fullest information to those who want it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate how very difficult it is not only for the ordinary public, but even at times for me, and for members of this House, to advise in relation to benefits under the Social Welfare Act.  Sometimes I am afraid to answer queries from my own constituents, or others, until I have consulted the Act or this little booklet.  We were so accustomed to the former Unemployment and National Health Insurance Acts that it is difficult for us to attune ourselves now to the provisions of the Social Welfare Act of 1952. I suppose in time we will be able to recite the provisions of the Act pretty well when we have grown used to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan and, I think, Deputy Blaney asked about the qualification for blind pensions.  The unfortunate position in which I find myself is, not alone in respect of blind pensions but in respect of disability benefit, that I am not a doctor; neither are the officials of my Department doctors. If a doctor or an ophthalmic surgeon tells a person that he is not blind then he is not blind and there is nothing I can do about it, whereas if he certifies that the person is blind then he is blind.  If the doctor says the person's leg is broken then his leg is broken.  I am not a judge of whether or not it is broken.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Brennan was particularly interested in persons who had been embroidery workers and who were now applicants for blind pensions. Deputy Brennan suggested that if a person could not carry on the usual occupation of embroidery she should be entitled to a blind pension.  That is the practice, so far as I am aware.  The definition of blindness is that the person should be (a) so blind as to be <Col N="782" /> unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential or (b) so blind as to be unable to continue her ordinary occupation.  If the appeals officer was satisfied that embroidery was her normal occupation and that her sight was so bad that she could not continue that work he would concede that the condition was satisfied.  That, briefly, is the principle on which the appeals officer works and, as far as I am aware, it has been fairly satisfactory. In any case, I do not think anybody would suggest that, on the question of blindness, the appeals officer would himself decide or that I should intervene. The appeals officer can only depend on the report of the ophthalmic surgeon or the doctor on the condition of the applicant for the blind pension.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Blaney is under a misapprehension about the qualification for disability benefit.  He quoted a case here of a person whose disability benefit was terminated after receiving it for six months.  One of the qualifications for receipt of disability benefit is that the applicant shall have 26 stamps.  For those 26 stamps he or she can obtain 12 months' disability benefit.  Unlimited benefit is paid in respect of those sick people who have 156 stamps.  That means that any person who has three years' stamps can receive disability benefit for an unlimited period.  That is a statutory provision of the 1952 measure and cannot be changed by regulation. Whilst I know there may be hardships here and there, by and large, the amount of benefit paid in respect of contributions could not be regarded as ungenerous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney, Deputy Flynn, and, throughout the year, Deputy Corry and I think Deputy MacBride mentioned the position of share fishermen with regard to insurance.  I was pleased to listen to the comments of Deputy Blaney to-day when he suggested that the share fishermen would be satisfied to pay the full rate of the stamp for all the benefits.  That proposal, as I said a week or two ago, is engaging my attention.  However, I am glad to hear from Deputy Blaney that the fishermen do not want something for nothing or something at a very cheap rate.  I <Col N="783" /> undertook, and I hope I will be able to make good the undertaking, to have a decision arrived at in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Those, I think, were most of the general points raised in this discussion. May I thank the Deputies for their criticism, harsh though some of it may have been, and for their general contribution to the debate on this Estimate?</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,255,800 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a <Col N="784" /> Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate for Forestry for 1956-57 at £1,822,800 shows an increase of £256,096 over the Estimate for 1955-56. On the Appropriations-in-Aid sub-head (sub-head H) there is an increase of £77,954, so that the increase in the gross Estimate is £334,050.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A shows an increase of £64,558 for Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  This is partly accounted for by the general revision of Civil Service remuneration but in the main it is to provide for additional administrative and technical staffs to enable the Forestry Division to cope with its constantly increasing volume of work.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B, Travelling Expenses, shows an increase of £4,000 to cover the travelling expenses of an enlarged outdoor staff.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside for the moment the main operational sub-heads C (1), C (2) and C (3), I will now deal with sub-head D, under which grants for afforestation purposes are made available to private persons and public bodies.  Expenditure under this sub-head last year was slightly in excess of the Estimate.  The number of first instalments of grants paid during the year was 56 involving 451 acres of new plantations, compared with 442 acres in 1954-55 and 360 acres in 1953-54.</P>
    <P>Provision for forestry training centres under sub-head E (1) shows an increase of £3,662 over last year.  This is due to increased management costs at Avondale and Kinnitty Castle centres and to the need for extra provision in connection with the management of the new centre at Shelton Abbey.  It will be noted that the Estimate makes provisions for a full year for Avondale school, but, in fact, it is expected that the school will be finally closed in the very near future when the new centre at Shelton Abbey is opened.  The bulk sum provided under the head of &ldquo;additional expenditure&rdquo; for Shelton Abbey, therefore, covers only the costs for the running of Shelton up to the end of the current year in so far as they exceed the expenses shown for Avondale school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> Under sub-head E (2) provision is made for expenditure on the staging of educational exhibits at the R.D.S. Spring Show and at various provincial shows.</P>
    <P>Provision under sub-head F&mdash;Agency Advisory and Special Services&mdash;is being retained at £100.</P>
    <P>The increase of £300 under sub-head G&mdash;Incidental Expenses&mdash;reflects the all-round increase in forestry activities and does not call for any comment.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the main operational sub-heads, I will deal first with sub-head C (1) which provides the funds for the acquisition of land for Forestry purposes.  This sub-head is of Grant-in-Aid character which means that unspent balances are not surrendered to the Exchequer at the end of the year. Last year's provision under the sub-head was £75,000 but as I pointed out when introducing the Estimate last year the unspent balance in the Grant-in-Aid fund on the 31st March, 1955 stood at the unprecedentedly high figure of £95,700 which with last year's provision made a total sum of almost £171,000 available in the fund for the acquisition of land at the commencement of 1955-56.</P>
    <P>The total area acquired during 1955-56 was 18,248 acres, compared with 17,513 acres in the preceding year.  At 31st March, 1956, sales had been closed and possession was pending in respect of 24 acres totalling 2,504 acres.  Price offers had been accepted and all that remained was to dispose of the legal formalities in the case of 336 areas totalling 27,502 acres.  Negotiations on price were in hands or pending in connection with 1,477 blocks of land totalling 115,907 acres and preliminary investigations of a further 1,700 offers totalling 146,000 acres were under way. These figures, covering a total of 3,500 areas comprising 292,000 acres in course of, or under consideration for, acquisition at 31st March, 1956, give a definite prospect of an appreciable rise in the rate of acquisition.</P>
    <P>On the financial side, the increased activity in acquisition last year resulted in the expenditure of over £107,000 out of sub-head C (1), leaving approximately £64,000 in the Grant-in-Aid Fund at the end of the year.  This <Col N="786" /> year's provision of £110,000 will provide adequate funds to finance more rapid acquisition progress in the current year.</P>
    <P>Despite the increase in the planting programme last year, the plantable reserve as at 31st March, 1956, stood at 49,049 acres, compared with 47,260 in March, 1955, and 45,156 acres in March, 1954.</P>
    <P>To deal now with sub-head C (2), Forest Development and Maintenance, and sub-head C (3) (1), Timber Conversion in State Forests, which between them bear the field costs in forest development and management, Deputies will find that the aggregate provision of £1,629,630 shows an increase of £219,680 over the Estimate for 1955-56.  Of this increase, £183,000 relates to the Labour heads in these sub-heads and £36,680 is the net addition to the non-labour items.</P>
    <P>To dispose first of the non-labour items, there is increased provision for cartage and freight costs in the Capital, Constructional, Maintenance and Timber Conversion sub-heads.  These increases are linked with the expansion in the programmes for road construction, planting and thinning to which I will refer later and with the normal expansion that is to be expected in the maintenance programme.</P>
    <P>There is also an increase under the Capital Expenditure head of sub-head C (2) for expenditure on the construction and purchase of houses for foresters.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, however, the main portion of sub-heads C (2) and C (3) (1) will be devoted to labour requirements and it is on the labour heads in the sub-heads that the real increase occurs.  The extra £183,000 required for labour is in part intended to meet the higher wage levels now obtaining but it is primarily due to the increased volume of work which will be undertaken in the current year over virtually the whole range of forestry activities.  In the first ten weeks of this year an average number of 5,149 men were employed on forestry work, compared with an average of 4,373 men in the corresponding period last year. The aggregate provision of £1,370,000 should enable labour staffs to be increased <Col N="787" /> at peak this year to over 5,500 but an increase in wage-levels beyond that contemplated when the Estimate was framed may give rise to need for a Supplementary Estimate later in the year.</P>
    <P>The only individual labour provision which shows a decrease is that for nurseries which is down by £11,000 as compared with 1955-56.  This saving is to a large extent due to introduction of new methods of weed control.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made under the Capital and Constructional Expenditure heads for an increase in the planting programme to 17,500 acres.</P>
    <P>Mention of planting activity and the increase in our area of plantations brings me to the subject of forest fires. The weather in the spring and early summer of this year was the worst possible from the point of view of fire danger and the foresters and their staffs had a most anxious and a trying time.  In the first half of this year, no less than 338 fires occurred at or near State forests, and of these 44 fires actually caused damage estimated at a total of over £5,000.  The damage, regrettable though it is, is nothing compared with what might have been sustained, were it not for the vigilance of the foresters and fire-watchers, and I must pay tribute also to the invaluable co-operation and assistance which is afforded to my Department by the Gardaí, the local fire brigades and the Army in detecting and controlling these outbreaks.</P>
    <P>Many of these fires are caused by farmers in burning rough grazing and by turf workers in cleaning spread-ground, but the vast majority of them are started by some act of carelessness on the part of a passer-by in casually throwing away a lighted match or cigarette-end, or by picnic-makers who fail to extinguish thoroughly their picnic fires.  Prosecutions under the Forestry Act, 1946, are taken whenever the offenders can be detected, but the most effective remedy against deliberate burning of carelessness of the kind I have mentioned is believed to be the education of the public to a constant wachfulness against such <Col N="788" /> danger and a realisation of the destruction which can be caused to their property by a forest fire.  The Department is doing all it can to foster this outlook amongst the public by means of Press advertisements, radio announcements and other forms of publicity. But if greater carefulness is not shown by the public, I will have to ask the Government to introduce legislation providing for the more drastic punishment of offenders.</P>
    <P>Returning again to the Estimate, under the Capital Expenditure head there is a substantial increase in the provision for the construction of new forest roads.  As more plantations reach the thinning stage, this work becomes increasingly important.  Last year the Forestry Division dealt with 118 miles of new road, compared with 90 miles in 1954-55 and 66 miles in 1953-54.  I am providing for a further increase in the volume of such work in the current year.  The divisions tractor fleet was recently increased to enable it to deal more expeditiously with road work and provision for labour is being increased to £161,000, compared with £125,000 in 1955-56.</P>
    <P>The provision for labour under the Maintenance head is £482,000 as against £427,000 for 1955-56.  The increase is partly due to higher wage rates but it is mainly attributable to the expansion in the volume of work as the area under forest increases and it does not call for any special comment.</P>
    <P>The labour provision under sub-head C (3) (1), Timber Conversion in State Forests, covers the cost of thinning plantations and the felling of mature timber.  The proposed provision for the current year is £232,000, compared with £170,000 for 1955-56.  In 1955-56, almost 11,000 acres were thinned.  The target for the current year is 13,000 acres.  This, together with the increase in wage rates, explains the increase in the provision for labour under this head.</P>
    <P>In sub-head C (3) (2), Sawmilling, which relates to the Department's sawmills at Dundrum and Cong, there is also an increase in the provision for labour, due mainly to increased wage-rates which have operated since <Col N="789" /> last December.  An increase under the head of Equipment provides for the installation of fire-fighting appliances at both sawmills.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash;at £243,204, allows for an increase of £77,954 over last year's figure.  Taking the individual items, there is an increase of £5,000 in the allowance for receipts from the sale of miscellaneous materials, which allows for certain revenue from the sale of some plants surplus to requirements in certain species in the State nurseries last spring and an increase of £2,500 in the sawmills figure, reflecting the attainment of full operation at Cong sawmill. The bulk of the increase is, however, by way of allowance for extra receipts from the sale of timber in the forests.</P>
    <P>The figure for sales of timber, at £200,000 is an increase of 55 per cent. over the figure in last year's Estimate. Actual receipts last year totalled approximately £180,000 against an Estimate allowance of £130,000 and it would not be unreasonably optimistic to expect a similar excess of actual receipts over Estimate allowance in the current year.  In the first quarter of the year, receipts amounted to £65,000 and the gross figure for the year may well prove to be of the order of £250,000.  The Estimate as it stands does not allow for receipts of such a high order partly because the extent to which it would be possible to increase revenue was not fully apparent when the Estimate was being prepared and partly, of course, because in such an Estimate prudence requires a conservative allowance on the revenue side.</P>
    <P>Thinning operations are being steadily expanded and continuance of that expansion is necessary to the proper development of the plantations. Much attention is being devoted to market extension to take up the increased output from thinning and this, together with the Department's efforts to secure more attractive prices for thinning produce is reflected in the increased revenue.  Since last year, the entry of the Clondalkin Paper Mills into the manufacture of pulp has opened an additional market and it has been possible to bring about some revival <Col N="790" /> of the pit-prop trade which fell off considerably for a number of years previously.  The position is still, however, that the output of thinning produce is in excess of demand.  Until output and demand can be brought to a happy relationship the market must still be shaky.  I am giving much attention to this whole question at the moment.  In the meantime, it is at least very gratifying that probable receipts for this year at £250,000, will give an increase of 40 per cent. over last year's total and 75 per cent. over the previous year.</P>
    <P>To pass now from the detailed provisions of the Estimate before the House, let me say that there is scarcely any aspect of Irish national endeavour on which there is such universal agreement on all sides of the House as there is on the basic issue of the desirability of a continuing afforestation drive. There has been a great deal of confusion, however, in regard to the optimum rate of development&mdash;confusion resulting largely from the difficulties experienced by Deputies in grasping all the complexities of a large-scale afforestation project and the factors which must govern its ultimate objectives and the tempo at which it can develop.  It is my hope that in this debate I shall be able to give every member of the House a clearer picture of the essentials which must govern our national forest policy.  If the debate can further be made the vehicle for a well-considered endorsement by the whole House of the forestry policy of the Government, a permanent gain will have been achieved.  The gain will lie in the help that such an expression of conviction will give to the Government, the Minister for Lands and his Department in pushing ahead with the forest development programme on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>Before considering to-day's position or to-morrow's possibilities, I should like to go back briefly over past history.  The story of Ireland's deforestation is well known.  The havoc of invasions, wars and wartime needs over the centuries was supplemented by the dire effects of the landlord and tenant system prior to the enactment of the Land Purchase Acts.  Unfortunately, <Col N="791" /> those Acts, while rectifying the agrarian social evils of the land tenure system, dealt a final blow to Ireland's forests by handing over ownership of most of the remaining woods to small farm proprietors who lacked both the resources and the incentive to preserve the timber.  The result, as we all learned in our schooldays, was to bring Ireland by the beginning of the present century into the unenviable situation of being the least wooded country in Europe.  The first faltering steps to rectify that situation were taken 52 years ago with the formation of a State forest service.  Progress since, by way of State afforestation, may be summarised in main periods as follows: 1904-1922, an average annual planting of 180 acres; 1922-1934, an average annual planting of slightly less than 3,000 acres; 1934-1950, an average annual planting of slightly under 7,000 acres (with an interim eight year drop to an average of about 4,700 acres during the war period); 1950-56, an average annual planting of 13,500 acres.</P>
    <P>The first period of 18 years was one in which little result in terms of actual planting was achieved &mdash; appallingly little when it is remembered that in that period the first World War made further inroads into our woods.  The plantings undertaken during this period were on a purely pilot scale and the total area planted amounted to little more than 3,000 acres.  The real value of these early plantations lay in the experience that was gained &mdash; and is still being gained&mdash;as to the behaviour of particular species and mixtures of species under varying conditions. Viewed as a practical research undertaking, this small-scale planting prior to 1922 was of significant worth because it was initiated at a time when deliberate afforestation for timber production as distinct from tree planting for geo-physical reasons &mdash; prevention of erosion, torrent control and so on&mdash;was in its infancy and no country in the world had any exact knowledge of the economic aspects of deliberate tree cultivation.  This early planting, however, made no significant contribution towards the forest resources of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> During the second period&mdash;the first 12 years of native Government&mdash;Irish forestry emerged from the pilot planting stage with a rapid increase in the first three years from an annual planting rate of 500 acres to 2,000 acres and a steady gain in momentum thereafter until a figure of over 4,000 acres was reached in 1933-34.  Much of the planting was still perforce of an experimental nature and the forestry service was gradually being developed on lines attuned to large-scale planting activities. Looking back now, it is easy to be critical of the fact that more was not accomplished in this period, but studying the records of the period in my Department it is quite clear that the whole project was still too young to have undertaken more than it did.</P>
    <P>The third period&mdash;the eight effective years from 1934 to 1950, discounting the war years&mdash;commenced with the transfer of forestry to the Department of Lands.  Its beginning was marked by the settlement of an annual planting target of 10,000 acres.  The actual annual achievement was stepped up to 7,600 acres by the commencement of the war and this level was again attained by 1948-49.  Again, one is tempted to be critical of the inadequacy of the target and of the failure to reach even that target but let us look at the facts dispassionately. In the pre-war years it was impossible to foresee the timber-hungry conditions which would beset the post-war world or the remarkable development of pulp markets for thinning produce. Prior to the war, it was quite understandable for a Government to pursue such a limited afforestation policy as the annual target of 10,000 acres then envisaged.  It is true that the envisaged target was not reached but so far as my knowledge goes, every country in the world which sets itself an afforestation target takes a long time to bring performance into line with the target.  That is true even of countries with large existing forest areas and the concomitant availability of existing organisation, trained personnel and other resources.  Acceleration of a forestry planting rate involves cumulative expansion of work on several different fronts, apart altogether from the problem of getting <Col N="793" /> the requisite land.  First of all, nursery resources have to be built up &mdash;a big task in itself.  Then the actual stepping-up of planting involves a bigger and bigger task with each year's increase in performance.  Most significant of all, each year's planting adds another block of forest to the total area to be maintained.  Viewed thus, an increase in the annual planting rate from 4,000 acres in 1933-34 to 7,600 acres in 1938-39 was a solid, if not spectacular, achievement and one I would hesitate to criticise.  I do feel that it is a pity, however, that consideration was not given to the impact of the war's effects on the post-war timber position immediately after, and indeed during, the war period.  At that stage, it should have been evident that the pre-war target of 10,000 acres was no longer realistic and advance planning might profitably have been initiated on a much enlarged post-war forestry target.  Nothing was done on this score, however, until the first inter-Party Government took office in 1948.</P>
    <P>The new Government addressed itself to a review of forestry policy as a matter of great urgency and only nine months after taking office a firm announcement of a new and much more vigorous State afforestation policy was made.  That announcement, in a White Paper on post-war planning dated 20th December, 1948, declared the intention to step up the annual planting rate to 25,000 acres which would ultimately provide 1,000,000 acres of productive State forest.  It was obvious that, just as the pre-war target of 10,000 acres had to be approached gradually, so too it would inevitably take time to gear the machine to the new 25,000 acres target.  There was indeed little ground for optimism as to the rapid attainment of the new annual target.  The plantable reserve in hands stood at only 30,000 acres despite the restrictions imposed on planting during the war years by lack of seed and fencing materials and the average annual rate of acquisition of plantable land over the previous five years had been only 4,000 acres; the acquisition prospect for 1948-49 itself was only about 3,500 acres.  Planting in 1947-48 had covered only 6,000 acres and the <Col N="794" /> programme for 1948-49 was but the restoration of the pre-war peak of 7,500 acres.  Plant supplies in the nurseries were not sufficient for any significant increase in planting and the nursery areas themselves were not adequate to meet a sharp production increase, even if seed could be obtained. Nor was the staff and organisation of the Forestry Service capable of overnight expansion and adjustment to meet the needs of the new programme. It was out of the question to secure immediately a notable increase in the planting rate itself but plans were formulated and put into operation to enable the rate to be expanded as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The first problem was to get the land.  A progressive increase in the inspectorate staff engaged on land acquisition was undertaken.  A flying survey of potential forest land in the country was made as a matter of top priority to delineate the areas in which concentrated efforts to acquire land would have most prospect of success. The ceiling price payable for forestry land was doubled.  Increased Land Commission co-operation was secured in arranging the transfer of marginal land to the Forestry Division.  Even with all these steps there was little prospect of attaining and continuing an annual planting of as high an order as 25,000 acres unless land of a quality and nature formerly treated as incapable of economic afforestation could be made to produce tree crops at a reasonable cost by the use of heavy machinery developed during and after the war.  Steps were taken to secure an experimental start in this field of work.</P>
    <P>These various unified efforts brought the rate of acquisition of plantable land up from 3,500 acres in 1948-49 to 6,700 acres in 1949-50, 10,900 acres in 1950-51 and 15,700 acres in 1951-52&mdash;an increase to fivefold in four years.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile steps were taken to locate and acquire land suitable for use as additional nursery areas.  The main work on this front was brought to fruition in 1950-51 when the total nursery area was increased to 577 <Col N="795" /> acres as compared with 367 acres in the previous year.</P>
    <P>There were staff expansion problems to be tackled.  The most urgent was the provision of an enlarged force of foresters for immediate direction of field work.  The basic training of a forester takes three years and he needs some years' further practical experience before he can be placed in full charge of a forest.  An enlarged intake of trainees could not, therefore, be of practical help for about five years and, to make matters worse, the training school at Avondale was not capable of housing an enlarged intake.  Emergency training schedules were devised to operate until a new training establishment could be set up and the annual intake of trainees was increased by 100 per cent. in 1950.  The difficulties of operating emergency training arrangements have militated against a regular annual intake of trainees at the increased rate and it will be some years yet before the availability of fully trained foresters settles down to a regular annual rhythm at the enlarged rate.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned but a few of the separate but integrated programmes which had to be launched to develop the resources which would enable the much enlarged afforestation objective sponsored by the first inter-Party Government to be achieved.  These few alone, however, suffice to show that in afforestation, just as in any other big production enterprise, years of patient building and organisation are needed to convert blueprints into active reality.</P>
    <P>With that axiom established, let us take a look at what progress has been made since 1948, in terms of actual planting, towards fulfilling the new policy decision.  The planting programme was increased in 1948-49 to about 7,500 acres as against 6,000 acres in the previous year and it was maintained at the higher figure in 1949-50 but the first real fruits of the inter-Party Government's policy were evident only in 1950-51 when 9,400 acres were planted&mdash;an increase of 2,000 acres on the previous year and by far the highest accomplishment for any <Col N="796" /> single year up to that.  The following year was marked by even more striking results.  Fifteen thousand acres were planted&mdash;an increase of 50 per cent. on the previous year, twice the best record for a single year while the old target prevailed and over two and a half times the average annual accomplishment under the old target. That was tremendous progress and, had it been possible to keep it up, attainment of the objective of an annual planting of 25,000 acres would not have been far off.</P>
    <P>The following year the planting programme was, however, reduced to 12,500 acres.  There it stayed until 1954-55 when it was again increased, but only to 13,500 acres.  In 1955-56 it rose again and once more 15,000 acres were planted.  As I have already said, the present year will be marked by an advance to 17,500 acres and further rapid progress is contemplated.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for me to make political capital out of the regression in planting in 1952-53 and the lack of further upward progress until the inter-Party Government again came into office.  I would be dishonest to do so and I have no such intention.  I feel that, in this matter of forestry, all Parties in the House can unite in furtherance of a common objective and I want to give full credit to the present Opposition for the part they played during their last period in office.  First, credit is due to them for allowing the planting of 15,000 acres to proceed in 1951-52.  That programme was one and a half times the maximum target envisaged by their forestry policy when previously in office.  Their acceptance of the more vigorous policy which had been inaugurated by the inter-Party Government was, I say again, to their credit.  Nor should criticism of the cut in the programme to 12,500 acres in 1952-53 and the lack of any further upward progress in planting until they left office in 1954 fail to take account of the extent to which reduction in the planting rate was the result of difficulties, the nature or extent of which had not previously emerged.</P>
    <P>The most immediate difficulty was <Col N="797" /> not directly related to the new planting target.  I refer to the increasing management needs of the existing State forest plantations.  When a new plantation is laid down, it gives rise to quite a considerable volume of maintenance work for a few years&mdash;control of competing vegetation, replacement of failures, repairs to fences and drains, and so on.  For about ten to 15 years after that, it requires little more than caretaking.  Then intensive silvicultural work has to be undertaken in pruning, cutting out poor and misshapen trees and regular thinning thereafter; much road construction work must also be undertaken when this stage is reached to enable thinnings to be extracted and sold.  Now, Deputies will remember that, in summarising the past history of State forestry in main periods, I described the period 1922-1934 as one of gradual growth with an average annual planting of less than 3,000 acres, the next period&mdash;commencing 1934&mdash;being one of comparatively rapid increase in planting with an average annual planting of 7,000 acres.  This upward trend of pre-war planting faced the forestry service with a fast-growing problem of first thinning and road construction in the early 1950's, coupled with a more gradual increase in requirements by way of repeat thinnings of the pre-1934 plantations.  If this work was to be given priority&mdash;and it was essential that it should be&mdash;its impact on the forestry service left less resilience to meet large-scale fresh planting pending strengthening and expansion of the man-power and other resources of the service.  In some forests indeed, the conflict of demands for treatment of old stands and erection of new ones was evident even in labour supply problems; in Glenmalure, for example, rapid progress with planting against a large reserve of plantable land would have drawn off labour from urgent thinning and road construction work.</P>
    <P>The inevitability of the extent to which the concession of priority to the silvicultural treatment of older plantations influenced the rate of fresh afforestation may be more easily grasped if I quote actual figures of this increase in management work.  In 1950-51, 4,000 acres were thinned compared <Col N="798" /> with an annual average of 3,200 acres over the previous three years. The figures thenceforward were:&mdash; 1951-52, 5,400 acres; 1952-53, 7,700 acres; 1953-54, 8,700 acres; 1954-55, 9,300 acres; 1955-56, 11,000 acres.</P>
    <P>In the current year, 13,000 acres will be thinned.  The cubic measurement of poles removed rose from 1,000,000 cubic feet in 1950-51 to 3,250,000 cubic feet in 1955-56.  These figures exclude pruning and light initial thinning by way of removal of stunted ill-formed saplings; that work shows a concurrent increase&mdash;the area handled in 1955-56 being 15,000 acres.  The expansion of road construction to facilitate extraction of thinnings is most easily studied on labour and cartage expenditure figures; aggregate expenditure on these heads in 1955-56 was approximately £150,000 compared with £18,000 in 1950-51.  It would have been physically impossible to make spectacular progress with fresh planting during a period of such rapid development of thinning and allied work and that alone was an ample justification for the regression in planting in 1952-53 and the slowness of the renewed upward trend since 1954-55.  The meteoric jump in thinning needs is now flattening off, much progress has been made with related problems, such as development of marketing organisation, and the Forestry Service can face a more rapid future expansion of planting without detriment to the needs of the older plantations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the impact of this whole question of thinning needs, it became apparent by 1952-53 that the rapid climb in the planting rate from the 6,000 acres figure of 1947-48 was giving rise to a volumetric increase in immediate after-care work&mdash;notably the control of competing vegetation and the replacement of failures&mdash;which could only be met if the rate of planting were temporarily slowed.  The competition of natural vegetation is a problem for the first two to three years (longer in some ground conditions) and the progressive rise in planting had increased the total areas of young plantations in need of cleaning to almost threefold.  The increased demand for plants for replacement of failures <Col N="799" /> inevitably reduced the extent to which a nursery production programme could be stretched to meet immediate new planting on a scale not covered by sowing in earlier years.  This plant supply factor was further complicated by unsatisfactory results in some areas in which seedling contorta pine were used in 1951-52 on mechanically-prepared ground; reluctance to continue general use of seedlings on such ground involved a recasting of immediate nursery potential.</P>
    <P>To show up even more clearly the extent to which work other than actual planting has grown since 1951-1952, I have had the expenditure on forest labour (including nursery labour) analysed for the two years 1951-52 and 1955-56.  In each of these years, 15,000 acres were planted.  In 1951-52, labour devoted to existing plantations was 90 per cent. of that devoted to fresh planting and nursery work.  In 1955-56 the corresponding ratio was 160 per cent.  In other words, in again reaching a planting figure of 15,000 acres last year, the Forestry Service has done so despite a tremendous growth of work in the interim in the existing plantations.  Last year's accomplishment in the field of forestry as a whole was a far more notable achievement than what I have already described as the striking achievement of 1951-52.  It augurs well for the future.  In presenting this picture of the maintenance and care of existing plantations I am anxious to bring home to the House and to the public the fact that forestry consists of a great deal more than planting young trees on virgin ground. It would be a criminal waste of public property and the taxpayers' money not to be scrupulously careful of our forests in the growing stage so as to ensure that thinnings are utilised to bring in the last penny and that the ultimate mature forest will be a stand of the best and straightest trees with the maximum cubic footage per acre of first-class timber.</P>
    <P>There were still other factors, however, which influenced the rate of new afforestation during the past four years <Col N="800" /> and which require careful study in relation to the future.  I refer to the problem of acquiring sufficient land and the related question of how far we can go in the successful exploitation of waste lands for forestry purposes.  In the past few years, the intake of plantable land has been maintained at a fairly steady figure averaging 16,500 acres, including an average of about 3,000 acres of sub-marginal land the economic use for which for forestry purposes is still open to some doubt. Even the maintenance of this level of acquisition has involved increasing difficulty.  The F.A.O. forestry authorities in a survey of European forestry policies and progress some years ago recognised the problem of acquiring suitable land for afforestation as a special difficulty of this country and of Great Britain; there is no need to tell the House that it is a greater problem by far here than in Britain.</P>
    <P>The building up of blocks of land suitable for forestry purposes by negotiation is a herculean task because of the present ownership pattern.  Mr. Roy Cameron of F.A.O., in the report on his forestry mission here, commented on this quoting in support of his comment the average plantable area per acquisition up to 1950 which was 180 acres.  Analysis of figures for more recent years shows that the average in the three-year period 1950-53 was only 104 acres and in the three-year period 1953-56 it had fallen to 71 acres.</P>
    <P>Unless, therefore, resort were had to ruthless compulsory acquisition, purchase of sufficient land to maintain a large scale planting programme must continue to be fraught with great and increasing difficulty.  More and more effort is being devoted to this aspect of the Forestry Division's work and there is ground for hoping that in the current year an increased aggregate area will be taken over.  The new Forestry Act will, of course, contribute to easement of the problem; statutory regulations thereunder are at present being framed and in the meantime initial work on likely cases is in hands. At best it will be late in the year before the first cases under the new Act come to fruition and the Act will <Col N="801" /> not materially assist the acquisition rate until next year.</P>
    <P>If, however, the rate of planting is to be further stepped up as I propose, the rate of acquisition must rise even more sharply so that the plantable reserve, now 49,000 acres, may be maintained in proper minimum ratio to the planting rate.  I cannot guarantee that such an increased intake of land will prove practicable.  My Department will do its best and at this stage I, and the Government, believe we should plan for the future on the assumption that sufficient land can and will be acquired.</P>
    <P>In the long term, the correctness or otherwise of this assumption will depend on the extent to which our present experimental work on poor peat soils proves successful.  If that work should prove successful, a much greater annual intake of land should readily be practicable.  Failure of the experimental work would, conversely, have a depressing effect on acquisition, since a fairly steady proportion of such land is at present being acquired for continuance of the experimental planting.  In that event, a regular planting programme of 25,000 acres could only be maintained if practically all of the land included as potential forest land in the Plantable Land Survey of 1949 could be confirmed as plantable on closer inspection and could be acquired at an adequate rate over the years.</P>
    <P>To base a firm, long-term programme entirely on such assumptions would be unwise.  Although efforts were made to exclude land of doubtful plantability from the survey, some of the land included has, in fact, been found on fuller inspection to be unplantable; how big a reduction factor should be applied on this score to the total of 1,200,000 acres returned by the survey is open to conjecture.  Nor is here any reasonable prospect that all of the plantable land could be acquired or that its acquisition could be brought about at an even tempo without recourse to compulsion.  Every acre of that land has an owner and, so long as the owners have the right to sell or <Col N="802" /> retain their property at will, many of them will refuse to sell and their successors in title will go on refusing to sell.  In such circumstances it is anybody's guess how much of the land covered by the plantable land survey will ultimately come into the ownership of the forestry service.  Prudence would not suggest an assumption that most of it can, and will, be brought under forest crops within 50 years.</P>
    <P>Even if some ephemeral circumstance of agricultural economy should make progress with the acquisition of such land easier for a number of years, it would be bad policy to plant it up at an annual rate of 25,000 acres in the absence of reasonable hope of long-term maintenance of that rate.  At the worst, such prodigality could lead to a period when planting might have to cease entirely; at best it would involve the virtual certainty of a sharp fall in the planting rate at a later stage.  Either result would be a violation of one of the axioms of good forestry.  A sound forest plan is one which seeks to approach closely the millennium of a balanced forest made up of plantations of every age within the rotation in standard proportions. That way, a fixed annual yield of timber of various sizes can be secured and full markets can be developed on the basis of certain long-term supply.</P>
    <P>Forest management itself is facilitated in the process and employment is maintained at a steady level.  That axiom is not seriously violated by short spasmodic variations in planting, provided they are moderate and not too frequent.  The organisation and economics of forest management suffer from such variations but ultimate cropping can be brought in line with a calculated norm by adjustments of the rotation period.  A steady planting of 25,000 acres for 25 years and a drop thereafter to, say, 12,500 acres would, however, be a serious violation of the principle.</P>
    <P>Nor would prodigality of this type be socially desirable.  For the sake of rapid planting but not good forestry, there would be an over-accelerated transference of land from uneconomic agricultural usage to forest cropping. The immediate effect might well be a <Col N="803" /> serious blow to local social well-being since the forest development which would ultimately increase the level of employment could not, in its early stages, be expected to absorb the full diversion of manpower from agricultural pursuits.  It may be of interest in this connection to quote the following comment which I came across recently in an official statement relating to progress of afforestation in Italy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These bare areas usually consist of waste open grazing land and, to a lesser extent, land that comes occasionally under shifting cultivation. Whatever the extent of such land, it is, of course, impossible to afforest it entirely without upsetting the social and economic situation.  A change over of crops of this kind takes time and requires concurrent improvement in the other agricultural production sectors, so that the local population may be assured of a better, or, at least, equal livelihood from the smaller cropland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our situation differs in some respects but the broad principle is equally applicable here.  This principle is one which the Irish Forest Service tries hard to honour and its constant aim is to seek, within the dictates of overall policy, to build up forest activity in each area at a steady rate which will avoid temporary employment vacua and enable the forest staffs to be given quasi-permanent work.  The rarity of complaints that afforestation is upsetting rather than aiding local employment is the measure of the success of this policy.</P>
    <P>The key to our permanent future planting rate is, therefore, as I have stressed on other occasions in speaking in the House, the success or otherwise of experimental planting on poor soils. That work was initiated on a very small scale in 1950-51 but large-scale experimental work had to be delayed until contracts for the purchase of heavy equipment were fulfilled in 1951-52.  The work has gone ahead steadily since then and has been extended into even poorer site-types than were attempted in the first year, and as I informed the House last autumn on the Forestry Bill <Col N="804" /> debate, so far the results of experimentation are satisfactory but the danger-period during which a serious check on growth could occur has not yet passed even in the 1950-51 and 1951-52 planting areas.  Our forestry service is, in fact, very much in advance of the forest authorities in most countries in this work, and we face the risks inherent in pioneering.  I, myself, have seen instances of quite striking growth on some of these areas but there is still danger that, in the constant extension of the root-systems of the young trees, they may reach a point at which excessive water or lack of nutriment will bring growth to an end, as happened years ago in attempts to grow forest crops on areas affected by hard mineral pans without the use of heavy machinery to break up the pans.</P>
    <P>The danger of total failure is receding and unless there is total failure, without any hope of still further technological advances to enable renewed attempts to be made, the work will go on.  Even if it should prove impossible to develop crops to sawlog size on some of these areas, continuance of afforestation on the site types concerned could well be justified economically if there were fair prospect of production of reasonable quantities of pulpwood on a short-term rotation.  In such a situation, the social advantages to be derived from extensive afforestation in the western districts where the problems of employment and emigration are most pressing, would, of course, be a powerful additional argument in favour of continuance of the project.  I, personally, believe that with the methods now at our disposal, the experimentation on which we are engaged will be a success but I share the view of the experts that extension of this work should be gradual so as to permit a constant ploughing back of the experience which is being steadily accumulated and I, and the Government, must, in prudence, delay a binding decision as to ultimate future policy in relation to the afforestation of such land until more positive results are available.</P>
    <P>Until that issue can be decided, the wider question as to what our permanent <Col N="805" /> overall planting rate should be must also remain open to some question.  The more immediate question of what we should undertake over the next few years is fortunately less difficult.  The policy of appreciable annual acceleration of our planting rate towards a target of 25,000 acres can be continued without violation of the principle of good forest planning which I enunciated earlier and, in so far as continuing extension of the overall planting rate involves a like expansion in the experimental work on poor planting grounds, such a policy is a rational recognition of our increasing knowledge in that sphere and confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>The comparative data I have given in relation to 1951-52 and 1955-56 when planting programmes of like extent&mdash; 15,000 acres&mdash;were carried out but with a huge increase in the volume of other work in the later year, is evidence that the forestry service is in a position to push ahead with the expansion of planting at an even more rapid rate than has obtained over the past two years whilst continuing to devote the necessary increasing attention to the existing plantations.  A service which has in five years undertaken the planting of 70,000 acres&mdash;exactly half of the accomplishment of the previous 45 years&mdash;simultaneously with an equally astronomical development of other work, can, with confidence, face appreciable further growth in its undertakings. I am, therefore, in a position to tell the House that not merely is it the intention to increase the planting rate this year by 2,500 acres to 17,500 acres, but that each succeeding year will be marked by a similar big increase until the 1948 target of 25,000 acres is reached.  The planting rates for the individual years will be:&mdash; 1956-57, 17,500 acres; 1957-58, 20,000 acres; 1958-59, 22,500 acres, and in 1959-60 the objective of 25,000 acres will be realised.  By then, much more information will have been gained in regard to the experimental planting of poor site-types and policy thenceforward can profitably be reviewed at that stage in relation to the degree of success of the experimental work and with full regard to the social and economic factors then present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> The attainment of a planting programme of as much as 25,000 acres within 11 years of the fixation of that target, for an organisation which was then geared to the planting of only 6,000-7,000 acres a year, and despite a huge increase in other work in the interval, will be a tremendous achievement. That much will be obvious to any member of this House with knowledge of the problems of large-scale organisation. But only the few Deputies in the House who have particular knowledge of the complexity of large-scale forest management can fully appreciate quite how great will be the achievement. Even as it stands to-day, the Forestry Service is handling a very big job of work.  Apart altogether from the management of 58 nurseries, with an aggregate of about 600 acres and an output last year of over 26,000,000 plants, and ignoring all the problems of acquiring several hundred different properties capable of being welded into forest blocks each year and leaving aside, too, the operation of the Department's sawmills, the preparation, fencing, draining and planting of an aggregate of even 15,000 acres in a single year and the annual addition of such an area to the gross total of intensive forest for subsequent management is no small task.</P>
    <P>Even if each year's planting were in one big block&mdash;a block ten times the size of the Phoenix Park&mdash;it would be a big undertaking.  In fact, however, each year's planting must be the product of careful planning and integration of several hundred separate planting projects scattered over the country and fitted into the overall pattern of other forest work so as to provide the optimum contribution towards local stabilisation of employment. On the management side, the Department is now responsible for no less than 1,500 distinct and separate forest properties organised for administrative convenience in groups styled &ldquo;forests&rdquo; which alone number 170.</P>
    <P>On the employment side, forestry is making an ever increasing contribution towards national well-being.  Whereas in 1949-50 the average number in the direct employment of the Forestry Division, excluding headquarters and <Col N="807" /> supervisory staffs and excluding also persons engaged in haulage, was not much over 2,000, the average last year was 4,850.  This year it will be 5,250 and the planting of 25,000 acres in 1959-60 will give employment to 8,000 men.  A more rapid rise thereafter is possible.  If figures of indirect employment, that is, employment given by purchasers and users of timber, were available, an even more striking rise would be shown in consequence of the sharp increase in thinning activity.</P>
    <P>It is notable too that this overall increase in employment comprehends, in particular, a steady increase in the congested counties in the West where the employment problem is most acute and that forestry employment in these areas will, over the coming years, rise more rapidly than in the remainder of the country.</P>
    <P>On this score, the Government has no hesitation in seeking the approval of the Dáil for a gross Vote for the current year of £2,000,000 for a service on which gross spending in 1947-48 was only £434,000.  Of this year's £2,000,000, £1,700,000, or 85 per cent. will be directly expended on salaries and wages, including payments to carters, as compared with 80 per cent. in 1947-48. The wage-content percentage may show a further rise in future years.  It is in this remarkably high labour content of forestry and in the particular potentialities of forestry in the congested counties that the great immediate value of afforestation on social grounds rests, but the State's capital outlay on afforestation is not merely justifiable on social grounds.  Ultimately it will bring a worth-while investment yield as well as contributing in a notable degree towards a better balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember from the detailed information which I gave the House on the Forestry Bill debate last autumn that, even if our annual planting programme for the future remained pegged at last year's actual accomplishment of 15,000 acres, we might anticipate an ultimate annual yield of sawlog timber amounting to five times our present consumption with, of course, equivalent availabilities of <Col N="808" /> other smaller material.  There is no need to stress that fact further.  Nor should it be necessary to remind the House of the favourable future position of this country <i>vis-a-vis</i> our nearest neighbour, Great Britain&mdash;a comparison upon which I also elaborated in that debate.  I feel, however, that it may be helpful to quote for the information of the House a few relevant facts in relation to our position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>Let us start with the fact that little more than 2 per cent. of this country is devoted to woods and plantations, leaving us far worse off in this respect at the moment than any other European country, but let us take account also of other pertinent facts. In Europe as a whole the concept of economic afforestation, that is planting for timber production, is a modern one, and the big headache of most European forest authorities is not to create new forests but to seek to bring their countries' existing forests and nominal forests into fuller bearing.  In very many European countries there are large areas technically classed as woodland which are understocked and capable of producing little or no useful timber.  As just one example, let me mention Yugoslavia, 28½ per cent. of which is under forest; it is authoritatively stated that, through neglect of proper treatment 38 per cent. of the forest area &ldquo;does not contribute to the production of timber&rdquo;.  For Europe as a whole, 58 per cent. of total forest area is represented by forests not managed under proper working plans.  Only 33 per cent. of European forests are State-owned and there is considerable difficulty in securing more efficient management of the privately owned forests, except in the isolated instances of forests operated by large industrial companies.  Forty per cent. of European forests are devoted to hardwoods, giving a lower annual yield than the conifers.  The overall annual yield from European forests, expressed in relation to population is only 25½ cubic feet per person.  Excluding this country and exluding also the three Scandinavian countries which are large timber exporters, Sweden, Norway and Finland, the annual yields from European forests expressed in relation <Col N="809" /> to population is only 17½ cubic feet per person.  If this country were to do no more than plant 15,000 acres a year henceforward, the future annual yield estimated on a moderate base can be taken as 30½ cubic feet per person.  In other words we have already advanced to a point at which we have a guarantee of a future timber yield more favourable than that enjoyed to-day by Europe as a whole and almost twice as favourable as that enjoyed by Europe less the Scandinavian timber-exporting bloc.  The comparison would become even more favourable if account were taken of the high European consumption of timber for fuel purposes.  In Europe excluding the Scandinavian bloc, fuel consumption accounts for 46 per cent. of the total cut.</P>
    <P>To drive the point home, let us compare our position with that of Denmark&mdash;I suggest Denmark because it is another small country with a comparatively small population and with a prime reliance on agriculture for its economy.  Denmark at the moment has an average yield per acre almost three times the European average and 9.1 per cent. of the country is under forest.  It is authoritatively stated that &ldquo;the demands for afforestation in Denmark have been fully satisfied&rdquo;.  One would not expect to find material for a favourable comparison here.  But with over one-third of Denmark's forests hardwoods giving a lower yield and with 62 per cent. of the total forest area privately-owned, 27 per cent. being held by 18,000 proprietors of small-holdings the net Danish yield is only 24 cubic feet per person as compared with the anticipated future Irish yield of 30½ cubic feet per person from a planting programme of even 15,000 acres.  Take into account the facts that 38 per cent. of the total cut in Denmark is at present devoted to firewood and that a much higher proportion of Denmark's population is industrially employed with a higher potential consumption of industrial timber and the comparison becomes even more favourable.</P>
    <P>The picture I have just presented is in such striking contrast with our <Col N="810" /> present impoverished state as to call for further explanation.  The explanation is simple.  Our very impoverishment has left us in the position that most of our modern plantations are of fast-growing conifers and all of our plantations are being laid down and developed as a State undertaking on lines calculated to give maximum yield with the added advantage that climatic conditions afford a prospect of an unusually high yield even for fully-stocked forest.  Our misfortune of to-day is, therefore, paradoxically also the basis of a healthy position in the future.  That position is already assured and we can take pride in the solid progress that has been made and the even greater progress planned for the future.</P>
    <P>Now let us recapitulate briefly.  I have tried in all that I have said to avoid any political scoring.  I cannot alter cold fact and it is cold fact that it was the first inter-Party Government which inaugurated our present vigorous forestry policy but I have been at pains to show that the Fianna Fáil Government which held office from 1951 to 1954 is due full credit for following the inter-Party Government's lead and that that Government should not be blamed for the slowing down of fresh planting during their period of office.  As we stand to-day the only real issues are: How much can we do?  And how fast can we do it?  Since the Forestry Service was given the signal to go ahead seven years ago very substantial progress has been made&mdash;spectacular progress in the light of the interim expansion of work in the existing plantations&mdash; and there is a guarantee of even further progress at a steady and appreciable rate in the years ahead. We have passed the stage where our establishment of forest was lagging behind possible future timber needs but our planting rate will continue to rise to the original 1948 target of 25,000 acres which will be reached in 1959-60.</P>
    <P>Thereafter the position will be reviewed in the light, <i>inter alia</i>, of the degree of success attending experimental work in the western counties. If that work has not proved successful some modification in the planting rate <Col N="811" /> may be inevitable; if it has prospered, a further increase is not out of the question.  That is a practical common-sense view of to-day's situation.  It concentrates on the attainment now and over the coming ten to 20 years of the maximum we can hope to achieve and leaves it open to the Government of the day to determine what should be done, say, in 40 years' time to fulfil national needs in 90 years' time. In a rapidly changing world we cannot, to-day, usefully consider the detailed requirements of our country in the middle of the next century.</P>
    <P>That development programme is the one which, in the considered opinion of the Government, represents the most exact compliance with the national interest consistent with realistic possibilities.  In being prepared to undertake a definite commitment on the lines set out, the Government is confident that the forestry service, to which the real credit for the progress of recent years is due, will meet fully the increasing demand made upon it. In this connection, I think I should point out that the forestry service always fulfils its declared planting programmes.  How many big undertakings can claim that distinction?</P>

      <P>Personally, I think it would have prolonged the discussion a good deal.  I have no feelings about that one way or the other, but the Government seem to be anxious to get their business through and, as an Opposition with experience of the difficulties of Government, which do not tend to decrease as time goes on, we would like to facilitate our friends as much as possible.  If they are working hard&mdash;and I hope they are&mdash;they are certainly entitled to the usual relaxation that comes by way of a good holiday.</P>
      <P>The Minister's very thorough and full review of forestry from many different angles, from the point of view of the work of the Department, of forestry in the national economy, of what we are aiming at, what we can accomplish, what, having regard to all the circumstances, we ought to attempt, what targets we ought to place before the forestry service&mdash;all these matters afford ample scope for a very lengthy discussion. I cannot avoid answering some of the points the Minister has made.  In spite of the anxiety which he has professed that he does not wish to make any political capital out of his work in the forestry service, I am afraid that I detected a considerable political slant in a good many of his statements.</P>
      <P>No doubt Ministers are entitled to make the best case they can for themselves, but if they could do so without denigrating the work of those whose co-operation they are seeking in the acceptance of a general national policy, that would be all the better.  We could spend a great deal of time denigrating what has been done in the past. I think our attitude ought to be rather to take the situation as it presents itself to us at present and see exactly how we stand, what are the prospects for the future, in what way can we adjust matters or improve them, having regard to our experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world is in the position at present that we have very great changes coming on very rapidly.  Therefore, it is no wonder that the best laid schemes of Ministers &ldquo;gang aft agley&rdquo;.  Prophecies and guarantees are not always fulfilled, or capable of fulfilment, because <Col N="813" /> new circumstances arise.  For example, there is no reference made, except a very passing one, to the fact that during a great part of the period during which the Administration to which I belonged held office we had a world war.</P>

      <P>Deputies can take the period since we first had forestry in this country and say that things have improved enormously since the last war ceased.  Of course.  Why should they not?  The White Paper the Minister referred to was presented in connection with the American aid programme, so far as I remember.  That American aid programme had not been there and O.E.E.C. had not been set up.  The Minister's Government were in the position that they happened to come into office just at the time the arrangements had been made in connection with Marshall Aid.  They gained the fruits, if they were fruits. The future will tell what the fruits of Marshall aid may be and what the ultimate advantage to this country was of that expenditure, whether it was expended in the best way possible and whether we got the best results from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate there is very little reference in the Minister's statement to the fact that the Administration in which he was first responsible for forestry had that advantage.  It was, of course, in the buoyant feeling that all these millions of dollars were to be made available that they said they were going to have a wonderful forestry programme that would put anything thought of by their predecessors in the shade.  The White Paper on E.R.P., issued by the Minister for External Affairs on 20th December, 1948, contained the first public pronouncement about a 25,000 acres per annum programme.  It was in that setting that it was announced.  As far as I know, and I made inquiries about that matter when I held office as Minister for Lands, no firm directive was given to the Department in regard to the implementation of that programme <Col N="814" /> for a considerable time afterwards.</P>
    <P>On 27th April, 1949, at column 49, Volume 115, of the Official Report, the Minister introducing his Estimate for the Forestry Division, stated that it did not include provision for 25,000 acres per annum.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the reserve of unplanted land on hands exceeds 25,000 acres the necessary transplants are not available either in the State or commercial nurseries and as transplants are normally three years old when planted out a certain interval must elapse before the necessary stocks can be raised.  In the meantime, the rate of purchase of land must be stepped up to at least 30,000 acres a year and it would be preferable to increase the rate for the next three years to 50,000 acres or thereabouts in order to build up the necessary reserve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We can admit that there was a feeling in 1951 that an effort ought to be made to come closer to a programme of 25,000 acres.  It was not possible to do it and it was suggested&mdash;I think against the advice of the forestry experts&mdash;that a target of 20,000 acres ought to be aimed at.  That could not be achieved, because, as I have stated here before, even taxing the resources of the organisation of the Forestry Branch to the utmost, it was not possible to do more than 15,000 acres or thereabouts per annum.</P>
    <P>In referring frequently to the fact that the aim of the Fianna Fáil Government before the war was to attain a target of 10,000 acres, the Minister now, several years after this aim of 25,000 acres had first been spoken of, has announced that we have still a planting programme of 15,000 acres which is to be increased to 17,500 acres by stages during the next few years. However, the House must remember that about one-third, if not more, of those 15,000 acres is due to mechanical planting&mdash;work done by heavy plough which was introduced in the period of the first Coalition Administration.  But the point is that the work that was done in the ordinary way by manual labour is substantially the same now as it was then.  Any increase in <Col N="815" /> respect of bog areas has been by way of mechanical work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is right, how can he account for the fact that there are more than 5,000 people employed now as against 2,000 then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than 5,000 employed now, and, when I entered the Department, there were 5,000 employed.  One of the reasons for that is that before the war we had a big employment content during the planting season, but during the rest of the year we had not the same numbers.  Then you had not this continuous work of which the Minister has spoken.  He has referred to the huge increase in employment and expenditure with reference to the stepping up of the programme of thinning during the past few years.  Of course, we are all very anxious to get the utmost employment in the forestry services and, as Deputy MacBride has reminded me of it, I might perhaps mention some of the figures given here by the Minister in his introductory statement to-day.</P>
      <P>He said that an average of 5,149 men were employed on forestry in the first ten weeks of this year, compared with an average of 4,373 men in the corresponding period last year.  That is a very substantial increase.  He also said that the aggregate provision of £1,370,000 should enable labour staffs to be increased at peak this year to over 5,500, but that an increase in wage levels beyond that contemplated when the Estimate was framed might give rise to the need for a Supplementary Estimate later in the year.  The planting programme next year is to be 17,500 acres.  Then we have the thinning programme which is 11,000 acres during the current year and is to be 13,000 acres during the coming year. We have also road-making and the building of houses in which connection the Minister has not given us any indication that any very large programme is in contemplation.  We should like to have more information on these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the fact of providing our <Col N="816" /> foresters with proper houses, we should like to know what is the position with regard to the establishment of communities of forestry workers.  If the forestry workers and the forestry service are to be utilised as an agency for revitalising the rural areas that are being depopulated, we should like to see communities established, as Bord na Móna has been trying to do.  The trouble with these communities is that they are wage earners and unless they are provided with regular employment and fairly attractive conditions they are not likely to remain.  However, it is desirable that, first, they should have proper housing accommodation; secondly, that these houses should be established for a community as far as possible; and, thirdly, that they should, if possible, be worked in with the economy of our smallholders or congests, so that the people working in the forests would either work their own little holdings or would be provided with plots by the Forestry Branch to enable them to do a certain amount in the way of agriculture if only to provide for their own needs and those of their families.  We have received no indication as to whether the Government has considered that in connection with the Report of the Commission on Emigration and Population which is a matter of great public interest at the present time.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of labour, the Report of the British Forestry Commissioners for 1954 indicates that they acquired 77,000 acres, and planted 70,000 acres; the thinnings amounted to 36,000 acres and over 5,000 acres were clear felled; 277 miles of road were made and 272 houses were built.  The labour corps was 13,612 of which 5.3 thousand belonged to England and 5,000 to Scotland.  Our activities in forestry are very widely scattered over 160 or more comparatively small plantations, many of which I know do not afford hope of expansion. The position in my time at any rate&mdash;the Minister will be able to let us know whether it has improved&mdash;was that you had not the land in the better-off areas.  They might not be considered first-class agricultural areas but as compared with the bog and mountainous areas in the West of <Col N="817" /> Ireland, where we are acquiring thousands of acres of land, these areas would be considered as being fairly good.</P>
    <P>In connection with this whole question of the annual target, as the Minister has rightly pointed out there is no use in having spasmodic fluctuations on any considerable scale, of jumping up by several thousand acres for a year or two and then having to reduce your target after that.  Everybody knows that you have to have a reserve of three times the annual planting programme. The Minister has announced that it is the intention to plant 17,500 acres next year, but he has fewer than 50,000 acres.  If our forests were concentrated in larger blocks, it would be easy enough, perhaps, to go near the three years' reserve and to treat that as a figure you could work on, but I think Mr. Cameron himself has said that it is not a reserve of three years but of about seven years you would require.  In other words, before any programme of expansion is carried on, the forestry people must know what they are going to work on, what they have on hands and what they are likely to have in five years' time.  They have reached the position in England now that they have planted more than they have acquired and they regard that as a very serious position.</P>
    <P>The Minister says on page 8 of his brief:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most immediate difficulty was not directly related to the new planting target.  I refer to the increasing management needs of the existing State Forest plantations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was the big difficulty not, on the one hand, that, while we were not attending properly to the maintenance of the existing plantations and were allowing our thinning operations to get greatly into arrears, with very deleterious effects on the forests and very grave consequences indeed, on the other hand we were not getting the intake of land that we had hoped for?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the fact that Mr. Cameron referred to the comparatively small acreage of the individual acquisition.  The average in <Col N="818" /> the three year period 1950 to 1953 was only 104 acres, and in the three year period 1953 to 1956 it had fallen to 71 acres.  Not alone was there the same amount of trouble and the same administrative costs dealing with each of those individual transactions as if they were ten times larger in area, but, of course, when it came to dealing with them and taking them into the forestry set-up there was all the tremendous additional cost of fencing those comparatively small areas as compared with the tremendous economy that would be secured if land in blocks of 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 acres could be got, which would also facilitate you if it were that type of land on which you could use machinery to the very best advantage.  If you could use those machines on a run of half a mile or a mile, you could obviously do much better work more economically, and get a better return, than if you were working your machines on comparatively small runs.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us now, that he has 49,000 acres in hands to undertake this programme of 17,500 acres next year, increasing by 2,500 acres per year until he reaches the target he hopes for of 25,000 acres.  &ldquo;If, however, the rate of planting is to be further stepped up,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;as I propose, the rate of acquisition must rise even more sharply, so that the plantable reserve, now 49,000 acres, may be maintained in proper minimum ratio to the planting rate.  I cannot guarantee that such an increased intake of land will prove practicable.&rdquo;  I do not know what that means.  Does it mean that the Minister has doubts as to whether it will prove practicable, or does he simply mean: &ldquo;If you want to bind me to give an absolute guarantee that I can get this land, of course I cannot give it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is understandable, and one can sympathise with the Minister in that whatever steps it may have been necessary to take since the Forestry Act was passed, sufficient time, perhaps, has not elapsed to enable us to judge fully what land is likely to come in. But, on the following page, the Minister tells us that the Department <Col N="819" />&ldquo;will do its best and at this stage I, and the Government, believe we should plan for the future, on the assumption that sufficient land can and will be acquired.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on then to refer to the fact that, with regard to this peat land, there seems to be still some doubt as to the results likely to be obtained.  It is not the first time that the Minister has expressed doubts. In a reference to the new experimental station down in the Bangor-Erris area, the Minister told us at column 1685, Volume 157:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a matter of information for the House, I should like to say that the forestry technicians in my Department are doubtful about the possibility of even growing trees on the 20 or 30 acres of that bog that have already been treated.  It took a certain amount of urging on my part to get them to deal with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that the technical officers of the Department are being allowed to exercise their own judgment in the matter, or does it mean that the Minister is pushing them into planting where their own judgment and experience leads them to believe they are not going to have very satisfactory results?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It means the latter.  I did some pushing, and I am proud of it.  On the other hand, I highly commend the officials for their readiness in pointing out to me when I might be making a mistake.</P>

      <P>Last year, the Minister tells us, the application of new technique to the large areas in the West was experimental in the first instance and until developments established whether the new methods would produce good timber at an economic cost, the whole future of this new development had to remain in doubt.  But on other occasions the Minister has told us, at column 878, Volume 151, that &ldquo;astonishingly good results&rdquo; have been obtained in Cloosh.  I am all in favour, of course, of developing those areas, but I should like to know what is the settled and final judgment of the <Col N="820" /> Minister's officers as to the possibilities of those areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was in the Department, I was told that those bog areas should be about 1,000 acres in extent, that the timber growth would be exceedingly slow, and that at least 20 years would elapse before the weeding and pruning stage would arrive.  In fact, it was stated, with regard to the mechanical operations, that cleaning operations on those raised mounds would not be required and that once the plants were put own, there would be no further work for a considerable period of years.  I do not know why the Minister, then, said that we had astonishingly good results in Cloosh.</P>
      <P>One would like to have something more definite when the Minister is replying as to what the feeling of his officers is with regard to Cloosh and Nephin and the West Donegal areas, because he says that, if this experimental work is not deemed to be successful, it means that we shall be driven back on trying to secure land under the Plantable Land Survey of 1949 in the other areas of the country.</P>
      <P>He also emphasises that of the 1,200,000 acres returned by the survey, it is very conjectural just what proportion of that acreage is really plantable land, and, if it is, that there is then the question whether it could be acquired or not.  &ldquo;It is anybody's guess,&rdquo; the Minister says, &ldquo;how much of the land covered by the plantable land survey will ultimately come into the ownership of the Forestry Service.  Prudence would not suggest an assumption that most of it can, and will, be brought under forest crops within 50 years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hence my appeal that the areas which we are told the Department of Agriculture from their experience definitely exclude from the area of arable land, potential agricultural land-hillsides and so on&mdash;should be acquired and <Col N="821" /> utilised for forestry purposes, thereby giving the Minister's Department the necessary reserve and enabling them to go ahead in the confident belief that they will be able to build up this target of 25,000 acres and not have to recede from it within a few years' time to a much smaller figure.</P>
    <P>Of course one has to make the point in connection with that that presumably at some time or other if the 25,000 acre target has been attained, it may no longer be possible, perhaps, to maintain it.  It could not be maintained indefinitely, but I think the point is whether it can be maintained over a reasonable period of ten, 15 or 20 years.  He says that a steady planting of 25,000 acres for 25 years and a drop thereafter to, say, 12,500 acres would, however, be a serious violation of the principle.  As we are not likely to be here in 25 years' time perhaps it is really only an academic question, but why bother about what may happen in 25 years' time?  The question is whether the Minister in his time, and his successor in his time, and his successor's succesor, will be able to maintain this 25,000 acre programme over a period of 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that a very large amount of the land which has not come in is the subject of negotiation and he thinks that, having regard to the figure giving the total acreage which is the subject of negotiation and consideration, he is very likely to get a better result.  The result this year seems to indicate an improvement of only about 1,000 acres.  The Minister has said that the average intake was about 16,500 acres for the past three years.  That does not indicate that we have improved a great deal.  It may take time, as I have said, but the Minister should be in a position to tell us whether, as a result of the forestry Act, his prognostication that acquisition under the new Act would mean that the intake would be stepped up so as to please the most enthusiastic Deputy is likely to be fulfilled.  He said that he was not holding out any false hopes, although early last year he told us that the pool tended to dry up.  It seems to me that the Minister's hopes <Col N="822" /> now seem to concentrate in very great measure indeed upon the result of the operations of the Forestry Act.  We will have to depend to a very great extent on getting the necessary reserve of land from the work of the Minister and his officials in bringing these commonages into the pool for afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>Dealing with North Mayo, may I remind the House that there were 113,000 acres stated to be suitable for planting in Mayo?  We do not know, of course, what proportion of that will be available.  I am sure the Minister, with his well-known interest in his native county, has gone into this matter in some more detail but I noticed that of the 5,000 or 6,000 acres in hand in the Glenamoy-Ballycastle area possibly none at all may be plantable in the long run.  One wonders, therefore, whether the anticipations of the Minister that he will be all right so far as the intake and the reserve of land are concerned will be fulfilled.  We may have land acquired but whether it will be land that will produce timber, timber that can be sold at a reasonably good price, is another question.</P>
    <P>About one half of the area in this plantable survey, say about 600,000 acres, was said to be suitable only for mechanical operation; perhaps another 200,000 or 300,000 may be found suitable. One would like to know whether in the areas that Mr. Cameron actually saw, in company with the Department of Agriculture representative&mdash;Wolfhill, the Galtees, the Comeragh-Knockmealdown, South Kilkenny and the Leinster Chain&mdash;prospects have improved in any degree.  He considered these areas to be very well suited for the production of timber, and he meant timber.  When we understand that forests in his experience had been grown on fairly high altitudes of up to 1,400 feet, there is no reason why, if the Department is actively concerned about areas like the Leinster Chain, we should not have substantial plantations built up there.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister that the income from the sales of timber is increasing and that he hopes to get in £250,000 this year.  That is a very substantial sum.  I noticed a <Col N="823" /> reference in a publication recently to the fact that a factory had been opened in Scotland for the conversion of various thinnings into chipboard for use in furniture making and building. It was opened at Annan in September last.  When in full production the factory will use 400 tons of timber per week to make about 250,000 square feet of board.  Experiments are also being carried out in parts of Scotland with a view to growing bamboo for the production of rayon pulp.  This may be undertaken on a large scale with financial assistance from the rayon industry if the experiments are successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to pit prop sales and I am glad to hear that they have improved.  Perhaps he would be good enough to tell us what proportion of the sales are taken by regular contract or regular dealings with the factories here.  Would he look into this matter and perhaps ask some of the officers of his Department to cross over to Scotland, where conditions seem to be somewhat similar to what we have here, and see what is being done there, not alone with regard to the utilisation of the timber but also with regard to the extraction, which is a very costly and tortuous business?  I can only assume that over there, having regard to the fact that they were able to deal with huge areas in which timber had been knocked down in storms a few years ago, and were able to clear out these areas and dispose of the timber, they have modern mechanical equipment for that purpose.  If we pay some more attention to that aspect, it will perhaps enable the Minister to increase his receipts still further.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask whether the sawmills are paying their way and whether there are any figures available which would indicate what the profit is.  As far as I can see sales are roughly equivalent to expenditure. Whether or not we agree that forestry should be handed over to a semi-State or commercial board, I think we can all agree that, as far as possible, operations like sawmilling are profitable. Obviously, commercial accounts can be rendered in regard to them&mdash;<Col N="824" /> probably they are rendered to the Minister&mdash;and we should like to know whether in fact a profit is being made or whether the sawmills are being run as a social service.  I am all in favour of social services where necessary but there should be a line drawn in regard to a great many of the activities of our Departments and our State boards clearly indicating where social service ends and commercial service begins.</P>
    <P>At what point do we begin to take into consideration the question of getting a return for the taxpayer for the expenditure involved?  At what point do we begin to consider in reality the problem of investing as much capital as we have&mdash;and it is very limited in our present circumstances&mdash;in the most effective way so that it will give the best return and ultimately make more wealth available for other capital purposes?  The expenditure is very substantial and it is satisfactory that it is going in such large degree in wages and in payment of labour.  If it were equally distributed all over the country and if the western areas could get even a larger share of what is being spent, nobody would be better pleased than myself.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question recently, the Minister indicated that in the year ending 31st March, 1951, the expenditure was £452,000.  The following year it was £667,000.  The next year it was £745,000.  The next year it was £891,000.  The next year it was £972,000 and last year it was £1,195,000. Thus, there has been an increase of more than two and a half times in the expenditure on labour in the past six years.  I think that very satisfactory, particularly for areas and constituencies like County Wicklow, which, owing to their circumstances, have the advantage that larger sums are spent there than perhaps in several counties in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister about the position with regard to head labourers. Are they receiving the same wage generally in all areas; have their rates the same relation in all areas to the wage of the ordinary labourer; and what is the position of the head labourer <i>vis-á-vis</i> a forest foreman? <Col N="825" /> One of the advantages of a service where you have such a large corps of labour is that, where you have good men, every inducement should be afforded to them to remain in the service.  One of the ways in which we can do that is by promotion for those who have shown they are energetic and capable of doing the work and capable of undertaking added responsibilities. I am entirely in favour of giving these men every opportunity to go ahead.  It is for that reason that I should like the Minister to let us know the position as regards head labourers' wages and the position as regards forest foremen and whether the opportunities for promotion to these posts are freely open to the ordinary workers in the plantations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry it has not been possible to discuss, in conjunction with this Estimate, the two motions which were put down, together with the amendments by the Opposition and by the Minister.  I think it would be helpful if we could have a comprehensive discussion.  However, no doubt we shall have that opportunity later on.</P>
      <P>As the House is no doubt aware, we have been pressing very hard for the implementation of the annual planning programme of 25,000 acres&mdash;a programme which was in fact adopted, as the Minister pointed out, by the inter-Party Government in 1948.  I therefore welcome the announcement by the Minister to-day that that target is now accepted and that it is proposed to achieve it by the year 1959-60.  I compliment the Minister on having jacked up the plantation rate this year to 17,500 acres.  I feel the Minister deserves full credit for having done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned with devoting a lot of time to looking back on what has been done&mdash;or rather, on what has not been done&mdash;in regard to forestry by successive Governments.  I think I can say, however, that what was not done by Irish Governments from 1922-48 in regard to afforestation will stand forever as an indictment of our own Governments.  A short-sighted policy was pursued which cannot be excused. <Col N="826" /> Deputy Derrig mentioned the war as one of the reasons for the lack of progress in afforestation.  The war did not last 20 years.  I am not prepared to accept the various reasons which were put forward as to why forestry should have come practically to a standstill during the war period.  It is, therefore, a matter for congratulation that we seem to have reached at last the position where we can see the target of 25,000 acres a year being reached in the near future.  I would naturally prefer that that target should have been reached by now.  However, I suppose it is not unreasonable to propose now that by additional annual increments of 2,500 acres a year, the 25,000 acres per year target will be reached by 1959-60.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly impatient in regard to the lack of progress on the part of the Forestry Division because the advantages of forestry to our economy are so obvious.  It is the one aspect of our development about which there is now no longer any controversy. It is the one type of productive investment in which we can forge ahead without doubt or hesitation.  We lack raw materials upon which to base industrial developments and timber is probably the most important raw material in the modern economy.  It is the raw material which forms the basis of many different industries.  We have the land, the climate and the manpower necessary to produce that raw material, but, for some extraordinary reason it has been practically impossible, despite the agreement of all the Parties, to have enough progress made.</P>
    <P>Forestry has the highest labour content of any public work undertaken by the Government.  By far the largest proportion of expenditure on forestry is expended on wages.  The employment it provides is a continuing and productive employment.  We are only too painfully aware at the moment of the imbalance in our trade.  We import vast quantities of timber and timber products which, were it not for the shortsightedness of successive Governments, could have been produced in this country, if an active forestry policy had been initiated in time and if it had been actively pursued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> The Minister is quite correct in saying that the present forestry policy, the present drive, dates from 1948 and the Minister is entitled to full credit for the improvement which has taken place in the plantation rate.  My only regret is that the rate of improvement has not been greater.  I have to voice some words of criticism in regard to the operations of the Forestry Division, but, in doing so, I want to make it clear that I do not blame the Minister entirely.  A large proportion of the Minister's brief was devoted to what might be described as an apologia for the lack of progress in the past.  I am not really concerned with that, save in so far as I feel it is well to point out that some of the reasons advanced for the lack of progress will not be accepted in future.</P>
    <P>We have been told, for instance, that the retrogression in forestry which took place after 1951 was due to the fact that thinning and maintenance operations had got into arrears, and that, instead of planting, the Forestry Division had to devote its time to maintenance work, which it should have been doing all along.  That explanation is nonsensical.  There is no shortage of labour in this country.  If more maintenance and thinning work had to be done, it would have been an easy matter to recruit the necessary labour force to do it.  We have been told that a shortage of staff and trained foresters impeded progress. Surely one of the elementary things to provide for, when you are planning any development programme, be it an industrial or agricultural programme, is to provide for the training of the people you require.</P>
    <P>There is no type of development which can lend itself to such detailed and accurate planning as forestry. Obviously it is work that has to be planned several years ahead.  You know fairly accurately how many men you will require in one year's time or in two years', five years' or ten years' time, to implement a certain programme. You know how many foresters you will need, how many plants you will use, how many acres of land you will use, and therefore it is easy to <Col N="828" /> plan for these requirements in advance. I do not, therefore, accept the excuse put forward, in retrospect, on behalf of the Department, which is based on the inadequacy of its planning and of its training facilities, any more than I accept any excuse based on the fact that the work of thinning and maintenance was neglected.  It should not have been neglected.</P>
    <P>I think I detected a suggestion that possibly it would be unwise to increase too rapidly for fear labour might be absorbed too rapidly.  I may be wrong in that.  It seems to me that, if that suggestion is there, it is obviously one that cannot stand examination.  I have dealt with these matters, not by way of criticism of the Minister but merely to give a clear indication that I, for one, will not be prepared to accept these matters as an excuse for failure to implement the programme which has now been decided upon.</P>
    <P>In speaking in the House before on forestry, I indicated that the fertility with which excuses for non-performance of forestry programmes in the past were made was practically unequalled. I enumerated many of the reasons advanced in the past.  I think it would be well if we now made up our minds that this programme which the Minister announced will be implemented and that no excuse will be accepted from anybody in regard to it, whether it is barbed wire, rabbits, hatchets, shortage of labour, arrears of thinning, arrears of maintenance.  Let us forget all about these excuses and make up our minds that we will not accept them in future.</P>
    <P>I think also&mdash;I shall not deal with this to-night because it will come up separately on a motion which we have tabled&mdash;that by and large the Minister's statement, when analysed and examined, really makes the case for the unsuitability of a Civil Service Department to handle a vast commercial undertaking such as forestry. However, we shall have an opportunity of discussing that in full when the motion which stands in my name comes to be discussed by the House, so I shall not deal with it in detail to-night. I merely want to mention that the Minister's very comprehensive <Col N="829" /> statement in my view really reinforces the view which I have so often expressed inside and outside this House as to the need to take forestry away from the Civil Service machine.</P>
    <P>References were made by the Minister and also by Deputy Derrig to the rate of plantation elsewhere and the progress made elsewhere.  It is well that we should compare briefly the rate of progress here with the rate of progress, say, in Britain.  In 1954, in Britain, the Forestry Commission planted close on 78,000 acres.  In addition, some 19,000 acres were planted privately, mainly through State-aided schemes of one kind or another or with the help of grants.  That is, in all, a total of close on 97,000 acres were planted in 1954.  That is more than six times what we planted.</P>
    <P>The total land area of Britain is 52,000,000 acres compared with our 17,000,000 acres or, in other words, the land area of Britain is about three times our land area.  Yet, Britain planted an area six times the area we planted.  Her area is three times the size of our area but she planted six times what we planted.  The amount of wasteland in Britain is smaller than the amount of wasteland here.  Yet, the area under forestry in Britain is much higher than the area under forestry here.  Nearly 6½ per cent. of the total area of Britain is under forestry whereas we have approximately 1½ per cent. of our area under forestry.</P>
    <P>We have the distinction of having the smallest percentage of our land under timber of any country in Europe. If the progress of British forestry is to be taken as a yardstick, we should plant considerably more than we even plan to plant now.  Yet, there is no comparison between the economic requirements of Britain and our economic requirements.  Britain is mainly an industrialised nation.  She suffers from overfull employment and does not require to create more employment, while we suffer from one of the highest rates of unemployment and emigration in Europe and, therefore, forestry is of particular importance to our economy as a means of increasing production on <Col N="830" /> the one hand and of providing employment on the other hand.  I mention that because I think Deputy Derrig was suggesting that we were doing as well as Britain in regard to forestry. I think that would be completely wrong.  Proportionately, we are doing much less.</P>
    <P>The Minister has devoted a great proportion of his speech to pointing out all the difficulties.  Of course there are difficulties in forestry.  Of course there are difficulties in any type of productive enterprise we wish to set up but do not tell me that these difficulties cannot be overcome.  The British Forestry Commission, I am sure, faces much greater difficulties by reason of the vast area with which they have to deal and the huge programme they are trying to implement.  They are planting over 5,000,000 acres as compared with our 1,000,000 acres.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters of detail and one or two suggestions I should like to bring to the Minister's notice.  First, I think the time has come when the Minister should really urge the Government to increase substantially the grant given to private individuals who undertake afforestation. Not only should that grant be increased but an effort should be made to persuade farmers throughout the country to avail of it and to go in for private planting themselves.  That is one of the cheapest ways in which forestry can be increased and increased rapidly.  I may be wrong but I have a suspicion at the back of my mind that the Department does not publicise the availability of this grant, that the Department does not like very much paying out this grant to private people. I may be wrong in that but I have a feeling that it is not one of the things that are publicised.  I have not seen any advertisement with regard to it or any propaganda from official sources seeking to speed up private planting by the farmers of the country.  A good deal more could be done in that direction and it would pay dividends.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been silent on this occasion in regard to one of the longstanding grievances which I have had for a number of years in regard to the administration of the Forestry Department. <Col N="831" /> There used to be a director of forestry who was a technical man and who was in charge of forestry operations. Since the last director of forestry retired, the post has been vacant and there has been no director of forestry.  It is true that through one of the devices that occur in administration&mdash;the Minister is not responsible for it&mdash;when the post of the director of forestry disappeared an additional assistant secretary appeared on the Book of Estimates for the Department of Lands.  Was there some type of barter or arrangement whereby we would do away with the post of director of forestry and have an additional higher civil servant instead?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is essential that we should have a director of forestry, a technical man who would be in charge of the technical work of forestry.  I will be told immediately that there are forestry inspectors and a chief inspector of forestry.  I have no criticism to offer in regard to their work.  I am sure that they are extremely competent and able men but it seems ridiculous that, at a time when we are expanding the forestry programme, we should do away with the director of forestry.  It may be, I do not know, that we have nobody suitable to fill the post.  If we have not, let us get somebody from elsewhere, but let us have a director of forestry.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would ask the Minister to give special attention is the question of forest thinnings and maintenance operations.  I have heard criticism, I do not know whether well-founded or not&mdash;I give it without adequate information to back it up&mdash; that in some areas thinning and maintenance operations have fallen into arrears.  If that is so, it is a completely false economy.  If that is so, additional men should be recruited to do the thinning and maintenance operations. I trust the Minister will not allow any question of economy to prevent the maintenance work from being carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Derrig really appreciated what he was saying in regard to employment in <Col N="832" /> forestry.  I think he tried to suggest that there has been no increase in employment in forestry.  The position is that when the present Minister for Lands took over that Department in 1948 about 2,000 men were employed in forestry.  The position now is that this year there will be 5,500 men employed in forestry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig also said that though the target of 25,000 acres a year was decided upon at the end of 1948, no steps had been taken or no direction had been given in regard to it. That is not in accordance with the facts.  The target of 25,000 acres was decided upon by the Government, was approved of by the House, and steps were taken by the then Minister, who is also the present Minister, to have that target implemented.  I think it is well to correct these statements because there is always a danger that if you allow them to go unchallenged people will come to accept them as facts.  However, I do not want to sound acrimonious to-night.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given the House a definite assurance that the target of 25,000 acres a year will be reached by the year 1959-60.  I think that we can compliment the Minister for having given us that assurance.  Those of us who have been advocating forestry for years back can also feel somewhat happy that we are at last, with the help of the Minister, reaching a position where we will at least plant 25,000 acres a year.  Let there be no slip.</P>
    <P>Let us make certain that that target is achieved.  I shall reserve anything I have to say in regard to the best methods of running forestry, whether it should be done by a board, by a forestry commission, by a separate Ministry or by one of the existing boards such as Bord na Móna, for another occasion when I hope we will have time for a much fuller discussion on the subject.  In the meantime, I should like the Minister to consider that question seriously so that, when we have a debate on it, we shall be able to have a pretty authoritative view from the Government with their reasons for or against each of the proposals submitted to us and then we shall be in a position to take a final decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán MacBride was very disturbed on the occasion of the debate on this Estimate a year ago because the Minister could not give him a guarantee that the target would be eventually 25,000 acres.  Having regard to the statement made by the Minister this evening, I think he has set out on what I might call a five-year plan.  Deputy MacBride always harps upon a five-year plan or a ten-year plan which is perhaps, a very good idea.  Last year we planted 15,000 acres, this year 17,500 or 18,000 acres, next year, perhaps, 21,000 acres and the year following 25,000 acres.  I hope Deputy MacBride does not mean that a halt is being called at 25,000 acres.</P>

      <P>In this country forests were cut down especially during the first world war.  At that time there was no provision made for replanting. Fortunately for us now, a rule has been brought in by our own Government that whenever a tree is cut down trees must be planted in its stead.  An alien Government had no interest in the afforestation of this country.  The comparison Deputy MacBride made in connection with the planting target in England and in this country at the present time is not a proper comparison because, I think, that even before the first world war about 18 per cent. of Britain was under trees whereas in this country there would be only something in the neighbourhood of 1 per cent. at any time.  In fact, as far as I remember when an Irish Government was established, there was in this country only something like .2 of 1 per cent. under afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose our own Government, when set up first, had many other things to deal with and, therefore, not very much progress was made.  Deputy MacBride was perfectly correct in saying that until 1948 very little progress at all was made in afforestation, a project which should be of the greatest importance to this country.  Not only would it give employment in rural areas which is very necessary&mdash;indeed, afforestation is the one and only type of permanent employment which would <Col N="834" /> be available in rural areas&mdash;but it would also beautify the country and have a wonderful effect on its climate and prevent which I might call mountain or land erosion.  Eventually, when the trees matured, we would have in this country a sufficient quantity of timber of various kinds so that there would be no necessity to import it.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the benefit that would be especially in time of war when shipping would be scarce or perhaps not available at all.  It would mean that we could carry on building or any other activity in which timber would be so much required without having to import it.  From the point of view of climate and preventing land erosion it would be invaluable.  Deputy MacBride referred to the effect it would have on our balance of payments. I take it that in value the import of timber would perhaps be, next to petrol, the most expensive commodity that we have to bring into this country from abroad.  While there are difficulties in reaching the target which we all desire, certainly no effort should be spared to plant the maximum number of acres from year to year until eventually we reach the percentage required in this country where we have so much land&mdash;not all arable land but land suitable for planting.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must always remember that while there would be a great deal of land which would not be arable though very suitable for planting, there are other activities like sheep farming with which we must not interfere in reaching our target of 25,000, 30,000 or 50,000 acres eventually per annum.  I am sure that while it is desirable to have this target in view everybody will agree that the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands finds it difficult to secure land suitable for planting.  I believe that the forestry section has powers to acquire land compulsorily but has never exercised those powers.  Perhaps that is only right but it seems we must really depend on voluntary offers of land for afforestation.  Even when land is offered voluntarily, as Deputy Derrig stated, it may or may not be an uneconomic proposition to acquire anything less than 100 acres because of <Col N="835" /> fencing and other expenses.  It would be much more desirable if we could acquire areas of 1,000 or 2,000 acres. That would be possible only by taking a number of adjoining holdings offering portions of plantable land so that it could be made into one economic forest.</P>
    <P>At the same time if anybody should offer 50 or 60 acres, if the land is suitable for planting it should not be rejected. The trouble in many cases, and the cause of the delay, is the question of title.  In fact, I know in my own county when land is offered freely there is nearly always a long delay because the landholder who offers the land is not the registered owner and acquisition is delayed.  It is desirable that some means should be adopted to overcome this.  I believe in the last Forestry Act there is a clause by which acquisition can be facilitated where difficulties of title arise.  Perhaps that may help to accelerate acquisition.  I understand that at the present rate of planting the reserve should be something like seven years.  If we are to maintain our goal, it is very necessary that we should have as large a reserve as possible.  I can see difficulties such as those I have mentioned and I feel that if at any time we fail to reach the target decided on in respect of any one year, it could be attributed to difficulties in acquiring land.</P>
    <P>I want to be fair to the Department. During a recent visit I paid to the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands I was agreeably surprised to see that so much land had been offered in South Kerry but I was not so agreeably surprised when I realised the difficulties, the delays and the possibility that it might take some years yet before that land would be available for planting.  I suppose not only are there difficulties and delays regarding the offer of land and its acquisition because of title considerations but there is also the question of finance. We cannot rush forward unless we have financial resources to carry out our commitments in connection with forestry.  I hope the Minister will always do his best to get as large an allocation of finance as possible for his <Col N="836" /> Department.  I am sure he is doing that.</P>
    <P>As regards labour, I understand that we have at present employed on afforestation something like 5,500 men. The number seems small; however, it is a big advance on what it was some years ago, especially prior to 1948. Employment in forestry does not seem to absorb the big numbers that one might expect.  I do not know why this is so, but I do know, as I have seen it in my own area, that even the fencing and draining of 150 or 200 acres sometimes require only five or six men.  There may be a good reason for that.  More men are employed when the time for planting comes round, and while that employment to my mind is not permanent, it is, as nearly as possible, whole-time employment.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that on this question of employment in forestry men who have gained experience by being employed for one or two years on planting are sometimes disemployed&mdash; this applies even to men who have proved themselves satisfactory&mdash;while some others who are inexperienced are brought in.  Also, it may not be fair that farmers and other people who already have gainful employment and a good way of living should get employment in preference to workers who have no other occupation.  I have seen farmers of £20 or £30 valuation, who owned 16 cows, getting employment as gangers in connection with forestry. I do not know whether that is the fault of the forester or some local influence but I think that if the forester is capable and fair no outside interference, political or otherwise, should be allowed to operate in connection with employment in forestry.  This applies also to any other type of employment. If the gangers or those in charge of afforestation are not fair in the allocation of employment they should be removed from office or shifted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride referred to private enterprise in connection with planting. There is an organisation, I know, through which certain grants are given to county committees of agriculture <Col N="837" /> for the planting of shelter belts but I think the amount is only £10 per acre and that has been the amount for years past.  I cannot see why that grant should not be brought under the Department of Lands and increased because everything possible should be done by forestry inspectors and others to get farmers to plant shelter belts. When you tell them, I know they will say: &ldquo;I will be dead when these trees mature&rdquo;, but it is remarkable how quickly trees will grow.  If one visits other countries, one sees that there are always shelter belts in the vicinity of farm houses and farm buildings.  A shelter belt beautifies the home and it is also useful afterwards if the landholder, or the State, requires timber for any purpose.</P>
    <P>If we could plant the percentage of land in this country to compare with other countries in Europe, when those trees matured, we would always have employment for caretakers of the forests, for those carrying out thinning and maintenance and, as the years go on, we would have the cutting down of the trees, the haulage of the timber to the mills, the work in the mills and so on.  I remember reading a book on afforestation at one time&mdash;I forget the name of the author&mdash;in which it was stated that if we had planted about 15 or 16 per cent. of our territory in this country&mdash;by that he meant that that percentage of our area was plantable land&mdash;we would have given work to 250,000 men.  I do not know whether that is correct or not.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of leeway to make up, because, as I stated at the beginning, at the time our own Government was set up this country was entirely denuded of its forests.  That was unfortunate.  A great patriot and writer once said that a country denuded of its trees is a country going to decay.  We have a great deal to make up.  I do not know if the Forestry Division can achieve the objectives it has set itself in regard to the afforestation required.  Several suggestions have been made in regard to the improvements that could be carried out.  While I have the greatest confidence in the Forestry Division as constituted at present, I think, in view of <Col N="838" /> the great success of the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna, that if a forestry board was set up&mdash;a board of experts on afforestation&mdash;that might help to a great extent to further afforestation, but with this proviso: that board should be under the control of the Minister for Lands and be something on the style of C.I.E., the E.S.B. or Board na Móna.  That is a question that can be considered later on.</P>
    <P>Big advances have been made and, if future Ministers continue on the lines laid down by the present Minister, I believe we can be hopeful that, within the next ten, 15 or 20 years, we shall have achieved our full programme of afforestation.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister's statement regarding the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes, but I should like to comment on his reply to a question which was put to him, I think, yesterday.  He stated that the average price per acre for land acquired for afforestation purposes worked out at £6 10s. per acre. I may not have that right, but I think that was the reply to the question.  I have known cases where land&mdash;and very good land&mdash;for afforestation purposes was offered to the Department and they were very slow to come up to the proper price&mdash;the price that would induce farmers and other people to come to an agreement.  I suggest that that question should be examined by the Minister with a view to giving some increase in the present price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of cases where the farmer concerned expects a price of from £10 to £15 per acre and the Department comes along and offers probably £6 per acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree there is a very big difference &mdash;that £6 per acre for good land for afforestation purposes is very low?  I <Col N="839" /> am not suggesting that the Department have not examined this problem very carefully and that, from their point of view, they have given the maximum price.  Nevertheless, the point I am making, and the reason I am making it, is that this may be one of the reasons why we are not getting readily the area of land we require or why we are not getting it without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not losing any land because of the price, and I might add that the price we are giving to most of these people is much greater than they would get on the open market.  That is the reason they are selling to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. I was only making the point to the Minister.  As regards the point made by Deputy Palmer in connection with employment, I agree to this extent, that the number of men employed in a forestry scheme, as far as I am aware, is very low.  The greatest number of men I have seen employed on a forestry scheme in South Kerry was five or six.  When planting operations commenced, that number might be increased, but after a time there would be a reduction again.  On the average, the number employed in forestry schemes in that area is very small.  To make matters worse, when planting is completed, the Department's officials lay off the men and employ what they call maintenance men.  Three or four men are, on an average, selected as maintenance men and are kept on for two years.  Men who have been employed on the planting operations, who have much more experience and who need employment, are passed over when it comes to the selection of maintenance men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the whole position examined by the Minister. Men who have given very satisfactory service to the Forestry Branch should not be passed over when it comes to the employment of maintenance men. Most of these men, in spite of their experience, are on unemployment assistance.  They are excellent workers, but they have no chance whatever of being re-employed by the Department <Col N="840" /> for another two years.  My suggestion is that the Minister's Department should work out a scheme of rotation in regard to the employment of maintenance men.  Men with experience of forestry could be selected and could be given employment in rotation over the two years.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to certain areas in South Kerry where land is being offered for afforestation.  I am glad to be able to state that the response from the farmers down there to the call for land for afforestation has been very encouraging during the past 12 months, and particularly so in the last six months.  I was in communication with the Minister's Department about areas in Caherciveen where large areas of land had been offered and I was informed that, even though the inspector was down there, his report is not yet available to the Department.  The position is that the land offered in these areas will not be taken up before next September. I think that when there is agreement and goodwill between the parties, and when farmers are anxious to give their land, the Department should waste no time in occupying it.  I know it is not easy for the Department to take over land immediately it is offered, but I know also that the reports from the inspectors are subject to great delays and that several months elapse between the time the land is offered and the time the Department make a move.</P>
    <P>Sometimes a year may elapse before the Department are able to tell the farmer concerned that they have decided to make an offer for the land and to establish a forestry centre in the area.  In South Kerry we are very anxious to have another of those centres established.  The establishment of such a centre is very important from the employment viewpoint, as well as for several other reasons. There would be up to 1,000 acres of land in the area which farmers would be willing to offer.  I hope the Minister will look into the position there and make an early decision.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the Minister appealed to Deputies to inform him on the availability of land for afforestation <Col N="841" /> in their respective areas.  Deputy Mrs. Crowley, Deputy Palmer and I interviewed a number of people in an endeavour to get them to communicate with the Department.  We hoped that everything possible would be done, with all possible speed, to meet these people who are anxious to facilitate the Department with offers of land. We are most anxious to see that delays are eliminated; we should like to see the land surveyed as quickly as possible and the inspectors' reports submitted to the Department without delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer referred to political influence in the employment of men. The Minister is aware that I raised a question some time ago about the employment of men in the Caragh Lake district as I understood a certain appointment was clearly a political one.  The man was appointed by the Minister on Deputy Palmer's recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
