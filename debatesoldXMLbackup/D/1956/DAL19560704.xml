      <P>It is proposed to take business as on the Order Paper: Nos. 7 and 8 (Votes 58 to 37, inclusive). Questions will be taken at 3 p.m.  If not already reached, it is proposed to interrupt business from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. to take Item No. 8 (Votes 58 to 37, inclusive) and, when questions are completed, to resume the order.  It is also proposed that consideration of Government business be not interrupted to-day at the time fixed for taking Private Members' business.</P>

      <P>Before you put the Order of Business to the House, I wish to ask the Taoiseach why the Greyhound Industry Bill, which is a non-important measure, having regard to the conditions which now afflict the country and which are disturbing to any person who has an eye to the future, is being proceeded with, why it is proposed to devote no less than 11 hours of Dáil time to consideration of this Bill, a Bill which in itself is a scandal, which, instead of accepting the recommendations of the commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am asking the Taoiseach why this Bill is being proceeded with, in view of the fact that <Col N="154" /> the national transport system is in the gravest difficulties, that it is facing a deficit this year which amounts to £4,000,000.</P>

      <P>I decline to accept the suggestion made by Deputy MacEntee that the Greyhound Racing Bill is a non-important Bill.  It deals with the regulation of an industry which is of very considerable importance to a very large number of people in the country, particularly farmers and more especially small farmers.  It is a matter of the utmost importance that we should get it out of the way and have the business of greyhound racing properly regulated by law.  If the Deputy had not indulged himself in so much obstruction of this Bill, he would not have the complaints he has to make to-day.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 26.</P>
    <P>In Section 26, to add to the section the following new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
    <P>() On the coming into operation of this Act and pending the making by him of the Order under sub-section (6) of this section the Minister shall make an Order appointing an independent qualified person as receiver to administer the affairs of the club.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having moved to report progress on this amendment on the last occasion, I have since gone into the matter fairly fully and I am <Col N="157" /> satisfied that the position which exists at the present time, and the failure of the Minister to accept this amendment, must be appreciated by this House.  Deputy MacEntee, at an earlier stage, used the words &ldquo;comparatively unimportant&rdquo; in relation to this Bill and now that there are 11 or 12 hours at the disposal of the House it causes one to think what reason the Government has for making such an Order.  We can only deduce that the Minister has at the back of his mind that he does not want the Greyhound Racing Bill to be amended in any way or to have our amendment discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy come to the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has stated this morning that this industry is one of our most important industries. With that we all agree and we maintain that every single section of this Bill is worthy of the greatest consideration by the members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy come to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this amendment moved by Deputy MacEntee I gave instances, on the last occasion, of the necessity of putting in a qualified person as a receiver to administer the affairs and assets of the club.  The Greyhound Advisory Committee dealt very fully with the financial administration of the Irish Coursing Club but, unfortunately, I had not the time on the last occasion to deal with the matter under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph 123, page 40, of their report, the advisory committee stated that they felt that the funds of the club could have been more efficiently administered and more equitably distributed, particularly as regards the funds of the subsidiary companies, which are dealt with under the amendment. These are the Sporting Press, Limited, Powerstown Park and the other assets.  This is a very serious matter and the report goes on to say that, in regard to the administration of the funds, the finance committee <Col N="158" /> appeared to have failed to ensure that the resources of the club were applied efficiently and equitably.  It states that members of the finance committee were lax in attending meetings and that some of them took little interest in the affairs of the committee.</P>
    <P>Surely that is a surprising report from a committee composed of people of all political persuasions.  These responsible men come along and put their names to a document containing a statement to the effect that the present Irish Coursing Club, as constituted, is inefficiently administered and that the members take little interest in the affairs of the committee and that the best use is not being made of the finances of the club.  Surely that statement bears out the necessity of the Minister accepting this amendment.</P>
    <P>If I might go back, Sir, and refer to the time allowed for this debate, if there had been a little co-operation by the Minister for Agriculture perhaps this debate would not be as acrimonious and contentious as it has turned out to be.  If the Minister wants to adopt that attitude we, on this side of the House, will have our say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of this amendment would have been disposed of long ago, if the Minister for Agriculture would listen to a little reason. No matter what case is put up by us, on this side of the House, we are wasting our sweetness on the desert air.  The onus is on us, if not on the Minister, to show the citizens of this country the serious plight in which the industry finds itself at present and the more serious plight in which it will find itself, if this amendment is not passed.  I consider this to be the most important amendment tabled to the Bill.</P>
      <P>To get back to the Report of the Greyhound Advisory Committee, about half way down paragraph 123 they refer to the distribution of income and remark on the failure of the club to plough any of their assets back to the coursing clubs in fair proportion.  I maintain that each of these remarks made by the advisory committee shows one thing and one thing only, that there is something very rotten in connection with the whole financial structure of the Irish Coursing Club.  That is not my personal opinion backed up on my own knowledge.  I have not that much knowledge but I do accept this report and in that connection I should like to refer the House also to paragraph 125, where it is said that this body are of the opinion that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...a full explanatory statement of accounts and balance sheet should be produced at each annual meeting.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Would the Minister or anyone in this House or outside it tell us what shareholder would put up with the state of affairs whereby the members and shareholders attending an annual general meeting&mdash;they have been attending these meetings down through the years&mdash;have never caught sight of a balance sheet?  Is that not a preposterous state of affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the appointment of a receiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why the receiver should be appointed.  The manner in which this organisation has <Col N="160" /> conducted its business is surely relevant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They go on then at paragraph 125 of the report to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Similarly, we consider that the present practice whereby the only reference in the balance sheet of the club to the subsidiary companies is to their nominal value at £1 each, is misleading....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Do the public realise what the carry-on of this body is?  In the balance sheet the assets of Powerstown Park appear at £1.  Powerstown Park, the subsidiary companies, the Sporting Press, are valued by the commission at £60,000.  This appears as £1 on the balance sheet.  If a crowd of school children carried on like that and if an individual in the Intermediate Certificate examination were asked in a question to frame a typical balance sheet of a company and gave such examples, we can imagine what marks he would get.  The position is fantastic. The value of Powerstown Park itself has been mentioned also at £26,000.</P>
      <P>Powerstown Park Racecourse consists of 168 statute acres of the best land in the Golden Vale and it appears on the balance sheet at 20/-.  For the same Powerstown Park, Limited, the secretary of the Irish Coursing Club offered an annual rent of £1,200 and surely they were not biased when they calmly suggested that the reference in the balance sheet to the fact that the nominal value of the subsidiary companies was £1 each is misleading. They go further in the report and say this should be altered forthwith.  Of course, it should be altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A consolidated statement of revenue and expenditure, as well as a consolidated balance sheet covering all operations, should be presented but it has never been presented.  I know members of the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  They are very reputable men who for different reasons have been unable to attend as much as they would like.  But when they attend and ask a question, they are nearly frozen out of the room by certain individuals.  It is a fantastic position to say that they cannot ask a <Col N="161" /> question at a general meeting and get the necessary information.</P>
    <P>To bear me out further, they say in the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every member of the club should be entitled to full information about any and every activity of the club or its subsidiary companies, and we feel that much of the prevailing dissatisfaction originated because members felt that they had not been given sufficient details in this connection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We had the same thing happening at the last standing committee meeting of the Irish Coursing Club, held in Jury's on the 1st May, 1956.  People came to that meeting, particularly the country members, and asked questions about the valuation.</P>
    <P>I have the full reports of both committees held on the 1st and 2nd May. Again, they were met with a closed-shop attitude.  Mr. Smith, of Smith, Griffin &amp; Co., Auctioneers, was paid a fee of 30 guineas to give his valuation on Powerstown Park.  One particular individual asked for the valuation and they nearly jumped down the unfortunate man's throat.  They would not disclose the information.  They would not say what Mr. Griffin offered for the premises.  Is it not fantastic?  The secretary can offer £1,200 a year or a bid of £20,000 to buy it outright, keep the grazing rights, keep the house and keep the profits.  The secretary can do all these things, but when a couple of honest and unfortunate members up from the country ask what Mr. Griffin, of Messrs. Smith, Griffin &amp; Co., valued the premises at, they are told, and not so politely, to shut up.  For two columns of the report, other members, including a reverend gentleman, said that everything was not over-and-above-board and that it was about time the information was given to the ordinary members of the standing committee.</P>
    <P>They were right in demanding that. Is it not a fantastic state of affairs to say that, having paid an auctioneer and valuer 30 guineas out of the funds of the Irish Coursing Club, the members of the Irish Coursing Club could not hear what that valuation was?  It would have been of assistance to this <Col N="162" /> House to have known what Powerstown Park is valued at.  The secretary himself must have a very good idea since he bid £20,000 for it and offered £1,200 a year.</P>
    <P>These are not my opinions.  They are facts unanimously signed by the members making up this committee. Further on, in paragraph 125 of the report, they made a remarkable observation quite in keeping with the point we are making here in connection with Deputy MacEntee's amendment. They said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Normally an executive committee and its officers&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the operative word is normally&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;are at all times merely the custodians of the funds entrusted to them by the parent body, each member of which is entitled to all reasonable information.  We find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club and its administrative officials frequently lost sight of these precepts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That passage occurs at the end of paragraph 125.  The sting of a sonnet is often in its tail and it is certainly in the tail here: &ldquo;Its administrative officials frequently lost sight of these precepts&rdquo;, is putting it in a very mild but lucid form.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which this amendment was debated, on 19th June, the Minister went to the greatest trouble on several occasions to interrupt me to state that a trust deed had been executed in regard to Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited.  I have looked through all the documents at my disposal and from statements issued by the Coursing Club itself, I can find no indication of that.  The point I am making is in reference to Volume 158, column 541.  I was referring to the <i>Sporting Press and Coursing Calendar.</i>  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a typical example of the slipshod method in which the Irish Coursing Club do their business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister interrupted to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The trust deed has been executed since.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> I asked a member of the standing committee of the club if the trust deed had been executed since and he said that, so far as he knew, and he had attended all the meetings, the trust deed had not been executed.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 152 of the report of the advisory committee, the recommendation is made:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We believe the new club should cause to be executed a trust deed which will specifically name members of the club as trustees for the assets of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister is in a position to have more definite facts on these matters, we would certainly like to know of them.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, Deputy MacEntee specifically mentions a receiver; but I am sure we would have been satisfied even if the Minister had said that, instead of a receiver, he would appoint a financial committee. In paragraph 150 of the report on the finances of the reorganised Irish Coursing Club, the committee said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the belief that efficient control and equitable distribution of its finances are essential if the club is to fulfil its functions properly, we are of opinion that the newly constituted club should at the outset establish a finance committee comprising members prepared to attend regularly and including if possible a person well versed in accounting matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We could not have a greater advocate for this amendment than this report of the advisory committee.  Every point referred to here to-day by me has been backed up by reference to the unanimous opinions of this impartial body.</P>
    <P>The most important observation contained in the report is made in paragraph 111.  This says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite these liquid assets and the fact that the assets and property of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, must be regarded as being held in trust for the Irish <Col N="164" /> Coursing Club, it appears that this concern has never contributed any portion of its substantial profits to the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that, of the thousands of pounds made by the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, not one halfpenny has gone to the smallest coursing club in West Clare or any other part of the country.  Not a shilling has been contributed out of the profits of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, which was supposed to have been set up and held in trust for the Irish Coursing Club.  Every year they have been most successful, and of the thousands of pounds which accrued from this success, not one penny has been ploughed back into coursing, greyhound racing or, as in the case of the Racing Board, contributions towards stakes and contributions to the management, not only for increased stakes but so that the admission charges to certain tracks could possibly be reduced.  Not one penny of that was used in this way.</P>
    <P>What did they do with the money? They spent £32,000 on buildings and installing machinery.  They gave evidence before the commission and very generously admitted on behalf of the company that its property and revenues belonged to the Irish Coursing Club; but they argued that the surplus revenue was retained merely in order that it might later be readily available to the Irish Coursing Club, should the latter's financial position decline or should the industry as a whole need help.  They suggested to the advisory committee that they were holding all the surplus revenue and profits in trust, in case they might be called on by the Irish Coursing Club.  Of course, as was found out later by the committee, the money was invested&mdash;and it was possibly a good investment&mdash; in buildings and the purchase of machinery for £32,000.</P>
    <P>Is it not about time the Minister stepped in and appointed the receiver we are looking for?  How do we know that the people administering the Sporting Press will not embark on some other scheme and spend another £20,000 or £30,000 out of their considerable assets before the new control <Col N="165" /> board is set up?  I quote from the report of the advisory committee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have already expressed doubt in regard to the action of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, in expending a sum of approximately £32,000 in the erection of buildings and installation of plant; in other words, utilising in this manner reserves which must have previously accumulated.  We cannot, therefore, accept as sufficient the explanation as to why the company did not contribute to the funds of the Irish Coursing Club as a whole during a period when coursing might have received greater financial assistance, e.g., by way of reducing fees, increasing prize money at coursing meetings or employing additional supervisory staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One could not call the Sporting Press, in its present form, inefficient.  Any body that can make £32,000 or £40,000 is certainly not inefficient.  Our argument is not so much on the manner in which the Sporting Press is run as the manner in which the assets are disposed of.  They must have been marvellous businessmen.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry interrupted me.  Would he just look back on the records he has at his disposal? If he does, he will find out that when the Sporting Press was set up originally, it was to be held in trust for the Irish Coursing Club and that the assets and any profits deriving therefrom were to be used for the benefit of coursing.  If Deputy Barry suggests that to plough that money into buildings and plant was improving the position of coursing in this country, we must disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> I was about to say that these were marvellous businessmen.  The Irish Coursing Club owned the Sporting Press, but the Irish Coursing Club were charged for the printing of the <i>Greyhound Calendar</i> and the Stud Book, not alone nominal sums but the highest market prices.  Not satisfied with printing for the Irish Coursing Club at top market prices, the Sporting Press entered into competition with commercial firms in the printing trade.</P>
    <P>Here is what the report of the advisory committee has to say at paragraph 112:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We understand that the company prints the Stud Book at a profit to itself, charging considerable sums to the Irish Coursing Club for the service.  The income derived by the Irish Coursing Club from the sale of the Stud Book to affiliated coursing clubs, etc., covered only a fraction of the cost of printing, so that the book in consequence is published at a consistent and serious loss to the club.  We see no valid reason why, in view of the sound financial position of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, and the fact that it was set up with funds provided by the Irish Coursing Club, it could not at least have undertaken the printing of the Stud Book free of charge, or at a nominal charge, to the parent body.  We are indeed of opinion that every affiliated coursing club would be reasonably entitled to a copy of the Stud Book, free of charge.  We also feel that the company could readily have made other printing concessions to coursing clubs generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But no; any coursing club in Ireland who required printing done were charged top market prices.  Now Deputy Barry will know to what purpose the assets and surplus revenue were put.  They were not used for the purpose intended.  There was quite a deal of comment in certain provincial newspapers as a result of discussions concerning Powerstown Park.  In the South of Ireland generally, it has become the subject of a great deal of controversy.  The rumour that Powerstown <Col N="167" /> Park was sold seemed to be completely incorrect, according to the decision at the last meeting of the Irish Coursing Club, held in Dublin on May 2nd last.  On that date, they decided to leave it to another meeting, and an undertaking was given to one of the members, who was worried, that no action would be taken pending the summoning of a special meeting.</P>
    <P>Since then, newspapers in that province seem to have more information on the subject than possibly the Minister or the members of this House. There were statements published that Powerstown Park was purchased for some fantastic figure.  That now seems to be completely incorrect.  I am referring to a leading article in a provincial paper.  In fairness to the standing committee, I should like now to say that these rumours seem to be incorrect.</P>
    <P>According to the report of the advisory committee, Powerstown Park, Limited, is a private company with a paid-up capital of £10,000.  The company was formed in 1932 by the Irish Coursing Club, mainly to establish a permanent national coursing ground and, to that end, to purchase the property known as Powerstown Park Racecourse.  The shareholders of the company, who were the nominees of the Irish Coursing Club, executed, in April, 1932, a deed of trust under which they acknowledged that they held their shares in trust for the Irish Coursing Club and were prepared to act in all respects under the direction of the club, as expressed or contained in resolutions from time to time passed by the standing committee.</P>
    <P>At that time, according to the report of the advisory committee, the senior joint-secretary of the Irish Coursing Club acted as salaried manager of Powerstown Park, Limited, and in consideration of payment of an agreed annual sum, was entitled, while acting in this capacity, to reside in Powerstown House and to use the lands of Powerstown demesne, comprising about 130 acres&mdash;the figure is incorrect&mdash;except at such times as portion of them is required for coursing or racing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> I have shown that the Irish Coursing Club, the owners of the Sporting Press Limited, have been charged &ldquo;considerable sums&rdquo; for the services of printing.  I have shown that Powerstown Park is supposed to be owned by the nominees in trust for the Irish Coursing Club, and I want to show now the benefits, moryah, that are derived by the owners, the Irish Coursing Club, from their property.</P>
    <P>The report of the advisory committee says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As in the case of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, and although Powerstown Park, Limited, appears to be a prosperous undertaking, no contribution whatever appears to have been made by it to the funds of the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quoting from paragraph 114 of the report of the advisory committee.  Here is the fantastic statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Indeed the Irish Coursing Club actually pays £100 per annum for the right to hold coursing meetings on its own lands at Powerstown Park.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed the members of the advisory committee were dismayed and amazed. As they said, they were paying the top price for their own printing and now, after landing out the money to buy Powerstown Park, they are being charged £100 per annum.  One would think that a balance sheet would show that something was coming back, but the advisory committee has pointed out that nothing has come back.  Where the money of Powerstown Park has gone, I do not know&mdash;and I would like to make it very clear that there is no question or suggestion that anyone has absconded with hundreds of thousands of pounds from Powerstown Park&mdash;but I do say that the whole position is frightfully serious.  The profits made by Powerstown Park were utilised to increase the company's assets.  In other words, they carried out improvements to the racecourse, to <Col N="169" /> the buildings themselves, to the tote, and to the stabling accommodation. But, as in the case of the Sporting Press, the purpose for which it was set up has been defeated.  It has been argued by very knowledgeable people that the directors of Powerstown Park, Limited, do not have to consult the Irish Coursing Club, if they dispose of their assets.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has put down this amendment that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the Minister shall make an Order appointing an independent qualified person as receiver and manager to carry on the business of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, for the sole benefit and advantage of the club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two individuals at the Irish Coursing Club meeting in Jury's Hotel held some time in May, received an undertaking, and that undertaking was not too clear, that it would not be disposed of without a further meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>And there can be a <i>fait accompli</i>, and the Minister can do nothing about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry and his colleagues concluded, when dealing solely with the Sporting Press, Limited, and Powerstown Park, Limited, that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The formation of these two companies, both of which engage in commercial activities, and the investment by the Irish Coursing Club in such commercial enterprises of funds arising directly from the Irish greyhound industry, appear to have been outside the terms of the constitution of the club.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In fact, Sir, not only were they outside the terms of the constitution of the club, but according to their articles of association, as one will realise if one goes to the trouble of reading the Articles of Association of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, and Powerstown Park, Limited, they have no authority, and never had any authority whatsoever, to embark on certain activities on which they have embarked.  They have exceeded the powers vested in them and they failed to take the necessary steps to acquire those powers which they lack, however they got away with it.</P>
      <P>Having said that the formation was outside the terms of the constitution, the report goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The position whereby one of the enterprises has been enabled to earn profits at the expense of the club&mdash; namely, the admitted profit on the printing of the stud book and the loss incurred by the club on its distribution&mdash;appears to justify the allegations of several witnesses that <Col N="171" /> the funds of the club as a whole, including its subsidiary companies, are not used to the best advantage. We believe that having formed these companies, the club should have ensured their subordination to the needs, financial and otherwise, of the club itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not a brainstorm of Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Briscoe that these amendments are put down and not, as the Minister has got into his head, that any persons have any axe to grind in the matter.  That is the case and there is irrefutable evidence to show that the whole financial position is in a state of chaos.</P>
    <P>A very important point arises from all this: the failure of the Irish Coursing Club to get back their own assets and to get some of the revenue has had a bearing on certain proposals and decisions made by the Minister.  After all, when the proposed levy on the bookmakers was introduced in this Bill, the Minister mentioned that he had taken into consideration the existing financial position and the probable future financial position of the Irish Coursing Club, and he came to the conclusion that it was necessary to have a levy imposed because they themselves would not have sufficient assets.  If Deputy MacEntee's amendments were accepted in whole or in part, and even if a receiver or manager was not appointed, a financial committee were set up, I maintain that very little need for this levy would arise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the assets of the Sporting Press, paragraph 117 of the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard to the assets of the Irish Coursing Club other than Powerstown Park, Limited, and the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, no instrument is in existence to show that these assets are vested in trustees for the club.  In the course of evidence, it was implied that the club's property and assets were vested in the standing committee, but, if so, they would be trustees for the individual members of the Irish Coursing Club.  In fact&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" />&mdash;and here is the serious position&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;it would seem logical to assume that the property and assets of the club belong to all members of the club jointly.  Indeed, it could be argued that every member of an affiliated coursing club has a vested interest in the property of the Irish Coursing Club.  It might further be logically assumed that this applies also to the assets of the subsidiary companies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the question of the balance sheet in connection with the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, and Powerstown Park.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made our position very clear, that we were willing as far as possible, and still are, to co-operate with the Minister, but evidently we have not converted him to our way of thinking in connection with these amendments.  We will do all in our power to show beyond yea or any that the arguments we can put up are irrefutable.  It is stated in the report at paragraph 119:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Assets, under the heading of offices, fixtures and fittings, equipment, stationery, etc., do not however appear on the balance sheet under any heading, so that in reality net assets are considerably higher. Offices which the club, as stated in evidence, erected in Clonmel at a cost of £15,000, are not referred to <Col N="173" /> in the balance sheet.  These assets were probably written off against profits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a very kind deduction.  The paragraph continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the club holds all the subscribed capital of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, and Powerstown Park, Limited.  It is at once apparent that the net assets of the club as shown in its balance sheet are not fully representative of the actual position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I lack the forensic capabilities of the Minister for Agriculture but I can certainly visualise how, if he were on this side of the House, he would go to town on that.  We would probably go on until Friday and be featured in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in similar articles to those we had every Sunday a couple of years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <P>It is becoming very hard.  The Deputy is getting dizzy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry is the cause of my dizziness.  Here is the Greyhound Advisory Committee's Report which was adopted unanimously, and the second signature I see under that of the chairman, Timothy O'Connell, is that of Anthony Barry, who is known to all and sundry by the remarkable appellation of &ldquo;Deputy Anthony Barry&rdquo;.  If I am getting dizzy it is Deputy Barry's opinions which are making me so, and I accept most of them.  There are very few I do not accept and we would be far better off if the Minister accepted the recommendations of the committee set up by himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this matter I want to mention before I conclude on this amendment.  I saw in one newspaper the suggestion made that to put the value of the asset of the Irish Coursing Club, known as the Greyhound and Sporting Press, at £60,000, as referred to by a Deputy, was fantastic.  The newspaper in question went on to refer to the appalling plight in which newspapers in this country find themselves to-day with the cost of paper, etc., and suggested that we were grossly exaggerating.  I <Col N="174" /> would like to clear that point up because the position is set out without any doubt whatever in paragraph 110 of the committee's report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from printing <i>The Coursing and Racing Calendar</i>&mdash; recently renamed <i>The Sporting Press</i>&mdash;the company prints the Stud Book on behalf of the Irish Coursing Club and prints &lsquo;membership&rsquo; and other cards for coursing clubs.  The company undertakes printing work for a number of horse racing companies and other sporting organisations, and&mdash;presumably in order to employ its staff and machinery full time-engages also in a considerable amount of other commercial printing and paper trading, outside the greyhound industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said all that at ten minutes to eleven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I am trying to make a particular point in this connection.  Is it not about time that we had the benefit of Deputy Barry's wisdom on some of these points?  When I sit down he can speak.  The paragraph continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, appears to have been remarkably successful from the outset, and the value of its assets, including buildings and equipment, is estimated by the Irish Coursing Club to be at present at least £60,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to go on record as saying, therefore, that when Deputy Briscoe referred previously to that figure of £60,000 there was nothing fantastic about it and no evidence that the members on this side of the House were exaggerating, because the Irish Coursing Club themselves valued the assets of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, at £60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate includes buildings which were erected in recent years at a cost of £14,000 and plant, machinery and equipment at a cost of £18,000, making a total of £32,000, the figure to which I referred about ten minutes ago.  The question arises&mdash;it has been asked here and in letters to newspapers of a sporting character&mdash;as to <Col N="175" /> why this £32,000 was spent, £32,000 representing an asset of the Irish Coursing Club.  A delegate from West Cork asked that very pertinent question at, I think, the second last meeting.</P>
    <P>In further proof of the ludicrous decisions that can be taken, this was the excuse given for putting up these buildings at a cost of £14,000 and installing plant and equipment at a cost of £18,000.  It was stated by the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;that is, by the members who gave evidence before the committee&mdash;that this expenditure had become imperative when the printing company was informed by the military authorities during the emergency period that it would have to vacate certain buildings held on lease in Clonmel and utilised in connection with the publication of the <i>Racing Calendar</i> and by the Irish Coursing Club in other directions.  Fortunately, there were some very efficient staff helping out this committee and they said that they had ascertained that the proposal of the Department of Defence to resume possession of the buildings &ldquo;has not up to the present been proceeded with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I am very interested in this, and so are Deputies on both sides of the House.  One of the members of the standing committee discussed the matter with me.  Unfortunately, he was not at the meeting&mdash;he should have been&mdash;and he is paying for the consequences now.  This man and other members of the standing committee sought information as to the existence of a record of this whole proceeding; there was an expenditure of nearly £40,000 involved and the Irish Coursing Club said they were satisfied it was imperative that the buildings should be vacated.  Is there any record of the Department of Defence serving notice to quit on the Irish Coursing Club?  Is there any record in the Minister's Department to show that a deputation waited on him from the Irish Coursing Club to point out that the buildings which the Department of Defence proposed to take would not be of the slightest use to the Army authorities?  No such deputation took place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> This meeting was held.  Mark you, it was not a special meeting.  None of the representatives all over the country got a three-line whip to attend Clonmel urgently in order to reach a major decision on the depletion of profits in relation to one of the subsidiary bodies.  An ordinary meeting of the Irish Coursing Club was held and, there and then, it was decided that because of the Department of Defence's intimation&mdash;wherever the record is, I do not know&mdash;that they required these premises, the premises would be vacated and £32,000 would be spent on the erection of a new premises.</P>
    <P>Surely there are good business people on the Irish Coursing Club. Everyone knows that if an ordinary individual who owns or leases property from the Department of Defence or any other Government Department receives an intimation that the Department in question intends to exercise certain powers, that individual has certain legal rights and will take steps to ensure that he receives adequate compensation.  There is no evidence of any compensation for disturbance being obtained by the Irish Coursing Club or the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited.  It has been remarked by certain members of the Irish Coursing Club that, due to the action or alleged action of the Department of Defence, they had to build a new premises at a cost of £14,000.  Forgetting all about the cost of the machinery, surely they were entitled to some compensation in relation to the premises they had to vacate.  If I were involved in that kind of situation, I would certainly be entitled to compensation, compensation adequate to purchase another house or to build a new house.  But the Irish Coursing Club did not get one penny compensation towards the erection of a new building. Is that efficient administration?</P>
    <P>If the Minister continues to refuse to accept this amendment, all I can say is that he is sticking his head in the sand and saying to Fianna Fáil that he will not accept any of their amendments, without any qualifying adjective, good or bad or indifferent.  On one memorable occasion he asked <Col N="177" /> Deputy Briscoe: &ldquo;Why should I accept the Deputy's amendment in order to give the Deputy political kudos?&rdquo;  or words to that effect.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the erection of this new building was a good deal.  Later on the advisory committee remarked, in relation to the expenditure of £32,000: &ldquo;On the whole, we have some doubts as to whether in the circumstances mentioned the company was justified in expending on the erection of new buildings and, more particularly, on the installation of new and elaborate printing machinery large sums which, properly speaking, belonged to the Irish Coursing Club and to the greyhound industry.  We have no information&rdquo;&mdash;they could not get the evidence; despite the questions asked by them at the commission they could not find out&mdash;&ldquo;as to whether the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, decided on this expenditure or whether the sanction of the standing committee for the expenditure was sought.&rdquo;  I suggest that is a most important statement because it shows that the Sporting Press came to a certain decision without the sanction of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  It is quite on the cards that what they did then, they will do again.  The Sporting Press, Limited, and Powerstown Park, Limited, could at the moment, without consulting anybody, dispose of their assets.  For all we know, they may do it next week.  The Sporting Press, Limited, states categorically here:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The committee, without the sanction of the standing committee, spent this £32,000.  The company appears to hold liquid assets to the value of £13,000 approximately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To show the House another bit of fantastic childishness, I would ask the House to listen to this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although these assets&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is, the £13,000 liquid assets they have</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;include Government securities earning only from 3¾ to 4 per cent., no effort has been made to redeem 6 per cent. debentures to the value of £4,000 held personally by the <Col N="178" /> senior joint secretary of the Irish Coursing Club who is also manager of the Coursing Greyhound Calendar and Sporting Press, Limited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here it might be noted that income-tax and corporation profits tax, amounting to £24,800, were paid by the company since 1933.  This is very big business.  That company alone, the Sporting Press, paid nearly £25,000 in income-tax and corporation profits tax since 1933.  Not one shilling was expended in subsidising stakes, in a reduction of entry fees or in any such alleviation of the hardships from which coursing clubs particularly in country areas suffered.  This is a childish bit of business whereby they invested in Government securities earning only from 3¾ to 4 per cent. and made no effort whatever to redeem 6 per cent. debentures to the value of £4,000.  That is another one of the very many peculiar things carried on by the Irish Coursing Club and their subsidiary bodies.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which I was speaking in regard to this matter here, I gave a guarantee to the Minister that he could be assured of our 100 per cent. co-operation in this matter. I suggested to him that he might communicate with the directors of the Irish Coursing Club.  I am asking him now to meet us in some small way on this amendment.  If the Minister would assure us that he will make his views known, in the light of what has been revealed in this House of the carryon of the whole financial administration of the Irish Coursing Club and from the facts which have been disclosed, not by me but through me, it would be a great help.  I have only been referring to the advisory committee's report.  I think it has been proved beyond yea or nay that the position is frightfully serious.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to stress more than any other is that there appears to be no method whereby the assets will not be depleted.  If the Minister would communicate with the secretary and directors of the Irish Coursing Club and suggest to them that he would not approve of the disposal of any of these assets until the new board is formed, <Col N="179" /> it would go a long way towards meeting the purpose of Deputy MacEntee's amendment.  I am certain that due consideration will be given to any such views expressed by the Minister.  The Irish Coursing Club know perfectly well that, when the new board is formed, their members will have control. I presume they will not become antagonistic to the Minister if a letter from the Minister for Agriculture is read out in two or three weeks' time by the secretary at the next Irish Coursing Club meeting here in Dublin saying that it has been brought to his notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister would give us some information on the point, it would go some way towards meeting us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to empower the Minister for Agriculture to appoint a receiver in respect of the property of the Irish Coursing Club after this Bill is passed and is law.  I do not know whether those who drafted the amendment bothered to read the Bill.  If they had, they would see that, under Article 13 of the constitution, the Bill provides that the property and assets of the club and its subsidiary interests, including Powerstown Park, Limited, and the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, shall be vested in trustees appointed by the club.  Therefore, with the passage of this Bill and its coming <Col N="180" /> into law, all the assets referred to in the amendments will be vested in trustees.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to provide for the period between the signing of the Bill by the President and the date of its coming into operation.  It is fantastic to suggest that anything is being done to protect the assets of the club by postponing indefinitely the enactment of this Bill, which, under Article 13 of the constitution, vests all the property and assets, including Powerstown Park and the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, in trustees to be appointed by the club.  The most effective way of securing that all these assets will be permanently held by the trustees, to whom will attach all the obligations of trustees, and these are heavy obligations, is to pass this Bill.  The sooner the Bill is passed, the sooner the trustees will be appointed and the sooner all the assets, including Powerstown Park and the Sporting Press, Limited, will be held in trust for the benefit of the club.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  The longer the Bill is delayed in passing, the longer that excellent purpose will be frustrated.  I think that Deputy MacEntee knows that but he announced this morning at half past ten that he proposes to obstruct to the limit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Those who believe that is a desirable thing to do are, I think, mistaken. The privileges of Parliament have been dearly bought and they must be sedulously protected, however mistakenly they are used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that there is not the slightest desire on my part, or on the part of anyone on this side of the House, to be either unreasonable or unco-operative in handling this Bill.  Already, I have endeavoured to meet the Opposition in relation to a number of points they <Col N="181" /> have raised.  Some of the amendments on the Order Paper in my name have been drafted for the purpose of meeting points raised by Deputies on the Opposition Benches on the Second Stage.  I believe that the provision in Section 13, vesting all the property of the club in trustees, fully and amply incorporates the principle enshrined in these amendments.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the only difference between the effect of Section 13 and the effect of these amendments is that, for the period that may elapse between the day on which the President signs this Bill and the day on which the Bill shall be brought into operation, the Minister will have power to appoint a receiver.  But I have not the slightest intention, once this Bill is passed, of delaying the day on which it will come into operation. The day on which it comes into operation all the property and assets of the club and its subsidiary interests, including Powerstown Park and the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, will be vested in trustees appointed by the club as provided by Section 13 of the revised constitution scheduled to the Bill we are at present discussing.  If we want to achieve that purpose, the sooner we pass this Bill the better it will be for everyone.  If the Opposition want to help the Government to get the Bill enacted, they have no reason to anticipate&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not the slightest danger that anyone will sell anything. These amendments cannot operate until this Bill becomes law.  I do not believe there is the slightest intention on the part of anybody to <Col N="182" /> dispose precipitately of anything. These amendments do not do anything to cure the situation whereas, if this Bill had been passed a month ago, or even six weeks ago, all that property would now be vested in trustees, which is what I wanted to have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But I am telling the Deputy I have not the slightest intention of delaying the appointing of the day.  The only effect of these amendments is to provide the Minister with power to appoint a receiver between the day on which the Bill passes into law and the day he appoints for the coming into operation of the Act.  That is all.  If this Bill had passed in the ordinary way, the trustees would now be appointed and all the property would be vested in them.  I still urge on the Opposition that they should co-operate in getting this Bill passed so that we may put this industry on a satisfactory basis.  I ask them to realise that the substance of the amendment in Deputy MacEntee's name is, in fact, enshrined in Article 13 of the draft constitution which is annexed to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has alleged that we are prostituting the proceedings of Parliament.  The Minister is quite a good judge of that scabrous occupation.  But we are not prostituting the proceedings of Parliament. We are here in the discharge of a public duty to induce or persuade the Minister to prevent what, in fact, will become one of the most scandalous abuses of office and authority that this country has known for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the amendments are not perfect.  They do not do what we should like to do, namely, to ensure that a receiver should be appointed immediately to administer the affairs of the club, the affairs of the Greyhound and Sporting Press and the affairs of Powerstown Park, Limited, all for the sole benefit and advantage of the Irish Coursing Club and of those who are the foundation upon which that club has been built, the greyhound owners and breeders and the small farmer about <Col N="183" /> whom the Taoiseach professed to be so much concerned this morning.  We could not, within the title of this Bill, do anything more than set out the things which we think should be done, if possible forthwith.  We are, of course, in the position to which the Minister has referred.  This Bill will take same time before it reaches the Statute Book.  The reason why it is likely to make slow progress in that regard will be easily understood by any person who studies the report of the Minister's own advisory committee, the committee he set up to advise him on the greyhound industry, and, side by side with that, studies the provisions of this Bill.  In every particular, except perhaps one&mdash;clause 13 of the constitution of the proposed reformed club&mdash;the Bill disregards the recommendations made to the Minister by the advisory committee.  It is an expression of lack of confidence in the Minister's own nominees, not excluding Deputy Anthony Barry who, I am glad to see, has replaced the Minister on the Front Bench.  I hope it is a happy augury and an indication of things to come.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we recognise very fully the imperfections of this amendment. It is imperfect in so far as it cannot come into operation until the Bill becomes law, but that is a matter which could easily be remedied, if the Minister were concerned to prevent the dissipation of the assets of the Irish Coursing Club for the benefit of some members and some officials of the club. This is a simple amendment, consisting of three sections.  The Minister could introduce into this House to-morrow morning a Bill to give effect to the principles of the amendment, and, if he did so, he would get all stages before to-morrow afternoon.  He could then take steps to protect the property which really belongs to the people who own and breed greyhounds in this country, because it was through their fees and the payments exacted from them that this club has accumulated the relatively enormous assets which it now has.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to bring home to our people, who are at the moment so <Col N="184" /> preoccupied with the grave plight in which they find themselves, why we in the Opposition have taken up the attitude which we have taken in regard to this Bill and particularly to bring home to them why we have put down this amendment.  The men in C.I.E. who are trembling on the verge of dismissal, or who are being told that, in lieu of dismissal, they must accept a reduction in their wages, no doubt will think that the Greyhound Industry Bill is of small concern.  The people who are on short time in many of the industries in this country will probably take that view also.  The unfortunate people who have entered into commitments for the purchase of houses, I would say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We know we have a difficult task in convincing the people that we are doing a great service to the State and to the people in the attitude we are taking up on this Bill and doing a great service to public morality in this country in the attitude which we have adopted.  As I have said, people have entered into commitments to purchase houses on the assumption that the money would be forthcoming, and it would be hard indeed for them to regard the Greyhound Industry Bill as of great importance, but this Bill is a matter of great importance to the State and to the people.</P>

I want to make it quite clear that it is no pleasure for me to <Col N="185" /> be here this morning and of no benefit or advantage to me or to any other member of the Opposition to be in this House this morning, but we are here because we have a public duty to discharge. We are not here, to use the elegant phrase of the Minister for Agriculture &ldquo;in prostitution of the procedure of Parliament.&rdquo;  We are here because the Minister has shown a calculated disregard of the recommendations of Deputy Anthony Barry and his colleagues on the advisory committee, and it is rather startling to think that Deputy Barry has not spoken one word of explanation of any kind of his <i>volte face</i> in this matter and he is now under the Whip of the Fine Gael Party going to go into the Lobby to vote against his own recent recommendations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry and the Minister for Agriculture apparently did not take the report of the advisory committee as seriously as we have taken it.  Everybody has known for a long time that the air in sporting circles was reeking with suggestions of mismanagement of the affairs of the Irish Coursing Club.  That is one of the reasons why the first paragraph of this amendment is on the Order Paper. It is because of the suspicions and the allegations about the way in which the affairs of the club were being managed for the benefit, advantage and profit of certain individuals.  It has been proven up to the hilt by the report of the advisory committee.  That is our justification for asking the Minister to appoint a qualified person as receiver to administer the affairs of the club, because Deputy Barry, over his own signature, has found that these allegations were justified; that the abuses which were alleged to exist did, in fact, exist; and that this club owned very valuable properties which were not being administered for the benefit and advantage of the club.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There cannot be any doubt in the mind of any person who listened to the cogent, reasoned speech <Col N="186" /> of Deputy O'Malley, substantiated in every particular by quotations from Deputy Barry himself, that there is grave need in the public interest to ensure that positions of trust will not be abused, that there is grave need to prove to the public that the sole and only reason why the Minister has introduced this Bill in the form in which it is now before the House is not to give these people an indemnity for their past misdeeds and to establish themselves in position under the protection of the laws of this country.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was before the House on the Second Stage, we welcomed it. We hoped that we would be in a position on Committee Stage to bring it into closer conformity with the recommendations of the committee. The Minister in his statement made a few minutes ago boasted that he had put down some amendments to meet the views of the Opposition.  The Minister expects a great measure of gratitude for trifling concessions.  The great man has unbent.  He is no longer the dictator of Dáil Eireann, no longer the Mussolini of the greyhound industry.  So, he has put down a number of amendments&mdash;an amendment to Section 13, an amendment which corrects the faulty drafting of the Bill and which says that a licence will not be refused for a track on the ground of unsuitability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was the Minister who raised this, boasting about the amendments which he had put down&mdash; an amendment which says that the greyhound board will not turn down an application until the applicant has been heard.  It does not, of course, appeal to the Minister.  That is not consistent with the sort of star chamber procedure which would be dear to his heart.  He has an amendment down to Sections 28, 29 and 30. They are mere amendments of phraseology, to make his own confused drafting of the Bill clearer.  He has an amendment down to Section 35 which is of the same effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one concession that the Minister did make to the common wisdom of <Col N="187" /> the House, the one concession which he did make to those who support him as well as those who criticise him, was amendment No. 24 to Section 48.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, but I am merely dealing with the fact.  The Minister has charged the Opposition with obstruction.  I am charging the Minister with deliberate dictatorship. He is attempting, for some reasons best known to himself, to steamroll this Bill through Dáil Éireann in defiance of the recommendations of his own advisory committee and, Sir, that is relevant, as I shall show you, to the amendment which is on the Order Paper.  That amendment was put down after certain facts came to our knowledge. That amendment was carefully considered.  As I have already said, Sir, it is not a perfect amendment&mdash; the Minister has drawn attention to its imperfections&mdash;but its acceptance by Dáil Éireann would be a clear indication to the gentlemen who control and administer the affairs of the Irish Coursing Club that they are not going to get away with it.  It would be a red light to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister was quite right: the amendment cannot become effective immediately, even if the House were to adopt it and that, as I concede, is the one weakness in it.  But, if it is a weakness and if the Minister thinks that in other respects, having regard to the knowledge which he now has, thanks to Deputy O'Malley, the principles of the amendment are sound, then he has a remedy, a remedy which we will be glad to facilitate him in devising.  He can ask us to withdraw this amendment and give us an undertaking, as I have said, that he will bring in a simple Bill to give effect to the principles and we will ensure that that Bill is given a speedy passage through this House.</P>

After all, it will be the Minister's responsibility to say yea or nay to this, to accept our very reasonable proposal or to reject it.  That will be his business.  He will be in a position to protect this industry and all the assets that have accrued to the Irish Coursing Club, if he is concerned to secure that, and to conserve them for the benefit and advantage of the owners and breeders of greyhounds in this country.  I trust he will accept the principles of this amendment, and, as I was going on to say when Deputy Barry interrupted, if he undertakes to bring in a simple Bill embodying the principles of this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I protest. Deputy Barry has not spoken in this debate, but Deputy Barry carries a very heavy responsibility in regard to the matters with which this Bill is dealing.  Deputy Barry was a member of the advisory committee, but he has kept up a running string of interjection, during the speeches of both Deputy O'Malley and myself.  If I have to repeat myself, it is because of these interruptions which throw me back to the point at which I was when the interruptions were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying, Sir, that if the Minister accepts the principles of this amendment, and gives an undertaking that he will bring in a Bill to give effect to those principles, we, on our side, are prepared to withdraw the amendment and to ensure that the Minister's proposals giving effect to its principles will have a speedy passage through the House.  We cannot, of course, speak for the members on the Government Benches, nor can we speak for the caucuses of the Parties which support the Government.  If the Minister brings in that simple Bill, the whole purpose of our criticism of the present measure will have been achieved.  We shall have ensured that the property and assets that properly belong to those who have built them up, the greyhound breeders and owners of this country, will be <Col N="189" /> conserved for their benefit.  That is a simple thing.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will reject that proposal as he has rejected every other constructive proposal that emanated from this side of the House.  It is made seriously and with full justification.  It is rather unfortunate that there are so few members of Dáil Éireann interested in the point of view which we are expressing, that there are so few members of Dáil Éireann who have read the report of the advisory committee.  If they had read it, it would not have been necessary for Deputy O'Malley and myself to have argued the case for drastic amendment of this Bill.  The report of the advisory committee would convince everybody that the amendment which we have down is essential.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has referred to the very substantial assets which belong, in equity, if not precisely in law, to the Irish Coursing Club.  It is exceedingly difficult for the ordinary person, merely reading the report of the advisory committee, to appreciate exactly what is the relationship between the administration of these properties and the controlling body of the club.  It is exceedingly difficult for any person, who has not had access to the internal accounts of these concerns, and of the club, to form an opinion as to what extent these valuable properties are being milked for the benefit and advantage of certain individuals. Any outsider may be suspicious about the set-up, about the inter-linkages, but he cannot have much more than suspicions.</P>
    <P>This amendment will clear the air, if effect is given to it, if the Minister accepts it.  A qualified person is to be appointed, one who has no financial or social entanglements, no bonds of ordinary social intercourse and friendship to fetter him in investigating the affairs of this club, a person who has no link with those who are members of the club and has no personal connections with the value of the property which, over the years, has accrued to them.  That is why we are asking that a qualified person should be appointed as receiver.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Sir, this amendment <Col N="190" /> was not put down except after close and serious consideration.  It is, I admit, an extraordinary step to have to take, but we have been driven to it. We have been driven to it by an appraisement of the facts which are disclosed in the report of the advisory committee.  It is an axiom of ordinary commercial life, and certainly a requirement of company law, that a balance sheet shall disclose the true position of the concern in respect of which it is published.  I do not suppose anybody will query that.</P>
    <P>What do we find in respect of the balance sheet of this organisation?  We find that a property, the Greyhound Sporting Press, Limited, modestly estimated by the managers of it, in 1951, as being worth £60,000, appears in the balance sheet at a valuation of £1.  Another property, Powerstown Park&mdash;a very valuable property indeed, because, under its present management, it has the unique advantage, like a racehorse, of making its owner pay for its keep&mdash;towards which the Irish Coursing Club, in the words of the report, actually pays £100 per annum for the right to hold coursing meetings on its own lands, is a property which so far has not been valued.  It is a property the value of which has not yet been disclosed to the Irish Coursing Club, but it is a property upon which considerable sums&mdash; £12,000 approximately by Powerstown Park Company, itself, and a further £2,000 by the Irish Coursing Club&mdash; have been spent in recent years.  This property, whose value, let me emphasise again, has not been disclosed to the members of the club, but upon which £14,000 has been spent by hardheaded shrewd businessmen, appears in the balance sheet for the edification of the members of the club at their annual general meetings valued at £1.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that, when a proposal to dispose of some portion of this property was before the meeting of the Irish Coursing Club, some members of that club took the view that the property was worth little or nothing, and that it should be virtually given away to the secretary of the club who is inflicting a grave hardship on the club by resigning from his <Col N="191" /> present position in order to secure an appointment, which is rated to be worth £5,000 a year to him?</P>
    <P>I was saying that the balance sheet of any concern is supposed to present a true and accurate picture of the assets of the concern.  I have shown that Powerstown Park, about which proposals have been made which will seriously affect the value of the property but upon which £14,000 has been spent, is valued at £1.  I have mentioned that the Greyhound and Sporting Press, valued by the management at £60,000, appears in the balance sheet at £1, but there are other properties, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, which are owned by the Irish Coursing Club and which are not mentioned in the balance sheet at all. According to Deputy Anthony Barry, &ldquo;assets, under the heading of offices, fixtures and fittings, equipment, stationery, etc., do not, however, appear on the balance sheet under any heading.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am quoting, Sir, from paragraph 119 of the report of the advisory committee.  The report goes on: &ldquo;So that in reality, the net assets are considerably higher.&rdquo;  That is a masterly understatement.  Let us see what the assets of this club are according to the balance sheet and what they are presumably in reality&mdash; the assets which we think call out for protection, which we think ought to be put into the custody and under the control of a receiver, a qualified person who would administer them for the benefit and advantage of the members of the club, the greyhound breeding industry as a whole and the small farmers of Ireland about whom the Taoiseach was so concerned this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is the balance sheet of this company as at the 30th June, 1950.  I should say, Sir, now that I have refreshed myself by looking at the figures, that I did say that certain values had been put upon Powerstown Park and the Greyhound and Sporting Press by the committee in 1951.  I see that, in fact, it was a year later than <Col N="192" /> the valuations had been made because the balance sheet to which I am going to refer was the balance sheet of the club as at 30th June, 1950.  I am continuing to quote from paragraph 119.</P>
    <P>According to this balance sheet, the assets of this concern, representing debtors, cash-on-hands and investments in Government loans, amounted to £8,558.  That was the main asset disclosed in the balance sheet.  Why they made such a disclosure in the balance sheet, having regard to the manner in which they concealed the value of assets like Powerstown Park and the Greyhound and Sporting Press, is, of course, inexplicable.  They might just as well have written that asset down to £1.  If they had, however, they would have shown that the club was carrying a substantial deficit.</P>

      <P>I did not say that.  I think the Deputy has misheard me.  I said it is somewhat inexplicable that they did not write down the items&mdash; debtors, cash-on-hands and investment in Government loans&mdash;in the same drastic way as they had understated the value of Powerstown Park and the Greyhound and Sporting Press.  I went on to say that perhaps the reason why they did not do it was that, if they had done so, the balance sheet would have shown a deficiency of assets over liabilities.  That is what I said.  I did not suggest that they wanted to do that.  Perhaps Deputy Barry may have the advantage.</P>

      <P>May I recapitulate slightly for the benefit of the members who have just come in?  I was saying that the balance sheet is supposed to disclose a true picture of an organisation's affairs.  I pointed out that Powerstown Park and the Greyhound <Col N="193" /> and Sporting Press, both exceedingly valuable properties with great potentialities, appear in the balance sheet at £1 each.  I was pointing out that the debtors, cash on hands, and investments in Government loans amounted to £8,558, or that they appear in the balance sheet at a figure of £8,558.  I was then going on&mdash;I am omitting the digression into which Deputy Anthony Barry led me&mdash;to point out that the net assets, after allowing for bank overdraft and creditors, are shown at £2,041.</P>
      <P>The result is that the ordinary members of the club, many of whom are not well acquainted with balance sheets, many of whom are engaged in agriculture and are more concerned with the valuation of their lands and the rates upon them than getting out a balance sheet at the end of every year to show whether they have a surplus or a deficiency in their assets, would assume that this club was a comparatively impoverished body and therefore would be quite willing to dispose of the assets of the club, thinking that, however little they got for them, they would be well paid. One must ask oneself very seriously why was a property like the Greyhound and Sporting Press, valued in 1950 by the management at £60,000, property which included buildings which were erected in recent years, to use the phraseology of the report, at a cost of approximately £14,000, which owned plant and equipment valued for £18,000 in the year 1950&mdash;buildings which would be worth at a modest estimate perhaps 30 per cent. more today and plant which would certainly be worth 50 per cent. more to-day&mdash; why was this property entered in the balance sheet at the trifling figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the contemptuous figure of £1?  Why was Powerstown Park, upon which £14,000 had been spent in a few years, entered in the balance sheet at £1?  Surely these are questions which must be <Col N="194" /> answered by the Minister, who is putting this Bill before the House to confirm in their present position the people who have been responsible for misleading the members of the club in this way?  I have said that the true value of Powerstown Park has not been disclosed to the members.  A valuation of that property was made recently.  Was that valuation put before the members?  If not, why not? Has the Minister ascertained why that valuation has not been disclosed? Is the Minister not aware of the fact that there are very valuable mineral clays on that property, the property which belongs to the Irish Coursing Club and not to the secretary of the club or to the standing committee of the club or to any officer of the club or any friend of any officer of the club?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of that fact, or is he as remote and aloof from the transactions of this organisation as he has been remote and aloof in his approach to this Bill and to the arguments which have been addressed to him in regard to it?  I refer to the fact that there are very important deposits of mineral clay in Powerstown Park, so valuable that the secretary of the club&mdash;I am sorry to have to mention names, but there is no other way in which I can justify the amendment I have put down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have here in my possession the minutes of a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club held in May last.  In the words of the minute itself, the meeting was held at 2.30 p.m.  I have here also the issue of the <i>Sporting Press</i> for Thursday, May 17th last. There is no slander in commenting upon the transactions which took place at that meeting, but there is, as far as I am concerned, a grave charge to be laid against the Minister that, with <Col N="195" /> this information, which is available to many people in this country, he has taken no steps to protect the properties of the members of the Irish Coursing Club.  Not once has he made any public announcement that he would not permit the Irish Coursing Club to divest itself of its assets, unless their true and full value was received for them.</P>
      <P>He has not even written the letter which Deputy O'Malley suggested he might write.  The Minister will not get away with this.  As Deputy O'Malley disclosed, a great deal of interest has been aroused in these transactions.  The provincial and sporting Press are commenting upon them and, in due course, the responsibility for what is now being done will be put on the Minister.  We have been compelled to open this matter in this way because of the inaction of the Minister, because of his stubborn refusal to do what we believe to be his public duty to do&mdash;to protect the property of the hapless individuals who cannot protect themselves.  As Deputy O'Malley mentioned, and as the report of the advisory committee itself states, it is almost as much as a man's life is worth to go to one of those meetings and utter a word of criticism or protest.  I have read the evidence given by individuals who had the temerity to go to one of the annual general meetings of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present; House counted, and 20 Deputies being present</i>,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the Minister was failing in his public duty in refusing to take action to preserve the property of the hapless individuals who are unable to protect themselves.  I referred to a statement made by Deputy O'Malley.  He did not put it in precisely my words, but he said that individuals who went to the annual general meetings of this club attempting to ask questions were put in the deep freeze.  I said it was as much almost as their lives were worth to go there and attack or query any action of the persons who have <Col N="196" /> control of this organisation.  That statement is not made rashly.  I have read the statements made before the advisory committee by individuals.  It is true the statements were not made on oath and, to that extent, they can be discounted.  But they were made and they were statements which were sifted.  They were not taken just at their face value.  They were sifted and investigated by the advisory committee, the members of which included a present member of Dáil Éireann.  They came to the conclusion that there was substantial foundation for these allegations.</P>
      <P>That brings me back to the point I was making, that when people find themselves in a position in which they are estopped, almost by fear of physical violence, from protesting against what they know to be wrong, it is the duty of the Minister who set up this committee to investigate these allegations, amongst others, and to take steps to ensure that the properties which belong to the members of the Irish Coursing Club will not be dissipated and done away with.  That, as I have said, is the purpose we seek to serve in this amendment.  We are asking that some person should be put in by the Minister at the earliest possible date, which would make our amendment relevant.</P>
      <P>I have already suggested, and I am only referring to it in passing, that if the Minister has a cogent argument against the amendment in so far as it cannot be immediately effective, we say he can make it immediately effective by bringing in a Bill which would get a speedy passage through this House and, I am sure, through the Seanad; but, in any event, there is a clamant need to do something either through a public statement made by the Minister or by means of a letter written to the persons in control of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was establishing a case for this amendment.  I was showing that the balance sheet of the club, according to the advisory committee, is not a true and accurate statement of the affairs of the club.  I was going on from that to say that these very valuable properties&mdash;Powerstown <Col N="197" /> Park in particular at this moment&mdash;are now the subject of negotiations between an officer of the club, an executive of Powerstown Park who holds not merely the position of chief executive officer of the club, but is also an executive of Powerstown Park&mdash;that is one of his capacities&mdash; and the standing committee of the club, either to rent or purchase Powerstown Park.  Surely there is a conflict of interest here which should not be allowed to exist in relation to an undertaking which is the subject of legislation now before the House?</P>
    <P>How can a person who wishes to purchase or rent portion of the property belonging to this club advise that club objectively in his capacity as an officer of it?  I think it will be conceded that it would be exceedingly difficult, even if he suffered from schizophrenia, even if one side of his brain were to operate solely in the interests of the Irish Coursing Club and the other side solely in his own interests and those of his colleagues who wish to enter into occupation of the lands of Powerstown Park or some portion of them, and utilise them for their own use and benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister, we know, is a philosopher, a great student of mass psychology.  I am putting that question to him.  Even a genius could not disentangle the border line between his own interests, on the one hand, as a potential owner, and on the other from his duties or obligations to the club of which he is an officer, but that is what is going on at the moment.  It would be quite impossible, in the ordinary course of human nature, for a person to keep right on both sides of this narrow line, which would divide self-interest from his official duties; but whether difficult or easy, it will certainly be impossible to convince outside people that that line has been strictly preserved and has not been traversed in any way.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in this matter becomes more accentuated when we study, firstly, the minutes of the standing committee and then turn to the report of the general meeting of the club which appears in the <Col N="198" /><i>Sporting Press</i>, because then we realise what the effect this fictitious and unreal balance sheet, to which I have referred, has had upon the minds of the members of this club, and even of the members of the standing committee. Do not forget that here is a concern possessed of assets, which I think it is no exaggeration to say, have a net value of about £100,000. The net assets of this concern appear on the balance sheet circulated to the ordinary members at a value of £2,041. What do we find?  We find that the unfortunate members of the standing committee took the view that Powerstown Park was worth little or nothing to them.  I am sorry to delay the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have these papers marked.  Unfortunately I cannot find the reference which would clinch what I have said.  However, it is there. There is not a doubt about it that the members of the standing committee themselves were under the impression that Powerstown Park was a property of very little value, an impression which the prospective purchaser or tenant of this property was not himself averse to creating.  A report appeared in the <i>Sporting Press</i> of May 17th of the proceedings at the Irish Coursing Club meeting, a report which was edited and prepared for the Press by the person to whom I must refer as the prospective purchaser. When he was asked by a member of the club why did he propose now to sell the property&mdash;and I hope this will sink into the minds of those who are giving me the courtesy of listening to me&mdash;his reply was: &ldquo;This had been going on for quite some time&rdquo;&mdash;mark the words&mdash;&ldquo;following the report of the advisory committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that not a very relevant statement? The persons who have been <Col N="199" /> battening on the property of the Irish Coursing Club were afraid that effect would be given to the recommendations of the advisory committee which had been set up by the present Minister for Agriculture in, I think, the year 1950.  Because these individuals were afraid that action would be taken to rectify the abuses which the advisory committee found to have been established, they proceeded to consider what they were going to do with, among other properties, Powerstown Park.</P>
    <P>Is that not the plain and simple deduction to be drawn from the statement that &ldquo;this&rdquo;&mdash;I am quoting the words as they appeared in the <i>Sporting Press</i>&mdash;&ldquo;had been going on for quite some time following the report of the advisory committee.&rdquo;  They sowed the seeds at one stage and the principal officer of the Irish Coursing Club and his associates are now proposing to reap the rich harvest from those seeds.</P>

That, Sir, is the point with which I was dealing when it was discovered that I had not a House to hear me.  At the meeting on 2nd May, as reported in the <i>Sporting Press</i> of Thursday 17th May, it was disclosed to those members who attended&mdash;now I warn the Deputies on the opposite benches that if they go away they will only have the trouble of coming back again&mdash;that Powerstown Park was to <Col N="201" /> be alienated and a member of the club put this question: why did they propose to sell the property?  The answer given by the prospective purchaser of the property was in these very significant words: &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has been going on for quite some time following the report&rdquo;&mdash;I trust Deputies opposite are listening&mdash;&ldquo;of the advisory committee.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it would not have been a measure such as this, which will allow these abuses to be perpetrated and will confirm in the enjoyment of their perquisites those who have been responsible for the fact that the members of the Irish Coursing Club had the general idea conveyed to them, and impressed upon them, that Powerstown Park was not a valuable <Col N="202" /> property, that it was a liability costing the Irish Coursing Club £100 a year and that the Greyhound and Sporting Press was not a very prosperous undertaking. That is what they had in mind when they said that this question of alienating the assets of the Irish Coursing Club had been under cogitation for quite some time following the report of the advisory committee. And then he went on to disclose how it was that such a preposterous proposal, as had been made, could be considered by any body of rational men, whether they were members of the standing committee or members of the Irish Coursing Club, whether they were men who were versed in commercial transactions or whether they were men who did not particularly mind, men to whom balance sheets were more like crossword puzzles than statements of affairs.</P>
      <P>He went on to say&mdash;and this is why the members of the Irish Coursing Club had before them year after year balance sheets which misled them as to the real condition of the affairs of the club: &ldquo;It was felt,&rdquo; said this prospective purchaser, a very skilful propagandist&mdash;some samples of his propaganda were recently before a special committee&mdash;the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House&mdash;&ldquo;it was felt&rdquo;&mdash;and this is his own record: this is his own report sub-edited by himself and printed in the paper of which he is editor&mdash;&ldquo;by some members that the return from Powerstown Park was so small that some step should be taken to realise the investment or see if something could be got out of it.&rdquo;  May I repeat that, so that it will sink in?  Some members opposite are saying they cannot hear me, so I will repeat it a little more loudly: &ldquo;It was felt by some members that the return from Powerstown Park was so small that some step should be taken to realise the investment or see if something could be got out of it.&rdquo;  Now, why was the return from Powerstown Park so small in the eyes of the members of the Irish Coursing Club?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This valuable property upon which, according to paragraph 114, £14,000 had been spent in a few years, was being managed and administered not <Col N="203" /> for the benefit of the club&mdash;I say that deliberately&mdash;but for the benefit and advantage and personal profit of the officers of the club.  That is why a return from this investment, worth at least £14,000 according to the figures which are printed in paragraph 114 of the report, was worth £1,200 a year to one of the officers of the club who has actually offered to rent it, to take it on lease at that figure, because this property was managed and administered not for the benefit and advantage of the persons to whom it belonged but of the officers of the club&mdash;self-appointed managers of this concern enjoying perquisites and emoluments such as few members of the club would never dream might attach to themselves.  The use of the lands, the use of the magnificent residence, were given as an emolument to the late senior joint secretary of the Irish Coursing Club who was also acting as salaried manager of Powerstown Park, Limited.  I am making that statement on the responsibility of Deputy A. Barry who signed the report of this advisory committee.</P>

      <P>I was on the point to which I shall come back and from which the Deputy was very anxious to lead me away, of how the members of the Irish Coursing Club were led to believe that Powerstown Park was a property of very little value.  That is what I was addressing myself to.  The reason, according to the prospective tenant, purchaser&mdash;what you will&mdash;of these lands is that they were getting a small return on their investment. Deputy A. Barry will no doubt recall the strictures he passed on the committee because of that.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Similarly, we consider that the present practice whereby the only reference in the balance sheet of the club to the subsidiary companies is to their nominal value at £1 each, is misleading and should be altered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he said&mdash;I am quoting from paragraph 125:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Normally, an executive committee and its officers are at all times merely the custodians of the funds entrusted to them by the parent <Col N="206" /> body, each member of which is entitled to all reasonable information. We find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club and its administrative officials frequently lost sight of these precepts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again Deputy Barry seems to have overlooked a statement which he endorsed, a statement which appears in paragraph 123, and which he endorsed by his signature to the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard to the administration of funds, the finance committee appears to have failed to make sure that the resources of the club were applied efficiently and equitably.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How could they?  The ordinary working members of the club might like to see things properly conducted but how could they ensure that the funds were being administered equitably when the funds were not being made available to them, when the only information they had as to the value of their property was the fact that it figures at £1 in the balance sheet of the club, when they could get no revenue from Powerstown Park but, on the contrary, were led to believe that Powers town Park was a charge upon them, a liability in so far as they had to pay £100 per annum to hold coursing meetings?</P>
    <P>Think of the rather sarcastic manner in which that fact is alluded to in the report of the advisory committee. They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As in the case of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, and although Powerstown Park, Limited, seems to be a prosperous undertaking, no contribution whatever appears to have been made by it to the funds of the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then comes this masterpiece of sarcasm:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Indeed the Irish Coursing Club actually pays £100 per annum for the right to hold coursing meetings on its own lands at Powerstown Park. Profits made by Powerstown Park, Limited, have been utilised to increase the company's assets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> On the one hand we have Powerstown Park, one of the properties which is referred to in this amendment, described as a prosperous undertaking; on the other hand we have the owners of Powerstown Park&mdash;I mean the owners in equity and, I suppose, in law as the trustee deed had been executed &mdash;looking upon it as a poor investment, an investment, to quote again the chief executive officer of the club, which was so small that some members of the club thought it would be better to divest themselves of the asset altogether, an opinion which no doubt was reinforced by the fact that the club was paying £100 per annum for the right to use its own lands.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, on the one hand we have Powerstown Park, Limited, which Deputy Barry and his colleagues on the advisory committee at paragraph 114 of the report declare was&mdash;and I am sure is&mdash;&ldquo;a prosperous undertaking&rdquo; and on the other hand you have the owners who think it is of little value to them.  Now consider what is happening in this situation; consider what is the justification for the amendment which we have put down in these circumstances, with the valuable property managed and administered by the chief executive officer of the Irish Coursing Club, a property into which all the profits that should properly have been brought into account as income of the Irish Coursing Club have gone, a property which has been developed and improved by ploughing back those profits into this company.  The chief executive officer of the Irish Coursing Club comes along and makes an offer&mdash;I was going to use an adjective which I do not want to use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;makes an offer to members of the club who are being deceived by an inaccurate balance sheet as to the real value of the concern and then modestly says: &ldquo;Having created the atmosphere, I am not going to participate in the discussion, <Col N="208" /> but here I am offering you £1,200 a year.&rdquo;  At the same time, because he has to think, as he says himself, of his private domestic concerns, he offers or tenders his resignation to the club because he has found, or is being offered, a more lucrative position in managing the property of which he and his colleagues are going to become either tenants or purchasers.</P>
      <P>Is not that, as I have said, an extraordinary situation?  The whole ground, according to this gentleman himself, having been prepared, he is going to enter into the lands and reap the rich harvest of all the moneys belonging to the club which were being ploughed back to develop that property.  While I have mentioned the secretary, I want to say that the responsibility does not rest with the secretary.  That was an ordinary business transaction, perhaps, from his point of view, but there is a grave responsibility resting on the Minister and it is because he is refusing to discharge that responsibility to protect these people who are not able to protect themselves that we have moved this amendment and that we are going to fight this Bill to the bitter end.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I think it will be agreed that the Minister was correct last night in saying that our entry into the U.N.O. would be welcomed by all right-thinking Irishmen.  I regard Ireland's entry into the U.N.O. as marking one of the important milestones in the progress of our external affairs. It is very easy and perhaps natural to be critical and disillusioned of the work which that organisation has done in the ten odd years or so since its inception.  It is, of course, easy to feel disillusioned at the failure of the realisation of many of the objects, at the length of the debates and the ineffectiveness of a great deal of its work. In spite of all that, we must appreciate that the U.N.O. has had successes, some of which indeed have been spectacular.  It has had a remarkable success in respect of the crisis in Korea.  It was action by the United Nations which had settled a situation there which had threatened to break world peace.  It has had a more recent success, for example, in the Middle East in bringing about a relaxation of the position in that area.  That was to a large extent the outcome of the visit paid by the Secretary-General to the Middle East.</P>
      <P>Other organisations connected with U.N.O., like U.N.E.S.C.O., the International Children's Fund and many other organisations, have had, if not spectacular results, at any rate real success in alleviating many problems throughout the world.  I make these points in order to underline the need for propaganda in this country on behalf of the U.N.O.  I would like the Minister to use the information services at his disposal to bring home to our people the work that is being done by the United Nations, so that it can be understood by the people and so that a better public opinion can be created in the work which we have to do in the U.N.O.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister when speaking yesterday gave what I thought the country wanted, namely, an indication of the heads of policy which our representatives would adopt in the deliberations in New York.  It is, of course, impossible to bind our delegates on <Col N="210" /> decisions and actions to be taken in very fluid situations and we can only at this stage give a general outline of the purposes which will dictate our actions.  The Minister put this policy under three heads.  I do not think anybody can disagree with the first, namely that we would try to see that the objects and aims of the charter are upheld at all times and that countries trying to evade the charter and trying to carry out their international arrangements despite the charter, or in defiance of it, will find that Ireland's assistance will be on the side of achieving the objects of the U.N.O.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that in the second aim of policy we would endeavour to maintain our independence of action in the U.N.O. and on each question that emerges there.  I think that is a very laudable objective. The Minister did say, however, that he would not join in any regional groups or blocs that are formed in the international organisations, such as the U.N.O.  I do not want now to question the wisdom of that decision but I want to find out whether it should be a rigid one.  I have no experience of the work in the U.N.O. but I have a little experience of the work in the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that certain valuable information could be got out of attending meetings of delegates from other countries.  It is important that we should maintain our independence but I do not think that attending meetings of Western European groups of countries and discussing the problems that arise in the Assembly would in any way bind us to supporting the decisions of those groups.  I think we could get a lot of useful information by attending these meetings with other countries and, as well, we could give assistance to the groups we meet in our discussions. I would not like to see any definite rigid rule made binding our delegates not to attend regional meetings with regional groups.</P>
    <P>In the third head of policy, all right-thinking people will agree with what the Minister has said.  The Minister, as I understood him, said that our work <Col N="211" /> in the U.N.O. and our vote in U.N.O. should be directed towards supporting our Christian civilisation.  I think that that is abundantly clear.  That is what we should be doing there.  A necessary corollary to that decision and objective was drawn by the Minister last night when he said that we should support the free countries of the world, the western bloc in its endeavours to stop the spread of world Communism. I do not think that there is anything inconsistent in that aim and the second aim clearly maintains our freedom of independence.  I think our freedom of movement depends largely on the support that we can give to the western powers in the U.N.O.</P>
    <P>As I understood Deputy Aiken last night, he was critical of the Minister on this point and referred to the fact that there were sins committed by nonCommunist countries just as by Communist countries.  I think everybody will agree with that.  There is not the slightest doubt that the Great Powers of the West have been guilty of actions with which we do not agree or which would not commend our support.  But it is wrong to say that because Britain, for example, carries out a certain policy in Cyprus, we should not assist the western powers such as Great Britain and the United States and the lesser powers in Europe in the fight against Communism.  This world struggle at the present time is not a struggle between Montagues and Capulets in which we could say &ldquo;a curse on both your houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a struggle in which the right is not completely on one side or the wrong completely on the other.  It is a struggle in which the scales are well balanced on one side as far as we are concerned and in which our best interests, our culture and our national existence depend on the strength of the western world.  We must endeavour to see, by our support and influence in U.N.O., that the western world is assisted.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is realistic to use the yardstick which Deputy Aiken mentioned yesterday of judging countries by their attitude to our own problem. We are suffering from the grievous <Col N="212" /> injustice that our country is partitioned against the will of the vast majority of our people and we want to try to get that injustice remedied.  I think it is unreal to think that we are going to have the nations of the world flock to our support and it is quite unreal to say that, if they do not come to our support, we will not give them assistance in U.N.O.</P>
    <P>The facts are, I think, quite clear. It will take a lot of hard and laborious work on our part to bring home to the nations of Western Europe that they must try to assist us in our endeavour to remedy the wrong of Partition.  We cannot remain aloof from supporting them while trying to do that work.  In the Council of Europe, at its last session, the question of Cyprus came up.  The Greek Government had a very good case to make and it was extraordinary to see what little active support they had for their case, though there was a great deal of underlying sympathy with them from other western powers.  It is politics, and international politics, and that is something we have to accept, even if we do not like it.  If we are going to judge other countries by their attitude to Partition in this country, we might find ourselves taking sides with the Russians, because, if we can judge by what the British Communist Party says by propaganda through the Connolly clubs, the Russians seem to think that the ending of Partition is a good stick with which to beat Great Britain.  I repeat that I do not think that should be the yardstick of our approach to other countries.</P>
    <P>We must approach other countries in the U.N.O. on the basis of their general desire for peace and on the basis of their political régimes and of the philosophies which govern their régimes.  We must approach them on their respect for the liberty of the person and freedom of religion, and on this basis we can have no doubt as to the group in U.N.O. to which our support should be given.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic about U.N.O. It would be foolish to pretend that Ireland will be able to stop world wars, but we hope to be able to help in the <Col N="213" /> struggle to stop local wars, and our voice and vote and influence, if properly used in U.N.O., can assist in bringing about that peaceful condition for which everybody in a troubled world hopes.</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday referred to the work of the Council of Europe. The first thing I want to say is that it does seem to me to be a very appropriate moment to try to give a new impetus to that work.  There can be no doubt that the importance and influence of the Council of Europe has declined in recent years and there can be no doubt that the rosy hopes expressed on its foundation have not been anything like realised.  There are probably various explanations for that but to my mind the failure of the E.D.C. treaties and their ratification was the turning point in the future of the council, and, to my mind, the failure in securing ratification of these treaties had a considerable influence on the 50 Deputies in the French Assembly who did not vote for them. The failure of Great Britain to give an assurance to the Organisation of Western European Union that she would maintain two divisions permanently in Western Europe affected that decision, even though the assurances were given some time later.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the importance of the Council of Europe has declined and a reflection of that was a statement by the Minister yesterday that during the year there had only been three meetings of the Committee of Ministers.  It does seem to me that, with the present position in world affairs and with the change in the Russian attitude, it is of vital importance that the work of the Council of Europe should be given a new impetus. In the present situation, with the likelihood of Popular Front Governments developing in certain European countries, it is necessary that an impetus be given to the Council of Europe in an endeavour to counteract that tendency and to assist in the fight against Communism.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the organisation of N.A.T.O. are searching around for alternatives and it seems to me that the solution is to be found in the <Col N="214" /> Council of Europe.  I would ask the Minister to press for more frequent meetings of the Committee of Ministers. The Council of Europe, as Deputies know, is controlled by the Committee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly is merely a consultative body, with no powers.  If Ministers meet only three times per annum and the Deputies meet only nine times in the year, that is not sufficient for a live organisation which the Council of Europe should be.  I therefore suggest to the Minister that he should press on his colleagues on the Committee of Ministers the importance of meeting more frequently and of making the Council of Europe a place in Europe where European matters can be discussed.</P>
    <P>Another matter of importance arising from the work of the Council of Ministers to which I should like to refer is the question of the release of prisoners held behind the Iron Curtain.  We all know that hundreds of thousands of people are held behind the Iron Curtain and are in forced labour camps.  In that respect, a good deal of work has been done by the Council of Europe and recently I had an opportunity of meeting representatives of refugee organisations in Germany.  They all stated that it was a direct result of the pressure and propaganda, through the Council of Europe and through the Governments associated with it, that many prisoners were released.  They were convinced that, if the Council of Europe could give more action in this matter, there would be much better results, and that many more people would be released from these prisons.  I would ask the Minister to take that matter up with the Committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in regard to the Council of Europe to which I want to refer, that is, the question of briefing representatives who go there. I know that the official position is that representatives of the Council of Europe are representatives of Parliament and have no official backing.  Be that as it may, there is still no reason why the resources of the Department should not be put at the services of the representatives, if they require them.  The Minister's advisers should <Col N="215" /> be prepared to brief the representatives on the work that is to be done at different times.  That would be a great help to the representatives.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have been at the Council of Europe know how inundated they are with the amount of information and documentation from the council itself.  It is very hard, indeed, to know and be informed as to what are the important things and what are the issues to be raised.  Our permanent representative in Strasbourg should now be in a position to know these things and to advise the Department. I would ask the Minister to assist Deputies in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister's remarks on Partition were welcomed and accepted by Deputy Aiken.  It is good to see the House unanimous on the approach which we should take in order to ease the differences between the two parts of the country.  There is one matter, however, with regard to the Six Counties which I should like to refer to, that is the position of the Nationalist Party in the Six Counties.  It is regrettable that the Opposition was, at best, lukewarm about the All-Party Committee that was set up some years ago and which now no longer functions. It seems to me that the Nationalist Party in Northern Ireland requires support, both material and moral, from the South.  That support could best come from an All-Party Committee.  If the All-Party Committee were re-established, we could assist greatly the constitutional Parties in the North by providing speakers, material and propaganda for them and, above all, by giving them our moral support, which they greatly need, in order to help them in very difficult times.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I want to refer to-day is the question which I raised last year, that is, the question of our emigrants in Britain.  The recent census statistics were appalling and demonstrated the tremendous number of our Irish nationals who have now gone to live in England.  As a nation, or as a State, we have a duty to these people, even though they have left the country.  I believe that the vast majority of them left the <Col N="216" /> country because we have not been able to provide the economic conditions which would enable them to remain at home, and we have a duty to them now even though they are beyond our reach.  The consular service in London does a great deal of work in assisting them, but I do not think it is enough.  I would like to see Irish centres set up by the Department in the principal cities such as London, Birmingham, and Liverpool which would provide advisory services, such as assistance as regards lodgings, work and conditions in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>A number of people, some years ago, set up such a centre which got very good support in Birmingham.  This group of people made it quite clear that, in the initial stages, the amount involved would not be very considerable and, after a period of time, such a centre could become self-supporting. I do not think the cost of setting up these centres would be prohibitive and, in view of our duty to our emigrants to assist them in the sometimes difficult circumstances in which they find themselves, I do not think our people would object to paying whatever money is necessary to fulfil that duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a very few words about the Council of Europe.  I have been there for quite a long time and the one great impression I have brought from it is that most of the western powers represented there are still behaving as if there had been no change in the world.  They are still endeavouring to continue the exploitation of Asia and Africa.  A small nation like ourselves has the advantage that we can point out to these people that, for their own sakes, they should stop this business and that if they continue to act as they have been acting&mdash; bombing Arab villages because they have not paid a collective fine imposed on them, as the British have done&mdash;it will not do them any good.  They have been acting as if they were back in the time of Lord Palmerston and both the British and French are behaving as if Africa were still a draw farm for Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is simply playing into the hands of the Communist powers, and if these <Col N="217" /> people do not behave themselves, they will find themselves without the assistance of either Africa or Asia which they could have, for the asking, at the moment.  They are acting very foolishly and we have been pointing that out to them.  I have noticed the Danes, another small nation like ourselves, pointing out that this thing will have to stop, if these people do not want to play into the hands of the Communist powers.  These people in Western Europe have been exploiting the people of Africa for centuries.  Western Europe has been enriched by the loot extracted from Africa, both by Britain and other countries of Western Europe. That has got to stop.</P>
    <P>These people have become conscious of their own rights and small people, like ourselves, are able to point out to the larger countries that they have got to stop this career of exploitation.  It may not be well received from us, but we have got the right to say that in the Council of Europe.  I contend that the people of countries like ours will always have a common meeting ground on questions like that.  When it comes to the exploitation of other peoples, our voices will always be raised against it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this matter to a British representative on the Council of Europe.  I asked him why the British persisted in this attitude of exploitation. He said he was a member of the Labour Party and that he did not know, but he told me to ask some of the other members.  They did not know, either.  I told them that, unless they changed their tactics and ceased to exploit the countries they are still exploiting, they would turn the scales against themselves.  That is the big menace now before the world, and our representatives, when they go to the U.N.O., should bear that in mind.  For the purpose of saving our western civilisation, these people have got to face the facts of the situation and not behave as if they were back in the time of Lord Palmerston, when a barrel of powder, or a charge of grapeshot, would settle all matters.</P>
    <P>If these people continue to act like that, they will have the whole of Africa and Asia against the Western <Col N="218" /> States.  That is the big menace that I see.  I want our representatives to be able to put that point of view before the Council of Europe and to warn these people that they are running the danger of putting the whole of Africa and Asia against them, unless they mend their ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The two main points dealt with in the Minister's opening statement were our admission to the United Nations and the part that we intend to play in that body, and, secondly, the problem of Partition. I regret very much that I found his statement to be most unrealistic.  I feel that the brief the Minister brought into this House could have been prepared, in part at any rate, by the British Foreign Office.  As regards the remainder of it, dealing with the situation in Europe and in Russia, I believe his statement was only trotting after the <i>Skibbereen Eagle.</i>  I think his breathtaking pronouncements on the changes that have taken place in the Kremlin and the conditions which existed in Russia must have caused consternation to the gentlemen in authority there at the moment.  The Minister proceeded in his opening remarks to warn us all about the changes that have taken place in the Kremlin and pointed out that we must be eternally vigilant if we are to maintain our Christian way of life.</P>
      <P>I do not know exactly what the Minister proposes to do about that.  I think he is not being realistic or straightforward in this House when he makes such a statement and when criticism is levelled at these people because, at the same time, we are prepared to send high level deputations to meet representatives behind the Iron Curtain.  I understand that, in a very short space of time, Bord na Móna and other public bodies here are to send deputations to Russia to study economic matters there.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we are to benefit from the experience that the Russian engineers have gained in the utilisation of peat and so forth, why must we criticise the people in charge of that country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt a body blow to the Russian administration, the Minister <Col N="219" /> proceeded to roam the Middle East and North Africa.  Here I felt the brief the Minister read out was identical with the briefs prepared for Sir Anthony Eden on the problems that face the British Government in the Middle East and North Africa.  Having dealt with North Africa and the Middle East, the Minister went on to say: &ldquo;These problems are under examination by my Department.&rdquo;  What exactly does that mean?  Is it an oil interest that is worrying Ireland in the Middle East?  Have we got colonies in North Africa about which we are worried?  I want to congratulate Deputy Boland on his remarks in regard to certain aspects of the treatment meted out to the unfortunate natives in Africa and in the Middle East at the present time by the colonial powers, be they Britain, France or any other country.  It is for that reason I say that the Minister's opening speech was completely unrealistic.</P>
    <P>As far as areas like North Africa and Cyprus are concerned, I have heard nothing so far from the Government or from the Minister for External Affairs deploring the treatment meted out to members of religious communities in Cyprus and the leaders of the Church there, be it the Greek Orthodox Church or any other Church. No criticism and no protest was made by this State or by the Minister's Department. Yet 12 months or two years ago, we were flooding the world with protests about the treatment meted out to bishops behind the Iron Curtain. Why could we not adopt that same attitude towards the treatment meted out to the bishops who are not behind the Iron Curtain?  Is it because we are so closely associated with Great Britain that we are afraid to tread on her toes?  Is it because we are afraid to pull the lion's tail that we are afraid to make a protest about the scandalous and horrifying manner in which human beings in Cyprus and North Africa are being treated at the present time?  Because it does not take place behind the Iron Curtain, we have not the courage of our convictions and we do not condemn it.  If we are to be realistic in external affairs and <Col N="220" /> have the respect of the small nations of the world, we should offer our criticisms equally of all nations, no matter on what side of the Iron Curtain they are, that do not give a fair deal to the ordinary human being.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with our entry into the U.N.O.  I am glad that Ireland has been accepted as a member of that organisation and I am glad for one main reason.  I believe that we should utilise our position as a member of that organisation to try and secure the reunification of our country through the means at our disposal in this organisation.  The Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach have pointed out that we would let no opportunity pass on which we could raise the problem of Partition.  That is most gratifying.  I hope that the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs really mean that.  It is very hard, of course, when you are dealing with legal people, men who are able to interpret and twist words that for the normal people have only one meaning.  We find that the Taoiseach himself has stated that we are not going to be a nuisance in the U.N.O.&mdash;that we are not to raise Partition at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>I think that the financial implications in regard to our commitments in the U.N.O. are pretty heavy.  Therefore, I do not think we should be sending representatives, whether they are on a permanent basis or otherwise, to the U.N.O. just for the sake of listening to the other nations protesting about their problems.  The Minister went on to state that, in our position as a member of the U.N.O., we would stay clear of all blocs.  I presume that to mean we will pursue a completely independent course in that body, but again I find myself rather suspicious of that statement of the Minister that we will stay clear of all blocs, because he tempers that statement very shortly afterwards by saying we belong to the great community of states made up of the U.S., Canada and Western Europe.  He said our national destiny was bound up with theirs.  He said our aim should be to strengthen the influence of this group in the U.N.O.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> Having first stated that we were to stay clear of all blocs, he proceeded, in that paragraph, to tie us in with what he described as the nations of Western Europe.  I note he leaves out Great Britain; he says: &ldquo;The U.S., Canada and Western Europe.&rdquo;  Why not be frank and say that, as far as we are concerned, Western Europe also includes Great Britain?  If our aim in the U.N.O. is to strengthen the influence of this group, is it not plain that our aim also is to strengthen the influence of the British Government in the U.N.O.?  Does that mean that our efforts will be to strengthen Britain's influence when she takes strong and remedial measures against those people who do not want to accept her rule?</P>
    <P>All this question of Western Europe and the situation there is cloaked over with the beautiful idea that Christianity is in danger from the menace behind the Iron Curtain, Communism. I think if we are realistic and look at the state of France and of Italy to-day we will find that the danger of Communism is coming from this side of the Iron Curtain as well.  If we look at Italy we will find that the Communist and semi-Communist or Socialist Party&mdash;the two Parties combined in Italy&mdash;have gained an influence and sway even at the local elections.  It was very lucky that there was not a Communist Mayor appointed in Rome recently.</P>
    <P>The situation has changed in Western Europe.  The pronouncements of the French Government in recent months have shown that they are realistic, that they are not satisfied with domination by either the U.S. or Great Britain on matters of foreign policy.  I think we should be realistic too, and that when the Minister says we will not tie ourselves to any bloc, he means what those words say.</P>
    <P>Next week, we will have a distinguished visitor coming to Ireland, the leader of the Indian nation.  I think there is significance in the fact that he is coming here; I think the leader of the Indian nation would like to discuss with Ireland's leaders what our attitude will be in the U.N.O.  I think he is the only foreign leader ever <Col N="222" /> given the privilege of coming on the floor of this House; the Dáil thought so much of him as a leader in India that he was brought in and given the privilege of sitting in this House.  India and Ireland are closely associated in the particular aspirations involved in their efforts to get freedom from Britain.  India has pursued a courageous path in spite of the pressure brought to bear on her by both the Communistic and capitalist states in recent years.</P>
    <P>She has decided India comes first and she is prepared to deal with each aspect of future events according as it will benefit India as a nation.  I think it would be hard for us to find a wiser line to take than that taken by India&mdash; that is, to stay clear of all blocs.  It is all very fine to talk about principles in international affairs.  There are no such things as principles in international politics to-day, and as far as Ireland is concerned, our aim should be to ensure that while we are a member of the U.N.O. we will not allow ourselves to be used or soiled by association with nations who are just concerned with keeping what they have or with trying to keep down other unfortunate nations.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks, the Minister dealt with the problem of Partition.  I am not going to deal with it in any detail now.  The Minister's speech was the same as every other speech made here during the last 15 years; there was no hope of solution for the problem.  To my mind, no real attempt is being made to solve Partition.  Even on this question of economic co-operation, we have not even been alert enough to take the initiative on the question of the use of atomic energy.  I believe that when the offer came to Ireland that we would get the benefit from America of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, we should have straightway asked the Six County Government to co-operate with us on that.  We should not have waited to discuss the problems at this end.  The initiative on all matters of co-operation should come from this House, from this side of the Border. If the Northern Government refuse to meet us and reciprocate, there is very <Col N="223" /> little we can do about it.  But at least we should make the gesture of friendship and co-operation.  There is very little hope of its coming from some of the gentlemen in the North.</P>
    <P>The only aspect of Partition that I should like to mention here now is that dealing with a legal aspect.  I should like the Minister to deal with this aspect when he is replying.  We are now about to take our place as a member of the U.N.O.  Our main object should be to expose the evils of Partition and try to seek support for the reunification of our country.  Our representatives in the organisation will have very strong legal grounds, apart from the strong moral grounds, on which to lay their case for the solution of Partition.  Our representatives will be dealing with the most highly skilled legal men in the world.  We must have our legal position clarified when we take our place in the U.N.O.</P>

      <P>I am speaking now completely as a layman with no legal training.  During the past three years, I have spent most of my spare time reading and studying the situation that led up to the signing of the 1925 Boundary Agreement.  I am dealing with the situation as I find it.  The 1925 Boundary Agreement came about as a result of the 1920 Act.  Until that agreement was passed there was no such recognised legal territory as the Six Counties as constituted to-day.  It was in 1925 that this House coldly and calmly signed an agreement with the British Government handing over for all time their rights to the Six Counties as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of going into the matter in detail.  It would take hours and I am merely skimming the verges of it.  When the Unionist Party representatives in the Six Counties go to an international meeting they ask our representatives or the representatives of foreign countries why the Irish representatives are moaning about Partition when they actually signed over the Six Counties themselves for all time.  I have not touched on the moral and the national issue at all.  There is no doubt with regard to the justice of our claim but before we go to talk in the U.N.O. with these highly skilled legal people, it behoves us here at this stage to ensure that there will be no loopholes for these legal men to shoot down or to delay the hearing of our case.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for External Affairs tell us what measures were taken by any Government here since 1925 to repudiate the 1925 Boundary Agreement which handed over the Six Counties?  What Act was passed in this House to repudiate that Agreement? If no such Act of repudiation was passed in this House would the Minister say if it is necessary or desirable that this House would formally take a decision repudiating the 1925 Boundary Agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan is a legal man but, with all due respect to him, I do not think I would take his legal opinion as being final on this very grave issue.  Deputy Flanagan knows perfectly well that there are legal men in the North who are as well trained and as skilled in their profession as the most highly trained legal men we have here.  There are legal men in Britain who take the view that no repudiation of the 1925 Boundary Agreement was made just as legal men in the Six Counties take that view.  A clearer and more honest way of dealing with the position would <Col N="225" /> be if we passed a simple, one-line Bill in this House before we took our seat in the U.N., stating that Dáil Éireann formally repudiates the 1925 Boundary Agreement.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude, I would like still to urge on the Taoiseach and the Government to give further serious consideration to the admission of the Six-County representatives.  I have no time whatever for irresponsible raids in the Six Counties.  I have no time whatever for certain individuals in this State who have not the guts to produce an economic and social policy in conjunction with their alleged military policy.  It is regrettable that so many fine young Irishmen are being misled by these mysterious gentlemen in the background, but from now on more and more of the youth of to-day will be attracted into such organisations.  It is very hard to criticise them because there is no alternative being offered to them by this House.  There is no attempt being made to solve the problem of Partition by constitutional means.  It is no good saying: &ldquo;Have patience.  It will come in time.&rdquo;  That is no answer to the young men of the present and future generations, especially when it comes from men of the older generations who were prepared to sacrifice their lives in order to ensure the freedom of this State. That is why I would urge on the Government the desirability of reconsidering their decision on this matter of allowing the Six-County representatives to take their rightful place in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I want to deal with is as to what exactly are the functions of the Department of External Affairs in regard to foreign trade, and so on.  As far as I can see, at the present moment, the Department of External Affairs is constituted on the same lines as the Foreign Office and we are trying to keep up with the Joneses on this question of standing in international societies, cultural and educational activities, and so forth.  That is all very desirable but there is a great deal of tightening up in finance: There is a shortage of money here for capital development purposes.  There <Col N="226" /> is a shortage of money for the expansion of industrial projects.  We have even reached a stage that in regard to the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna, two of our most important industrial concerns, the money available for their expansion is very limited.  In fact the situation with regard to both of these State bodies will be critical within the next 12 months as far as the labour supply is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware of the grave dissatisfaction which exists among members of the ranks stationed at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, because of conditions generally and because of the interpretation of regulations in a harsh manner to the detriment of the men concerned; and whether he is prepared to have the matter investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="Minister for Defence (General MacEoin) Seán (Major-General) Mac Eoin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the existence of grave dissatisfaction amongst the members of the permanent Defence Force stationed at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick.  As a result of inquiries which I have made, I can find no evidence that dissatisfaction does, in fact, exist or that the conditions of service there or the manner in which regulations are interpreted or enforced are such as to give cause for any complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the inquiries he put on foot were addressed to the officer commanding and other officers in Sarsfield Barracks? Is he aware that there is grave dissatisfaction among the ranks stationed in that barracks?  If I present to him irrefutable evidence from soldiers in the ranks, will he give a guarantee that no disciplinary action will ensue as a result of such representations and such evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the inquiries were made in the barracks and not from the Deputy, or any other Deputy in Limerick.  If evidence comes to my notice from any source which I can regard as reliable, I shall certainly have it examined.  If the request is that I do not take disciplinary action against the people who make the charges, if they are found to be ill-founded, I presume then I shall also <Col N="231" /> be at liberty to waive privilege as far as the evidence is concerned in order to enable the officers who are accused to take action against the accuser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that most extraordinary supplementary reply, is the Minister aware that I did not mention or suggest that he should set inquiries afoot through Deputies? I said &ldquo;through the officer commanding and the officers in Sarsfield Barracks.&rdquo; Is the Minister not aware that justice cannot be done while the threat hangs over the head of the ordinary private that disciplinary action may ensue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no private soldier who does not know that he can make a complaint direct to me at any time or in any place and I will protect him fully against any attack from anybody.  Every serving soldier knows that.  I can assure the Deputy that, as far as my investigations have gone, there is no cause for complaint.  But I will take from the Deputy, if he sends it to me, any information he has relating to the matter.  I do not think, however, that he should put a condition on it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that a member of the Defence Forces [name supplied] attached to Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, was evicted by the tenant from a corporation house in which he was a subtenant, and that the soldier, his 19-year-old wife and his child were given a ticket for the City Home, and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter; further, whether he is aware of the acute shortage of housing accommodation for married personnel in Sarsfield Barracks, and what immediate action is contemplated to alleviate the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no responsibility for the matter mentioned in the first part of the Deputy's question and it is not, therefore, my intention to make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the need for the provision of housing accommodation for <Col N="232" /> married personnel at this barracks and the matter is under consideration as part of the general scheme to improve the housing conditions of married soldiers at the larger military centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the end of June, 1954, he gave an exactly similar undertaking?  He said the matter was under consideration then.  Further, is the Minister aware that a married soldier, his 19-year-old wife and one child have had to go into the City Home in this so-called Christian, Catholic Ireland? Surely, while it may not be within his province, he should direct his attention to such matters?</P>

      <P>In other words, is it the duty of a member of the Defence Forces who is acting as orderly to clean the house, do the cooking and mind the children?  There is nothing at all amusing in that; as every Deputy on every side of the House <Col N="234" /> knows that is what is happening, and will the Minister state whether this is correct?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that grave inconvenience and expense are caused to the general public, and particularly to the farming community, of Donaskeigh, Grants-town, Ballinard, Curraghpoor and Alleen, because no public telephone facilities exist in Donaskeigh, and whether he will take immediate steps to have such facilities provided there.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from and on behalf of local organisations to provide a sub-post office with public telephone facilities at Donaskeigh.  Provision of the facilities requested would be uneconomic and accordingly I regret they cannot be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is one of the most important and populous districts in the South? There is a double school there; there is a Catholic Church and last, but by no means least, there is a creamery with an intake of 4,000 gallons a day. The nearest post office is Tipperary, <Col N="237" /> some five miles away, and Dundrum is something about the same distance away.  I would like to know if the Minister could do something towards providing telephone facilities in these circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the Deputy appears to be geographically at sea because the nearest post office is much closer than Tipperary.  However, the particular difficulty is that there is not justification for the provision of a sub-post office at that particular point and without a sub-post office you cannot have a telephone.  We have put sub-offices and telephones as close as we possibly can but in present circumstances there is no justification for a sub-office and telephone in the district.  The only way in which it could be provided would be for a telephone to be rented by a local resident or a number of residents in order to provide facilities for the locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fishermen employed under a contract of service are treated as nonagricultural workers for the purpose of insurance contributions.  Fishermen not employed under a contract of service and remunerated by a share in the profits or the gross earnings of the working of the vessel are insurable at a special rate.  The position regarding the latter class is under consideration.</P>

I am asking the Minister, is he not prepared to accept that the points made from this side of the House are based on substantial views as to certain points of principle and to the approach to matters of this nature.  Can he not give us some enlightenment as to his views or can he not argue against the points made so as to give us an opportunity of making up our minds on the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is apparently not aware that I have already intervened in the debate this morning. Deputy O'Malley spoke for one and a half hours and Deputy MacEntee spoke for two hours on this amendment.  I spoke for four and a half minutes, in the course of which I was able to submit to the House arguments which persuaded Deputy MacEntee that his proposal was largely vitiated, when I directed his attention to Article 13 in the constitution of the Irish Coursing Club as scheduled in the Bill. That Article sets out that the property and assets of the club and its subsidiary interests, including Powerstown Park Limited, and the Greyhound and Sporting Press Limited, should be vested in trustees appointed by the club.</P>
      <P>That provision much more obviously meets the purpose which Deputy MacEntee appeared to have in view, inasmuch as his amendment cannot come into operation until the Bill is passed into law.  His amendment proposes that a receiver should be appointed for the period that might elapse between the enactment of the Bill and its coming into operation&mdash;a matter of days.  My purpose is to bring the Act into operation at the earliest possible moment so that all these properties would become the subject matter of a trusteeship under the terms of the Act itself, in perpetuity. Deputy MacEntee was constrained to admit that these considerations made it very manifest that there were grave defects in the procedure proposed by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to say that if I was now prepared to introduce a short Bill, which he undertook would be hurried through the House, but adding that he <Col N="243" /> could not speak for the Seanad, implementing the terms of this amendment, his opposition to the Bill would be withdrawn.  That is a course that I do not think wisdom or prudence would suggest and I would honestly recommend to Deputies that they should have regard to Article 13 of the constitution of the club.  They would then see that, in fact, the expeditious passing of this Bill through the House, subject to the amendments I have set down, and subject also to certain other amendments which I promised to bring in on the Report Stage, would achieve the purpose of bringing these properties under trusteeship much more efficiently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The proposer of the amendment spoke for two hours and Deputy O'Malley spoke for an hour and a half. Both have expressed their intention to continue talking on this amendment as long as the rules of order will permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that I am desirous of showing some discourtesy to the House in failing to meet reasonable arguments.  I do not believe that the length of time consumed in meeting reasonable arguments makes the measure of one's courtesy.  I was not discourteous to the House but I merely wish to expedite the procedure by saying that there is nothing more I can usefully say on the amendment.  I have tried to explain to the best of my ability that all the circumstances that could reasonably be argued on this amendment are amply covered by Article 13 of the schedule of the constitution of the Irish Coursing Club.  I do not propose to interfere further in the discussion of this amendment because I believe I have already said everything I can possibly say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether <Col N="244" /> the Minister will be prepared to extend his courtesy to explain to us on this side of the House, with his background of legal knowledge, what is the present position.  Paragraph 13, to which the Minister has referred, has not the force of law at the moment, nor will it have the force of law until this Bill is enacted in some form or another.  The Minister accepts that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither would the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  But the Minister will remember that, when this amendment was first introduced by Deputy MacEntee, he gave an undertaking to the House that, in his ministerial capacity, he would get from this Irish Coursing Club an undertaking that nothing of their properties would be disturbed until it could be dealt with.  That will satisfy us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy?  The Deputy says &ldquo;That will satisfy us&rdquo;.  May I direct the Deputy's attention to the answer I gave to a parliamentary question put down by Deputy MacEntee on the 8th May.  In the course of that answer I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As to the second part of the question, I am informed by the president of the Irish Coursing Club that any decision to sell or let any property of the club would require the assent of the general body of the members, and that should any such decision be taken at any time, it would be carried into effect by public auction or competitive tender.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What further undertaking can I get from the Irish Coursing Club other than that which I have got and which I have communicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now come very close to understanding our attitude in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But I did that on the 8th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a satisfactory answer.  We want to preserve all the assets for this reorganised body.  Then, after they have had their new control board set up, they <Col N="245" /> can deal with the disposal or otherwise of any of the assets for the benefit of the club.  The Minister's answer is just this: that the present board of the Irish Coursing Club can decide yes or no&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The only limitation that the Minister gives there is that it will be done by public auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  It will require the assent of the general body of the members&mdash;of the general body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We feel that there is a certain amount of apprehension at the moment at the possibility of the assets being in any way disturbed, and we will be prepared to withdraw this amendment if the Minister will give the House an assurance that nothing will be done, that nothing will be disbursed or disposed of, until this becomes an Act.  That will help him in bringing this Bill through this House.  When the Minister says that we have made up our minds here to obstruct, that is not the case.  In his answer to my previous question, the Minister referred to the fact that he had considered each one of the previous amendments in a courteous way and that he had given, in his opinion, a satisfactory answer.  I say to the Minister that I do not know what amendment he has accepted yet.  I do not know that he has given way on a single amendment proposed by this side of the House.</P>
      <P>We asked previously for certain compromises, as between what was in the Bill and what was suggested in the amendment, and the Minister would not accept.  I do not think the Minister has even given an inch from the beginning up to the present section we are dealing with, unless the Minister can correct me and show me to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to tell us now what word of the Bill up to the present he has agreed to change as a result of all the approaches from this side.  The Minister <Col N="246" /> in his reply said he was dealing with this amendment, he thought, as satisfactorily as he had dealt with other amendments.  Will the Minister at this stage save the House trying to adduce new arguments and new reasons, other than those already given, to induce him to accept the sense of what is in this amendment or in this series of amendments; or would he suggest even some counter-suggestion to the amendments to meet the point we have?  If one reads what has emerged from the last meeting of this body, it is quite clear that a certain element were seriously prepared to consider the acceptance of an offer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer was on the 8th May&mdash;six days later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it was.  But the position is that the Minister must admit that we have no statutory control of this body and the main purpose behind this Bill is to bring about statutory control.  What is to stop him saying &ldquo;all right&rdquo;?  There has been an inquiry.  The investigation showed that there were reasonable grounds for requiring legislation of this kind because the industry is of national importance. It is not a small little private industry in the hands of a few people.  There are certain agreements which have to be honoured, which were made in good faith by both sides in the past, but if there is a particular beneficiary of one of those agreements who now wishes to change his own circumstances, then the board should be protected to the extent of its assets not being impaired in any way by certain changes which are contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I beg the Minister just to say that he will indicate to these people that no disposal, by public auction or otherwise, of any of the assets will be countenanced by him and that such disposal can only take place when this Bill becomes an Act.  If he says that, we will be all quite satisfied.  We all meet different sections of the public. <Col N="247" /> The Minister will probably hear from people who agree with his point of view in the matter; we will hear from the persons who are in some disagreement with the point of view expressed by him.  If you put the two together, is it not wiser in the long run to say: &ldquo;This is the proper way of dealing with it; I will give you that undertaking and we will all be happy about the section&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly easy for me to get up and say all sorts of extravagant things in Dáil Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and give extravagant undertakings.  But as the Deputy knows perfectly well, I have no power to ensure that what I say should be done.  I take the view, and I imagine it would be shared by any reasonable person, that there should not be any change in the <i>status quo</i> while this Bill is under consideration by Oireachtas Éireann.  I think the communication which I made to the Chairman of the Irish Coursing Club and the reply which he made to me indicate that perfectly clearly.  But there is no use in my misleading Dáil Éireann by telling them because I have said something, that means that I can control what I have no power to control.</P>
      <P>I addressed an inquiry to the person and induced him to reply to me.  I then gave a reply to Deputy MacEntee here in the House and here are the terms of my reply:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have, however, made inquiries from the president of the Irish Coursing Club, who informs me that while offers to buy or lease property belonging to the club have been received from time to time over the years, no decision has, in fact, been made by the club as suggested in the first part of the question.  As to the second part of the question, I am informed by the president of the Irish Coursing Club that any decision to sell or let any property of the club would require the assent of the general body of the members, and that should any such decision be taken at any time, it would be <Col N="248" /> carried into effect by public auction or competitive tender.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot place any restraint upon them, but it has been made perfectly manifest by me that there should not be any change in the <i>status quo</i> while the Bill is pending.  I cannot give the House an undertaking that there will not be a change in the <i>status quo</i>, because it is not in my power to give such an undertaking.  However, a different situation arises when the Bill passes and if Deputies would get together and get the Bill through promptly all their anxieties would be allayed at once.  It is this eternal delay of the Bill that maintains this situation.  This Bill has been under discussion now for eight months and during all that time there has been no change in the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Six days out of eight months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been before the House for that period.  If the Deputies' apprehensions were well founded would it not be likely that a change would have taken place in that long period?  It has not taken place, and the chairman of the club has put himself on record in these terms to me. He knows my views.  If the Deputies are sincere in their desire to implement these amendments, the way to do it is to pass this Bill.  The Deputy's amendment provides a security for the period that will elapse between the enactment of the Bill and the putting of it into operation.  Article 13 of the Schedule to the Bill provides security in perpetuity. If the Deputies want that security, we can find a common mind and make progress, but if they are simply here to obstruct, then I must excuse myself from further contribution on an amendment on which I think I have spoken already repetitiously in an effort to meet the points made by each Deputy who has risen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak only because my name was mentioned very considerably in the course of the morning's debate.  I want to agree with what the Minister has said about the Bill being before the House since last November.  Deputy O'Malley said <Col N="249" /> we have had only six days to consider it.  That was nearly twice the period it took us to consider the Finance Bill, a much more important measure.  What is more important, however, is that this commission reported to Deputy's Briscoe's Party, to Deputy MacEntee's Party, to Deputy O'Malley's Party in 1952, that for two and a half years after that this ex-Minister for Finance did not take any action on it, and that although he did not, Powerstown Park was not sold to some foreigner or somebody else.  The Deputy's Party did not do anything about it because I think they felt it was not quite as worrying a matter then as it apparently is now.  I think the hypocrisy of Deputy MacEntee is unveiled by the fact that, for two and a half years as Minister for Finance, he had this report before him, disclosing these various discrepancies in the administration of the affairs of this club, and he did nothing about them.  This Government came into office and we do something about them.  It is quite obvious the attitude of Deputy MacEntee is &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; and dishonest and that Deputy MacEntee does not give a damn whether or not this Bill was ever introduced.  He is now using it as a vehicle to express his personal hatred against individuals and I do not think that any king of the underworld in New York&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>I must say that I think the amendments are so designed that they can provide a vehicle for attack on the persons named by Deputy MacEntee here to-day.  I think Deputy MacEntee could have dealt with this matter while he was Minister for Finance.  I agree with the Minister that there is no danger whatever of anything happening to the assests of this organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is the custodian of order in this House and I am quite certain the Ceann Comhairle would not allow such an approach as that described by Deputy Barry.  We are at one in so far as the Minister agrees that neither he nor the House has any statutory power to enforce anything on the Irish Coursing Club executive at the moment.  We all accept that.  There is, however, proof before the House that while this Bill was going through there was in contemplation a deal to dispose of certain of the resources of this club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are asking the Minister to do, and we are quite prepared to withdraw the amendment if he gives us this undertaking, is to write a letter to this body saying it would be his wish that <Col N="251" /> they would not disturb any of these assets until the Bill becomes an Act. We would be quite satisfied with that because we believe that because of the position the Minister occupies in the Government a request made by him would be honoured by these people. Perhaps we are being a bit obstinate in not being satisfied with the reply to Deputy MacEntee's question which the Minister read out.  However, if the Minister agrees to request these people to maintain the <i>status quo</i> we will immediately withdraw this amendment and more progress will be made.  We have grounds for our attitude.  As reported in the <i>Sporting Press</i> of May 17th, which is after the date of the question to which the Minister referred, one of the members of the executive is quoted as saying: &ldquo;They had got a competent firm of valuers to give the valuation as to the value of the property.  The standing committee&rdquo;&mdash;not as a result of a general meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The propriety of my writing to any citizen of the State purporting to control the disposition of this property in my official capacity is open to question when I have no legislative function, but I would be prepared to meet the Deputy just to test whether we are <i>ad idem</i> in this matter at all by saying I would undertake to direct the attention of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club to the text of the debate in the course of which these references have been made.</P>

      <P>On the section, may I say that on the Second Stage I think it was drawn to the Minister's attention that if a bookmaker was refused a licence he should appeal to the body who refused him.  That is dealt with in Section 29 (3), which states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the board proposes to refuse an application for a course-betting permit, or to suspend or revoke a course-betting permit, the board shall serve notice of the proposal on the applicant or holder and shall, if any representations are made in writing <Col N="253" /> by the applicant or holder within seven days, consider the representation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Could I assist the Deputy?  These are the sections on which I wish to get the issues in order to indicate the atmosphere of sweet reasonableness that could prevail if we only approached these matters in a co-operative way.  I took note of the representations that were made on various sides of the House that where a man's livelihood was in issue, while disciplinary action might be necessary, he ought to have the right where he felt his livelihood was at stake, to go to some outside person so that both parties, the bookmaker and the disciplinary body, would appear before him.</P>
      <P>I notice the suggestion as regards the district justice or a Circuit Court judge.  I think that, on the whole, it is better to arrange that if an appeal of this kind is brought, we should facilitate the bookmaker to have such an appeal, that we should set up an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal to deal with each case which should consist of an independent person, preferably with legal experience, possibly assisted by assessors.  I will undertake to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage which will set out the scheme which I think is acceptable to the Bookmakers' Association, giving them access of appeal. However, it is expedient to provide that where a bookmaker meets with a condemnation of this kind and his licence is withdrawn and he wants to make an appeal and have a special <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal set up to hear that appeal, he should be required to make a substantial deposit so that if his appeal is determined to be wholly frivolous he will be penalised to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that proposal first occurred to my mind in order to avoid fictitious appeals being made, I felt it might be a great hardship on small bookmakers with limited resources.  Then it occurred to me that small bookmakers <Col N="254" /> or bookmakers of any standing are members of their association and if a small bookmaker comes to his association and says: &ldquo;They have given me the knock and I have not had a fair do; I want to make an appeal&rdquo;, if he can satisfy his colleagues that he has any kind of a fighting chance the organisation which disposes of adequate resources will put up the stake for him.  The only way of preventing a man making a wholly irrational appeal, when he actually deserves the censure which was laid upon him is to provide that he shall make a deposit, which he will be in danger of losing if his appeal is rejected.  If the appeal is successful, he will of course get his deposit back.</P>
    <P>There may be a borderline case in which the Bookmakers' Association may think the appeal was justified and yet the competent tribunal may determine the authority was right in what they did in which event the Bookmakers' Association would have to bear the loss of the deposit.  I think we ought to put in a proviso to prevent wholly irrational appeals being made. The proviso I propose to the House will be directed to that end, to avoid the submission of wholly improper appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Minister has said in principle is very good. I suppose we can discuss the question when the amendment is moved.  I agree with the Minister that, if the appeal were to be made by the individual bookmaker, we might have what he quite properly describes as frivolous or fictitious appeals and therefore a deposit would be necessary, a deposit which would become forfeit.  The latter part of his suggestion, however, appeals to me much more.  The bookmakers have an association and, if the association, as a trade union body, appeals on behalf of its members, I do not think a deposit should then be necessary.  What form of court the Minister has in mind I do not know. That is something to be considered.  It might be possible for us to suggest, however, or for the Minister to consider, that, apart from those he has mentioned, there should be some <Col N="255" /> representative of the Bookmakers' Association on that <i>ad hoc</i> body.</P>

The amendment tabled by Deputy Walsh seeks to give statutory effect to the system actually in operation at present in connection with the collection of the levy on horse racing bets.  The system, in fact, operates at the moment and the insertion of this amendment is not really necessary to achieve the purpose Deputy Walsh has in mind.

      <P>On the section, I would like to get some clarification and so, I am sure, would other interested parties in connection with the rate of levy.  I am not interested as to whether the levy is 2½ per cent.  or 1¾ per cent.  I am talking now of the actual bet.  On the Second Stage the Minister stated that if a punter puts 2/6 on a dog and the punter loses, the bookmaker will have to pay the appropriate levy on the half-crown.  If, however, the punter wins at four to one he should get 12/6, but the bookmaker will deduct tax on that 12/6. The Minister went further and pointed <Col N="257" /> out that the bookmaker gains nothing at all, good, bad or indifferent.  This question of levies is causing controversy up and down the country. The Minister may have seen the very long correspondence in the Press in relation to this levy.  If I go into a bookmaker's office to-morrow and lose £1 the bookmaker will pay the tax on that £1.  If the horse wins at four to one I should get £5; but the bookmaker has the audacity to stop tax on that £5 whereas, under the Act, the bet is the original stake and not the winnings and all the bookmaker should do is stop tax on the stake.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of what I think, or Deputy Barry thinks.  It is the law of the land.  The law states that a bet is a stake levied at a hazard or risk and that the bet shall be taxed.  It was first of all 2½ per cent.; then it was increased to 5 per cent., then to 7½ per cent. and now it is, I think, 10 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point.  I am not giving him a short answer but I think it is often a prudent thing to let well alone.  Does the Deputy follow me?  The fact is that under the horse betting situation nobody has ever challenged it; they have accepted it as a good working arrangement. That seems to be a fairly sporting approach on the matter.  If it were challenged, it would have to be clarified.  I think what Deputy Walsh had in mind was to do just what Deputy O'Malley is talking about, to clarify the situation in his amendment No. 21, which the Deputy has withdrawn. I think it is better to leave things as they are and to allow the present system to function unless and until some enterprising soul can go into court and establish the proposition that Deputy O'Malley advances here.  I think it right to say that if anybody did so succeed it would be necessary to come to Dáil Éireann and pass legislation in the terms of Deputy Walsh's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advised the withdrawal of Deputy Walsh's amendment because I am a great believer in leaving well alone. <Col N="258" /> However, I agree with Deputy O'Malley that if some enterprising soul does go to court and gets a finding on the lines that he apprehends then we will have to come in and legislate on the lines of Deputy Walsh's amendment. If the view were very strongly expressed to me that we ought to do that now, I could bring in an amendment on the Report Stage.  I think there are some slight, technical drafting details which require to be considered in the amendment submitted by Deputy Walsh, but I could bring in an amendment on those lines to give effect to that principle if the House thought that desirable, but my recommendation would be to leave well alone, and if a difficulty of that kind materialises hereafter, we are all agreed on what we think ought to be done.  We can then bring in a short, amending Bill to deal, not only with greyhound racing, but with horse racing also, and make abundantly clear what is at present generally presumed to be the case, even though the doubt to which Deputy O'Malley refers may, in fact, be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press unduly on this matter but there is no question of doubt in my mind.  Bookmakers, since 1926 on, have retained moneys to pay the Revenue Commissioners by stopping tax from winnings. If the Minister studies the 1926 Act&mdash; I think it is Section 14&mdash;he will see there that a levy can be imposed only on the bets and the bookmakers certainly have had some &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; to have down through the years made deductions from winnings and stakes.  The stake is the only taxable thing.  I would suggest to the Minister that a small amendment on the Report Stage would cover everything and if he wants to authorise bookmakers to tax winnings and stakes, let him say it here because the people who go to greyhound races are a most peculiar crowd&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point on this section concerning the levy.  I and speakers on both sides of the House have, I think, maintained that the levy is not necessary at all. It is quite obvious that the money for this new board must come from somewhere. It cannot come out of the air, and I presume the Government has no money to give them as they have not got money for more necessary things. I want to point out that no one knows apparently how the rate is to be calculated, whether it will be 2½ per cent. or 1¼ per cent.  Personally, I would rather see the levy, if there has to be a levy, fixed at 2½ per cent. because it would be very difficult to collect 1¼ per cent., particularly from the small betters.  I think the Minister has no knowledge at the present time of what exactly the levy will be.  He says in sub-section (1) of Section 32:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person who, as a licensed bookmaker, enters into a course bet on or after the commencement of this section shall pay to the board a levy calculated at the rate of the prescribed percentage for the time being of the amount of the course bet.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that the finances of the control board were gone into in great detail by the advisory <Col N="260" /> committee and I agree that the section put down by the Minister is but carrying out more or less the recommendation of the advisory committee, but it is on the actual figures that I disagree.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 153 in the advisory committee's report pointed out that the probable approximate administrative expenses of the control board in its first year of operation would total some £23,000, that is, allowing for the salary of the chairman, £2,500 a year; the salary of the secretary, £1,200, and including travelling expenses and salaries of stipendiary stewards and other expenses.  That sum of £23,000 in the first year is for administrative expenses alone.  Then they go on to say that the fees payable by licensed track officials and licensed track owners would reduce that amount to a total of £22,000.  They go on from there and give a most extraordinary figure.  This is the most contentious section of the whole Bill, this question of the levy. Without reference to the question at all on this particular section, the Racing Board for 1953, 1954 and 1955 have shown that the moneys which have accrued&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy help me?  What does the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting first of all that there is no necessity for the levy at the present time.  The Minister in reply to that said a control board must be set up to get things going, to pay the initial cost of £40,000 or £50,000 for the tote at Harold's Cross, at Shelbourne Park and eventually at Cork and Limerick. We will have to get money from somewhere and I am suggesting to the Minister that the imposition of the levy on the bookmaker is not necessary. I think I can show him that.  I agree that the Minister is not imposing the levy; he is not coming in here to-day to impose a levy of 2½ or 1¼ per cent.  He is just giving authority to the board to collect a levy which the board will prescribe at a certain rate. The Minister is giving the board that authority and I am simply saying to the Minister that the levy to be collected <Col N="261" /> from the bookmakers could, indeed, be done without.</P>
      <P>The reason I am trying to force the Minister on this point is that the figures, as presented by the Racing Board, are indicative of the trend of betting in this country.  We have the figures given by the Racing Board for 1953, 1954 and 1955 both as regards the levy from the bookmakers and the contribution from the tote.  In 1953 the levy from the bookmakers amounted to £153,000.  In 1954 that contribution fell to £144,000 and the levy paid in 1955 fell again to £134,000.  In three years the contribution from the bookmakers to the Racing Board was down by about £20,000.</P>
      <P>Taking the contribution from the tote for the same period&mdash;the contribution from the tote to the Racing Board in 1953 was £180,000.  In 1954 it was £185,000 and in 1955 it was more or less static.  What I am trying to point out is that the trend of betting and the turnover of the bookmakers is on the downward grade.  They are not in a position to contribute any more.  There is no question or doubt about it but that these individuals, and the Minister is more friendly with some of them than I am, are being slowly but surely squeezed out of their profession.</P>
      <P>Usually a bookmaker bets at horse races and dog races and he also has a starting price office.  The Minister for Finance has already taken care of the starting price office and the course betting and now the Minister for Agriculture, to give him the final hammer, is dealing with him on the greyhound track.  That is another example of killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  The Minister, some years ago, in this House, paid a tribute to the bookmakers of this country and said that, if it were not for them, horse racing in the country generally would not have developed as it did.  He then spoke very much in favour of helping this section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still on the point that I am asking the Minister to withdraw this section in its entirety because the figures published in the report in 1952 were quite amazing.  I have given figures for 1953, 1954 and 1955, which show that betting with the bookmakers <Col N="262" /> is on the downward grade.  The figures given in the report in paragraph 155 state that the estimated turnover from the two major Dublin racing tracks, that is, Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross, in a normal racing season in which upwards of 1,600 races are run, is somewhat in the region of £2,500,000.</P>

      <P>From paragraph 155 of the advisory committee's report. They state that on the two Dublin tracks £2,500,000 was bet one year.  I do not want to disagree with the advisory committee on this score but there are people on both sides of this House who are conversant with Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross.  I have discussed this matter with them and they cannot make out where this figure of £2,500,000 is obtained.  In Shelbourne Park, there are generally five or six bookmakers who hold fairly big money and five or six others who hold average-sized money.  The remainder are small men.  If the Minister for Agriculture went to them with a £5 note on a two-to-one shot it would be wiped out immediately.  They could not get the duster quick enough.  To say that £2,500,000 is bet in Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross combined in a single racing season is going beyond the beyonds.  However, this is the figure used by the advisory committee and the figure which will be used by the board to calculate the revenue they will get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt what Deputy O'Malley is saying but, with regard to the volume of betting, the only indication I can have is the report of the committee.  The last time I was at Shelbourne Park was about 1932 and it would be ludicrous for me to represent to the House that I have any better or later information <Col N="263" /> than is made available in that report. As far as I am concerned, it is purely an estimate.  That estimate was based on the unsworn evidence given to the committee and in many cases it might be of a rather loose nature.  Men were giving their opinions at large without pretending that they were testifying on oath.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley says that, if I act on the basis of that testimony, I may unwittingly crush some of the smaller bookmakers but I think that Deputy O'Malley is overlooking the fact that we were all in agreement with amendment No. 21 in the name of Deputy Tom Walsh which has been withdrawn with the right to reintroduce it on the Report Stage.  That amendment provides that the small and the large bookmaker will levy both on the winnings of the punter and on the stake which he retains in a losing bet.  The effect of that is that neither the small nor the large bookmaker, taking their general experience, will have any difference in the contributions which they will make.  They will recover through the levy on the winning bet what they have paid out on the losing bet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  The whole purpose of this legislation is to draw off the pool of betting, winning or losing, a sum which shall be devoted, not to the Exchequer, but to the improvement of the sport itself.  That principle seems to have had success in horse racing and it is the aim of the horse-racing people in England, who say it is the only salvation of horse racing there.  That is the principle of the whole legislation&mdash;that there should be drawn off the pool of betting something sufficient to improve the stakes and to improve the amenities of the greyhound industry in this country. But it is not going to close the small bookmaker.  The bookmakers, small and large, should break about even.  I do not say that in every case he breaks absolutely even but the terms of Deputy Walsh's amendment operate to ensure that he makes a substantial contribution in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> It is to be borne in mind that, in asking the bookmakers, for a period at least, to act as the collecting agents of this levy, they are not doing it for nothing because they will benefit by the improvement of the greyhound racing industry.  Were the greyhound industry here to continue to deteriorate, their livelihood would disappear. There is no body of men who will benefit more, in proportion to their interest in the industry as a whole, than the bookmakers will benefit under this legislation.  This legislation is calculated, we hope, to put greyhound racing on a basis which will ensure to the honest bookmaker a steady honest livelihood.  We all know that, were legislation of this kind not enacted, there is an imminent danger of a number of tracks closing down in the country, thus depriving the bookmakers of a legitimate source of income.</P>
    <P>Here is a fact.  I have no better estimate than the estimate in the report of the total volume of betting and the consequent probable yield of a levy.  But I think the House knows that, in our judgment, it is not impossible that, after an introductory period, it will transpire that the levy on the tote will itself be sufficient to provide the revenue and that we can then drop the levy on the bookmakers altogether.  If it does transpire that the levy on the tote will yield a sufficient revenue to finance the necessary improvement in greyhound racing, I do not doubt that the board will drop the levy on the bookmakers. But in order to get it going, we have to have the levy on the bookmakers and the tote in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>I think I did say at some stage that, in an effort to reassure the bookmakers that their circumstances were borne closely in mind, I thought 1¼ per cent. should be the maximum levy upon them, but to tell the truth, I have detected, even among certain elements in the bookmaking profession, a tendency to express the same view as Deputy O'Malley that, if there is a levy on the bookmakers at all, it is better to have it 2½ per cent. than 1¼ per cent.  But, as at present advised, I have said that I agree that 1¼ per cent. would be the limit of the levy to be <Col N="265" /> made on them, and unless it were made clear to me that the bookmakers as a body would prefer to see a levy of 2½ per cent., I think I should be bound to make it 1¼ per cent.</P>
    <P>If the levy on the bookmakers were made 2½ per cent. <i>ab initio</i> it would probably bring nearer the day when the levy on the bookmakers could be disposed of altogether If we make it 1¼ per cent. <i>ab initio</i>, we might have to keep it on for five, six or seven years, while the levy on the tote was coming to meet our total requirements.  When I say &ldquo;total requirements&rdquo; I mean the total requirements of the board.  If we had the levy of 2½ per cent. on the bookmakers <i>ab initio</i>, it might be possible to drop the levy on the bookmakers altogether at the end of three or four years.  But if the bookmakers adhere to the view that, in all the circumstances, they would prefer it would not be left at a rate higher than 1¼ per cent., I think I would feel bound to say &ldquo;let it be no higher than that,&rdquo; even though that involves maintaining it for a longer period than would be the case otherwise.</P>
    <P>As far as the estimate is concerned, there is no use arguing with me about it.  While I may respect Deputy O'Malley's opinion, I am not qualified to weigh up the opinion of the Deputy beside the report.  I think I must stand over the estimate given to me by the committee which deliberated these matters with all the information before them and offered that estimate to me. No matter how much I respect the opinion of individual Deputies, I cannot set it against the estimate that is here provided.</P>

      <P>I was not here when the Minister made his statement that he was to some extent meeting our point of view in relation to the amendment No. 16a.  I would just like to say I am grateful to the Minister for meeting us in that way.  I hope his letter will be fully effective to prevent what we have apprehended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason I rose on this section is that I am in some difficulty about the drafting of it.  Maybe my recollection is at fault, but I do not remember any section which empowers any person to fix a levy at a prescribed <Col N="266" /> amount.  I would be very grateful if the Minister could clear up that difficulty for me.  I do see that a levy calculated on the rate of the prescribed percentage for the time being is mentioned, but I have not been able to trace any provision in the Bill, in the few minutes I have had to refresh myself on it, whereby any person may fix a levy at a prescribed amount.  It is a point which I had in mind before. Perhaps if the Minister could help me in that regard, I might be able to go further.</P>

      <P>Yes, that clarifies the situation as far as I am concerned. Before you put that section, Sir, I would like to say that this is a matter which has developed since the last Budget and I do not know how the Minister is going to deal with it.  It has given birth to some apprehension among those who were hoping this Bill would be of great benefit to the greyhound breeding industry.  What was new to us when this Bill came up for discussion earlier was the fact that in the recent Finance Bill the Minister for Finance would impose a stamp duty and also a levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy in order, possibly, to save trouble?  I approached the Minister for Finance on that matter and he authorised me to communicate the <Col N="267" /> following letter to the House.  Does it meet the Deputy's convenience that I should mention it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the letter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have your letter of the 29th instant about the Greyhound Industry Bill and the question whether you can, if necessary, make a statement that a stamp duty is not contemplated in relation to the receipts of the proposed board for the greyhound industry.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As you know it would not be possible for me to give any assurance which would fetter the discretion of myself, or of any successor Minister for Finance, in relation to a matter of taxation.  What can be said, however, is that there is no present intention of imposing on the Greyhound Board a stamp duty similar to that which is being charged on the receipts of the Racing Board under the provisions of the Finance Bill this year.  I hope that this will suffice for your purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy, with his experience, will agree that, subject to the reservations which every Minister for Finance must make on his own behalf and on behalf of his successors, that is as exhaustive an undertaking as can be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has been good enough to disclose it to the House and I am sure that if any succeeding Minister has the hardihood to come to the House and impose a levy later, this will be adverted to.  I think it is as substantial a guarantee as can be given in the circumstances.  There is another circumstance in connection with this industry about which Deputy O'Malley made reference and which we should all keep in mind.  That is that the business of bookmaking on the greyhound tracks is carried on mainly by very small men.  I do not know how they are going to be protected against, say, the possibility that the larger men <Col N="268" /> who can work on much smaller margins of profit may forgo collecting the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be made a condition of their licences that they must collect it.  That is the practice of the Racing Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be a matter that will be borne in mind by the board set up under this Bill.  I wish to express the very strong desire and hope that the new board will be meticulous in ensuring that this particular condition will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, we have objected to the levy being imposed at all.  I do not want to bore the House.  The Minister has stated it is a question for the board to say whether or not a levy will be imposed. In the light of circumstances, it appears a levy is highly necessary. There are some observations I should like to bring to the Minister's notice.  I hope that between now and the Report Stage he will reconsider certain matters in connection with betting through bookmakers.  In the report of the Greyhound Advisory Committee, at paragraph 156, it is stated that the bookmakers came along to give evidence and objected to the totalisator. Of course they also objected to the levy, but they objected strongly to the totalisator on the grounds that it would cause the bookmakers to lose their livelihood.  It is admitted by the advisory committee that 20 per cent. of the people who had been betting with the bookmakers were switching to the totalisator.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there will be increased attendances at greyhound tracks, but the overall point to bear in mind is that not alone will the bookmakers be hit by the totalisator but now they have to face competition from the totalisator and to pay this levy imposed in the recent Budget.  I say in all seriousness that, in view of the present plight in which bookmakers here find themselves, the Minister should omit this section altogether.  I do not give a snap of my fingers for the bookmakers; they have the same rights as any other body in the country, but we should learn from what happened in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> The punitive taxation imposed on greyhound racing by successive British Chancellors of the Exchequer has resulted in crippling the industry over there.  That has naturally shown itself in the prices obtainable for dogs.  The days of the £2,500 dogs have gone; a good dog now averages between £150 and £200.  If the Minister looks at today's newspapers he will find that the Greyhound Racing Association shares, which were up to about 45/- each, are now quoted at 1/1.  At greyhound tracks like White City, Clapham, Westham, there were up to 70 or 80 bookmakers operating.  Now there are only four and they are a combine.  They have been completely wiped out.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say to the Minister that he would want to give a little more time to this question.  This is not going to be as handy as it was for the Racing Board; it will not run on such smooth, oiled wheels.  You will have two sections of betting for greyhound tracks; you will have the bookmakers and the totalisator.  The Minister knows well that the totalisator, as such, will be very different from that operating at horse-racing meetings.  You will have only six dogs in every race.  The ordinary person who goes to a horse-race meeting has up to 28 or 30 runners in each race.  Eventually, you will have the show system, the one, two, three forecast.  However, that will take time and, in the meantime, you will have the greatest difficulty in administering it from the point of view of the board's financial requirements.  I do not want to go over old ground again.  Deputy MacEntee referred after Christmas to the point of getting some of the assets of the Irish Coursing Club for the first year, the <i>ab initio</i> period.  If the board got some of the assets of the club for the first year there would be no necessity for imposing this levy.</P>
    <P>I must say that if it is proposed to collect the levy in the immediate future we might as well face the fact that bookmakers, as such, will be completely shut out of the game altogether. We all know that, even since the last racing season, the attendances at the Dublin tracks have never been smaller, even though the advisory committee, who took evidence in 1951, <Col N="270" /> referred to the fantastic percentages that were being made in those days. That, however, was 1951 and the advisory committee were going on the surmise that things would get better. I read out statistics to show that the takings are down by £20,000 in three years.  Naturally the board will come along and impose this levy, but I think that after a year or two there might not be any necessity to keep the levy on.</P>
    <P>Does anyone in his common sense not know that if we have a greyhound racing control board set up in this country with the Irish Coursing Club having a controlling interest in it they will not remove that levy?  They will say: &ldquo;We cannot remove it because we want to do this, that or the other; we want to make improvements in Cork, Limerick, or elsewhere.  Therefore we cannot afford to remove the levy.&rdquo;  If the Minister under this section empowers the board to impose a levy on bookmakers the bookmakers can rest assured that the levy will never come off.  The same theorising no doubt took place in 1926 when the first levy on licensed bookmakers was imposed in this country.  It was then 2½ per cent. which was raised to 5 per cent. and then 7 per cent.  Now since the 10th July, it is 10 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was reduced at one period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think back in 1926 it was reduced from 5 per cent. to 2½ per cent.  It then went up again and never looked back.  I am not fighting the bookmakers' case.  I am pointing out that it is the man in the street who will be paying for this in the long run. Some of us do not know where we are going.  The Minister for Justice was screaming about people losing sixpence playing pongo.  We are talking about £4,500,000 being paid at the Dublin tracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, you are not compelled to attend but the Taoiseach said this morning that the small farmer is vitally interested in this industry and Deputy Barry will appreciate the <Col N="271" /> amount of employment given throughout the State, not alone in greyhound tracks, but under various other headings.  Before the levy was mentioned and the tote alone was suggested, the assistants to the bookmakers appeared before the advisory committee and so seriously did they regard their future plight that they asked the advisory committee to recommend that they would get first choice of any position which might arise in the new proposed tote at the greyhound tracks.  It was not for pleasure they went there but because they saw their livelihood would be affected.</P>
      <P>I have indicated the position in England and what has happened in England will happen here.  This whole business in connection with the Greyhound Industry Board is fraught with the greatest difficulties.  There is no comparison, good, bad or indifferent with the Racing Board.  We are dealing with two entirely different matters.  While the bookmakers supported unanimously the establishment of a control board and said it was highly necessary, they nevertheless objected strongly to a levy on course bets and maintained that the revenue of the Irish Coursing Club should provide the funds necessary to finance the board.</P>
      <P>They went further and informed the committee that the installation of totalisators on tracks would cause serious unemployment amongst their members.  These remarks were made before a levy was spoken of.  If it was going to cause serious unemployment then, what must the bookmakers think now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were deputations in this House some months ago to members of the Labour Party from representatives of bookmakers' societies.  There had been deputations from bookmakers to both the Government side and the Opposition side.  They said that their position was so critical that they could not bear any further tax.  All these deputations came before the recent increases by the Minister for Finance in the levies.  At the time they came here they put up a very <Col N="272" /> good case to members on all sides of the House.  They came with facts and figures to show that they could not bear this levy.</P>
    <P>The only way of dealing with this matter is to omit Section 32 and not give this right of levy.  From the estimated figures, when the tote comes into operation, it is calculated by the advisory committee that there is absolutely no need for a levy at all from the bookmakers.  The Minister can say that he has said all that to me. He has pointed out that in the first year 2½ per cent. might be the levy and yield a certain amount, that it might be reduced to 1¼ per cent. for two or three years and then disappear. That would be wishful thinking on the Minister's part.  Once the levy goes on, it is not from 2½ per cent. to 1¼ per cent. it will go but down through the years, on some pretext or other, be it new grand stands, photo finish equipment or reorganisation, or what not, that levy will be increased from 2½ per cent. to 5 per cent. and then to 7½ per cent.  Trust any control board to find good use for the money which will accrue.</P>
    <P>Another part of the advisory committee's report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the combined betting turnover on horse-racing tracks, from the totalisator and from course betting in recent years has tended to decline rather than to increase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would stress this point to the Minister with reference to the totalisator. I am quoting paragraph 157 of the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The totalisator will undoubtedly attract a certain volume of betting from bookmakers and will probably attract a number of new backers, who although accustomed to attend greyhound racing fixtures, might hesitate to approach a busy bookmaker with a modest two shillings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They then suggest that the increased attendance of the public will more than compensate for the loss but they doubt whether any such increase will be on a large scale.  They next make the extraordinary statement that they would view with concern any appreciably increased attendance of <Col N="273" /> the public at the Dublin City tracks or rather the increased revenue which would thereby accrue to already exceedingly prosperous undertakings.</P>
    <P>Would not one think that the general public should not be saddled with this?  Remember, it is not the bookmakers; they are only tax collectors. The new levy will not cost them 1/-. It is you and I, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who will have to pay this.</P>
    <P>Why should we have to pay any more if we pick this type of sport for an odd night's amusement?  Why do not Mr. Paddy O'Donoghue, of Shelbourne Park, and my friend, Mr. Jim Frost, of Limerick, and Mr. Riordan, of Harold's Cross, and our friends in Cork and Galway and Waterford make their contribution?  We will leave out the provincial tracks, where, I admit, things are not going too well.  We will deal with Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park where, in the words used here, they are already exceedingly prosperous undertakings.  Is this House to turn itself into a philanthropic institution for the advancement of the directors of Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park, to bring increased dividends to these people by our having to pay more taxation on bets?  We will see the directors of Shelbourne Park putting up, not just an ordinary lounge bar but something like the White City, a bar about 200 yards long encased in glass.  I dread the thought of it.</P>

      <P>I dread the thought of it, I said, and I dread the thought of the revenue which will accrue to the management of both these tracks, extra revenue for these exceedingly prosperous undertakings.  The Minister may ask what would I suggest? Not to prolong the agony, I suggest, first of all, that he delete this section in its entirety.  I am always against permissive legislation.  This is a bait that the control board will take.  If the power is not given to the control board, they will have to look elsewhere. <Col N="274" /> I have indicated certain sources from which they can seek the cost of the new totalisators.  The capital expenditure on the new totalisators will be in the region of £40,000 each.  Are you and I, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to pay the directors of these two exceedingly prosperous Dublin tracks the cost of putting in these totalisators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is interested at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is.  The initial capital outlay will be at least £40,000 each for the totalisators; inclusive of the cost of erection, it will be approximately £50,000 each.  A staff of approximately 35 will be required to operate these machines.  As the two tracks concerned run meetings on alternate nights these staffs will be employed every night during the racing season.  On the assumption that the operators are paid an average of £1 per night the cost of their salaries will be £8,000 per year.  This report goes on to say that, apart from the initial outlay and possible capital repayments, the total running cost of the totalisators on the two tracks will be £11,000 per year.  It may be assumed that the cost of collecting the 1¼ per cent. betting levy on £43,000 will be 10 per cent. of this sum, or £4,375, and the control board, after the first year, will have a net revenue of £53,500 approximately. Administrative costs in the first year, as I have shown, will be about £22,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the bookmakers say they do not want a levy.  It will hit them very badly.  If, however, a levy must be imposed they ask that the levy be at least a proper one and one that can be worked, namely, 2½ per cent. and not 1½ per cent.  It has been calculated that 2½ per cent. on the course bookmakers will yield £10,000, and they will get £1,000 from fees from tracks in the first year at 2½ per cent.  Administrative expenses run to £23,000.  The cost of collection is £10,000 and the cost and installation of totalisator machinery on the Dublin tracks will be approximately £50,000 each.  The cost is not fantastic, but it is fantastic to think that we will be putting these totalisators <Col N="275" /> in for the benefit of certain race-track owners.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and vote against his own recommendation.  It is like the Labour Party amendment earlier to-day which was not moved because there was no Labour Deputy in the House.  Now, I have pointed out that at 2½ per cent. a sum of £100,000 will be yielded.  Taking into consideration the cost of the totalisator and the £23,000 administrative expenses, there will be a surplus to be carried over to the first year of £10,000.  Suppose the levy was only 1¼ per cent. in the first year, the yield will be approximately £43,750.  We drop from 2½ per cent. to 1¼ per cent. and we get £43,000 from the 1¼ per cent.  The 5 per cent. tote <Col N="276" /> deduction will bring in another £25,000. Licensing fees, estimated surplus and surplus from the preceding year will bring in £84,000.  Administrative costs run to £23,000; the levy collection, £24,000, and tote operating costs £11,000.  In the second year, after all those figures, this board will say there will be a surplus carried forward to the next year.  After the second year in operation they will have a surplus of £37,000.  They will have that without subsidising racing or giving grants to courses and, all the time, the Irish Coursing Club is working away at its own coursing and breeding.  I think I have shown in no uncertain manner that the revenue which will accrue to the new board from the totalisator will more than defray the running costs and administrative expenses of the control board.</P>
      <P>I agree that the Minister could very truthfully say that in the initial period they will have to get funds from some source, but surely such a contingency has arisen on a previous occasion, as in the case of the Racing Board, the National Stud or other such cases. These bodies are empowered to raise loans, or float companies, and the Minister for Finance may take up a certain amount of the shares.  Surely that difficulty could be overcome.  Once the tote was in on the two Dublin tracks, they say here, a very conservative estimate of the revenue from this would be £25,000.  They were getting £1,000 from the licensing fees from greyhound tracks around the country and that makes £26,000.  As I say, the position is really one in which, the more one reads the advisory committee report, the more one comes to the conclusion that this section should be suspended altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his statement originally on the section has pointed out that what he is doing is simply allowing the board, if they deem it necessary, to impose a levy.  I am pointing out to him that, in his innocence, he is of opinion that the possibility might arise that the levy would be imposed for only a year or a year and a half.  We all know what has happened in the past.  However, I simply bring the matter to the attention <Col N="277" /> of the Minister to see if something could be done to remedy it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very difficult section and I confess I approach it with two minds.  I am not opposed to the tote; I think it ought to be a clean and honest system of betting that can be well-controlled and regulated. It has a great many attractions, as the report points out, for those who want to bet in small amounts or for those who are afraid of weakening the market when they approached a bookmaker with a substantial bet.  People bet with a certain degree of privacy that does not always obtain when one bets in the ring.  I have no prejudice whatever against the tote as a betting machine and I have no doubt that the great majority of the patrons of the greyhound racing tracks will find the tote very attractive.  These considerations are, in fact, the foundation upon which the advisory committee has made its recommendations concerning the tax to be imposed upon those who bet on the tote and upon those who bet with bookmakers.  But there is a human aspect of this matter of which I think we cannot lose sight.  I think it is an aspect of the matter which has perhaps been somewhat lightly regarded by the members of the advisory committee.  That is, as I have mentioned before, the fact that the majority of those who make books on greyhound tracks are small men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I should refer to the remark which the Minister made while the Dáil was in temporary recess but, really, I think the Minister will agree that this section is one which will affect the livelihood of a great number of people and it is rather disconcerting to feel, when one is talking to empty benches, that one is merely beating the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying that there are humanitarian considerations arising in this section to which I think the advisory committee did not give sufficient consideration. Most of us, or at least those of us who are not very familiar <Col N="278" /> with this particular form of sport, those of us who do not go to dog tracks, are perhaps inclined to think of the bookmaker as a sort of minor plutocrat.  I have no doubt that many bookmakers are prosperous; those who bet in the ring at horse-race meetings are undoubtedly very substantial men. Unfortunately that is not the case. That is undoubtedly not the case with those who attend and stand up at greyhound races.  The vast majority of them are small men who find it very hard to make a living, who have, if they want to remain in business, to be very circumspect in their dealings with the public and who have to live very modestly.  I am afraid that the imposition of a levy on these men will undoubtedly deprive a great number of them of their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I approach this section with two minds.  The idea of the totalisator appeals to me.  On the other hand I can see that the introduction of the totalisator is going to create very serious problems for the small bookmaker and his wife and family.  I am really wondering whether, taking it by and large, it is worth while imposing a levy at all on the small bookmakers. I am particularly doubtful whether there is any justification for imposing it during the first year at the rate of 2½ per cent. which the advisory committee recommends in paragraph 164.</P>
    <P>I doubt the equity of that recommendation. It seems to me to be unfair. I assume that the committee justified it to themselves on the grounds that the Greyhound Board to be set up under the Bill would have no funds whatever at its disposal.  As the Bill stands now, that, of course, is true, unless the board were to avail of the power to borrow which is conferred on it by Section 17 of the Bill. It might be argued whether, in view of the present very stringent credit conditions, the board could make effective use of that power, even if it decided to do so.  I do not suppose that that would be advanced by the Minister as a justification for proceeding to impose the levy on the bookmakers during the first years of the board's operation at the rate of 2½ per cent., so I do not propose to <Col N="279" /> say that the board could finance itself during the first year by availing of its powers to borrow, I think, up to £25,000.  We can rule that out.</P>
    <P>There is another source from which the board can find the money wherewith to finance its initial operations. We had a long debate this morning, the trend of which has been running all through this Bill, in which the very substantial assets of the Irish Coursing Club were mentioned.  I think that it would be better that the board should be empowered, during the initial year of its existence, in any event, to draw on the resources of the Irish Coursing Club for the moneys which are necessary to establish the board and to enable it to initiate its operations and to function as is envisaged in the Bill. I think that is a much more fair and reasonable way of approaching the problem of finding the initial finance for the board than to mulct the small bookmaker to the tune of 2½ per cent. of his turnover.</P>
    <P>I cannot, in fact, see any justification at all for imposing this initial levy on the bookmakers.  Why should he be compelled to collect from his patrons the capital which is to be utilised to establish a board which will ultimately be in competition with himself?  Part III of the Bill certainly foreshadows that one of the things which the board will do in order to provide itself with revenue is to establish totalisators which will be in very severe competition with the existing bookmakers.  It does seem to me to be very unfair that the bookmakers should be mulcted in this way to establish an organisation which will enter into very severe competition with them, competition which, I believe, will be so severe as to put the majority of them, I might nearly say the great majority of them, out of business.  I do not know whether the Minister has adverted to that position. I feel, despite the hard things which I occasionally say about him, that he would say with me that that is really going a bit too far.</P>
    <P>I would urge very strongly, and from no partisan approach on the matter at all, that this section should be amended in such a way as to stop the <Col N="280" /> board from prescribing any levy during the period when the board is rendering little or no service to the industry and to those who own or patronise the tracks.  It would give the bookmakers some little respite to adjust themselves to the severe competition with which they will be faced. It is not a proposal to which exception could be taken by anyone.  It seems to me at any rate to be merely the essence of fair play and common justice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal to make a levy at all, again I doubt whether it will be worth while imposing a levy, with all the difficulties of collecting it. I doubt if it will be worth while to compel the bookmakers to collect this levy off all the course bets which they may take.  As I mentioned in the beginning, the totalisator is an extremely attractive machine with which to bet. To realise this, one has only to go to a racecourse and see the crowds lining up at every window, making their bets and coming away without any undue fuss.  They can make their bets in comfort and make them very easily.  I think that the inherent attractions of the totalisator are such that the machine will inevitably deprive the ordinary common run of bookmakers of their patrons.  But it seems a pity that the extinction of the small man should be hastened by compelling him to make the levy.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the amount which he has to levy is small, but there is the difficulty and the fact that he is dealing as one individual with another, and he is in a position where there may be petty arguments&mdash;indeed arguments which are far from petty and which may be heated and violent &mdash;as to whether he has deducted too much or too little.  Because of its very nature, this cannot happen with regard to totalisator betting, but as we all know it has happened with bookmakers. Where the vast majority of these bookmakers are small men, taking small bets, they will be harassed and this is going to prove very troublesome indeed.</P>
    <P>I think that, if the main purpose of this Bill is to set up totalisators or deprive the totalisators of competition, <Col N="281" /> that will be achieved by the mere establishment of this levy.  I will concede that the levy to be imposed on bookmakers during the second and subsequent seasons is only 25 per cent. of that which is to be levied on the totalisator pool.  But, as I have said, the totalisator is impersonal.  The whole thing is done automatically.  The amount of calculation that has to be made is infinitesimal.  But for the bookmaker, dealing, say, even with 10/- or £1 bets&mdash;not to speak of the unfortunate individual whose principal bet is 2/- or 2/6&mdash;it does mean a certain amount of trouble and calculation and, what is very important in regard to greyhound racing, it does mean a substantial amount of delay.</P>
    <P>I do not want to put the case too strongly, but as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, within about one and a half hours&mdash;I have not been to the dogs for a long time&mdash;or within a very brief period, six races are run so that they have merely time to collect their bets and get another one on.  If, in these circumstances, there is any delay on the part of the bookmaker in calculating what the levy is, what he is to be responsible to the board for in respect of each and every one of his bets, it will certainly put him at a further disadvantage so far as the totalisator is concerned.</P>
    <P>I feel that for the vast majority of the people, the bookmakers' occupation is not held in great esteem.  Some people certainly would approach this question with a very prejudiced mind.  I think we have got to approach it with the greatest objectivity, so that we can deal fairly with it.  Many people would say it is a good thing that the levy is imposed on bookmakers because eventually they would be put out of business.  I think that is a harsh way to approach this question.  Most of the people who find themselves established as bookmakers in these days, and particularly most of those who have to stand up on the greyhound tracks, are men well settled in years.  I meet a great many of them from time to time, in the House and elsewhere, and most of them are men who would find it very difficult to turn to some other means of livelihood.  Most of them are men <Col N="282" /> without a trade; most of them certainly are men who are not members of any organised body of labour; many of them, you might say, are men of mediocre education.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will happen to them.  We do not want to make them a charge on public funds, and yet I think that will inevitably be the effect of this Bill in so far as a great number of them are concerned.  I feel sure that the Minister would not want that; I am certain nobody else in the House would want it.  I think we should let the totalisator operate on its own merits because I am perfectly certain it would justify itself and that we may be able to soften the blow on those who find themselves committed to this way of earning a living.  I feel we should leave out Section 32 altogether. If we do not do that, I suggest we should give an undertaking that no immediate levy will be imposed on the bookmakers mainly in order to provide funds for the board to erect totalisators mainly in order to compete with the bookmakers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider this matter carefully.  The problem will not last for very long and we can at least give the unfortunate people who will be severely hit by this section when it comes into operation a longer, a sufficient period in which to continue in their business or to find a better way of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter, I want to make the position quite clear.  I believe that this Bill will greatly benefit the bookmaker by reviving this industry and putting the whole business of greyhound racing on a decent and equitable basis, calculated to command the confidence of those who have ceased to be patrons of it because they no longer believe in the rectitude of its administration.  That is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that this levy will operate as a tax on no bookmaker. As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, and I pointed out, the bookmaker is merely the collector of the levy from the betting public.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, it is the betting public pay it.  We believe that it is just and equitable to draw off the pool <Col N="283" /> of wagered money a sum sufficient to enable the control board to improve the amenities, the stakes, and facilities of the greyhound racing industry and to provide adequate supervision so as to revitalise it and put it in a sound condition.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I think that it was Deputy O'Malley who pointed to the precedent of the disappearance of the bookmaker in Great Britain.  I should like to remind Deputies of a matter I mentioned on the Second Reading of the Bill&mdash;that there is no comparison between the circumstances here and in Great Britain.  The totalisator in Great Britain is operated by the track owners for the track owners' benefit and advantage, with the result that the tendency manifested itself in Great Britain for the track owners to favour the totalisator as against the bookmaker.</P>
    <P>The exact opposite is the case in Ireland.  Under this Bill, the track owner gets nothing from the totalisator. All the benefits of the totalisator go to the industry for its improvement under the direction of the control board.  But the track owner continues to draw the admission fee from the bookmaker and, therefore, it is in his interest jealously to protect the interests of the bookmaker who patronises his track, because the more bookmakers he draws to his track the more entrance fees he collects.</P>
    <P>I am advised that I cannot successfully inaugurate this legislation without the levy on the bookmaker.  That is the best advice I can get both from the commission and from others from whom I have taken counsel.  I considered most carefully every conceivable device that could be proposed to me to avoid putting the levy on the bookmakers, but I was forced to the conclusion that unless you want to abandon the whole legislation you must have the levy on the bookmaker.</P>
    <P>I offered to the bookmakers the assurance that they would not be asked to collect it at a level in excess of 1¼ per cent. if that would help, but it was by no means their unanimous opinion that a limit of 1¼ per cent. <Col N="284" /> would be an advantage.  There is the consideration that if the levy were 2½ per cent. <i>ab initio</i>, the term during which they would be required to maintain the levy might be materially abbreviated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give the considerations which lead him to hope that such a position would obtain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see reference to it in the report of the commission.  In the report, the recommendation is that the levy on bookmakers should be maintained until such time as the operation of the totalisator yielded revenue sufficient to carry the whole burden.  That is what is present to my mind.  In the event of a revenue developing from the totalisator, I think it is specifically set out in the report that at the end of five years the control board should review the whole financial set up with a view to determining whether a continuation of the bookmakers' levy would be necessary or even desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my understanding of the programme.  It is no use my setting myself up here as an expert on greyhound racing or administration.  I am assured we cannot make the thing work without some initial levy on the bookmakers to finance the improvement of the industry in the variety of ways contemplated in the Bill&mdash;the amenities, stakes, supervision and the other services which will be the duty of the control board to discharge.  I do not believe it will hurt a single bookmaker.  On the contrary, I believe the ultimate effect on the bookmakers will greatly improve their circumstances. In fact the Bill will not work without some levy on the bookmakers in the interim period.  If it would, I have no desire to impose this levy.  I am advised it would not and I have no alternative but to ask the House to accept the section.  Our hope is that at a reasonably early stage the revenue would make the maintenance of the levy on the bookmakers unnecessary and that the recommendations of the advisory body, that the board would review the position in five years' time with a view to determining whether <Col N="285" /> the levy should not then be dropped, would be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been put to me by a number of bookmakers that they are finding it very hard to carry on already without having to meet this extra tax.  A number of the smaller bookmakers who have been making a rather indifferent living over the years state that this will cripple them altogether because they are being attacked from two sides.  In the first place, there is the increase in the tax and, secondly, the competition from the totalisators, which will eliminate a great deal of the business they transacted heretofore.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately every piece of legislation that is brought in seems to have the effect of hurting somebody.  While I agree that this Bill was long overdue &mdash;and nobody welcomes it more than I do&mdash;nevertheless we are interfering with the livelihood of quite a number of people by asking this section of the community to pay extra tax.  As the Minister rightly said, the bookmakers do not pay the tax; it is the public who pay it, the ordinary punters who place a bet.  That may be said of all taxation.  The person who purchases any consumer goods or ordinary machinery is the person who has to pay the taxation but it is the person who must collect the tax who will always suffer.  We have had that experience during the years in relation to taxes on various commodities, that people in the trade have complained that their sales had gone down.  If this happens in relation to taxation on everyday commodities, I cannot see how the bookmakers will survive, if the same result follows.  As Deputy MacEntee has pointed out the small bookmakers we are discussing have merely existed and tried to carry on, often in adversity, over the years.  Now we will squeeze them out altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states that his advisers have told him they cannot carry on without this increased tax.  When the Racing Board was first established, the tax they were paying was 5 per cent. and it was reduced to 2½ per cent.  Why was it reduced?  Why did the Racing Board not continue reaping <Col N="286" /> the benefit of higher taxation at that period to carry out the very essential schemes the Racing Board had in mind?  As a result of experience and as a result of the various representations that had been made to the Minister for Finance at that period it was found not to be practicable, that they were taking too much from the punter and the bookmaker.  When people put on a bet they blamed the bookmaker for taking an increased percentage and as a result the tax had to be removed.  Now we have the position that even when the tax was increased recently, the Racing Board kicked up a row and stated that the increased taxation would affect them considerably.  In the light of the experience we have gained over the years, and as a result of the advice obtained from various quarters, surely we must find some other more reasonable method for raising the necessary funds to improve the industry so that we will not squeeze out some of these bookmakers.</P>
    <P>I have told the House on a number of previous occasions that we are all anxious to make this a good Bill.  We are anxious to find a means whereby measures may be introduced which will not have to interfere with the livelihood of one section of the community in order to improve that of another section.  The Minister should ask himself: &ldquo;If it is a fact that these small bookmakers are making a haphazard living at the present time and are not doing so well, how can I make this Bill workable without interfering with them?&rdquo;  The Minister told us he cannot do that.  I am not convinced of that.</P>
    <P>If we eliminate the bookmakers, our action will be tantamount to killing the goose which lays the golden eggs. If bookmakers deduct this tax, or levy, then people will bet on the tote and refuse to pay this tax to the bookmakers. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this section.  In a year or two things may have improved; the bookmakers' standard of living and financial position may have improved. At the moment I am told by long-established <Col N="287" /> bookmakers that they are only eking out an existence.  They have a constant struggle.  I appeal to the Minister to forgo this levy on these already overburdened bookmakers for a year or two at least.</P>
    <P>We do not like holding up the Bill or delaying its passage through the House, but we have to be fair and just to all sections of our people.  Remember, it is not the views expressed here which will operate; it is what is contained in this section.  If the section is passed, the Minister will be powerless to help the people towards whom he is anxious to show goodwill.  Surely, there is some other direction in which he could raise this money.  As Deputy MacEntee has pointed out, many bookmakers are beyond their labour; they will not now be able to fit into some other sphere or take up some other activity.  For that reason alone, the Minister should do nothing which may injure them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to drop this section.  If, as time goes on, the situation improves the Minister can then come in here with amending legislation. Very few Acts of this House have not at some stage been amended so the Minister will be in no danger of creating a precedent.  There is no shadow of doubt that the bookmakers at the moment cannot bear this tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall vote against this section.  I want to explain very briefly why.  I shall vote against it because what is now, the not expressed intention, but certainly the implied intention, of the Minister to induce the board to give effect to the proposal which provides for the imposition of a levy at the rate of 2½ per cent. on bookmakers in order to establish an organisation to compete against bookmakers themselves, is both inequitable and unjust.  I regret that I am not able to accept the Minister's view that there is a suggestion in the report that, if the bookmakers accept these levies, in a brief period they may be relieved of them altogether.  On the contrary, as I read paragraph 164 of the report it suggests that, so far from there being a reduction in the levy, <Col N="288" /> there may be an increase in the levy to 2½ per cent. on bookmakers and 7½ per cent. on the tote.  My objection to the section is confirmed by what the advisory committee itself has said in paragraph 157.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that while the tote turnover has increased, the total amount wagered on racecourses has declined, whether the betting has been done through the tote or the bookmakers. The only conclusion to be drawn from that is that even where horse racing is concerned, where conditions from the bookmakers' point of view are somewhat better than they would be under the Bill, the bookmakers have suffered very severely since the introduction of the tote.  That strengthens my objection to Section 32 and it strengthens my opposition to putting a levy on bookmakers during the first year, before the board has begun to operate, at a rate of 2½ per cent. on the wagers.  I am sorry; I would like to meet the Minister and give him this section without a division but so far as I am concerned that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I might ask the Minister seriously to draw his own picture of the situation that will develop when this Bill becomes an Act? I think it was on the Second Stage that we made some references to this section.  I want the Minister to accept from me that I have formed my own views from what I might describe as a real, serious examination of this matter.  I shall first of all try to point out to the Minister that the advent of the tote would create a new situation on these greyhound racetracks so that there would be an added attraction for people who have never gone to these meetings or who, if they did go, did not have ordinary betting transactions with bookmakers.  I do not know whether the Minister knows that there is a form of gambling attaching to the tote which does not exist as far as bookmakers are concerned.  First there is a choice of betting on a dog to win or to be placed.  You can bet on the dog being placed which is not the normal practice with bookmakers.  There is also what I might describe as a nightly lottery on each race, a gamble on which two dogs will come first and <Col N="289" /> second.  This particular form of transaction does not arise with the bookmakers. All these different transactions become possible with the tote, and will bring new revenue from which the tote will have its percentage.</P>
      <P>The opinions of the advisory committee as to estimates of turnover are just, if you like, admitted to be wild guesses so that, therefore, they could just as easily be very much underestimated as over-estimated.  Apart from what Deputy MacEntee has said about its not being in accordance with what we understand as equity to ask men to damage their own business and their own livelihood for the purpose of subsidising a competitor, I want to say to the Minister that this may drive a considerable number of people out of employment and the employers themselves out of existence.</P>
      <P>The report does suggest at paragraph 157 that it is anticipated that bookmakers will be driven out of business and that their staffs will become unemployed.  They make the suggestion that such disemployed persons who were previously engaged in this kind of work should be employed by the new tote.  If anybody wants clearer evidence than that, I do not know where it will be found.  I was just quoting the number of the paragraph from memory.  It is paragraph 157 on page 64 of the advisory committee's report, and I had better quote this part of it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are not prepared to agree with the views expressed on behalf of the bookmakers' assistants that the installation of totalisators on city tracks would cause serious unemployment amongst their members.  Their association requested that consideration be given in due course to absorption in the totalisator staff of any members of the association who may lose their employment as a result of the installation of totalisators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although no further objections to the totalisator were raised before us, we are aware that a previous committee of inquiry advised in a majority report against a proposal in this connection, chiefly on the <Col N="290" /> grounds that totalisators would provide increased facilities for betting, particularly by a section of the public who could ill afford to bet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wrongly interpreted it, and thought it was the Bookmakers' Association who made that case, but nevertheless this was the proposal, and it is implied that this is the way out.  The other part of that quotation confirms what I said about the new type of betting.  It is referred to there as new persons being induced to gamble who did not do so before.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage, we discussed the difficulty, first of all, of applying the levy, the physical difficulty of collecting 2½ per cent. on a 2/- bet.  The calculations of the fractions of pennies and halfpennies that would arise would create a situation in which, we pointed out, the bookmaker would probably have to carry with him a wagon load of coppers.  The fear was also expressed that the system would be an inducement to unfair competition between bookmakers themselves because, in order to secure business, one bookmaker might feel he could afford not to deduct the tax from his clients, whereas another bookmaker who might have a very small net return on his night's operations, could not afford to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that this levy on greyhound bookmaking operations is full of problems, not perhaps from the State point of view, but from the board's point of view, but I say that, from the human side of it, from the point of view of those engaged in that business, the situation would be very difficult.  We do not know what result will accrue; the Minister does not know, and could not know.  It has been suggested that, instead of putting this levy on immediately, the Bill be so framed that if it can be shown that the income from the tote is inadequate to meet the requirements of the board the levy can be put on the bookmakers or, alternatively, they can be charged a fee for transacting their business, in the manner which we discussed on the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister will remember that I suggested, in connection with <Col N="291" /> the charge that is to be made for admission to bookmakers, a similar charge could be made to the bookmaker on his entrance fee as a contribution to this board.  That is easy to calculate, because if it is assumed that the entry fee will be £1 to the bookmaker for carrying on his work, and if there are 60 bookmakers attending a racetrack for six nights of the week&mdash;that is to say, for three nights a week at each of two tracks&mdash;we can estimate that we would have £60 per night coming in for the board, and that would be a very substantial contribution&mdash;certainly, if that could be applied in the first year, or the first and second years.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister not to pursue the idea of carrying the proposal through in this way because it would only be followed by hardship for those who have to pay the levy, and by dislocation and general dissatisfaction on the part of the public. Surely the Minister will accept the proposition?  We are going to get income from the tote whatever the final percentage agreed on may be.  The punter, that is to say, the person who makes his bet through the tote, does not really care whether the tote deducts 7½ per cent. or 10 per cent. from the turnover; all he is concerned about is backing a winner and getting the best odds to his money.</P>
    <P>That would make a substantial contribution to the running costs and to the provision of capital repayment for the cost of the installation.  If the Minister feels that he is seriously advised that it could not be expected that the turnover would be of such magnitude as to justify levies on another source of income then I appeal to him to accept the suggestion I made that, right from the beginning, there should be a charge made by the board to each bookmaker attending a racetrack, at least equal to his entrance fee to that track.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that, in the beginning, there will be at most three totalisators in operation&mdash;one in Shelbourne Park, one in Harold's Cross and possibly one in Cork City.  For a long time to come our totalisator <Col N="292" /> development will remain at that point because it is at these places that you have a large number of days racing in the year.  Would the Minister, at this stage, say that he will consider the proposal and, by Report Stage, possibly we will have another proposal to make?  If that is done by him this section can be left in abeyance instead of our having, at this side of the House, to vote against it now with the consequences which follow from a decision of that kind.  Can I appeal to the Minister to say that he is prepared to give that consideration to our proposal?</P>
    <P>It is obvious that he must be impressed that there is something in what is being said about the taking of this levy and the hardships and grievances which will arise from it. The Minister was gracious enough, before this, to meet us on a question and his action has, I think, solved a serious matter of principle which was held by us here.  Could I ask him now to take the same approach to this very serious problem which has been created by this section?  The Minister, if he wishes, can now give an indication of his opinion and I will give way to him to do so.</P>

      <P>I would be very happy to meet the Deputy but there would be no use in my trying to deceive him. The fact is that the Bill, as drafted, is permissive and the alternative mentioned by the Deputy is incorporated in Section 48, sub-section (4).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The board can make regulations for the payment of levies and generally for the carrying out of the provisions of this section.  The alternative which the board may use, if it wishes to do so, is incorporated in Section 48, sub-section (4).  Nothing would be easier for me than to say that I would do what the Deputy has asked me to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  This is a provision which permits them to make such a charge in lieu of a levy.  Nothing <Col N="293" /> would be easier for me than to say that the two alternatives are open to the board to decide.  I do not feel that it would be honest for me to mislead the House on that point.  I have to tell the House that, in my judgment, the board will avail of their powers under Section 32 and impose a levy on bookmakers of not less than 1¼ per cent. This levy will not be borne by the bookmakers.  It will be borne by the betting public and none of us wants to put a charge on the betting public in excess of what it is essential to charge for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Might I further direct the attention of the Deputy to a quotation from paragraph 157 of the report in which the committee gave their opinion on the representations made by the bookmakers regarding the danger of the totalisator seriously interfering with the bookmakers' business?  The committee expressed the opinion that those misapprehensions were not well founded.  The alternative that the Deputy suggests is already in the Bill. but I would not be honest if I lead the Deputy into believing that the board will not make the levy from the bookmakers. In my opinion, the board must do so to the extent of a levy of not less than 1¼ per cent. on bets carried by bookmakers.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the reference in the report, in paragraph 164, with regard to the possibility that if, at the end of a period, the board's finances would justify the suspension of the levy on bookmakers' bets, and regarding the total dependence of the board on the revenue derived from the totalisator, will be borne in mind.  I do not think I can add anything to that beyond saying that the Bill, as it stands, provides the two alternative methods.  It would not be honest for me to present Section 32 to the House without telling it quite frankly that the intention is that a levy of not less than 1¼ will be made on bookmakers' bets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I cannot accept the Minister's association of Section 32 and Section 48.  My reading of Section 48 is that it deals with the board's regulation of admission fees charged to bookmakers <Col N="294" /> and to be paid to track owners.  These do not accrue at all to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would look at sub-section (4) (b) and (c) he would see that it envisages the suspension of Section 32 to Section 35 in which event the board would substitute a fixed charge such as the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting to the Minister is to leave that for 12 months after the establishment of the tote and then opt as to which of the two is likely to be the better.  I say that it would be better, instead of Section 32, to take it out and put into Section 48 that, in lieu of these levies, we should have an additional charge on the bookmaker, the charges to be fixed under Section 48, which charges would go to the owners of the tracks, plus a charge payable at the entrances by the bookmakers, which would go to the board.  I must say that, in my opinion, the Minister will get a very substantial and really recognisable income in that form that can be treated on the basis of estimating income in relation to estimated expenditure, rather than a levy which can be very problematical as to its ups and downs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is literally true that, under the Bill as it stands at present, the board could adopt the course that the Deputy suggests, but the board could also make the levy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we not get together in this way?  Let the Bill go through but let the entrance charge have priority and let the levy be an alternative if they find that the entrance charge is not satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting near a bargain.  Would the Minister accept my suggestion that he transfer what is in Section 48 to Section 32 and that he transfer what is in Section 32 to Section 48 as the alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I will say this: the Bill as it stands entitles the board to adopt the procedure under Section 48, 4 (b) and (c), on the one hand, or to adopt the procedure under Section 32.  If the board puts up to me proposals under 48 as essential I will consent, or if the board puts up the procedure under 32 as essential I will give my consent to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Which does the Minister think the board will recommend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they will recommend 32.  But I will give the Deputy this undertaking: I will not influence them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that.  We know we will not influence them either.  I am afraid, if the Minister cannot see the force of whatever argument we have tried to make in this case, we will have no alternative but to vote against this section.  We are trying to get the Minister to see that we want to do justice.  We do not want to do an injustice, and I am sure the Minister does not want to do an injustice.  I am saying quite seriously that I believe, if Section 32 is the one for which the board will opt, as I understand they may do, the trouble is going to start, and it is a trouble which will become incurable.  Men will be put out of business, people will <Col N="296" /> be put out of employment and the whole greyhound racing industry, as we understand it, will be damaged.</P>
      <P>At one time it was thought by some people that the advent of the tote would kill the bookmaker.  I do not subscribe to that view at all.  I think the advent of the tote is going to add considerably to the attendances at racetracks by the public, and the Minister can assure the board, or the board will probably find it out for themselves, that these increased attendances and the increased number of transactions, plus new transactions and new forms of betting, will ensure that the board will get a very substantial portion of its required income.</P>
      <P>One of the problems the Minister sees, and we all see, is that they will have to work on an overdraft for a period.  How long will it be before there is a surplus of income over expenditure required to pay off the capital expenditure?  I think the Minister could agree that the matter be reviewed.  Do not put on the levy. Put a charge on, if you like, for the admission and review the matter in two years, and so alter Section 32 that it can be considered only if, after a period of one or two years or whatever period is agreed on, it is found necessary to supplement the income by a form of levy.  Surely the Minister can see the sense of that and accept it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm to bring a fresh view on this matter about the levy on the bookmaker.  I wonder if the Minister, when having Section 32 drafted, looked for a similar case where the right of levy was made to a board under the control of this House? What occurred to me at once was the E.S.B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not take the Racing Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a full right; they were given power by this House to levy in whatever direction they liked.  There are people throughout the country at present, who, if they had that opportunity again, would not allow Dáil Éireann to give them that power.  We have the same thing in this House and in local authorities <Col N="297" /> throughout the country.  Whenever anybody has the power to levy money on someone else, they cling to that authority and they make a case year after year for raising more money. That is the danger.</P>
      <P>If the Minister will look at page 68 of the report of the advisory committee he will see that in the first year 2½ per cent. is estimated to bring in £100,000.  In the second year, for some peculiar reason, 1¼ per cent. is only estimated to bring in £43,750.  Where has the rest gone to?  I know that the tote is not in existence in the first year.  They expect to get £25,000 from the tote.  The total from the bookmakers and from the tote in the second year will be £84,000 as against £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>£43,000 in the second year.  The tote is to give £25,000.  That will not make £100,000 when you add it together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The levy on the bookmakers in the first year would be 2½ per cent. and 1¼ per cent. in the second year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>One and a quarter per cent. plus the totalisator.  It does not make sense.  It says, in other words, that the board's revenue from people attending the tracks will drop a certain amount from one year to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They will reduce the rate of the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who do not bet with the bookmaker will bet with the totalisator.  The thing does not make sense at all.  If you turn to the expenditure side, you will see what I am trying to prove.  The cost of the collection of the levy will be £10,000 in the first year.  I do not know what kind of police force they propose to have to collect that money from the bookmakers.  The sum for contingencies is £8,000.  Go down along then to the total income from the bookmakers at £43,000 and the £25,000 <Col N="298" /> income from the tote.  These figures represent much less than the £100,000 levied in the first year.  Look at the expenditure side and you will find administrative expenses at £23,000.  In the second year the cost of the collection of the levy drops to £4,300, but the cost of the operation of the totalisator is given at £11,000.  In plain words, it is going to cost £15,000 in the second year to collect £68,000 and it will cost only £10,000 to collect £100,000 in the first year.</P>
      <P>The thing looks &ldquo;phoney&rdquo;.  It proves that it is bad business to give such power to boards appointed through legislation of this kind, whether they be racing boards, the E.S.B., Bord na Móna or any other board.  It is bad business to give them power to levy, because you will find that over the years they will make a case for a review of the levy with the object of increasing it.  In this case the board appointed may levy off the bookmaker only.</P>
      <P>I feel sure the Minister does not want to kill off all the small bookmakers in the country.  If that were to happen, the House would be very sorry for having made such a law.  These small bookmakers and their families depend on their ability to earn a living.  They pay rents and rates and taxes.  I feel sure that neither the Minister nor the advisory committee contemplated that small bookmakers would be wiped out in a year or two.  I wonder if the Minister has given sufficiently careful consideration to that.  It is a very serious matter and something no Deputy could take lightly.  The Minister has given no guarantee to the House that bookmakers will not be wiped out through the operation of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not said one way or another whether he has power to confine the operation of the totalisator to the City of Dublin.  The board can erect totalisators in any area they like. There is talk already about having one on wheels&mdash;a huge van, drawn by tractor, which can be set up on any small track in the country.  That would wipe out the small bookmakers in a very short time.  Why should Deputies sit here, knowing what the results of this law will be?  We have seen similar <Col N="299" /> results flow from previous legislation of this type.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw this section and redraft it, keeping in mind what the results might be.</P>
    <P>If Dáil Éireann, with its members' eyes open, wants to wipe out the bookmakers on greyhound tracks, let the Minister say so and let us know what we are doing.  The Minister has not told us what advice he has got on this matter from those who are capable of advising him.  This is a very important section of the community with which we are dealing.  I doubt very much if the Minister has ever attended a greyhound racetrack in his life.  Possibly he may have gone to see what it was like, but I would like to tell him that 20 or 30 small bookmakers attend each track in the country, some of them travelling 20 miles, in order to make their livelihood.  Any body of human beings would be reluctant to give power to levy on some section of the community an amount they would find it very hard to bear.  It must be borne in mind that boards like that proposed to be set up here very seldom reduce taxation.  Governments do not do it; local authorities do not do it.  The E.S.B. do not do it and neither do Bord na Móna.  Even Deputy Corry's Comhlucht Siúcra Éireann have raised expenses during the years.  They have been able to justify the increasing of costs on the man with the red hand who produces the beet.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be strongly advised at this stage to withdraw this section and possibly to introduce a modified section later on.  I would suggest, as an alternative, that he would keep in his own hands the power to decide, from year to year, what levy the board might impose on bookmakers during the first five years of the operation of the Act.  I would press him at least to keep that power in his own hands.  This board should be required to prove the necessity for the levy for which they apply, because as the section stands at the moment they will be judge and jury; the bookmakers will have no appeal from their decision, not even to the courts of the land.  In fact this board may refuse a bookmaker a licence to operate if he <Col N="300" /> or any group representing him object to the levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the debate at this stage because, when Section 9 was passed by the House, I lost all interest in the Bill.  Dealing with the amendment I have put down here in regard to the levy on bookmakers, this 1¼ per cent. represents 3d. in the £.  We have not been told whether it is on the bet or on the complete takings this levy is to be imposed.  We have not been told what type of machinery the bookmakers are expected to set up in order to make it easy to collect this levy. Anybody who is conversant with greyhound racing knows that races are held within 20 minutes of each other and the difficulty there is in paying out and opening a book on a succeeding race. There is very little time left for the bookmakers or for the punters to make their arrangements say for the collection of winnings on one race and the placing of bets on the subsequent race.</P>
      <P>In principle, I disapprove of this levy on bookmakers.  This is the first step towards the introduction of the tote and when the tote has been introduced to the various tracks, starting with the city tracks, I am sure, and extending later to the provincial tracks you will find that there will be a general pool and each track, irrespective of how much it has contributed to the industry generally, will have the right to draw from that pool although many tracks may not be worth any contribution from the board that is being created.  The installation of the tote on many greyhound racing tracks will sound the death knell of the bookmakers on those tracks.  In the smaller tracks, with the attendances as they are at present, there will be very little room left for a second system of betting or gambling.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested in many quarters that the bookmaker does not cater for the small punter, that he is not prepared to take small bets of 1/- or 2/-.  That may be true of the Dublin tracks but it is not true to say that the bookmakers are not prepared to accept small bets on the provincial tracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the tote is introduced with a 2/- <Col N="301" /> bet being made available, as it will be, I can see how the bookmaker's business will be affected on these small provincial tracks.  It means the bookmaker must go.  He will not have the finances or the organisation behind him which the board will have.  The board will have the assistance of the State and the contributions from the tote, and through the proposed levy the bookmakers will actually be contributing to their own extinction.  Why any Minister should think it necessary to place this imposition on any section of the community I do not know.  If there was no fund there from which to draw it would be a different thing, but there is a fund there.</P>
    <P>The greyhound racing industry does not start with the passing of this Bill. The greyhound industry has been in existence for a great number of years, since about 1916 or 1917, and since that time substantial funds have been built up.  The greyhound industry to-day owns a paper circulating throughout the country.  It is the owner of a racecourse.  Its members are, whether individually or as representatives of the industry in the Irish Coursing Club, directors of many of these provincial racing tracks.  These two undertakings, Powerstown Park and the <i>Sporting Press</i> are very valuable assets, the property of the greyhound industry to-day.</P>
    <P>Why is that property not being devoted to this purpose?  It has been estimated that the cost of the board in the first year will be about £23,000. If we assume that the cost of running the tote will be an additional £12,000, the total expenses for the board and for the tote will be £35,000 a year.  Is this property now in the possession of the Irish Coursing Club able to make no contribution towards meeting these expenses?  Is the industry itself able to make no contribution towards meeting the expenses of the board?  Why is the obligation placed on the sporting public, as it were, to contribute to the upkeep of the tracks throughout the country and in Dublin?  Ultimately, it will be the sporting public, the punters, who will be making that contribution and the bookmakers will act as agents only for the board.  That agency will disappear when the tote is introduced <Col N="302" /> to the track because the tote will cut out the bookmakers completely.</P>
    <P>When this levy has been collected and the expenses paid, the Minister has not stated to what purpose these moneys will be devoted.  The only thing we have been told so far is that the expenses of the board may amount to £23,000.  Is any provision to be made for better stake money?  Is any provision to be made, for instance, for a reduction in the entry fees for the general public?  We have not touched on any of these points yet and no argument has been put forward to justify the collection of this levy.  Surely it is not the intention to set up this board in order to give a few people better positions than the ones they hold to-day?  We know what the intention of the Minister was when he refused to accept the amendment put forward to Section 9.  He merely wants a continuation of the system which has existed since 1916.</P>
    <P>The people responsible for the management, or mismanagement, of the Irish Coursing Club during that period will now be legally restored to the position of being the people responsible for the industry in the future. These people will be entrusted with the collection of these moneys to expend them in any way they think fit.  Since the foundation of this State we have had commissions appointed to inquire into betting finances.  We had the 1927 commission which reported unanimously in favour of the tote to assist horse racing.  The 1932 commission did not agree that the tote should be instituted to help horse racing; there was actually a minority in support of the tote on that occasion.  In 1951 the people responsible for this report on the greyhound racing industry were not in favour of the tote on provincial tracks; they were opposed to it.  They were prepared to try it out as an experiment and, if the experiment were successful, the moneys were not to go to the board to be expended in any way the members of the board thought fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the distribution of these moneys as recommended by the commission set up in 1951.  The suggestion was that stake moneys on the tracks should be increased; there should be a reduction of entry fees to owners and an improvement of the export trade, if necessary by the appointment of independent auctioneers to conduct auction sales; a grant to the Irish Coursing Club to finance schemes to help greyhound breeders and to any other scheme approved by the Minister which would be conducive to improving the greyhound industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>Now in the report of the advisory committee on greyhound racing we have this £23,000 which would be collected by the board in the first year and the way in which these moneys are to be expended, it is suggested, is as follows: the salary of the chairman, £2,500; the salary of the secretary, £1,200; allowances to other members, £1,800; travelling expenses of members, £1,000; salaries of four stipendiary stewards, £2,000; travelling expenses of such stewards, £1,500; 18 to 20 track control stewards, £8,000; expenses of offices and secretariat, £5,000.  That was a nice way to deal with this £23,000.  This £23,000 would go to 23 people&mdash;£1,000 a year each. That is what the setting up of the new board means.</P>
      <P>Mark you, the new board is largely composed of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  Provision has now been made in the Bill to give a majority on the board to the members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  It is they and not the Minister who will be responsible. It is the Irish Coursing Club which will be responsible for the selection of the directors of the board which, in future, will largely control&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated I am opposed to the levy.  I see no necessity for it.  The Irish Coursing Club have valuable property already and, until such time as that property is either disposed of or taken over by the board, as it should be taken over, I see no reason why the general public should be asked to make this contribution in order to make up this £23,000 for the purpose of giving 24 people on an average £1,000 a year each.  It is the general public which will have to make the contribution on its bets.  The bookmakers make their contribution.  Why not adopt some other method rather than that suggested by the Minister?  Surely there are other ways in which this could be done?  If bookmakers were asked to pay a fee, for instance, that would obviate the necessity of their having to go to all the trouble of book-keeping on the course in connection with small bets of 2/- and 2/6, calculating the 1¼ per cent. at 5 to 4 on and 6 to 4 on.  Their task will be a difficult one.</P>
      <P>A bookmaker would need to spend a little time refreshing his memory and he might get a new lesson or two in mathematics before he could deal with them.  Why not adopt some other plan?  Surely, throughout the country, the amount of money could be collected through charging more, for instance, for bookmakers' stands in particular places?  On every course, whether racecourse or racetrack, there are certain positions that are more valuable than others and the people who are lucky enough or who are able to pay for them could pay a little extra rather than be asked to collect this levy from the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have that complete change in outlook regarding greyhound racing&mdash;and I believe we will have a complete change&mdash;why not introduce the tote only to the larger tracks and forget about the provincial tracks, to the two tracks in Dublin, the one in Limerick and Cork, for <Col N="305" /> instance.  If money has to be found for the board to help to supplement the State money collected through entrance charges or entry fees, surely the method I have suggested would be sufficient.  Give the bookmakers a chance on the provincial tracks; do not ask them to pay this levy.  Personally, I do not see what good it will do for the industry generally.  The bookmakers down through the years have made it possible to have horse racing and greyhound racing; we must remember we shall have no greyhound or horse racing if we do not have a gamble.  Nobody will bother, even though he may be the greatest lover of either sport, to go to see horses or greyhounds galloping if there is no gamble in it.  It is the gamble that will induce the people to go, and you take away the gambling instinct of the people when you drive the bookmakers out.  In my opinion, the introduction of this levy will go a long way towards driving the bookmakers out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this levy for several reasons.  In the first instance I do not believe that the small bookmaker, as we know him down the country on the ordinary provincial tracks, has sufficient funds to meet commitments.  Betting is not so heavy; farmers have not so much to gamble with as they had before they fell under the Minister's displeasure.  Generally the money is not there.  Furthermore I object to giving power to a team of people to say what the levy should be. We have seen the effects of such measures in the past under legislation brought in and passed in this House. I remember spending some weary hours afterwards endeavouring to take from certain sections of the community powers given to them by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can take the Cattle Insurance Act as one item.  Under that we had the self-same powers that are given to this committee in regard to the levy proposal, powers without appeal.  That Cattle Insurance Act actually drove some very decent cattle dealers out of business altogether&mdash;or very nearly so. We had to come into this House with an amendment to fight the vested interests behind the team of cattle dealers engaged in that insurance business.  Now we are going to have a <Col N="306" /> gentleman with £2,500 a year, more than the Minister has, as much as the Taoiseach has.  He is the chairman of the team to be paid out of this levy, and he has a job a good deal softer than that of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach has a tough job to keep all the warring elements together.</P>

If the chairman wants to double his salary he can, without reference to this House, put 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. on the levy on the bookmakers.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;anymore than the Ceann Comhairle tells me this has to do with the levy.  There is no power here under which the levy is to be controlled; nothing but the sweet will of this team that the Minister will place in control of it.  I think that the suggestion was made here that the Minister should withdraw this Bill and think it over again unless he has already appointed a chairman.  I think that would be the best thing he could do.  The only thing that sub-section (6) says is that &ldquo;regulations for the purposes of this section shall require the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  There is no bother in getting that.  Unless something which was done was called to his attention in this House, it might be five years before the Minister would know that it was in operation at all.</P>
      <P>I object to giving any body of men the power of levying on any body of citizens, and of doing what I have seen done here before, driving them out of business.  I notice that the Labour Party are very conspicuous by their absence this evening.  What do they think of the number of people who are to be disemployed and driven out of business under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know, any of us who go to the tracks, that outside of Dublin the amount collected on the ordinary rural tracks is not worth talking about.  The <Col N="308" /> ordinary citizen goes in there for a night's amusement, to see a dog run because it is a neighbour's dog.  You will put these unfortunate people, the bookmakers, to the trouble of making up all these percentages so that they can work out whether, in the finish, they should collect twopence or three-pence. I would like to see some of the Deputies here taking on the job of making that up.  That is what will happen and it is unfair and unjust to any body of men to put that obligation on them.</P>
    <P>If I saw that this matter was to be put under some sort of definite control, I would not mind but that is not to be done.  It will mean that the team taking charge can, at their own sweet will, increase the levies.  If they do not increase them themselves, when the Minister for Finance finds his tail caught in the trap, as our own joker did a few weeks ago, he can come along and put another 2½ or 3 per cent. on to it.  That is how this thing will be carried on.  It is wrong and unjust to the ordinary citizen and to the particular section of the community that is to be driven out of existence by this measure.  We all know what is happening as regards racing at the present day.  We have seen it happen.  I consider that, as far as this section is concerned, the best thing the Minister could do would be to withdraw it and reconsider the whole matter.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 33.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 33 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 33 is a purely machinery section, virtually identical with Section 28 of the 1945 Racing Board and Racecourses Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the section is a machinery section, but the question arises in my mind as to whether it is equitable in its provisions. We have voted on this side of the House against Section 32, which empowers the board to impose a levy on course bookmakers.  We have done that because there were some aspects of that which struck us as being unfair and unjust, in particular the one to which I have already referred&mdash;the prospect that the board, with the consent of the Minister, will accept the recommendation of the advisory committee to impose a levy of 2½ per cent. on bookmakers during the first year of the board's existence, the purpose being to provide the board with funds to establish the totalisator.  This section proposes to give effect to that.  I think it aggravates the injustice to which I have referred, because it imposes on the bookmakers, not merely the levy&mdash;which, of course, the House has now decided should be imposed&mdash; but it also imposes upon the bookmaker the responsibility for collecting <Col N="311" /> that levy and the expense which he will necessarily incur in collecting the levy.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to speak on the sections of this Bill without traversing or repeating something that has already been said.  I have stressed the point that the majority of the people who engage in bookmaking on greyhound racetracks are comparatively small men. Many of them, unfortunately, are not men of a high degree of literacy.  They are not men who are used to keeping accounts or making quick calculations. When they take a bet, they take it in terms of 7/- to 4/-.  That goes down in the book and it does not require any great arithmetical skill to know precisely what is owed.  In every case under this Bill, before the bookmaker pays out a bet he must make a mental calculation and must ensure that every penny of the levy which is collectable will be retained by him and subsequently paid over to the board.</P>
      <P>That might be difficult for the most agile and most expert arithmetician among us in the hurly-burly of a racetrack, particularly when, as I have pointed out, the races follow each other in quick succession.  I do not see how any bookmaker will be able to comply with the requirements of this section unless he hires or employs a very expert clerk.  That will cost him a great deal of money.  It creates a problem, undoubtedly, for the board. The board must ensure that the levy is collected.  If so, then I think the board should defray the expense incurred by the bookmaker in assessing the levy in the first place and in collecting it subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision whatever in the section for a reimbursement to the bookmaker of the expense which he will incur in doing what is, in effect, the job of the board.  I know it might not be an easy thing to devise some provision which would recoup the bookmaker the expense to which this section will undeniably put him.  I will readily admit that.  However, I do think that instead of the necessity for the levy being paid over to the board, as this section is intended to accomplish, the bookmaker should be entitled to deduct from the amount of <Col N="312" /> the levy collected by him a sum equal to the expense which he has incurred and which is imposed upon him by this section.  It is particularly important, I think, that that aspect of the provisions of the section should not be overlooked, in view of the provisions of sub-section (2).</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) is a penal section.  It provides that if any person contravenes a regulation under the section or makes, in any record kept in pursuance of any regulation under the section, any false entry with regard to a course bet, that person shall be liable guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.  Just mark paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;makes, in any record kept in pursuance of any regulation under this section any false entry with regard to a course bet,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose &ldquo;false&rdquo; means untrue, deceptive or misleading, any inaccurate entry, whether or not it is made with the intention to deceive.  Suppose a bookmaker made a genuine mistake.  I will not ask the House to assume either that entries might not be made in error or that entries might not be made which were deliberately false. That bookmaker might be described as having made a false entry and that unfortunate individual, who has already had the unpleasant duty of collecting a levy of 2½ per cent. from his successful customers has, at the same time, in the circumstances which I have described, to risk the danger of being found guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will say that his interpretation of the term &ldquo;false entry&rdquo; means an entry which is made with deliberate intent to deceive.  I can see that is quite a reasonable construction to put on the words, but unfortunately, in the case of an offence of this sort, the onus is placed on the accused person to prove his innocence, since the fact that the entry is incorrect will be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that it is a false entry.  The unfortunate bookmaker, in order to exonerate himself, will be compelled <Col N="313" /> to prove that, in fact, he made a mistake in good faith, that it was a mere slip in arithmetic or that his clerk failed to make a correct record.  That is a very difficult position in which to put an unfortunate individual.  I cannot conceive it possible for him to call any evidence to substantiate his case and to exculpate him from the charge of having made a false entry with intent to defraud the board.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances there should be some provision made which will make the section less onerous and less expensive to the bookmaker.  As I have said, it might be difficult to make a provision of that sort but I think the responsibility does lie on the Minister to try to meet the case which I am making.  There are other circumstances to which I might refer, and the Minister might say to me: &ldquo;This is no more difficult for a bookmaker at a greyhound racetrack than it is for a bookmaker standing at the Curragh.&rdquo; Of course it is very much more difficult. The greyhound race-meetings take place in the evening, often in artificial light.</P>

      <P>And as my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, says, ten minutes between the races.  We all know the length of time that elapses between races at a horse-meeting; there is no such interval at a greyhound-meeting to permit a bookmaker to deal with this question of a levy in a leisurely way.  He must deal very promptly, very hurriedly, with a number of people who are clamouring for their money.  Any of us who have been at those race-meetings know how impatient the successful punter is to get paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know how impatient punters are on these occasions.  Any fumbling and delay on the part of the bookmaker might quite readily lead to a brawl and disturbance for which, of course, the unfortunate <Col N="314" /> bookmaker would be held responsible. I say, therefore, that the Minister's suggestion that we are not asking the bookmaker to do any more under this section than the bookmakers attending at the Curragh and elsewhere are required to do under the Racing Act, is not a very substantial argument in favour of the section.  The circumstances are so radically different that the provisions which apply in one case can scarcely be made to operate in the other.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is hopeless to ask the Minister, in the light of what I have said in relation to this section, to reconsider his attitude in regard to Section 32.  If it were not for Section 32 these disabilities, these heavy responsibilities, would not be imposed upon the bookmaker.  It will not be possible in the practical conditions which prevail at greyhound racing tracks to give effect to this section without doing a grave injustice to these men.  I do not think that in the end the board would lose very much if the levy were waived.  I suppose I would be slightly out of order in trying to reinforce what I have already said on Section 32.  I would ask the Minister to look at Section 32 and Section 33 together.  If he looks at them in the light of what I have told him about the conditions which prevail on the greyhound tracks, I have some hope that he will decide that, since it would not be easy to operate Section 33 in a rational way, and since unless Section 33 is operated it will not be possible to ensure that all the levies are collected, he will forgo the levies and allow the bookmakers to carry on until such time as the totalisator finally extinguishes them.</P>

I cannot see that the ordinary greyhound racing track in this country is inadequately illumined and that the business of greyhound racing and wagering thereon is carried on in Stygian gloom where nobody can see what he is doing.  I am not swayed by that argument.  I cannot accept the proposition that while at the Curragh, if there is a difference between a wagerer and a bookmaker, decorum and rational disputation will ensue whereas, if, at a greyhound racing track such a difference arises, the imminence of riot will be upon us.

Because on the Curragh there is literacy&mdash;even Latin, such as Deputy O'Malley has favoured us with in his Horatian interjection.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with a comparatively long interval between each race and the conditions which prevail in another type of race meeting which is held very often in the evening in artificial light.  Apparently the Minister, who is in charge of this Bill, does not know the difference between these two types of function.  The Minister, with that sort of snobbish superiority, held up his hands when we were discussing Section 32 and proclaimed to Heaven that, thank God, he was not like other men, that he was not one of the <i>hoi polloi</i> who go to greyhound race meetings.  He confessed that he knew nothing about the sport and that the last occasion&mdash;and I assume the only occasion&mdash;upon which he was on a greyhound racetrack was in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, completely ignorant of the conditions which obtain on greyhound racetracks, instead of addressing himself when he rises to the serious arguments that have been advanced on this side of the House, emulates the type of lower schoolboy at a neophyte's debating society by a speech such as we have just listened to.  While the Minister may find matter for gibing and jeering at in this section and in this debate, this section is a matter of serious import to those who are bound under penalty to comply with its provisions. That is why we have tried to <Col N="319" /> inform the Minister, so that he will appreciate that a section which might be workable and practicable in the Racing Act will not be workable in the conditions which will obtain in those enclosures to which Section 33 is supposed to apply.</P>
    <P>I did not say anything about Stygian gloom.  I said that these events were often held in the evening after sunset in artificial light.  I suppose O'Connell Street is one of the most brightly illuminated thoroughfares, not only in the City of Dublin but in any city of Europe.  Let any person walk down O'Connell Street to-night and he will see bright spots of dazzling light on the pavement, but between these he will see dark patches of shadow.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he has to operate very quickly.  As Deputy O'Malley told the House and tried to explain to the Minister, there are six races, and sometimes seven, in the evening at these tracks, and the interval between the end of each race and the start of the next is about ten minutes.  It may be a little longer. In that period a bookmaker, standing up with people around him, has not merely to enter the bets, not merely to pay out to those who have made winning bets, but he also has to make a very rapid calculation.</P>
      <P>I was saying&mdash;and I am certain&mdash; that the general body of the fraternity would not deny that the standard of literacy among some of these men is not very high.  Up to this, it did not have to be very high.  If they could read and write, they could enter bets in terms with which they were familiar, but it becomes quite a different matter when they have to levy, assess or compute a percentage upon those bets. That requires a great deal of mental agility and a degree of ability that is not easily found.</P>

      <P>How is that reasoned argument on behalf of the bookmakers dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister who has the responsibility for this Bill which is imposing these disabilities upon the bookmakers?  He gets up here and he alleges that I said that all of the bookmakers were illiterate persons. Sir, the Rules of Order bar me from characterising the Minister's statements accurately and precisely but those who heard me speak and heard the Minister speak afterwards might very well wonder if the Minister knows the difference between right and wrong, between truth and falsehood and whether falsity does not more often characterise his speech than veracity.</P>
      <P>There is no blame, in the circumstances in which many of our people have grown up to manhood over the last 30 or 40 years, attaching to the man who has not had the benefit of public school education like the Minister, whose parents have not been so well-endowed that they were able to send him to a university.  There is no blame whatever attaching to a person who, because of his boyhood circumstances, finds he is not as well-equipped to deal with clerical transactions as more fortunate and better-circumstanced persons might be.  Indeed, when a person so handicapped creates an independent position for himself, uses his talents to the best of his ability to provide for himself and his family, he is entitled to the highest degree of consideration.  When I said that the standard of literacy amongst some of these men is not of the highest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister cannot ride away from his responsibilities under Section 33.</P>
      <P>The Minister approves of the section. I trust that he did.  I trust that he read the section before he put it to the House.  Some of us are wondering whether he read the Bill at all in view of the attitude he has taken.  If he did, and if he approved it, all I can say then is that it is doubtful whether the Minister knows the difference between a horse and a greyhound, and between a racecourse and a greyhound track.  The conditions that exist on a greyhound track are as different from those which exist in a racecourse as the difference between a horse and a greyhound.  The Minister has, on several occasions, when questioned as to the suitability of some of the provisions of this Bill, harked back to the Racing Act and said &ldquo;This section is taken from the Racing Act.&rdquo;  What a confession coming from the Minister that is in charge of our primary industry.  Is it any wonder, in the light of that confession, that our cattle prices are tumbling?</P>

It is taken out of the Racing Act.&rdquo;  That is an Act which was passed by this House years ago, but Rip Van Winkle has been sleeping all that time and thinks that circumstances in the year 1956 are just as they were in the year in which the Racing Act was passed.  He seems to think that the provisions of that Act, which were acceptable to the House then, can be taken and applied, without <Col N="322" /> the changing of a comma, to quite a different sport.  I say that the fact that the Minister has lifted this section out of another Act does not add to its merits and does not make it any more acceptable to the House.  It merely condemns the Minister out of his own mouth with the sloth, indolence, and incompetence which he has applied to this Bill as he has applied these qualities to the agricultural industry of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find all this rather amusing, especially the remarks of Deputy MacEntee regarding the abilities of a bookmaker's clerk.  Did Deputy MacEntee ever notice the agility of a bookmaker's clerk and is he aware of the fact that a bookmaker's clerk can make a calculation much more rapidly than Deputy MacEntee can?  Is he aware that these calculations resolve themselves into simple matters of addition and subtraction? This is parliamentary codology, based on Section 32 of this Bill, which Deputy MacEntee insists on bringing forward for no other purpose than that of deliberate obstruction.  Does he not know that after the first few nights of these calculations every bookmaker's clerk in Dublin and in the provinces will know automatically what is the sum payable on every single bet?  Does he not know that the thing is completely mechanical?  Is it not true that every bookmaker in Dublin will rise to this and is it not his business to see that there is no Stygian gloom about the piece of paper on which his clerk makes his calculations?  If there was, should he not produce a flash-lamp and dissipate that gloom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bookmakers' clerks are the most agile-minded people in this country, and Deputy MacEntee knows that as well as everybody else if he has gone to the dogs as often as, speaking metaphorically, he has been going to the dogs here for the last 20 years.  This is parliamentary codology and obstruction based on the merits of this section which is part of the machinery of Government.  There is no Party who subscribed more to that machinery of Government than Fianna Fáil when, all through 20 years of office, they applied that machinery of <Col N="323" /> Government to putting a man in the wrong when he was in the wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The bookmaker has to enter in the prescribed manner particulars of all the course bets, retain the records, make up the sum and charge the levy under this section.  I am telling you what he has to do. Forty-five bob each way cross doubles, 1/2, and a 120 each way trebles, 1/2. The Minister can make that up at his ease and then he can see the kind of job he has given the bookmaker to do. Is the Minister serious?  Did he even read the Bill before he brought it in here?  Those are ten horses picked out of to-day's racing returns and those are the bets.  The last was only 8/1. Make up 2½ per cent. on that.  How much will he be charged before he leaves the race-track or the dog-track? In the dog-track you usually have seven races.  That would be 21 cross doubles and 66 trebles.  The Minister can &ldquo;have a go&rdquo; at that.</P>
      <P>I suggest when he finishes on that job, to make up for his laziness, he take a stroll between Dungarvan and Clonmel.  There he will find a little monument to a greyhound called Master McGrath, which won the Waterloo Cup three times.  That dog did more for dog racing and agriculture than the Minister did in all his life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing particularly with that section.  I am giving the Minister ten races and I am asking him to make it up.  He expects that the bookmaker must do it or else be fined £100 under this section.  Let the Minister <Col N="325" /> do it.  He has got £2,500 a year. That is more than the bookmakers ever got out of the game.  Let the Minister make it up and give us the result. My trouble with this Minister, and with all the Ministers over there lately, is that they are so damn lazy.  The Minister admitted that he took this section out of the Bill for horse racing. In horse racing there is a half an hour between each race, which gives them some chance to make up bets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In evening racing the poor devil is in an even worse position. Dog racing is on at night time.  The longest period between any two races is a quarter of an hour.  Will the Minister undertake to make up that ticket or any ticket like it in a quarter of an hour, and make it up in regard to the particular levy, be it 3½ per cent. or 4 per cent., that has to be put on it? Unfortunately, we of the agricultural community have been brought into such straits by the Minister lately that we have to fall back on the dogs and the horses.  Now, after following the pig with one levy, he is following up the greyhounds with another levy.  It is not fair.  No human being could make up a levy like that, and dockets like that occur every night in the dog track.</P>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Tony Barry would take the Minister up to Shelbourne Park for a couple of nights and let him see how the game is going.  He would learn there that this section does not suit the business.  That section should be changed completely, unless the Opposition or the chief Party in the Coalition want to make jobs for all the briefless lawyers, who could go down to the Police Court and defend the bookmakers.</P>

      <P>The bookmaker is taken to the courts for not complying with this section.  He may be fined £100 and, if he appeals, he gives a job to some of those boys.  That is the job <Col N="326" /> that the Minister has given to the unfortunate bookmaker under this section. The section was brought in to cover horse racing, where you have only one race every half-hour, and it was not brought in to cover dog racing. The Minister was so damn lazy that, instead of having a section prepared for this Bill, he brought in this one and threw it in like that.  That is what has happened.  I suggest that the Minister should take it out, take it home and sleep on it.  Let some Deputy over there take him to the dogs for a couple of nights and let him have a look for himself.  If he does, he will not come in here and make such an idiot of himself by putting forward the like of that.</P>

The majority of them are solicitors' clerks and they do this work in their spare time.  It is a reflection on these <Col N="327" /> men for Deputy MacEntee and other speakers to say that they cannot make up the bets they have got.  They have the right to know if there will be any improvement in an industry which is an important one for them, for the small farmers and the workers who keep dogs.  The interests of these people are not being served by the holding up of this Bill.  If the Opposition want to serve these people they should let the Bill go through.  After all, I think it is a good thing for bookmakers to have horse racing and dog racing by night.  In that way, they have the double event.  All this shedding of crocodile tears by Deputy MacEntee and others of the Fianna Fáil Party is so much balderdash.</P>

He must submit records of all his betting transactions, whether they deal with greyhound racing or horse racing.  I presume these records are contained in one book, in one ledger or whatever it may be.  The board may demand that this book be submitted to them.  They have the right, according to this section, to examine transactions that <Col N="329" /> have no relation to greyhound racing. That in itself is sufficient reason for the deletion of this section.  Under it, you are empowering the board to inspect a type of transaction which they are not legitimately entitled to inspect.  The members of the board which the Minister has designed are the ex-members of the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club. They are the people the Minister will appoint to control the industry, the people who, for 25 years, have been in control of it and who have made it a complete failure.</P>

Obviously Deputy Donegan was brought in here for his nuisance value, just as Deputy Coogan is thrown into these debates to interrupt the Opposition.

      <P>There will be no bookmakers, according to me and according to Deputies on the Government side of the House, at the four tracks I have mentioned.  Perhaps they will bet at the flapper tracks but that is no concern of this House.  We are speaking about licensed tracks under this Bill.  The Minister has chosen in his wisdom to refer to the Racing Board Act of 1945.  I wonder has the Minister read the speech he <Col N="332" /> made when that Act was introduced here, because very many of the sections were criticised by him.  He told us in very polite terms what we should do with certain sections but we did not carry out his suggestions. They are now part of the legislation of this State.  I want to point out&mdash; and I draw to your attention the fact that the Labour Party has one sole representative sitting on those benches &mdash;that if Section 32 is brought in along with Section 33 then the unemployment position among the greyhound fraternity will be very serious indeed. Before there was any question of a levy the bookmakers' assistants' representatives made representations to the greyhound advisory committee that if the totalisator was brought in the consequences would be very serious for them due to the unemployment of their members.  They made representations to that committee to recommend in their findings that their members, if they lost their jobs, should get priority when the totalisator was brought into the tracks.  There was no mention of the levy at that time. Now a levy is envisaged of 2½ per cent. in the first year and 1¼ per cent. thereafter.</P>

      <P>It is not the bookmaker. It is you and I and the ordinary man in the street who pays the levy, but where else in the world would a bookmaker be asked to act as a tax collector on behalf of the State? Then we get the usual cliché which has been thrown back at us since the Second Reading of the Bill was moved on the 14th December last year: &ldquo;It is like the Racing Board Act of 1945.&rdquo; There is no comparison between horse racing and greyhound racing.  If you go out to Shelbourne Park the first race may be at 8.30, the next race at 8.37, with intervals of seven or ten minutes between each race.  What chance has the ordinary bookmaker's clerk of computing the proper amount of the tax?  As I remarked previously, the life will be frightened out of these unfortunate clerks waiting for the officials of the new board, with their <Col N="333" /> famous stumps of pencil, to come around to try to justify their existence by prosecuting some unfortunate clerk to a bookmaker.  It is about time the Minister made himself aware of the position.  It is about time that the Minister and his colleagues would cease misrepresenting the attitude of this Party on this very important subject. There is no question of delaying tactics.  There is no question of obstruction on the part of those on this side of the House.</P>

Once again at 9 o'clock, and we have been here since 10.30 this morning trying to hammer a little sense into the Minister, I repeat that we, on this side of the House, are willing to have an all-Party meeting on the controversial sections in order to take them out of what has unfortunately been introduced by speakers on the Government side, namely, political acrimony.  If the Minister likes to look back on the debates he will see that, in relation to certain sections of the Bill&mdash;I admit he was in better humour then than he is now: it was not one of Stygian gloom&mdash;he was prepared to let them go to a free vote of the House.  Why the sudden change?  It is quite obvious that he knows now that the entire Labour Party will vote against certain sections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not reading.  He can refresh his memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to refresh my memory on this.  For the benefit of those on the other side of the House who have not yet read the section I will refer to certain points in it.  Sub-section (a) requires bookmakers, who are liable to pay levies, to enter, in the prescribed manner and at the prescribed time, particulars of all course bets in the prescribed record.  In the prescribed manner, in the prescribed time and in the prescribed records; it is quite obvious that this sub-section must have reference to some other section or sub-section in this series of sections.  Bookmakers have to enter in the prescribed manner the prescribed particulars and they must do it in the prescribed time.</P>
      <P>Who will prescribe all these things? It is not the Minister.  It must be the board.  The board will prescribe and we have no doubt at all but that the board will prescribe that bookmakers will do all these things in Section 33 at the time the bets are made or at the time the bets are being paid.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>Under sub-section (ii) they will retain the records for the prescribed time.  Now prescribed there again means prescribed by the board, we take it.  Whether the period is long or short&mdash;it may be for years&mdash;they will have to retain these records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-section (iii) they will have to send, on the request of the board, the records to the board for their inspection.  The bookmakers will have a lot of things to do&mdash;the small little bookmakers that we talked about on the previous section, the men with scarcely any property in this world. <Col N="337" /> They may have their bags and their board and their box and a small amount of money, but they have no property.  Nevertheless they will have to do all the things that are set out in this section.</P>
    <P>They will have to furnish copies of the record to the board at such time or times as may be prescribed.  It will not do just once; under sub-section (iii) they will have to send the records to the board for inspection and under this sub-section they will have to furnish copies of the records as often as the board may demand or as often as may be prescribed by the board.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (b) the board may make regulations for the supply, use and supervision of levy paid betting sheets and the making of refunds in respect of unused or partly unused such sheets.  I suppose they will have to furnish these to the board too.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (c) deals with entering into arrangements by the board with and taking security from bookmakers desiring to pay levies on the basis of returns furnished by them.  Under this sub-section they must give security to the board, these little bookmakers about whom we were talking a short time ago.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (d) deals with the granting to bookmakers by the board of remissions or refunds (as the case may require) of a levy in cases in which the whole or any part of the contingent liability of a bookmaker in respect of a course bet made, laid or otherwise entered into by him is shown to the satisfaction of the board to have been transferred to another bookmaker by means of a fresh bet made, laid or otherwise entered into by the first-mentioned bookmaker with the second-mentioned bookmaker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy not hear me?  This means that the board can give back portion of the levy which they have taken in the wrong if the bookmaker has laid off the particular bet.  Deputy Donegan will understand <Col N="338" /> that.  The small bookmakers have many things to do under this section. These small bookmakers went in and pleaded before the advisory committee, of which that respected member of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Barry, was a member, before any legislation came before this House that they should be treated fairly and that the advisory committee should advise the Minister for Agriculture to deal fairly with them in this Bill.  Instead, it is quite obvious that if they were going to be levied on bets under the previous section, they have to make all kinds of returns to the board under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite plain, as I said before, that the object is to wipe out those bookmakers because they could not do all that is laid down under Section 33.  It is clear that the Minister knows this.  I say this much: it was just pure, cussed laziness on the part of someone&mdash;and that someone must be the Minister&mdash;that this section was lifted out of the horse racing Bill.  Any rural Deputy sitting behind the Minister could have told him that it could not be operated in regard to dog tracks even if it is workable in regard to horse racing.  The Minister suggested on a couple of occasions during the day that we were obstructing the passage of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is the second major Bill dealing with lotteries and betting to come to this House since it assembled last October.  I am surprised that the Minister is not anxious to get agreement from this side of the House, and have an agreed Bill which could be quickly passed.  Instead, the time of Dáil Éireann was taken up because of the crooked attitude adopted by the Minister. If any measure ever came before this House that should be non-controversial it is this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not endeavouring to keep as close to it as he can.  The Deputy is making general statements and is not dealing in any specific way with the section. If he does not deal with the section, I will have to ask him to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I had got down as far as sub-section (2) of this section which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  contravenes a regulation under this section, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  makes, in any record kept in pursuance of any regulation under this section, any false entry with regard to a course bet, <Col N="340" /> that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In all the legislation that has passed through the House over the years a fine of £100 was very seldom provided. The usual fines ranged from £5 to £10, £15 or £20 and it was probably during the emergency that this House suggested that any person might be fined £100.  Now, if a small bookmaker makes a mistake, or his clerk makes a wrong record, which is discovered afterwards, that poor man may be fined £100.  There is not much encouragement for a bookmaker to go to a dog track any more.</P>
    <P>There is one redeeming feature if you like and that is in sub-section (3) which provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Regulations for the purpose of this section shall require the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Either the Minister will consent or object to the regulations made by the board.  When regulations are once made everything set out in this section can be operated and if proof were needed we can see that bookmaking on greyhound racetracks under that section will be an impossibility for ever more.  There is no doubt about it; bookmaking must come to an end. The situation was bad enough under the previous section, but this section makes it so difficult that no bookmaker could continue to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section dealing with the collection of the money by the bookmakers and in my opinion we are being rather hard on this section of the community in making it a penal offence if bookmakers do not collect the money required under the Bill.  Some two hours ago I dealt with the tax; now we are dealing with the collection of tax by the bookmakers and with the penalty that can be imposed for not collecting it. A number of these people are not equipped to do this job, or not as well equipped as they might be.  For one thing they have to deal with the ordinary tax; now they have to deal with <Col N="341" /> the special tax.  I feel there should be some other method of raising the money without being too hard on a section of the people who, in my estimation, are not able to bear it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right; a number of them are poor fellows.  I feel the Minister's advisers should be in a position to advise him on this particular Section 33.  Indeed, if I might say so, it is followed up by Sections 34 and 35 which prescribe what penalty can be put on a bookmaker if he does not conform to the regulations.</P>
      <P>While I am personally anxious to see that this Bill should go through this House and that it should be a good Bill, I am also anxious about the individual bookmakers who are to suffer under the legislation that we are passing here.  We cannot be just with the whole community unless we are just with the individual.  We are dealing with individuals here, a group of them. Surely it is not beyond the resources of the Department of Agriculture and the numerous advisers of the Minister to bring in legislation here which will give the board enough money to carry on the work that this Bill requires of it without penalising a section of the community that is overtaxed already. That section of the community is the bookmakers.  Not alone are we taxing them but we are compelling them to toe the line and, if they do not do that, they are to be fined £100.  I would say that that is an injustice.  I would say that they are thoroughly unsuited to have an obligation of that kind put upon them.  I feel that this House, and the Minister and his advisers should be in a position to have some other means of getting the money than by doing it in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone have the bookmakers to do this, but they also have to deal with competition from the totalisator and, for that reason, I must speak against what I feel is an injustice to this section of the community.  I feel that this regulation will be responsible for a lot of unemployment and it is a pity, when this Parliament introduces legislation of this kind, that the framers of such legislation could not introduce it in a <Col N="342" /> way that would not penalise a section of the community for the benefit of another section.  I feel that Section 33 is an injustice to the people I am defending and they are the bookmaking community.</P>

      <P>We have spent a long time on this section and I do not propose to inflict myself on the House for any length of time.  I have merely risen to ask the Minister will he not give some consideration to the arguments by which we have been attempting to demonstrate that this section will be unworkable?  Whether it will be workable or not, it will impose a great deal of expenditure on small people who can ill afford to defray the cost of complying with this section.  If the Minister would assure us that he would, on the Report Stage, bring in an amendment to reimburse the bookmakers for the expenses which they will incur in collecting the levy on behalf of the board, he would go a long way indeed to meet us.  I am sorry the Minister is not here.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary will be in a position to answer for him.</P>

      <P>I would feel happier about the section, and the effect of it, if I thought the board would reimburse the bookmakers for the expenses they will incur in complying with the requirements of this section.</P>
      <P>There is another point to which I would like the Minister to attend also. The penalty which is prescribed under sub-section (2) of the section is a very heavy one.  As Deputy Allen has pointed out to the members on the opposite benches who have taken the trouble to listen to the debate it amounts to no less than £100.  I hesitate to believe that Deputies responsible for this legislation have noted that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>You know what happens with revenue penalties.  The maximum penalty is the one that is imposed.  When I was Minister for Finance from 1932 to 1949 I had, on <Col N="343" /> many occasions, to deal with the cases of bookmakers who had been guilty of an offence similar to that which is created by this section.  Many representations were made to me on their behalf.  Inevitably, I found that the maximum penalty, in that case £100, had been imposed and I had no power to mitigate it, even though it was quite clear to me that the unfortunate devils who had been guilty of the offence had forfeited their sole means of livelihood. I know the difference between those who follow the occupation of bookmaker and those who attend the greyhound racing tracks.  The majority of the latter are all small men who can ill afford to go to race meetings.  They have been caught up in this game and they are there because of circumstances.</P>
      <P>I do not want to condone any breach of the regulations of which they might be guilty, but I do want to feel that this section is enforceable and that it will not impose an obligation on people which they cannot fulfil. Therefore, I fear that many people are going to be caught out under sub-section (1) of this section.  I feel that there will be many people who, unwittingly, will have made false entries in their records.  The difficulty in their case will be to prove to the satisfaction of the court that these entries have been made unwittingly and without any intention to deceive.</P>
      <P>The penalty which is provided for under sub-section (2), the penalty of £100, is a heavy one.  As the section stands at the moment, there is no power to mitigate that penalty.  I have two suggestions to make to the Minister.  One is that the maximum penalty should be reduced to, say, £50. The other is that the Minister himself should take power to mitigate the penalty which the court may impose in any case when the Minister, in his own good judgment, feels it to be excessive&mdash;excessive in relation to the resources of the man upon whom it is imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the three suggestions which I would submit for the Minister's consideration.  As I have said, if he can see his way to accept them, a great <Col N="344" /> deal of our dislike of this section will be removed and a great deal of the objections which we find in it will be overcome.  The first suggestion, if I may repeat it, since the Minister was not present when I made it, was: would he introduce on the Report Stage some provision which would compel the board&mdash;I think I had better use the word &ldquo;compel&rdquo;&mdash;to reimburse the bookmakers for any expenses which they may legitimately incur in collecting the levy?  I know that that might not be very easy to draft, but it would be possible, say, that the Minister might say that the bookmakers would be entitled to retain some fraction of the levy, say, one fifth, to re-inburse them for the expenses which they would incur.  That has two merits. It will enable these people to carry on, I think, without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>The second one is that it will, perhaps, enable the board to enforce more strictly the regulations, because they will have the assurance that the people who have to comply with paragraph A, sub-section (1) are not doing it gratuitously for the board, but that they are being recouped for the expenses to which they may be put.</P>
    <P>The second suggestion I make is that the amount of the penalty provided in sub-section (2) might be reduced to £50; and the third one is that the Minister should take some powers to mitigate a penalty in any case in which he is convinced that the penalty, even for a deliberate offence, is excessive in relation to the resources of the bookmaker upon whom it is imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had made these suggestions at the beginning instead of the end, we might have got somewhere.  I will begin at the last of the Minister's three suggestions, that is the suggestion in regard to powers of mitigation.  I think that such powers are generally vested in the Minister for Justice in respect of all such offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that.  I would be glad if the Minister would look that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that, if there is not such a <Col N="345" /> general power, I will have no objection to such a power being created in this Act.  But one has to bear in mind that the general principle ought to be that the fixing of a maximum penalty should be left to the discretion of the appropriate court which tries the offence.  There is available to the judiciary discretion to give the defendant the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, if he believes it was a relatively insignificant offence, or to fine him 10/- or £1, or even 1/- if he thinks it is no more than a technical offence, and generally to use his discretion in matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>I think it is a sound principle to say that the power of mitigation is a power that the Minister should rarely use once the matter is before the courts, bearing in mind that the defendant always has the right to appeal to the Superior Court from a decision that he feels unduly harsh. There is always an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court in any criminal prosecution for a statutory offence or a Common Law offence. But I will certainly examine that suggestion.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amount of the fine, if the Deputy felt strongly that the maximum of £100 was excessive, I would not hesitate, if the Deputy pressed that view, to reduce it to £50. There is no desire to quibble with anybody. The desire is to provide that, where a person flagrantly seeks to defraud the board by making a contribution which is not what he is obliged to contribute in comparison with all his colleagues in the bookmaking profession, he shall be suitably penalised. If the Deputy presses that strongly, I am prepared to reduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the third proposal, that the board should pay the cost of collection, I do not think that is a reasonable proposal for the reason that the only place that the board can get the revenue to do that is from the proceeds of the levy.  We have given the undertaking that, if the bookmakers consider that 1¼ per cent. should be the maximum levy paid, we will so provide.  If you provide a higher levy, you simply provide the extra revenue from which all such concessions <Col N="346" /> could be made.  The whole object of the scheme is to secure for the board sufficient revenue to enable it to do the work it has to do. Anxious as I am to meet the Deputy in any reasonable proposal, I am sorry that that is a proposal on which I cannot meet him.</P>
    <P>In regard to the desirability of providing a third recourse for a defendant, after he has appeared before the courts in the first instance and exercised his right of appeal, and the ability of the Minister to remit, if that power is not vested in the Minister for Justice under his general powers, I will certainly seek to incorporate it in this Bill or to give to myself or the appropriate Minister the power the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay or to debate this matter any further except to say I am glad the Minister is prepared to meet us in some respects.  I would very much like that the penalty should be reduced from £100 to £50.  I am glad to accept the Minister's assurance that he will verify that, in fact, the Minister for Justice has general power to mitigate a monetary penalty, and if he should find that that is not the case in relation to this particular penalty, that he will bring in an amendment to ensure that the power of mitigation can be exercised.</P>

      <P>We do not want the Minister to do that.  I agree with the Minister that this mitigation of penalty should be exercised only on the rarest occasions, but I have particularly in mind the fact that very small people may find themselves in difficulties by reason of that.  That is really all I am concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I wanted to make&mdash; the Minister might see his way to meet me&mdash;was that the board might recoup or reimburse the bookmakers for the expenses incurred by them in collecting the levy.  I do not think we have really threshed out the merits of that <Col N="347" /> suggestion.  I think it could be done very simply and I do not think it would be impossible to achieve; neither do I think it would place an impossible burden on the funds of the board.  However, as I have said, we have not yet had a chance to make the case for it in any great detail.  What I propose to do is to vote formally against the section when it is put to the House, because I think the section will be found to be impracticable, and to reserve the right to bring in an amendment on Report Stage which would enable us to discuss, perhaps on a more suitable occasion, the practicability of recouping the bookmakers for any expense they may incur under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 41, before &ldquo;bookmaking&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;greyhound&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this on behalf of Deputy Walsh.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered this amendment. I think it is of fundamental importance. The section, as it stands, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An authorised officer of the board may (subject to the production by him if so required of his appointment) at any time enter any premises in which the business of bookmaking is carried on and there search for, inspect and take copies of or extracts from any documents there found relating or believed by such authorised officer to relate to course bets entered into by the person engaged in the said business and may require any person found in such premises to produce all documents in such premises relating to such course bets.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point there is that a very wide power is given to the authorised officer of the board to enter any premises in which the business of bookmaking is carried on.  I have a fundamental objection to the section.  We desire in this amendment to limit these powers <Col N="348" /> of entry to those businesses in which greyhound racing only is carried on.  I do not anticipate that the Minister will have much difficulty in accepting the amendment.  We may, perhaps, have some discussion then on the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here is that the levy attaches to course bets only, the bets made on a greyhound racing track, but the records relevant to such betting transactions may well be kept in the office of a bookmaker who would be engaged in other transactions, and thither the officer of the board must have recourse in order to inspect those records of course bets. The officers of the board have the power to enter only bookmakers' premises, because it might well mean that a bookmaker who did no office betting in regard to the transaction of his business on tracks would bring back to his place of business his records.  You could not say his permanent office was a greyhound bookmaking premises because it would not be a greyhound bookmaking premises.  It would be a bookmaking premises, but, in fact, a premises in which he carries on no greyhound bookmaking business.  It would, however, be a premises where he could ordinarily keep the records of his greyhound track transactions. Thither the officers of the board would have to have the right to repair to inspect those records.  Really, I feel sure the Deputy does not imagine that any abuse might herein lie.  The officers of the board are statutorily confined to bookmakers' premises, to which they will be required to repair for no other purpose than to inspect records of greyhound track bookmaking transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a point in support of the section as it appears in the Bill.  The Minister's case is&mdash;and I agree there is substance in it&mdash;that a person may not actually carry on the <Col N="349" /> business of greyhound bookmaking in his office, that he may confine his activities to the track.  I do not want to commit myself at the moment.  I concede that in the case of such a person the board might feel they should have power to examine his records and, for that purpose, have to enter premises occupied by him, even though these premises were not occupied by him for the purpose of carrying on the business of bookmaking on greyhound racing.  They might be occupied by him for carrying on a general business of a bookmaker. As I say, there is substance in that point, but, if so, it seems to me that the phraseology of the section lends a different principle to it.  I am not addressing myself to the merits of that principle.  I suggest that the Minister might word the section in this way: &ldquo;To enter any premises in which the business of bookmaking is carried on by any person who&rdquo;&mdash;I am just trying to phrase it&mdash;&ldquo;holds a licence or a permit from the board.&rdquo;  I am trying to find a form of words&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy?  What he is trying to do is to confine the entry of the officer to the office of the bookmaker who has at least got a track licence, but one of the difficulties which might well arise is that the officer of the board might have a legitimate reason to believe that a bookmaker not licensed to bet on greyhound tracks had in fact been betting on greyhound tracks.  It would therefore be necessary to enter his premises for the purpose of searching for and requiring production of his records to establish that fact.  It might arise that the officer of the board would have a duty to inspect the records of a licensed bookmaker who held no licence from the board to bet on a greyhound track.  It is for that reason we seek to retain the power for an authorised officer of the Greyhound Control Board to enter any bookmaker's premises in search of evidence that he has been transacting betting business on a greyhound track.  It is a power that I imagine would be very rarely used. Could we dispose of the amendment first?</P>

      <P>On the section, it seems to me that, having disposed of the amendment, the fundamental objection remains and I think that my point of view is strengthened by what the Minister has just said in respect of the amendment.  I think it is unprecedented that we should authorise the officer of a statutory board to enter the premises of any individual who has no association in this case with the activity which the statutory board has been set up to control and administer. I think the Minister will find that this section, if it is challenged in the courts, will be held to be repugnant to the Constitution.  Why should an officer of the Greyhound Industry Board be authorised to enter the business premises of a bookmaker who has no licence or permit from the board to operate on a greyhound racing track at all?  It is carrying the right of search far beyond what has ever been contemplated.</P>

      <P>I think the case made by the Deputy in respect of that part of this section has a good deal of force and I would like to look at it again, that is, regarding the entry of premises where the person is not a registered greyhound bookmaker.  In the meantime perhaps the Deputy would think about an amendment and put it down on the Report Stage to remedy the defect which he sees.  I shall examine the section again and put forward an amendment in the same sense.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to allow the section to go through on the undertaking that it will be recommitted on the Report Stage.  I am very unhappy about giving any officer of this board the right to enter premises of another person.  It seems to me the board ought to be content with the powers which would be conferred on it by Section 35.  They ought to be wide enough.  It is not that I want to protect <Col N="351" /> any person who is guilty of an offence under it.  I want to preserve the ordinary privacy of a person's business premises.</P>
      <P>I want to safeguard from extenuation, to put it that way, so far as I possibly can, the constitutional rights of the individual in this country.  That is why I am prepared, in order that we might make some progress, to allow the section to go through if the Minister will undertake that we shall have the right to recommit and discuss it. I would ask the Minister to consider very carefully the terms of Section 34. I am perfectly certain if he were on this side of the House, and I were to bring in a proposal of that sort, he would resist it very strongly and criticise it very cogently.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we could have some explanation from the Minister as to what exactly he has in mind <Col N="352" /> here?  May I read the section and perhaps I shall be able, as I go along, to point out my difficulty in regard to it? The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The board may, after consultation with the club, make regulations providing for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  prohibiting persons from performing specified functions, or specified classes of functions, at authorised coursing meetings save under and in accordance with permits granted by the board at its discretion,</P>
      <P>(b)  the making by the board of charges in respect of the grant, retention or renewal of permits.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not see any objection to (b). With regard to (c), the attachment of conditions to permits, I do not know whether there is any limitation or restriction as to the character of the conditions which may be attached to permits. The next sub-section (d) deals with the suspension and revocation of such permits.  Sub-section (e) prohibits persons performing specified classes of functions at authorised coursing meetings from having any beneficial interest in bookmaking at such meetings or in the ownership of greyhounds participating in events forming items at such meetings: there is no objection whatsoever to that.  Sub-section (f), the refusal of entries for events forming items at authorised coursing meetings in the case of greyhounds in respect of which disqualification orders under Section 45 of this Act are in force; there is no objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only paragraph on which I would like to have some information from the Minister is that in relation to the prohibiting of persons from performing specified functions, or specified classes of functions, at authorised coursing meetings save under and in accordance with permits granted by the board at its discretion.  I assume that means only persons licensed to act as starters and judges could act at these meetings, or does it apply to any other class of persons?  One can understand that the starters and judges must be licensed and authorised by the board but then, again, there are other people who will be engaged, like <Col N="353" /> kennel men and so forth; there are cloak-room attendants.  The question is as to whether or not the power given under (a) is too wide, particularly as these regulations will not be subject to the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises out of a recommendation in paragraph 143 at page 59 of the advisory committee's report.  It is designed to provide that the control board may prescribe the qualifications necessary on the part of all officials connected with coursing and racing and grant suitable candidates for these posts licences which will render them eligible for appointment. It is anticipated that this procedure would apply to stipendiary or supervising stewards employed either by the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club or the board itself, as well as to managers, graders, judges, timekeepers, hare drivers and stewards connected with coursing events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot imagine that the board, which I would hope to be acting in the closest co-operation with the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club, would try to attach conditions to the employment of relatively minor personnel, such as cloakroom attendants and so forth.  I would suggest to the Deputy that the underlying theme of all this legislation is that, subject to certain essential safeguards, we would give this board power to supervise the day-to-day finances of the greyhound racing and coursing industry through the Irish Coursing Club.  We should not seek unnecessarily to regulate their every act.  I must proceed on the assumption that, in regard to matters of this kind, the board will proceed with reasonable prudence and stipulate that there shall be qualifications for certain types of officials at a coursing meeting where it is appropriate that such qualifications should be stipulated, such as in the case of a stipendiary steward, a starter, or something of that kind.  I think I must proceed on the assumption that a responsible board, on which the Irish Coursing Club itself will be adequately represented, will not make or prescribe vexatious qualifications for simple <Col N="354" /> servants who should not really have any specific qualifications stipulated for them at all.  I think, however it is both appropriate and suitable that the board should have the power to insist on certain minimum qualifications for a stipendiary steward, a starter, a hare driver or a timekeeper.  I do not think we need apprehend that any abuses will ensue from the giving of such a general power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a discussion we had earlier to day with regard to an <i>ad hoc</i> court of appeal in relation to bookmakers.  Does the Minister not think that there is a necessity under this section to have some body to which people could make appeals?  This goes further than merely engaging a person who is qualified.  I can quite visualise a particular body saying they will not engage so-and-so.  If a person is found qualified and is subsequently either suspended or dismissed, surely that person will have a grievance.  There might be some doubt as to the merits of the decision and, from that point of view, the aggrieved person should have some body to whom he can make an appeal.  I do not think we can legislate here to give a body, such as the board which will be set up here, all power over the lives and the limbs of their employees with no appeal on the part of the employees.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that something must be done to remedy that position.  If he likes, another <i>ad hoc</i> body can be set up. After all, there could very easily be a suggestion that a particular individual should not occupy a certain position because his third cousin owns a dog which is racing on that particular track on that particular day.  That might be a very good way of getting rid of an individual.  Would the Minister not consider this point between this and the Report Stage?  Asking him to consider something is not, I am sure, unreasonable.</P>

I think that the power given in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) is much too wide.  I think that there should be some clear statment as to the classes of persons to which it will apply.  I mean we should not, in a matter of this sort, hand over to private individuals the power of prohibiting persons from doing certain work.  That is what it amounts to.  Let me be quite clear about this and I am not challenging the necessity for the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we not do a deal on the managers, graders, judges, timekeepers, hare drivers, stewards and stipendiary stewards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if the Minister were to introduce an amendment setting out the classes of persons which the board may prohibit from performing certain functions at coursing meetings, that would go a long way to meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do a deal then on the basis of managers, graders, judges, timekeejers, hare drivers and stewards.  Now the report put in &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; but we will leave it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The list of persons whom the Minister has specified would go a long way to meet me.  There is only one other thing, and again it comes back to my objection to the section. Sub-section (2) creates an offence. It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If in relation to an authorised coursing meeting, there is a contravention of any regulation under this section, the person holding the meeting shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should look into that sub-section again.  There should be some provision made&mdash;the person <Col N="357" /> holding a coursing meeting might be deceived.  A person might come along with a permit, perhaps even a forged permit for all one knows, and the person holding the coursing meeting might, in good faith, allow him to function.  I think there should be some further consideration given to sub-section (2).  Personally, I would also like that these regulations should be made with the consent of the Minister. That is a great safeguard.  We cannot have bureaucracy proliferating all over the place and we cannot give bureaucrats almost absolute power of control but that is what is to happen under this Bill and under this section as it stands.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister&mdash;it will not always be the present Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I should like the responsible Minister mentioned in this Bill to have responsibility pinned on him in some way for the actions of the board under this section, and it can, of course, be pinned on him if the regulations are made with his consent. The Minister says he is quite convinced that the board will not act in an unreasonable way.  Lots of us have made mistakes of judgment in matters of that sort which we have bitterly regretted later.  I do not think we should proceed in a matter of this kind on the assumption that the board would always act in good faith if the board is to be allowed to go its own sweet way.  That is why I think it would be a great safeguard for everybody concerned if the Minister were to introduce an amendment on the Report Stage stating that these regulations must be made with his consent. I am sure his consent will not be needed except on perhaps one or two occasions, the first being when the board is making the regulations governing the classes of persons which the Minister himself has detailed to us and perhaps on another subsequent or rare occasion when these regulations may have to be modified.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider the point which I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall consider the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I want to add that some members of the <Col N="358" /> standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club feel there should be an appeal if any individual among those referred to here by the Minister were penalised. It was suggested to me that in a case of that kind the Minister might consider, say, the District Court.  Members of the Irish Coursing Club have mentioned this to me.  If the Minister gave that permission in that section I think it would be fair to all concerned because I feel, as Deputy MacEntee rightly said, that mistakes could easily be made.  We are all human and prejudices exist and even the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club pointed that out at that time.  They felt it was only right that some court of appeal should be left open.</P>
      <P>It may be all right to say that the board will consist of exceptionally decent men&mdash;I am sure it will&mdash;but nevertheless a board may err and I believe the individuals to whom the Minister referred should have some protection and some method of appeal. The case may arise where a particular track owner, manager or steward may have at one time or other annoyed some members of the future board or of the board that will be appointed when this Bill becomes law and that member may be anxious to get his own back by using his influence, but if he knows this individual has the right to appeal to an impartial court he will be very slow to do anything that should not be done.</P>
      <P>I feel that it will call for good operation of the regulations if it is known that every individual has the right of appeal to an impartial court. I do not want to make it impossible for the board to operate but if the board feels that any man, holding a responsible job, has the right to appeal to an impartial court, let it be a District Court or some other court, whichever the Minister may cite as the court of appeal, I think it will make for impartiality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to be a little more precise in regard to the suggestion which I made to him which was that, generally, the board could only make regulations with the consent of the Minister.  I should not like to allow this section to pass without getting, if I could, an <Col N="359" /> undertaking from the Minister that, on the Report Stage, he would bring in an amendment to provide for this concession. I put it to the Minister that it will not impose any undue obligation on him and we would regard it as a great protection.</P>
      <P>The right of appeal from a decision of the board to suspend or revoke a permit is a more difficult matter.  We want to have this board, as far as possible, an autonomous body, able to act on its own responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate thing is that there is a feeling in some minds and among some sections of the community that favouritism has influenced the actions of the board in respect of certain undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have a feeling that certain persons will be on that board and, unfortunately, these gentlemen are associated in many minds with certain, shall I say, restrictive practices, in the past.  That is why Deputy P.J. Burke is so concerned about paragraph (d) which gives the board the right to suspend and revoke permits.  It is also the reason which actuated Deputy Briscoe in raising this matter.</P>
      <P>I can see that the board, for the proper control of those who are licensed to act at coursing meetings, should have the power to suspend and revoke permits.  It would be impossible for them to see that these coursing meetings were properly conducted if they had not that power, but, unfortunately, as I have said, the atmosphere which has been created around the past activities of members of the club has caused a degree of suspicion which makes people rather anxious to ensure that these powers of suspension and revocation will be exercised impartially and effectively. I do not know how the Minister could fully meet me on this point but perhaps he would consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point with which I am really concerned is that the Minister should <Col N="360" /> provide that the regulations be made only with his consent.  I hope that the Minister can give me a specific and definite assurance that he will, on the Report Stage, bring in an amendment to cover that and, so far as I am concerned, I would readily accept Section 36.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would meet the Deputy by naming the categories of cases.  I will look at the problem raised in paragraph (d) as to whether it is practicable to provide for an appeal, but I do not want to set up tribunals all over the place to deal with every trivial little matter.  I would ask the Deputy not to press the suggestion with regard to the control of the Minister.  If we did that, we would bring back to within the province of the Minister for Agriculture the whole supervision of this business. I do not want to invest the Minister for Agriculture with the obligation of supervising coursing in this country. We have got to set up a control board in which we will have confidence.  Do not, in the excess of your zeal for safety, create a situation in which, in the last analysis, Dáil Éireann is to run the coursing business.  Our aim ought to be to set up a competent control board which will supervise the whole thing.  Once you insert the provision that anything must have the approval of the Minister anyone can ask a parliamentary question and you bring back the whole thing on to the floor of Dáil Éireann.</P>
