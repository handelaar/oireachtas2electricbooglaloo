      <P>It is not possible to give precisely the information desired. Imports are brought to account according to descriptions specified in the official import list.  This list distinguishes between &ldquo;daily&rdquo; and &ldquo;other&rdquo; newspapers, but does not separately specify Sunday newspapers. The values of non-dutiable imports of British newspapers, other than daily newspapers, were as follows: £196,366 in 1952; £176,587 in 1954; and £166,661 in 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recurring difficulties on the Dún Laoghaire/Holyhead route I wrote personally to the British Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation last year asking him to intervene with a view to obtaining from the British Transport Commission an assurance that they would provide an adequate service at all times.  As a result, the chairman of the London-Midland Board came to Dublin and gave me an undertaking that everything possible would be done to provide adequate and comfortable services.</P>
      <P>The British Transport Commission have since indicated that they have taken a number of measures to improve the cross-Channel services. These measures include:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> (a)  An increased number of extra sailings on both the Dún Laoghaire/ Holyhead and Rosslare/Fishguard routes during July and August.  On the former route there will be 25 extra sailings inwards and 24 outwards during these months.  On the latter route there will be four extra inward sailings and one outwards.</P>
    <P>(b)  Increased accommodation for third-class passengers.</P>
    <P>(c)  A 20 per cent. reduction in fares in mid-week from 1st May to mid-September.  This inducement was introduced last year, but this season it has come into operation six weeks earlier.</P>
    <P>(d)  Increased allocations of sailing tickets to London, Birmingham and Manchester offices.  Previously these tickets have been based mainly at Holyhead.</P>
    <P>(e)  Publicity designed to attract to alternative services passengers who fail to obtain accommodation on the Dún Laoghaire/Holyhead route.</P>
    <P>I hope that these arrangements may result in improved services this year and I have asked An Bord Fáilte to keep this matter under close review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if he is satisfied that there will be no &ldquo;racket&rdquo; in sailing tickets such as there is in Dublin in relation to cinema tickets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every possible step has been taken to ensure that there will be a substantial improvement this year.  That obviously presupposes the elimination of anything which could be described as a &ldquo;racket&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte Eireann that the scheme which has been formulated by Bray Enterprises, Limited, for the development of tourist amenities in Bray falls into two parts.  The first part comprises works of a non-revenue earning character such as acquisition of sites and provision of essential services, which, if undertaken, would require to be assisted by means of non-repayable grants.  The second part of the scheme consists of works of a revenue earning nature which would be eligible to be financed by means of a loan guaranteed by me under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me that there should be provision for State grants towards meeting part of the cost of non-revenue earning works at tourist resorts.  I am not at present in a position to state whether it will be possible to make any such provision.</P>

An instalment of £8,000 towards the cost of the works was paid to the county council in 1955-56 and it is expected that the balance will be paid in the current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the need for works on private accommodation bog roads will be examined by the E.S.B. in the light of tenders received by the board for the supply of turf.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is now in a position to state when approximately the new school at Bishopstown, Cork, will be erected, and whether, in view of extensive building schemes in that area, he will give special consideration to the problem of providing additional school accommodation for the extra 300 children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. O'Donovan) (for the Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to his previous question on the 29th February, 1956, the preliminary arrangements for the erection of the proposed new school for infant boys and girls at Bishopstown, near Cork City, are in the hands of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Because of the increasingly heavy programme of work in connection with the building of new schools and the enlargement and improvement of existing schools which the commissioners have on hands and of the pressure on their architectural staff there is inevitably considerable delay in completing the preparations which have to be made by the commissioners in the many cases in which grants have been sanctioned by my Department in order to enable contracts to be placed.  It will take some time yet to bring the case of the new school at Bishopstown to the stage at which tenders can be invited, but every effort will be made to expedite matters as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unable to say at present when <Col N="7" /> work on the erection of the school will be commenced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that observation, I think it is appropriate that I should inform the Deputy and the House that our experience of mortality in respect of horses transhipped has been as follows in recent years: In 1949, .03 per cent of 1 per cent.; 1950, .1 of 1 per cent.; 1951, .28 of 1 per cent.; 1952, .21 of 1 per cent.; 1953, .12 of 1 per cent; 1954, .22 of 1 per cent. and 1955, .26 of 1 per cent.  That would include any horse which died from natural causes apart from injuries sustained in transit.  Furthermore, I think it is right to say that, in association with the Blue Cross, at present special veterinary research is proceeding to investigate the causes of mortality of horses from causes other than accidents which would further reduce the figure I have given the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This question appears to deal with matters wholly within the competence of the members of the Irish Coursing Club.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> As to the second part of the question, I am informed by the President of the Irish Coursing Club that any decision to sell or let any property of the club would require the assent of the general body of the members, and that should any such decision be taken at any time, it would be carried into effect by public auction or competitive tender.</P>

In view of the terms of the Bill now under the consideration of this House &ldquo;to reorganise and reform&rdquo; that, I suggest, is a matter that should be looked into.

      <P>The outturn of last year's Current Budget is shown in Table I of the &ldquo;Tables in connection with the Financial Statement&rdquo; which have been circulated to Deputies.  In comparing the actual result with our expectations we may ignore Motor Vehicle Duties and the Special Import Levy, since receipts are balanced by equivalent issues to the Road Fund and the Capital Fund, respectively.  On this basis, current expenditure totalled £106.9 million against the budgetary estimate of £105.5 million, showing an increase of £1.4 million.  This happily was offset as to £1.1 million by an increase in the revenue intake over budgetary expectations, leaving a deficit of £300,000 odd.</P>
      <P>Of the increase of £1.4 million in current expenditure, over £1 million was due to increased pay in which the Army, Garda Síochána and Teachers participated as well as Civil Servants.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that I took credit last year for &ldquo;general overestimation and savings&rdquo; of £3,000,000 or £3,450,000 in all, counting a specific saving envisaged in flour subsidy.  The actual saving on the total provision for non-capital Supply Services was £3,123,000, a gratifyingly close approach to the budgetary estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All things considered, the year's results were not disappointing.  This year, however, I must ensure that there will be no deficit, however small. As Deputies will realise from the survey of our economic position which I will give later, borrowing for current <Col N="20" /> purposes is, in our present circumstances, indefensible.</P>
    <P Just="Center">II&mdash;CAPITAL BUDGET, 1955-56</P>
    <P>Figures of the outturn of the Capital Budget for 1955-56 will be found in Table II of the paper I have already mentioned.  It will be observed that total issues for capital purposes financed by the State amounted to £26.71 million as against the budget estimate of £34.07 million.  The principal cause of the reduction was that the £4,000,000 originally provided for Exchequer advances to the E.S.B. had not to be issued because the Board successfully financed its capital requirements last year by direct borrowing from the public.  The provision for payments on foot of the shipping programme also proved excessive; against the expected £1,500,000 less than £700,000 actually matured, which is one of the reasons why the provision required for Irish Shipping, Limited, in 1956-57 is so heavy.  The rate of progress with hospital building was slower &mdash;and the receipts from the Hospitals' Sweepstakes greater&mdash;than we had expected. Expenditure from the National Development Fund was also below the estimate.  By the end of 1955-56 total expenditure from the Fund had exceeded £4,000,000 as against allocations of over £7,000,000.  The rate of expenditure from the Fund reflects the nature and diversity of the approved projects, some of which require a good deal of advance planning followed by expenditure spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Vote expenditure on Housing in 1955-56 and borrowings by local authorities from the Local Loans Fund for Housing and other purposes were somewhat above the level of the previous year.  Issues for telephone capital and expenditure on the Land Project and Arterial Drainage were also higher than in 1954-55.</P>
    <P>As the financial year advanced the financing of capital expenditure in the public sector became more difficult and more costly.  The world-wide rise in interest rates and the severe dislocation experienced in the British capital market had their inevitable effect on our economy.  At home the upturn in <Col N="21" /> consumption and decline in savings combined to cause a grave balance of payments problem, the financing of which resulted in a scarcity of capital for development purposes.  The problem became increasingly acute as the year drew to a close.  The E.S.B.'s first issue of £10,000,000 of stock in October, 1955, was over-subscribed. The smaller Cork Corporation issue in November was also successful.  In December, however, the Dublin Corporation issue of £6,000,000 attracted little public support and Government funds were called on to subscribe over £1,000,000 under the underwriting arrangements. The banks had also to take up £3,000,000 of the issue.  The results of the Government issue of £20,000,000 of National Savings Bonds in February were also disappointing.</P>
    <P>This contraction of investment resources is a direct consequence of the substantial rise in consumption in a period when total production was static.  Without peril to its political and economic freedom the community, as I said on the Vote on Account, cannot have at one and the same time both more consumption and more investment than its present output will support.  The serious situation which has developed since last summer, and which I hope we are now beginning to surmount, is one which has caused the Government the greatest concern.</P>
    <P>Various measures have already been taken to deal with it.  The success of those measures depends on the cooperation of the public.  Our economic development is at stake.  Our hopes of improving our living standards and providing a larger volume of gainful employment depend on an adequate supply of savings to finance capital investment designed to raise national production.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BORROWING, 1955-56.</P>
    <P>To finance the Capital Budget, the deficit on current account and other borrowing charges, a net borrowing of £24.53 million had to be incurred last year, after allowing for loan repayments of £2.85 million from local authorities and other borrowers.  The sources of this borrowing were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Underwriting subscriptions of over £5,000,000 in respect of National Savings Bonds were financed by sales of sterling securities from Departmental Funds.</P>
    <P>So much for last year.  Before turning to the budgetary problems presented by the estimates for this year, on capital and on current account, it is necessary to consider briefly the economic and financial framework in which my proposals must be set.</P>
    <P Just="Center">III&mdash;ECONOMIC SURVEY</P>
    <P>When introducing the Vote on Account in March I reviewed the economic situation and pointed to certain dangerous tendencies which no Government concerned with the nation's economic health could allow to go unchecked.  The balance of trade was deteriorating, savings had declined despite increases in money incomes, consumption was outrunning production and it was becoming difficult to raise adequate capital for local and national development.  Remedial action could not await the budget and with Government approval I imposed a special levy on certain imports of a less essential nature, the proceeds of which would be used to finance capital expenditure.  Hire-purchase transactions were restricted and I announced the introduction of an attractive new issue of Savings Certificates which in fact became available for public subscription last week.</P>
    <P>It is much too early to appraise the effect of these measures.  I hope that, reinforced by a careful and realistic budget, they will have adequate results.  The improvement in the trade returns for March may, perhaps, indicate that the tide has begun to turn. But a persistent and substantial change for the better is needed over this year to provide a sure basis for future prosperity.  The high levels of business activity, industrial production <Col N="23" /> and employment are evidence that the economy is fundamentally sound.  Our primary objective is to achieve a sustained increase in production and exports so as to ensure that internal expansion is protected and reinforced by a better external balance.</P>
    <P>Because of what I said on the Vote on Account my economic survey to-day will be confined to a summary of the main trends, giving more up-to-date information than was possible in March.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BALANCE OF PAYMENTS</P>
    <P>The final figures now available for our balance of payments show that we spent abroad last year £35½ million more than we earned.  The increase of £30 million in the deficit as compared with 1954 was the result of a substantial rise in imports, accompanied by a decline in exports, with scarcely any change in net invisible receipts.  It was not until the second half of the year that the gap widened to any significant extent and, indeed, the first signs of serious strain appeared only towards the end of the year when the expected rise in exports failed to materialise.</P>
    <P>An analysis of payments by areas shows a substantial decline in our normal current surplus with Britain. We again made a good showing with the dollar area although the exceptional surplus of $3.7 million earned in 1954 was converted into the moderate deficit of $5.2 million.  Our dollar earnings both from merchandise and invisible exports were higher in 1955 but the rise was more than outweighed by increased dollar outlay.</P>
    <P>The deficit in the balance of payments in 1955 was financed almost entirely by the realisation of external assets by the commercial banks.  This was in contrast with the experience of recent years when our external payments deficits were financed for the most part by an increase in foreign indebtedness.  The loss of external assets by the commercial banks in 1955 was roughly equivalent to their total loss during the eight preceding years. The rate of loss of external resources represented by a balance of payments deficit of £35½ million could not be allowed to continue without risk of <Col N="24" /> undermining our economic independence and our prospect of a sustained improvement in living standards.</P>
    <P>We can expect no relief from an improvement in the terms of trade in 1956.  Even a uniform rise in import and export prices must cause a deterioration in the balance of trade, imports being almost double exports. Last year, for instance, although the terms of trade showed little change, price movements added £4½ million to the trade deficit.</P>
    <P>The trade returns for the early months of 1956 did little to allay anxiety about the trend of our external payments.  Imports continued to rise in January and February as compared with 1955 while exports were much below the corresponding 1955 levels. Taking the two months together, the adverse balance increased by a further £6 million, imports being £2.6 million higher and exports £3.4 million less. The March returns, however, as I mentioned earlier, showed some improvement. For the first time for over a year, the rising trend in imports was reversed.  Imports in March were down by £1.7 million as compared with the previous month and by £4.7 million as compared with March of last year. Much ground, however, has still to be regained if our external accounts this year are to close with a tolerable balance.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRODUCTION</P>
    <P>There was a fall last year in the volume of agricultural output, particularly in that part of output which is represented by exports of meat.  The extent of the fall in agricultural output as a whole is estimated provisionally at 2 per cent.  The increase in cattle stocks holds out hope that the ground lost will be recovered this year.  Looking to the future, output and exports of cattle are likely to rise with the improvement in veterinary services and the reduction in the mortality of young cattle.  There is, however, a limit to the increase that can be expected unless the number of cows&mdash;which has remained virtually stable for over a century&mdash;shows an upward trend.</P>
    <P>Industrial production continued to expand in 1955.  The preliminary figure <Col N="25" /> for the volume of output in all industries and services covered by the Census of Industrial Production shows a 2½ per cent. rise over 1954.  The rate of growth in manufacturing industry, which had been tapering off towards the end of 1954, improved again in 1955 and by the end of the year was running at a level 3.3 per cent. higher than in the December quarter of 1954.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT</P>
    <P>The higher industrial output in 1955 was accompanied by a corresponding increase in employment.  Employment in manufacturing industries in December reached a record figure of 157,400. This was 1,700 higher than in December, 1954, and 6,300 higher than in December, 1953.</P>
    <P>The employment situation in agriculture was not unsatisfactory; the fall of 3,000 recorded in 1955, from 421,000 to 418,000, following a rise of 500 in 1954, contrasts with an average decline of 16,000 per annum for the five years 1948 to 1953.</P>
    <P>The total number of persons registered as unemployed in recent weeks is approximately the same as in the corresponding weeks of 1955 and is well below the 1954 level.  In 1955 the percentage of the insured population which was unemployed averaged 6.8. This is the lowest percentage recorded in the post-war period.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRICES AND EARNINGS</P>
    <P>Prices generally were higher in 1955. Between December, 1954, and December, 1955, wholesale prices rose by 4.7 per cent. while the index of consumer prices rose by six points or by 4.8 per cent. in the 12 months to mid-February, 1956.  Import prices of raw materials, which had been declining from the beginning of 1953 to the middle of 1954, commenced to rise in the third quarter of 1954 and contributed to the rise in living costs.  A further factor was the substantial upward adjustment of wages and salaries in the second half of 1955.  Average weekly earnings in manufacturing industries at the end of 1955 were higher by 11/- than at the end of 1954, while in relation to purchasing power, the corresponding rise in real terms was 5.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Salary and wage awards in 1955 were <Col N="26" /> for the most part greater than the increase in retail prices but unless there is an increase in productivity this immediate benefit cannot endure. Moreover, if domestic costs continue to rise, the resulting higher prices of our products must hamper the development of new exports and may even threaten established export lines. Recognition is growing of the direct connection between pay increases, not matched by improved productivity, and rising prices.  I am glad to say also that the imperative need for stability in our present difficult economic circumstances is becoming more widely accepted.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MONETARY SITUATION</P>
    <P>In 1955, for the first time for many years, the deposits within the State of the commercial banks fell.  The loss of deposits cannot be attributed to any reduction in the amount of credit made available by the banking system since bank lending within the State in the form of advances and investments increased at a higher rate than in any post-war year.  In fact, deposits within the State fell by £13.2 million although advances and investments within the State rose by £18.2 million.  These figures are closely related to the rise in consumption and the overspending on less essential imports.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL INCOME</P>
    <P>Complete estimates of national income and expenditure for 1955 have not yet been assembled but provisional figures are available for some of the more important components.</P>
    <P>National income in money terms is estimated to have increased from £448 million in 1954 to about £460 million in 1955.  In contrast, however, with an annual rate of growth in real terms of about 2 per cent. in each of the two preceding years, there does not appear to have been any increase in the volume of national production in 1955.  The rise in national income was altogether a reflection of higher wage and other income levels&mdash;a purely monetary affair.  In other words, there was no increase in production to set against the increase in money incomes.  The full impact on the economy of the increases in remuneration will not be felt until this year as most of the awards <Col N="27" /> were granted in the second half of 1955.  Personal consumption at current prices increased by about 10 per cent. last year.  This increase, with its effect on savings and on the balance of payments, was one of the dominant factors in the recent economic situation. While part of the increased expenditure is accounted for by price movements, the volume of personal consumption probably rose by as much as 7 per cent. in a year in which over-all production did not rise at all.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CAPITAL FORMATION</P>
    <P>Excluding depreciation, net domestic capital formation in 1955 is estimated at £63 million or £9 million more than in 1954.  The increase is, however, entirely accounted for by the change in the volume of stocks over the two years.  As far as can be judged, there was no increase either in home-produced fixed capital or in imported capital goods ready for use.  As net domestic capital formation was financed to the extent of almost £36 million by a draw on external capital resources, the estimated net increase in national capital in 1955 was only £27 million or 5 per cent. of gross national product at market prices.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SAVINGS</P>
    <P>The increase in net national capital depends, of course, on what the community saves.  Total savings in 1955 are provisionally estimated to have amounted to only £27 million.  This was £21 million less than in 1954 and £30 million less than in 1953.  The fall appears to have been in personal savings which are believed to have been only about one-half of the 1954 figure of £37 million.  The reduction in savings last year is all the more serious because our rate of saving in relation to national income is not high at the best of times.  I have often stressed during the past 18 months that, if we are to have a high rate of national development and at the same time have a better balance in our external payments, we must greatly increase our savings.  This is our basic prescription for economic security and progress.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>Our less developed economy is particularly exposed to the influence of <Col N="28" /> economic variations and trends in the outside world.  A few years ago it looked as if inflation had at last been conquered but, unfortunately, in almost every country there has been a further eruption in 1955, with serious effect on world prices.  The countermeasures taken in individual countries have not yet been fully effective. World prices are beyond our control but that does not make them any less of a real problem for us.  We must face the fact that every rise in world prices accentuates our trade deficit and threatens our existing standard of living.  We can repel this threat only by producing more, particularly for export, and by doing so more efficiently.</P>
    <P>In the light of my survey of our economic position to-day's budget must, above all, be a realistic budget. We must be sure of making ends meet on current account and our capital expenditure must be measured with prudence until savings have caught up and closed the inflationary gap.  To give any further stimulus to inflation in this budget would make nonsense of our conclusions and precepts by strengthening the very forces which are upsetting the economy.  Rather must we try to moderate those forces and, within the unfortunately narrow scope afforded by the need for making ends meet, do something more to encourage production and saving.  These are the principles on which I have based this budget.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IV&mdash;CAPITAL BUDGET, 1956-57</P>
    <P>Before turning to the Current Budget for 1956-57, I shall outline the prospect regarding capital expenditure this year.  The estimates in Table II, totalling £27.64 million, cover the following services:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> On the Vote on Account I made the comment that it would be shortsighted to seek a way out of our present difficulties by cutting down such investment as will yield early returns in terms of increased output of saleable goods.  I pointed out, however, that capital is not only scarce but abnormally dear at present and, having referred to the failure of the last National Loan to attract adequate subscriptions, I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This makes it unhappily only too clear that, in the absence of a marked change in the savings trend, it would not be possible to meet all our desirable capital requirements without recourse to methods which would only increase the existing inflationary pressure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the screening process to which in the coming weeks I must subject the capital needs of the State and of the other bodies which depend on the State for support in raising their capital requirements, I must assume that the public will increase their savings to a significant degree.  If this assumption were not made, very drastic reductions would have to be made in public capital outlay at great cost in terms of employment and of future prospects of improved living standards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This, then, is the basis on which, in consultation with my colleagues in the Government, I have examined the estimates of capital expenditure not only by the State itself but by the E.S.B., Dublin and Cork Corporations and C.I.E. in the current year.  Account must obviously be taken of the requirements of all these bodies when assessing the draw on the pool of national savings.</P>
    <P>When the estimates of public capital outlay in the present year had been assembled, they showed that the outlay proposed was considerably above the level of recent years.  It was obvious that, even on the most optimistic assumptions about a revival of savings, the aggregate demand for capital for public purposes exceeded the prospective supply.  It was, therefore, inevitable that each estimate should be re-examined and that consideration <Col N="30" /> should be given to the limit which our resources must set for public capital expenditure as a whole.</P>
    <P>In this context the Government have been careful to preserve an equitable balance between social and economic considerations.  In regard to housing, in particular, while the needs of local authorities outside Dublin and Cork are tapering off, having already been largely satisfied, it is recognised that a grave problem still exists in our two principal cities.  The most sympathetic consideration has, therefore, been given to the capital needs of Dublin and Cork Corporations for housing, both for slum clearance and for house purchase loans.  It was in pursuance of this that the Lord Mayor of Dublin was recently informed by the Taoiseach that approval will be granted for aggregate borrowing of £4,000,000 by Dublin Corporation in the current financial year and that the Government undertook to come to the aid of the Corporation should they not be able to raise independently £3,000,000 of capital in addition to the £1,000,000 already promised from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>The estimates of Voted Capital Services have been re-examined and arrangements are being made to effect an economy of £600,000, reducing the requirement to £11,000,000.</P>
    <P>As regards &ldquo;below-the-line&rdquo; issues and other items of capital expenditure, there has also been a realistic screening of requirements, the general aim being to eliminate overestimation and to adjust programmes to an up-to-date assessment of our needs.</P>
    <P>The result of the general review is that the over-all capital requirements of the State and other public bodies in 1956-57 have been settled at a gross figure of £43,500,000, towards which there will be available over £3,000,000 of capital repayments accruing to the Exchequer and the Local Loans Fund, £3,000,000 from the proceeds of the Special Import Levy and a further £500,000 which I propose to transfer to capital purposes from the Road Fund.  I am enabled to make this transfer from the Road Fund by the buoyancy of the revenue from Motor Vehicle Duties, which shows a surplus of £250,000 over allocations to road <Col N="31" /> authorities.  The other £250,000 must come from a slight reduction in the rate of expenditure on main road improvements so that capital development of a more urgent and essential nature may be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>While public capital outlay this year will be at approximately the same level as last year, it will be financed in a way which will impose less strain on our balance of payments.  As I have indicated above, a significant part of the finance will be obtained, not from borrowing or sales of sterling securities, but out of the proceeds of the Special Import Levy and by transfer from the Road Fund.  The net borrowing requirement this year on foot of the capital programmes of the State, local authorities, the E.S.B. and C.I.E. will amount to about £37,000,000, as compared with £41,000,000 last year and an average of £36,000,000 in the three previous years.  Provided personal savings recover to the 1954 level we can carry through a programme of national development of this magnitude without undue strain on our resources and with great benefit to our economic and social welfare.</P>
    <P Just="Center">V&mdash;CURRENT BUDGET, 1956-57</P>
    <P Just="Center">ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to the estimates of current revenue and expenditure for the present year.  These were presented to the Dáil a few days ago in the form of a White Paper and Deputies have had an opportunity of studying the picture they disclose.  It is not a bright one.  The estimated intake of revenue at existing rates of taxation is far from sufficient to meet current expenditure on Central Fund and Supply Services.  Indeed, the revenue estimate at £113.49 million falls short of the current expenditure figure of £120.62 million by £7.13 million.</P>
    <P>Ordinary tax revenue, apart from Motor Vehicle Duties, is estimated at £89,175,000 which compares with an actual receipt of £89,126,000 last year. It might be thought that tax revenue should be expected to display a greater buoyancy.  Last year, however, we had a windfall receipt of the order of £500,000 in Death Duties and the <Col N="32" /> revenue estimates for this year have had to take account also of the deterrent effect on dutiable imports of the Special Import Levy.  I hope that, as a result not only of the levy but of a change in the attitude of the public towards less essential spending and of an increase in production, the import excess will be narrowed and our balance of trade improved.  These are the immediate and primary objectives of policy and completely outweigh any revenue considerations.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POST OFFICE REVENUE</P>
    <P>The estimate of non-tax revenue shows an increase of £1,145,000 over last year's receipt.  This increase is due partly to the natural growth in the return from State assets according as our capital programme advances but mainly to an expansion of Post Office revenue.  Last year the Post Office brought in £6,891,000, but even this large sum fell short of the out goings on postal and allied services, which have been considerably increased by higher pay and other expenses.  In fact, the commercial accounts of the Post Office for last year are expected to show a deficit of roughly £500,000.  It has always been a fundamental principle that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should run its services on commercial lines; in other words, that it should not operate at a loss.  Indeed, it would not be inappropriate that the Department should make some contribution by way of profit to general Exchequer revenue, though I am afraid I cannot hope for that this year. The minimum requirement, however, which must be observed is that the Post Office should pay its way. Towards rectifying the existing deficit, therefore, the responsible Minister intends to raise certain charges, the increased revenue from which has been allowed for in the White Paper figures. I may say that I understand it is not intended to increase the existing three-penny letter rate.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CAUSES OF INCREASED EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>As regards expenditure which is chargeable against ordinary revenue, that is, revenue other than the proceeds of Motor Vehicle Duties, the position is that this year's estimate of £114,871,000 exceeds last year's actual <Col N="33" /> expenditure of £106,855,000 by just over £8,000,000.  The increase arises under four main heads.  The extra cost this year of the various pay increases awarded last year will be over £2,500,000.  These increases cover not only the Civil Service, as ordinarily understood, but the employees of the Post Office, the Board of Works, the Forestry Division, the Land Commission and, in addition, the Army, the Garda Síochána and Teachers.  The extra charge arises because this Government have met promptly and fully their obligations under the established Conciliation and Arbitration machinery.</P>
    <P>The second large item of additional cost is a sum, again of over £2,500,000, for service of debt.  I have mentioned earlier that there is an offset to this&mdash; amounting to £500,000&mdash;in the shape of additional revenue from State advances and investments.  Included in this year's charge is the cost of servicing the National Loan issued in February last.  This year, also, we begin to repay the principal of our dollar borrowings from the Government of the United States.</P>
    <P>The provision of better health services entails additional cost to the Exchequer of almost £1,250,000, while the grant towards the relief of rates on agricultural land is £340,000 above last year's expenditure.  Amongst the variety of items which account for the balance of the total increase of £8,000,000 I might mention the additional grants of £135,000 for Universities and Colleges.</P>
    <P>The increases in debt charges, remuneration, health services, etc., are commitments which the Government must discharge in full and in a manner consistent with the present state of our economy.  It must be understood that increased taxation is the inevitable and direct consequence of increased costs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ALLOWANCE FOR SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES</P>
    <P>The difference between the current revenue and expenditure estimates is, as I have said, £7.13 million.  Against expenditure now unforeseen I must make the usual provision of £750,000. At the same time, I would stress the Government's determination to avoid <Col N="34" /> adding to commitments this year except in two respects, for which specific and complete provision is being made in this budget.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONS</P>
    <P>Frequent and insistent representations have been made to me and to other members of the Government about the position of superannuated members of the State and local authority services. In 1950, under the Pensions (Increase) Act of that year, pensions were increased.  Since then there have been further appreciable advances in living costs which have been alleviated in the case of serving personnel.</P>
    <P>Despite our straitened financial position the Government have decided to concede exceptionally a measure of relief weighted in favour of the most hard-hit of the pensioners.  The cost of doing anything for pensioners, even in a modest way, is formidable because of their numbers.  Provision is, nevertheless, being made in this budget for a scale of increases, on the model of the 1950 Act, graduated according to the amount of the pension.  Details of the increases have not yet been worked out fully but I may say that what is contemplated is a maximum increase of 15 per cent. on the lowest pensions, as they stand, tapering by stages down to an increase of 6 per cent. for pensioners of £450 a year and over, who, incidentally, got no benefit from the 1950 Act.  These increases will apply broadly to persons in the classes named in the 1950 Act and in the Defence Forces Pension Schemes who retired prior to 1st November, 1952.</P>
    <P>I estimate the cost to the Exchequer at £120,000 in 1956-57 and at £180,000 in a full year.  Legislation to give effect to this concession is being prepared.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOCIAL INSURANCE BENEFITS</P>
    <P>The Government have also considered those rates of benefit which are paid from the Social Insurance Fund. That fund, as the House is aware, has always been based on the insurance principle of contributions from the employer, the employee and the State. The benefits payable from the fund were determined as far back as October, 1949, since when their value in real <Col N="35" /> terms has obviously declined.  The Government have decided that these rates of benefit should be increased. Legislation to give effect to this decision will shortly be introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare.  Bearing in mind that such legislation and its implementation will take some little time and that the contribution of the State towards the extra cost will be one-third, I must set aside this year £300,000 under this heading.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ALLOWANCE FOR OVER-ESTIMATION</P>
    <P>The result of these adjustments is that the gap between revenue and expenditure has become £8.3 million. Some writing-down of this figure is, however, justified by our experience for some years past which shows that the provision made for expenditure is usually excessive, however carefully the original estimates are screened. Last year, as I mentioned earlier, the actual saving through overestimation came to £3,123,000.  It would not be unreasonable to count this year on £3,000,000, leaving the deficit to be covered by budgetary measures at £5.3 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ADMINISTRATIVE ECONOMIES</P>
    <P>To reinforce the prospect of obtaining a saving of this order, I intend vigorously to press on with the revision of Civil Service administrative methods so as to check the rising cost of government.  Measures to that end are being pursued already.  They must now be intensified and accelerated. I propose, therefore, to set up, under my immediate direction, a committee of the heads of the various Departments whose function it will be to push forward the introduction of improved methods in their own Departments and throughout the public service generally.  I would add that, where involved or cumbersome techniques derive from statute, proposals will be formulated for amending legislation specifically designed to remove obstacles to the introduction of speedier, less costly and more modern administrative methods.  By taking advantage of the normal wastage that arises from retirements, etc., such reforms can be effected and significant economies achieved, without discharging <Col N="36" /> any serving official.  I am authorised to make it clear that every member of the Government is determined to reduce the cost of administration in this way.</P>
    <P Just="Center">METHOD OF MEETING DEFICIT</P>
    <P>I now pass to the measures which must be taken to eliminate the deficit of £5.3 million on current account.  I may say at once that the Government do not propose that any part of this deficit should be met by a reduction in food subsidies.  Indeed, because of the decision taken by the Government on its formation in June, 1954, the butter subsidy this year is almost £2 million higher than it was in 1953-54.  The provisions for that subsidy and the subsidy on bread and flour are being maintained; we are not going to relieve even a serious budgetary problem by adding deliberately to the cost of essential foodstuffs when the maintenance of stability is of such critical importance. The principle I am following in this budget is to levy the taxation which is inevitable on less essential forms of expenditure, particularly on imports.  I am taxing expenditure rather than income and I am hoping in this way not only to maintain production but to stimulate economy in regard to imports and a greater volume of personal saving.  Any progress made in either of these directions will be a direct and immediate contribution towards putting our economy on a stronger and more stable basis.</P>
    <P>It will come, therefore, as no surprise that I intend the brunt of the task of making ends meet to fall on tobacco and petrol, imports of which in 1955 amounted to close on £8.4 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TOBACCO</P>
    <P>I propose to raise the main rate of duty applicable to leaf tobacco to £2 2s. 9d. per lb., an increase of 7s. 11d.  Allowing a margin for the trade, this will have the effect of increasing the retail price of 20 standard cigarettes by 5d.  The increased duty adds about 6d. to the selling price of an ounce of pipe tobacco but in the case of the hard-pressed varieties I propose to limit the average advance to 4d. by increasing the existing rebate allowed on such tobacco at a cost of £200,000 this year.</P>
    <P>I propose also to levy a special <Col N="37" /> excise duty of 7s. 11d. per lb., i.e., the amount of the increase in the customs duty, on all duty-paid stocks of unmanufactured, and manufactured tobacco held by the manufacturers at 5 p.m. this evening.</P>
    <P>The other rates of tobacco duty will be raised in accordance with the increase in the main customs rate. Allowing for the cost of the increased rebate, I expect these measures to yield £2,955,000 this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PETROL</P>
    <P>Consumption of petrol has been rising steadily over the years and reached the figure of £84,750,000 gallons for the year 1955-56 compared with 80,380,000 gallons in 1954-55 and 76,730,000 gallons in 1953-54.  The duty was raised by 5d. in 1948, by 2d. in 1951 and by 5½d. in 1952.  These increases seem to have in no way hindered the increasing use of motor transport and it will be conceded that much of that use is for less essential purposes.  I propose to raise the customs duty from 1/9½d. to 2/3¼d. a gallon, that is, by 5¾d. a gallon, with a complementary increase in the excise duty.  This will probably mean an increase of 6d. a gallon in the price of standard petrol.  Petrol purchased for and used in agricultural tractors and farm engines is entitled to a repayment of 8d. per gallon from the existing duty.  The rate of repayment will be raised by the amount of the increase in duty so that in effect petrol used for these purposes will not bear the increase in duty.  The cost of this concession will be £20,000 this year leaving the net additional yield at £1,330,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">HYDROCARBON OILS OTHER THAN PETROL</P>
    <P>Side by side with the petrol duty there is a duty on the other oils included in the hydrocarbon group. Through the operation of a rebate pro vision, however, the latter duty becomes effective only where the one are used for combustion in road vehicles.  In practice, only a small fraction of the oils is so used and the great bulk is free from duty.  I do not now propose that the oils used as road fuel&mdash;mainly in omnibuses and heavy lorries&mdash;should bear any new impost.  I am, however, forced to consider the <Col N="38" /> oils which hitherto have had the benefit of a rebate of the full duty.  They include kerosene, fuel oils and lubricating oils and comprise a substantial and rising item in our imports.  To mark the need for economy in their use, and thus to restrain imports, I propose that these oils should in future bear an effective duty of 1d. a gallon.  This result will be achieved by a variation in the existing rebate, with effect from the 11th instant.  I am making an exception in the case of tractor vaporising oil which will continue to enjoy full immunity from duty.</P>
    <P>The increased yield from the duty this year, allowing £45,000 for the exemption of tractor vaporising oil, will be £465,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MATCHES</P>
    <P>The duty on matches has been twice reduced since the War to enable the retail price to be kept at 1½d. a box despite rising costs of production.  I have come to the conclusion that in present circumstances this commodity could bear a modest increase and I propose to raise the duty by 4/6d. a gross.  Allowing a margin for the trade, this will bring the price of the ordinary box of matches to 2d.  I expect to get £170,000 from the increase in the current year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE WATERS</P>
    <P>The main rate of duty on table waters has remained unaltered since its introduction 40 years ago at the low figure of 4d. a gallon.  The quantity consumed has risen from around 1,650,000 gallons in 1939 to about 5,750,000 gallons at present.  Considering the duty increases which other commodities have had to bear since 1939, it will scarcely be thought unreasonable to ask consumers to contribute a little more to the Exchequer. I propose, therefore, to raise the excise duty to a flat 1s. a gallon and the customs rate to 1s. 4d.  The additional yield is estimated at £150,000 this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BETTING</P>
    <P>It will be generally agreed that betting and gambling are high on the list of objects of non-essential spending, the curtailment of which will not affect production or employment but should help towards greater saving.  Accordingly, I propose</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> (a)  to increase the rate of the existing excise duty on bets made in bookmaking offices from 7½ per cent. to 10 per cent.;</P>
    <P>(b)  to collect from the Racing Board a stamp duty of 5 per cent. of the aggregate of sums staked by means of totalisators operated by the Board; and</P>
    <P>(c)  to collect from the Racing Board a stamp duty of 2½ per cent. of the aggregate of bets made with bookmakers on race-courses.</P>
    <P>These measures will have effect in respect of bets made on or after the 1st July next.  If the Racing Board so desire they will be free to meet their liability to stamp duty by increasing their current levy in the case of course bets and will be authorised to retain a larger share of sums staked by means of totalisators.</P>
    <P>I propose also to attach excise duties to the gaming licences to be issued under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  The duties will range from £10 for a quarterly licence to £40 in the case of an annual licence.</P>
    <P>I expect these measures to produce £290,000 this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ENTERTAINMENTS DUTY</P>
    <P>In view of our present financial difficulties, I propose to restore the dance tax which operated up to 1952.  The rates will be the same as before with the exception that I have introduced into the scale a measure of flexibility which past experience showed to be necessary.  Under general entertainments duty law, dances held three miles or more from towns having populations exceeding 1,000 will be free of tax.  Under the same law dances in towns of 1,000 to 2,000 would be entitled to a repayment of half of the duty paid.  This latter concession would, however, be difficult to administer and accordingly I am introducing in its stead, for dances in those towns, a separate scale of duty producing approximately the same effect.  With the smaller towns and rural areas excluded I do not visualise any great administrative difficulty in the collection of this tax.</P>
    <P>The duties will operate from the 1st August next and I estimate their yield this year at £100,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NET YIELD OF ADDITIONAL TAXES</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> From the taxes I have mentioned, the net yield this year is estimated at £5,460,000, as compared with the deficit of £5,300,000.  I have arranged that it should be rather more than is needed to bridge the gap because, as I indicated earlier, I wish to do something in this budget to encourage production and saving.  I am conscious that direct taxation, that is, the taxation of incomes and profits, has a more deterrent effect on enterprise and saving than taxes on personal spending of a semi-luxury character.  I have concentrated on taxes of the latter kind in order to meet the budgetary deficit.  With the margin of revenue available I propose now to afford, by way of relief from direct taxation, some stimulus to expansion of output and to greater personal and corporate saving.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INDUSTRIAL TAXATION</P>
    <P>In the budget of 1953 my predecessor announced the institution of a Committee to examine certain aspects of industrial taxation.  That Committee concluded its labours last month and the report was presented to me on the 19th April, 1956.  I should like to take this opportunity of extending thanks and appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Committee who gave so much valuable time to this arduous task.  I have no doubt that their report will prove extremely helpful to all in considering this complex problem.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, since I received this report such a short while ago, I have not yet had the opportunity fully to study it and to consider its implications. The report is being printed and I hope will be available to the members of the Oireachtas and to the public early next month.  There is, however, one proposal on which the Committee reports favourably and which I have myself always considered particularly apposite to our circumstances.  I propose, accordingly, to include in the Finance Bill a section granting a 20 per cent. initial allowance for wear and tear on machinery or plant (exclusive of vehicles) acquired on or after 6th April, 1956, for use in a trade.  I hope that this will act as an incentive <Col N="41" /> to those engaged in industry to modernise their plant and so increase efficient production, thus contributing in some degree towards the solution of the problems to which I have earlier referred.  This proposal will not affect the Exchequer in the current year because income tax assessments are normally based on the preceding year, but it will cost next year about £200,000.</P>
    <P>I hope that as soon as the report is available everyone interested in the vital problem of industrial efficiency will study it carefully.  Detailed official examination of the report will, meanwhile, be proceeding but will necessarily take some time.  I said earlier this year and I repeat now that when that examination is completed I shall be prepared to consider a more general review of our code of direct taxation. It would obviously not be feasible or proper to tackle that until we have first considered in detail the valuable results of the lengthy study that was given to a particular aspect of the problem by the recent Committee.</P>
    <P>I should also refer here to two other proposals designed to give a fresh impetus to investment by our citizens in Irish industrial development.  Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, provided a 20 per cent. remission from income tax for certain public issues floated for the establishment or extension of industries.  That section did not grant this benefit to &ldquo;rights&rdquo; or bonus issues following the original issue.  The effect has been to subdivide certain Irish issues in a way that has made them less marketable, a disadvantage on which the Industrial Taxation Committee has also commented. I propose to remedy this defect by providing that &ldquo;rights&rdquo; or bonus issues, to the extent that they relate to shares with the 20 per cent. relief, may themselves qualify for that relief, thereby permitting the amalgamation of these issues so as to increase their marketability.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ESTATE DUTY</P>
    <P>I intend also to grant a relief from Estate Duty for new public issues made for the promotion of Irish industry analogous to the income tax relief to which I have just referred.  Broadly, my idea is that one-third of the value of any stock, shares or securities issued <Col N="42" /> after the passing of this year's Finance Act and coming within the ambit of the new relief will, in the case of an individual dying domiciled in Ireland, be excluded from account in the assessment of Estate Duty.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SAVINGS INCENTIVE AND OTHER INCOME TAX RELIEFS</P>
    <P>As an incentive to personal saving I propose to exempt from income tax the first £25 of the total interest otherwise assessable upon an individual taxpayer, arising from deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank, the Trustee Savings Banks, or the commercial banks.  The estimated cost to the Exchequer of this exemption will be £50,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>I am linking with this concession some relief from income tax for married couples and for those who have to support dependent relatives. I propose an increased allowance of £10 in each case.  The cost will be £106,000 this year and, in a full year, £287,000.</P>
    <P>Last year I raised the tax free allowance for each child from £85 to £100.  There is an anomaly in that the allowance is available to a taxpayer for the year in which his child is born whereas if he adopts a child in the year during which the adopted child was born, he gets no relief for that year.  I propose to correct this anomaly.</P>
    <P>Having granted these reliefs I emerge with a balance on the Current Budget.  There are, however, some other changes in tax law, not of significance in my budgetary calculations, to which I wish to refer before I conclude.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OTHER CHANGES IN TAX LAW</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1954, and Section 5 of the Finance Act, 1955, secured that interest on certain stocks issued by the E.S.B., by C.I.E. or by a local authority might be paid without deduction of income tax.  To facilitate external subscribers to such stocks, I propose to provide that neither the capital nor the interest shall be liable to any taxation so long as it is shown that the stocks are in the beneficial ownership of persons who are neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State; and <Col N="43" /> also, that the interest shall not be liable to income tax so long as it is shown that the stocks are in the beneficial ownership of persons who, wherever their domicile, are not ordinarily resident here.  This will bring these stocks completely into line with National Loans.</P>
    <P>In 1947 a specially high rate of Stamp Duty&mdash;25 per cent.&mdash;was imposed on certain transfers of property to persons other than Irish nationals and those then resident here.  It was designed specifically to meet the circumstances of that time and, as my predecessor then made clear, was to be purely temporary.  The yield from the duty has shrunk to almost nothing and the circumstances in which it was imposed no longer exist.  On the contrary, our anxiety now is to induce foreign industrialists to build factories here so as to increase employment and enlarge our export potential.  When, for instance, we require skilled technicians to operate new processes and teach them to our own people, they should not have to bear this heavy impost.  I propose, therefore, that this duty will no longer apply to industrial sites or private dwelling-houses as distinct from agricultural land.</P>
    <P>I propose to continue for a further three years the exemption from Corporation Profits Tax which has hitherto been granted to certain concerns, including public utility companies.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in existing law whereby the relief allowable for income tax purposes to a person in respect of a life insurance premium is restricted by reference to 7 per cent. of the actual capital sum payable on death.  This limitation may impose hardship when it applies to a person whose health is impaired and whose annual premium, by reason of that circumstance, exceeds 7 per cent. of the capital sum payable.  I propose to remove this hardship by relaxing the restriction in such cases.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>The economic and financial problems with which we are faced this year arise partly because we do not live in an isolated economy and partly from increased domestic costs.  In the light of <Col N="44" /> these rising costs the estimates of expenditure have been cut to the minimum consistent with the provision of essential services, the maintenance of employment and the development of our resources.</P>
    <P>Our economic conditions demand, first, a sufficient degree of order and stability to enable us to continue uninterruptedly our efforts to raise the standard of living of all our people; second, the setting aside by the community, in the form of savings, of sufficient resources to sustain the national development on which our hopes of higher standards are based, even though this may involve some immediate sacrifice; and, third, a determined and cooperative effort by all, both employers and employees, in agriculture, industry and other forms of production to increase the national output.  I know our people do not desire that national development should be slowed down. The drift towards less essential spending is, however, directly limiting the resources available for that development. If it were to proceed unchecked it would frustrate our hopes for the future.</P>
    <P>In raising the additional taxation that increased costs have made inevitable my aim has been to place the stress where it will least affect production and employment while, at the same time, influencing a return to a saving and spending pattern more in accord with our national objectives.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, suggest that budgetary measures are all-powerful. On the contrary, the decisions of individuals are more important in their economic effect than any financial measures of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is, however, the Government's responsibility to do its part to secure the achievement of the national economic objectives.  This Government will not shirk that responsibility and this budget is built on that principle. It is not a popular budget in the ordinary sense of that term but I do claim that it is a realistic budget designed to serve the long-term interests of our people.  When those interests are fully appreciated, I am confident the Government will get the cooperation of all in the effort to secure a permanent and progressive increase in our standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget which the Minister for Finance has just announced will, I think, come as a great shock and a great disappointment to the people of this country.  The heavy increases in taxation which are to be imposed will provide the shock; the disappointment will arise from the evidence that this Government appears to have no conception of policy or plan for dealing with the very serious national problems which, in their incompetence, they have allowed to develop.  Ministers have been trying for some weeks past to condition the public minds to the acceptance of increased taxation.  They know they failed.  They failed because for years previously these same individuals had been drilling into the minds of the Irish people that taxation here was unnecessarily high and that they could effect a reduction of it.  There is not a Deputy sitting opposite who does not owe his seat in this House to repeated pledges to his constituents that he would be able to reduce the cost of Government and reduce taxation.  What a pack of &ldquo;phoneys&rdquo; you have proven yourselves to be!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the record of this Government to date.  When they came into office in 1954 they took over the last Budget of the previous Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;the Budget presented to this House before the election of 1954 by Deputy MacEntee.  That Budget estimated the cost of non-capital supply services at £88,737,000.  To-day the Coalition Minister for Finance estimates the cost of these services at £97,520,000&mdash;an increase on that side of the Budget of £8,784,000.  For the Central Fund Services, the bill has gone up by £4,365,000.  The total increase effected in the cost of Government services under this administration in two years is, therefore, over £13,000,000.  Do Deputies now remember the broadcast statement of the Fine Gael financial expert, Deputy McGilligan, when he went to Radio Eireann a few days before the polling in 1954 and said that any Minister for Finance who knew his job would be <Col N="46" /> able to reduce the cost of Government by not less than £10,000,000 per year and that he would not despair of reducing it by more than that?  How many votes did that statement get you in the general election?  Did you think then that you would see the day when you would sit behind a Minister for Finance applauding the imposition of new taxes?</P>
    <P>What is this country getting for that £13,000,000 by which you have increased the cost of Government administration? Deduct the Central Fund services if you will&mdash;the higher charge for interest on the public debt; deduct the £700,000 by which the Estimate for Social Welfare exceeds the Estimate for 1954.  There is nothing to be deducted in respect of food subsidies. The provision for these, including butter, is no higher this year than it was in 1954.  That leaves £8,000,000 to be accounted for.  What happened to it?  Where is it gone?  In waste and extravagance.  That is what the country is paying for incompetent Government.  &ldquo;£10,000,000 a year could be saved by any Minister for Finance who knew his job&rdquo;&mdash;but this Minister for Finance and this Government have added £8,000,000 to administrative expenses.  That is what the people have got to pay because of their credulity in listening to the glowing election promises of these Ministers when they were seeking their votes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is going to establish a commission to review administration methods in the Civil Service. He does not hope to succeed. Look at the Book of Estimates which he has presented.  He contemplates that to do the same administrative work this year as was done last year will require 300 more civil servants, not counting Garda, or Army, or post office or teachers&mdash;300 more administrative and clerical officers to do this year the same work as was done last year.  There has been no expansion in the public services worth talking about; £8,000,000 has gone in waste.</P>
    <P>It was not merely in the election campaign that all these promises of reduced taxes were held out.  Some few months ago the Taoiseach, on his Estimate, talked about the prospect of lower taxation without any diminution <Col N="47" /> in Government services; indeed, he even held out a prospect of lower taxation and extended services at the same time.  Did he know then where his Government was going?  Did he know what was happening in the various Departments?  Did he know how costs were rising because of incompetence, because there are men in charge of Government Departments who have no business experience and who do not know how to ensure that the money provided for the various Departments by the taxpayers is properly spent?</P>
    <P>What did the people expect to hear in the statement from the Minister for Finance to-day?  They expected to hear some definite proposals intended to bring about that increase in production and exports which this country needs to survive.  What proposals have we got?  A few finicky little measures which will cost the Exchequer nothing; an initial allowance for wear and tear on machinery that represents no increase in the allowance but merely an advance of the depreciation provision, and which costs the Exchequer nothing at any time; a modification of the provisions of Section 7 of the 1932 Finance Act, which does not matter.  We devised that arrangement as a means to induce people to invest in Irish industry. It did not succeed.  To the knowledge of many Deputies here, there are shareholders in Irish industry to-day who do not even apply for the allowance; and, if they wanted it, they would have to go through all this elaborate procedure of making an individual application to the Revenue Commissioners.  What relevancy have these proposals to the national need, to the gap of £35,000,000 in our balance of payments, to the pulling down of the external reserves of the banks, forcing the present credit squeeze, a credit squeeze which is promoting widespread unemployment in many directions, and which is likely to become more acute during the year?</P>
    <P>Have the Government any sense of responsibility?  Have they any knowledge of the tasks that are facing them?  Did it occur to them that this Budget deficit of theirs should be rectified by reducing the cost of <Col N="48" /> Government?  At one time they said that was possible.  At one time they professed to believe that that was such an easy task that they had no difficulty in putting a figure upon the reduction that they could bring about. Can they now stop it rising?  What is the meaning of all this nonsense that the Minister for Finance is talking&mdash; the effect of increased costs upon the national economy&mdash;when Government costs are going up far more rapidly than any other?  Is there any sense in this exhortation to our people to avoid increases in cost which have an inflationary effect when the Government will not set a lead?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister for Finance find in all the industrial activities carried on in this country, in all the business firms which are supposed to listen to his exhortation, any single one of them in which costs have risen as much as they have risen in the Government service?  Does he not think that example is much better than precept and that he should begin his exhortation by announcing what he is going to do to bring down the costs of Government or to stop them rising?</P>
    <P>We need savings.  One of the main achievements of the Government to date has been the falling-off in the level of savings.  The Minister for Finance is hoping, by various devices, to get savings back to the 1954 level. But what is there in this Budget designed to help to bring about that situation?  Does the Minister for Finance think that he can encourage private people to save when he will not try to save himself?  All this parade of new taxes, dearer matches, dearer mineral waters for the children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will that be their answer to the people who sent them here?  Will that be their answer to the people they misled into believing they could reduce costs, the people <Col N="49" /> who sent them here for that purpose? Will their answer be to laugh at them because they were such fools as to believe them?  These increases in revenue coming from these additional imposts are very small in relation to the fantastic promises that the Government made.  If the Government could save, not the £10,000,000 the Deputies opposite talked about but 10 per cent. of that, none of these higher taxes would be necessary.</P>
      <P>These higher taxes are being imposed because of the Government's inability to prevent the cost of administration going up, their incapacity to devise any method of getting the cost of Government down.  In 1953, the Fianna Fáil Government, of which I was a member, took a decision that taxation in this country had reached the danger limit.  We announced that we had made up our minds on that fact and that, so far as we were concerned, there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that, if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burdens on the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Can we, even now, get a promise that this is the last impost? We cannot.  This is the second Budget this year.  We will have a third.  In last March the Minister came in here with a series of proposals designed to increase the amount that the Irish taxpayers will pay this year by £3,000,000. He comes in now in May with proposals to increase the levy on them still further by £5,500,000; and he tells us that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will bring in another Budget in a few weeks' time to raise another £500,000.  Will that be the last Budget this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Government make up their minds now that Government expenditure cannot go higher than they have let it go to date?  Can they give the people a promise that there is any prospect of stability now?  What is the use of all these exhortations to save unless the people can be assured that the value of money will be maintained? <Col N="50" /> Only a very foolish man will save money now if he believes that this time 12 months that money will buy less in goods than it will buy to-day. Will the Government not realise that their responsibility in relation to prices is a definite one?</P>
    <P>I am not talking now about their election promises.  In their election campaign they promised to bring down the cost of living in every direction. Will they at least promise now to make some effort to stop the cost of living from going up still further?  It is now the common theme of Ministers that the Government is powerless to control the upward movement of prices.  Do they not realise that, unless they devise some method of maintaining stability of money values, of preventing prices rising further, all their exhortations to save will be useless and the increased level of investment which they are seeking will not come about?</P>
    <P>Will they take to heart their own words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our economic development is at stake.  Our hopes of improving our living standards and providing a larger volume of gainful employment depend on an adequate supply of savings to finance capital investment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government cannot get savings without giving an assurance of stability of money values.  Have they thrown in the towel completely in relation to this question of the cost of living?  Is it good enough now for the Minister for Finance to come in here and say that prices are going up because of factors which are outside the control of the Government?  The Government and Deputies opposite did not say that two years ago.  They said then that every factor affecting prices was under the control of the Government.</P>

The Minister for Finance will have noticed that the applause that greeted his Budget was rather localised, and that not all the Deputies supporting the Government are facing this new duty of theirs with any enthusiasm.  Do you remember the time when the Labour Party were giving the assurance to the electorate that they would not join in the Government, unless they got in advance an undertaking that the price of cigarettes and drink would come down?  Was that assurance not given to the public by spoken word from public platforms and by advertisements in the public Press?  Are they now going to vote for this 5d. on the package of cigarettes, this 6d. on the gallon of petrol, these higher taxes which the Minister has announced?</P>

      <P>The Minister has talked about pruning the capital expenditure of the State and public authorities but nevertheless he is contemplating facing the task of raising £37,000,000 for capital purposes this year.  I think there is some explanation due to the Dáil as to how the Minister proposes to raise that money.  It is only a couple of months since the Government attempted to raise money by public loan and failed, although they offered a rate of interest which was the highest ever offered for a public loan in this State for 30 years.  Are they now contemplating methods of finance which are going to add to the difficulties of the country?  Does the Minister seriously hope he can raise £37,000,000 out of public savings in this year?  If he does not succeed in raising that sum of money, what is the prospect for maintaining the level of employment and the volume of trade&mdash; even the reduced level of employment and the reduced volume of trade which the country now enjoys?</P>
      <P>The Minister is going to raid the Road Fund.  A quarter of a million pounds is to be taken from the money that might have been available to the Road Fund for road maintenance purposes, in order to relieve the Exchequer difficulty.</P>

      <P>I notice the Minister <Col N="53" /> for Finance is estimating a 14 per cent. increase in road vehicle duty revenue this year.  I think that is nonsense. Having regard to the facts of the situation as they were developing, and as they have been intensified by the additional impost of March last, the prospect of a considerably greater increase in the number of motor cars on the road in this year than in any previous year is fantastic.  Yet the Minister's proposition is that, although the revenue of the Road Fund is not likely to expand in this year in any degree equivalent to previous years, nevertheless he will raid it for the purpose of meeting his Exchequer difficulties. I do not know if the Minister has made any estimate of the number of road workers who will be unemployed by reason of that decision.  I do not know if the Labour Party care.  Surely, however, some member of the Government must have asked himself what was the likely consequence of this decision which they were taking and surely some member of the Government should, therefore, be in a position to give the House some information about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Committee on Industrial Taxation has been a long time producing its report.  I think the House would have been quite agreeable to adjourn the debate on the Budget for a fortnight to give the Minister time to read it and act upon its recommendations, if they are of value.  We cannot estimate the value of the recommendations until we see them.  Surely it will be recognised that what our country needs more than anything else is a very considerable expansion in the level of investment in private productive enterprises. I ask if there is any weapon available to the Government which can bring about that expansion which we must have, other than a suitable modification of the taxation of industrial profits&mdash;a suitable inducement to people to invest in industrial enterprise. Are we to wait 12 months while the Minister for Finance leisurely reads the report before any proposals arising out of the report will come before the House?  Is this country to remain in the doldrums, as it has been for the past year, just because the Minister for <Col N="54" /> Finance will not sit up for a night or two to read that report?</P>

Will it go up another £8,000,000 next year?  Will any member of the Government give an assurance that it will not go up?  I am sure the people of this country are beginning to feel that this Government are completely irresponsible and that they do not know the magnitude of the duties they undertook when they accepted ministerial office.  They are allowing a situation to develop which can be disastrous for this country and which generations may not be able to remedy.</P>
      <P>This Government must face up to their responsibilities in a more definite way than they have hitherto attempted. This is not merely a matter of votes: I do not care whether you get or lose votes on the Budget.  It is important that the country should be well governed and it is especially important that, this year, effective action will be taken to undo the damage which has already been done.  It is essential to reverse the wrong direction of the national progress.  We must try to get moving in the right direction again. The Government alone have the power to do that, and, if they do not intend to try, they have a duty to go back to the people and to tell them so.  Last year the Minister for Finance described the 1955 Budget as &ldquo;the first instalment, and only the first instalment, of the Coalition plans.&rdquo;  This Budget is the second instalment.

    <P>(10)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later than the 15th day of May, 1956, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at 5 o'clock in the afternoon of the 8th day of May, 1956, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(11)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of paragraph (10) of this Resolution, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> (b)  render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at 5 o'clock in the afternoon of the 8th day of May, 1956.</P>
    <P>(12)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by paragraph (10) of this Resolution or on the 15th day of May, 1956, whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in this Resolution on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at 5 o'clock in the afternoon of the 8th day of May, 1956, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a date not later than the 1st day of January, 1957, upon the manufacturer giving security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(13)  That every manufacturer required by paragraph (10) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (11) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of £50, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forefeited.</P>
    <P>(14)  That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty provided for by paragraph (8) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (8) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>
    <P>(15)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory <Col N="60" /> effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

      <P>I think the House should hear the Minister for Social Welfare upon the fact which the Minister has now disclosed to the House that, of the 5d. that is now to be imposed on the packet of 20 cigarettes, the tobacco manufacturers and other persons engaged in the tobacco trade are going to get a ½d.  We all remember the speeches which the Minister for Social Welfare made on the 1952 Budget when, acting on the advice of the Prices Advisory Body set up by the Minister's own colleague, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, we conceded that it was only equitable and just that the benefit of the equivalent of a tax of 1d. per packet of 20 cigarettes would inure to the tobacco industry as a whole and all those engaged in it.  The Minister for Social Welfare twitted the Government of the day that this was only <Col N="62" /> passing it over to those whom he described as the millionaire manufacturers and foreign combines.  I think that before the House decides on this Resolution it is entitled to hear from the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is now prepared to support giving this money to the millionaire manufacturers and the foreign combines as he described them in 1952.</P>

      <P>Normally in the past 1d. on 20 cigarettes was assumed to bring in £1,000,000.  It is possible that the Minister is estimating for some reduction in consumption following this very heavy increase in tax.  Would I be right in saying that this ½d. to the trade involves £500,000?  Of the additional amount which the consumers will pay every year, £500,000 will go to the trade.  Has anybody calculated that?  Did somebody decide the need of that?</P>

The figures the Deputy gave us in respect of a ½d. yielding £500,000 would not be accurate, partly because of the decreased consumption due to a variety of reasons, including the one mentioned by Deputy MacBride.  I do not propose to segregate the various component parts of that reduced consumption but the Deputy can take it, as can be seen from the figures I gave, that an increase of 4½d. in duty <Col N="64" /> means £2,945,000, excluding the duty on stocks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that members of the Labour Party, particularly those who represent the rural constituencies, are conspicuously absent when this Resolution is being debated.  I want to ask the Minister for Finance, so that it will be quite clear to all the Deputies who are voting to support this Resolution, what in fact it intends to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> As I take it, Sections (2) and (3) are the sections which impose the main rates of duty, the duty upon petrol and mineral hydrocarbon oils used for the purposes of ordinary personal and commercial transport.  Sections (4) and (5) grant rebates, but these rebates are so graded that a tax of 1d. per gallon will be imposed upon all oils used for lighting, heating and cooking. I assume that I am correct in that. Therefore, in the constituency which is represented in this House by, among others, the recently appointed Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Spring, where oil is extensively used for cooking and perhaps for heating, and in those districts which are not yet covered by the rural electrification scheme, for lighting, and in the constituency of every member of the Labour Party who represents a rural area, every smallholder and agricultural worker will be charged henceforward on all the oil used for these domestic purposes at the rate of 1d. per gallon.</P>
    <P>That is what the working class people in our rural areas are paying for the fact that the Government has not tackled what is the basic difficulty in all this matter, the phenomenon of rising Government expenditure.  Until we can manage to curb and curtail that, there will be no relief for any taxpayer in this country and the burdens upon the workers, upon the poorer sections of this community, are going to be increased.  That is what is at stake here in this Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Opposition and the Government have made it quite clear that this country is facing a serious crisis and that one of the causes of that crisis is the importation of commodities from abroad, in many instances commodities for which a reasonable substitute can be produced and found at home.  In spite of the fact that this Government has not brought about a reduction in the cost of Government administration, my opinion is that it is our duty as members of this House to take the unpopular step of helping in our own way by our votes to ensure that the importation from abroad of goods that are of a luxury nature is limited to the <Col N="69" /> minimum.  Both commodities, tobacco and oils, come from abroad.  When Deputy MacEntee suggests that in various constituencies oil is used for fuel and heating purposes, I should like to state that I regret the day we still have to use oil for these purposes. We have a first class native substitute in peat and I should like to see the Government give a dynamic kick in the pants to Bord na Móna and the E.S.B. to get under way with a first class programme, so that our native fuel resources would be exploited to the utmost.  Although it may be unpopular to say so, I would not be logical in my arguments down through the years if I did not say that, if a Government are to put on additional taxes, they should be put on some commodity that comes from abroad rather than commodities that are produced in Ireland.  I am only sorry that the Minister has not taken immediate steps to cut out the importation of cereals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on the actual details of this and I want the Minister to clarify the position in so far as the farming community are concerned with the use of oil and petrol.  I think we should ensure, when applying penalties to the public, that the farming community, our primary producers, are given every incentive.  Before I cast my vote on this, I want to be assured that it will not have an adverse effect on agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the steepest increase in petrol duty ever imposed in one year.  Have the Government made any estimate of the effect of it upon the user of petrol?  Did they take into account the intention to impose this higher tax when preparing their estimate of the revenue foreseeable from this duty?  I am rather puzzled. The Minister apparently is expecting that the amount paid on road tax on vehicles this year will not merely be considerably above last year, but that there will be a far greater expansion of revenue than was previously in evidence. <Col N="70" /> I presume the Government are aware how badly the motor trade is already hit.  I think that the saturation of the market for motor-cars which has been going on recently here would have produced a considerable failing off in the number of new cars registered this year without any Government action; but the Government decided to increase the price of cars by imposing a 15 per cent. additional duty on imported parts.  That is already having its effect on a number of firms.  In fact, I do not think there is any firm which has not laid off a substantial number of employees.  Further impositions on the motor trade in the form of a petrol tax are bound to have further consequences in that direction.  Apparently, however, the Government think not; apparently it is assumed that not only will the motor trade not be affected, but that there will be an expansion in it this year at a greater rate than ever before.  I think that is a nonsensical assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister satisfied himself that this new duty will not affect the cost of fuel to C.I.E. for transport services in Dublin City?  In other words, has he satisfied himself it will not affect bus fares?  Can he say whether or not this new duty is likely to be made an excuse for another increase in bus fares in the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy McQuillan is not so innocent as to think that an increase of 6d. a gallon on the price of petrol is not going to increase the cost of production on farms and that it is not going to affect the agricultural community?  Every Deputy knows that farm production, or a great part of it, is hauled by petrol-driven lorries and other vehicles of that kind. Accordingly, an increase in the price of petrol must affect the cost of agricultural production and will be passed on to the consumer.  The new tax will also affect hackney owners about whom there was such wailing and moaning in 1952.  It will be a serious blow to these people.  Although tractor oil is exempted, still a large part of farm produce will be affected by the increased price of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This duty on other <Col N="71" /> hydrocarbon oils includes heavy oils other than petrol, tractor oils and diesel oil.  The heavier type of buses run on diesel oil.  There is no increase of duty in respect of that user of diesel oil.  In respect of Deputy McQuillan's point about tractor vaporising oil, that is excluded from the duty and the rebate provisions by which repayment can be claimed are contained in this Resolution for petrol tractors used for agricultural purposes. Farmers will have to pay to-morrow the same price as they paid to-day for petrol for agricultural purposes.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy Lemass's point about motor vehicles is concerned, he must be aware, as I am aware, every Deputy is aware, and as the country is aware, that immediately after the new impositions on imported parts, people rushed in and bought up cars. The effect of that rush to purchase before the duty impacted on the price of new cars was to bring into tax in the financial year cars that would not have been bought until perhaps May or June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say we are not proposing to divide the House on all the Resolutions to-day.  We are opposed to all the Resolutions which involve increased taxes on the ground that the Government could have avoided the need for increased taxes if they had made a serious effort to reduce administration costs.  That applies particularly to the taxes with which the remaining Resolutions are concerned, each of which is estimated to bring in only a comparatively small amount of money.  One would think that a very small effort at economy in administration would have saved £170,000 per year and therefore made unnecessary the tax upon matches.  However, we will discuss that in more detail on the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to get clear upon one aspect of this tax.  The price of the box of matches will, presumably, go up by a halfpenny&mdash;six shillings per dozen? The Minister is going to get 4/6 per dozen and the manufacturer will get 1/6 per dozen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I know it is not.  In fact, the manufacturer will get £55,000 or £56,000 extra and it will be entirely a matter for himself whether he keeps that or uses some part of it to increase the trade margin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware how certain branches of the Department of which he was previously in charge operate.  The Deputy knows perfectly well in relation to these trading margins that they are allocated to the various parts of the trade by agreement with the Department.</P>

      <P>I am not denying the possibility that the margins may have to be increased.  That arose, as I said, twice before and on each occasion the Fianna Fáil Government met the situation by reducing the tax.  This time the situation is met by increasing the tax.  No doubt the additional allowance to the manufacturer is the same as before, but I do not know what point the Minister and the Deputies opposite are trying to make.  The manufacturer will get, through a higher price, something like £55,000 a year, which he will probably find it necessary to lose in part, to rectify the margin to the wholesalers and retailers.  But I take it it is a matter entirely for himself whether he does or not.</P>

That means that those who take soda water with a large whiskey will have their crime punished; I understand they will have to pay an extra 1d. per bottle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather important item and I wish to say a few words on it.  It is good in so far as this Supplementary Estimate by the Minister does ensure that a certain grade of pig, that is, grade A, will carry what can be regarded as a guaranteed price, so that all those farmers who send pigs to the factory, if they are grade A, will get not less than 235/- per cwt. dead weight.  For that there is required a Supplementary Estimate of £50,000, but, as well, there is required a sum of 4/7d. per pig from the producer.  Now that 4/7d. by the producer will be paid on all pigs, irrespective of whether they are grade A or otherwise.  These two things, the Estimate of £50,000 and whatever sum is gathered by the levy of 4/7d. per pig, will go to form a pool.  At the present time, and possibly during this year, that pool may not be called upon, that is, the prices received by grade A pigs exported will never drop below 235/- per cwt.  What will happen to that pool if <Col N="88" /> it is not called upon during the year or next year?  Will it be kept there to help the big industry, and if the pool is not used this year, can we expect that the levy of 4/7d. will be done away with, so that pig producers will not have, in years to come, to keep contributing to that pool?</P>
      <P>This 4/7d., together with the Supplementary Estimate, means, in effect, that two things will happen&mdash;No. 1, the producer of the pig will have to pay for its consumption across the water, and, No. 2, the general taxpayer, who will be asked to put up the £50,000 which the Minister is seeking now, will also be asked to pay so that Irish bacon will be consumed at a cheaper price across the water.  However, the subsidisation of exports is not anything new.</P>
      <P>In regard to the export on the hoof which has been allowed since 1st of May, what arrangements have been made in regard to that?  Is everyone allowed to export?  Are there any restrictions?  What restrictions have the British imposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>None.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any grading, or has the Minister considered giving a subsidy or putting a floor under the export of live pigs of a certain grade?  Will it be carried out in the same way as the export of cattle?  A further point is in connection with pigs reaching the factory which will not be graded in the A category.  We do know that over half the number of pigs going into these factories do not reach that grade.  I presume that, as is the case heretofore, it will be a case of taking the best price the farmer can get for those. That leaves the same unsatisfactory position as before, which is bad enough as far as a farmer is concerned; but what makes the matter worse is that, where the consumer is concerned, I am afraid he does not get the benefit of the farmer's loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a farmer receives a bad price for anything there, including grade B down, the consumer, the general public, does not get the advantage of it.  I <Col N="89" /> know that in most rural districts bacon is sold as bacon, and it is impossible to get the same differentiation between the various cuts as exists, say, in a city like Dublin or some of the other cities.  That means, in effect, that the housewife in the rural areas has not an opportunity of selecting the dearer cuts or the cheaper cuts, if she so wishes.  She has to take what is sitting on the counter, and usually the price she pays is the higher price, whether it is grade B or A or X.  That is something over which the Minister has no control, but he should arrange with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there should be some better system.  It is not fair that, when the farmer is so unlucky as to get a bad price, through his pig not grading up to a certain grade, the consumer should be mulcted as well.</P>
    <P>As most Deputies have pointed out during the course of this debate so far, a more satisfactory solution to the problems which have caused unsatisfactory conditions in the pig industry up to now&mdash;we have fluctuations and high prices, low prices, drops in production, gluts here and there at periods&mdash;would be that the producer of pigs, rather than having a guaranteed price for one grade, should have access to cheaper feeding stuffs.  Sometimes a person who produces pigs also produces feeding stuffs but when he buys back the pig feeding stuffs he finds that prices have gone up more than 100 per cent.  That is kept on by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The wheat-growers of this country get a certain price for their wheat.  Offals can be sold at a certain price but, through the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, they are paying a higher price for wheat offals than they should.</P>
    <P>I listened to the speeches of some of the Deputies on the Minister's Estimate and it was proved pretty clearly that pig producers lost about £600,000 on the purchase of wheat offals.  It is essential that feeding stuffs should be provided at a reasonable price; that would be a better proposition so far as pig producers and farmers are concerned.  However, it is satisfactory that, when grade A bacon is <Col N="90" /> produced, if in the future there is a slump say in the British market, farmers will not suffer a very severe loss.  That is satisfactory but it is only one step that should be taken to put the whole pig industry on a better footing.  It is one step but there are others which the Minister could take and which, in order to remedy the injustices and the chaotic state of affairs at the moment, he must take if we are to have a steady pig industry.  It is only by having a steady pig industry and steady production that we can hope to have an export market.  If we have fluctuations, if we have a glut at one time and a scarcity at another time, we cannot hope to get and to hold an export market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like more information from the Minister about the necessity for this £50,000.  I suppose the Minister hopes to spend it well and to increase pig production.  No portion is being spent on live pigs.  It is not applicable to live pigs but to grade A bacon only.  Who will grade it?  Will it be graded on this side or on the far side?  Will it be graded in our factories here and will that be accepted in England as that type of bacon and will we be paid on that grading?  Assuming a market is found for grade B or grade X, or whatever grade you like, will any subsidy be paid on that?</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has a clear mind on this at all&mdash;that he is going to export only grade A bacon and to give the factories here, at the expense of the taxpayers and the pig producer, a certain subsidy.  Would the Minister give us the date when pigs were last under 235/- a cwt.?  Would the Minister tell us when the factories had to sell bacon under that figure?  I think it was between 1948 and 1951 when the Minister was Minister for Agriculture in the first Coalition Government.  The Minister held the same portfolio then as he now holds. At their present rate, I do not see any reason for this step at all.  In my view, farmers should be levied only on the grade A pigs.  It is unfair to levy them on other than grade A pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that, at the moment, the price for pigs, other than grade A pigs, is uneconomic.  There is <Col N="91" /> a big danger in this whole matter. This Vote will not affect it but the big danger of this levy on the whole of pig production is that over 50 per cent. of the pigs going into the factory are graded other than grade A and farmers are getting a very uneconomic price for them, on the present price of feeding.  They are just getting their money out of grade A pigs and the profit is very limited.  Fifty per cent. of the pigs are not grade A pigs.  Why should there be a levy of 4/11 on a low grade pig?  I think that is wrong.  It will further depress the price that will be paid to the farmers for those uneconomic pigs, as we will call them, from his point of view.</P>
    <P>Was there a necessity or was there a good reason for bringing in grading when we have no bacon for export? If the Minister hoped to increase the pig population by bringing in grading at a time when pig production was falling in the country, he did a definite injury to the chance of increasing production by bringing in grading at the time he did.  There was no necessity for grading for the home market because bacon is sold across the counter to the consumer at whatever grade it comes into the grocer's shop.</P>
    <P>The introduction of grading would have been all right if we had a surplus of bacon for export but we do not need any boosting up from either the Exchequer or the levy on the pigs we have at the moment for selling whatever we have on the home market.  I think the Minister will have to agree with me on that.  That is an aspect of the whole matter of pig production about which the Minister cannot do anything.  He cannot help the producers in any way to enable them to have more grade A pigs going into the factory. There is little or nothing he can do about it.  He can talk about pig testing or tell the farmers to feed their pigs on barley or skimmed milk.  I suppose there is not enough skimmed milk in those parts of the country where pigs are reared to feed it to them.  Generally, the pig fattening areas are not the areas where the most skimmed milk is available.  I think <Col N="92" /> that will be shown from the returns of pig production in the larger dairying areas.  Pig production in those areas is much lower than it is in areas where there is little or no skimmed milk available for feeding to the pigs. I suggest to the Minister that this carcase levy is being imposed at an inopportune time.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not there is any definite sign of an increase in pig production at the moment.  I am afraid there is not, because the price of feeding stuffs is very high.  This grading will have a detrimental effect. In its own way, it is preventing a chance to increase pig production.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say because if I spoke of mill offals on this Vote I might be ruled out of order.  The Minister must know fairly definitely by now that the increase in the price of mill offals reduced the number of pigs available in this country by 20 per cent. in the first 15 or 16 months of his term of office.  In that instance the Minister, who is supposed to look after the interests of the farmers of this country, deliberately surrendered his rights to the Minister for Finance in order, I suppose, that flour and bread might be subsidised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes they did.  It has been most eloquently argued that the increases in the price of mill offals and feeding stuffs had operated purely to exploit pig producers who could get only 235/- per cwt. for their grade A pigs.  The plain fact is that at the present moment, grade A pigs are fetching from 250/- to 260/- a cwt. at the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, why the levy of 4/7d?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All the history of pig production in this country has been that every Fianna Fáil órator who ever got up to speak in public proclaims it to be the inevitable future that when prices reach a remunerative level, if production increases, the bottom falls out of the price.  Here is the guarantee that, no matter how far pig production is increased, the price cannot fall below a certain level for grade A pigs.  The whole purpose of this scheme is to enable us to say to the farmers that if they produce enough pigs to provide us with a substantial export surplus, the price will not fall below a certain level.  A number of people apprehend that the price will <Col N="94" /> collapse if the production goes up.  The scheme guarantees the farmers that if they increase the number of pigs they produce by 2,000,000, it does not matter; they will still get not less than 235/- a cwt. for their grade A pigs.  Deputy Allen asks why not make it 250/- a cwt. The answer is we cannot afford it.  We are back in a buyer's market.  Up to a fortnight ago, the pigs and bacon agreement I made with the British Government in 1951 was in operation. That has come to an end and now we are in competition with the whole world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did pigs fall by 20 per cent. in numbers under that agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are in competition with the whole world and we have to reassure our producers that, while adapting themselves to that situation, the Government are prepared to ensure that, whatever other Governments do on the Continent, they will not be asked to accept a price lower than 235/- a cwt.  No foreign producers will be allowed to create a situation on the foreign market in which we trade calculated seriously to prejudice our farmers while they produce grade A bacon.  If there is no danger in the outside market the scheme can do no harm.  If there is danger, the farmers have the guarantee that, upon whomso ever it impinges, it cannot impinge upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham&mdash;I do not blame him, for he knows nothing about it&mdash; cheerfully envisages a situation in which there will be no draw upon this fund.  He says the necessity might not arise in the present year or next year. That is a type of optimism characteristic of East Donegal which does Deputy Cunningham credit.  I know that, when you are dealing with youth, it is good to have the optimistic viewpoint and to think that every cloud has a silver lining; but I think Deputies Allen and Walsh will be able to tell him that the possibility of this fund not being called upon is so remote as to make it almost unnecessary to consider.  However, if it does arise that we do accumulate a growing fund on which we are not called upon to <Col N="95" /> draw, I assure the Deputy I shall be very glad.</P>

That was a fraud and a racket operated by Deputy Corry who is as cute as a Christian.  The fact that prices of pollard, bran and mill offals are so high is related to world prices. The proof of that is that if Deputy Cunningham, Deputy Allen, Deputy <Col N="96" /> Walsh or Deputy Collins can buy bran or pollard cheaper anywhere in the world they can bring it into this country freely, and many are bringing in pollard at the present time.</P>

      <P>I think we shall get a good production.  The essential barley to produce in this country is the barley that will not have to pass through the <Col N="97" /> millers' hands.  Deputy Cunningham is talking about the man who grows barley, sells it and then buys it back again.  There is the heart of the evil. Why does he sell it and buy it back although it costs him 100 per cent. more when he buys it back?  That is an exaggeration, I agree, but the man who sells barley and then buys back compound feeding stuff is inviting the miller, the sack manufacturer, the wholesaler, the transport company, to take a handful of feathers out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does he not grow the barley, grind it on his own farm and feed it to his own pigs?  What is the use of arguing that we ought to have a situation in which we emphasise the desirability of doing the very thing to which Deputy Cunningham referred, growing barley, selling it and buying it back again?  The man who does that is losing a very substantial part of the profits he ought to get.  I want him to produce and grind his own barley and only in so far as he is producing more pigs than his land is capable of feeding, in that event and in that event only, to buy feeding stuffs from abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to make my speech?  I allowed him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely ask the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is quite simple.  If the farmer who is producing this extra barley is to get the full return for it, he should feed it himself. If he does not feed it himself, then some other farmer has to buy it.  The problem is, if you want to fix a price of 48/- for surplus barley produced by the barley grower in Kilkenny, Laois and East Cork, who has to pay it? The man who has to pay the 48/-, or the end price based on 48/-, is the pig <Col N="98" /> feeder in West Cork, West Donegal, in Mayo and Galway&mdash;the smallest farmers in this country.  What I want the small farmer to do is to grow his own barley and to purchase only the requirements over and above that which his own land is capable of producing.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to some of the farmers who are at present growing large acreages of barley that they might with advantage try to keep more pigs and feed more pigs.  The ideal situation from my point of view is that every farmer should grow all the coarse grains he requires on his own holding.  There will be some enterprising farmers who will feed more pigs than the number for which their own land is capable of growing grain and they will buy in the most advantageous market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My barley is worth as much, pound for pound, as what the Minister brings from across the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason I have felt able to say that in the situation in which we find ourselves now, while the ideal is that the farmer should grow whatever barley he requires to feed his own pigs, it will be possible to ensure that those who grow a surplus will not get less than 40/- a barrel for it.  What we must bear in mind in regard to the relatively well-to-do farmer who growing a surplus of 200 barrels, and from that up, with a minimum guaranteed price, is that it is the small farmer who is feeding pigs who has to pay it.  You must try to weigh up the relative claims of those two farmers in trying to secure a guaranteed price for surplus barley production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Give the Irish farmer the world price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Walsh knows as well as I do that to give the Irish farmer the world price for his barley would be very poor inducement to him to produce barley at the present time. You must bear in mind that barley produced here has to be dried, stored and transported.  By the time you have paid 40/- a barrel for it, it will <Col N="99" /> always compare in quality but rarely in price with barley available from foreign sources.  There was a time when the disparity in price between barley grown here for sale and the price at which barley was available from foreign sources was so wide that you could not contemplate asking the pig producer here to carry it because it would have put him out of all competitive capacity as opposed to his rivals in foreign markets, but now with increased yields of feeding barley varieties, I am not without hope that it may be possible largely to substitute barley of Irish production for imported coarse grains.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the ridiculous situation arose in which the miller was buying back barley from him in January, having been paid for drying it and having been paid for storing it. The millers then compelled him to sell it back for substantially less than he paid for it and he lost a quarter of a million pounds in one year.  That kind of thing helps nobody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister prove it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said all he is going to be let say.  The aim I have is to try to build up a situation in which we will be able substantially to substitute home-grown barley for imported coarse grains but, in doing that, we must keep plainly before our minds the relative claims of the comparatively well-to-do farmer who grows it and the comparatively poor farmer who consumes it.  The price of pollard is strictly related to the world price.  The test of that is that anybody can import all the pollard he can get anywhere <Col N="100" /> and certain persons are doing it.  No mill in Ireland could get an excess price for pollard at the present time, because people can bring it in from anywhere, and if they could buy it cheaper anywhere else, they would. Some people find that they can buy it as cheap, or fractionally cheaper, and so they do bring it in.</P>
      <P>The situation can arise in which they want pollard in Cork; there is pollard in Dublin, and the net result is that the transport charge from Dublin to Cork makes Dublin pollard dearer in Cork than the price at which they can get pollard from Argentina by sea and so they bring it into Cork.</P>
      <P>Anybody can bring pollard from any part of the world and if he can get it cheaper than the price at which it can be had in Ireland, he is quite free to bring it in in any quantity.  That is the only means of deciding what price should obtain for mill offals in this country.  That is the only criterion that applies&mdash;that the world price&mdash;no more&mdash;can be charged.</P>
      <P>An argument can be made that you ought to subsidise pollard and sell it at less than the world price.  Does anybody suggest that we ought to subsidise pollard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Walsh should not ask such an idiotic question. <Col N="101" /> Deputy Walsh knows full well that, under the Pigs and Bacon Agreement with Great Britain, we had a guaranteed price for pork and a guaranteed price for bacon, that we equated these two prices and so were able to pay a wholly artificial price and that that enabled us to export pork and bacon. The Deputy knows that perfectly well. I do not expect some of the other Deputies to know it, but he knows that that enabled us to maintain prices in this country for pigs out of all relation to world prices.  That was done under the Trade Agreement of 1951, negotiated by me.  It was a particularly fortunate and profitable agreement.  That is the reason it was possible to do that up to the end of that agreement.  Now we have an open market and this scheme is designed to ensure that there will be no collapse of that.</P>

It is a very alluring proposition and I can well see how certain people not familiar with the trade might be wholly deceived by it, that is, that there are grade A, B and C pigs but there is no grade A, B and C bacon in shops.  No one can tell with certainty what prices are obtaining in the shops. I do know&mdash;this information is available to anybody who wants to consult the price lists of the bacon curers which are available to anybody who wants to get them&mdash;that, as of 12th May, one factory is offering leanest bacon at 340/-, lean at 328/-, medium at 308/- and stout at 290/-.  There is a differential of 50/- a cwt. between the leanest bacon offered and the stout bacon.  That is a much wider disparity than the disparity which exists between the top price offered for pigs and the lowest price offered for pigs.</P>

If you offer stout bacon in any grocer's or provision shop in this country at the present time, with the exception of a very few isolated places, nobody will buy it and the people will go to another shop until they find the quality of bacon that they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great difficulty is that to dispose of fat bacon is rapidly becoming impossible.  When Deputy Allen asks why do we not guarantee grades A, B and C, the answer is: for the simple reason that there is no market for <Col N="103" /> grade C.  There is no use in my going to the farmers and saying: &ldquo;I can guarantee a market for grades A, B and C.&rdquo;  The time is rapidly coming when grade C will be unsaleable. Grade B bacon is hard to sell and, in our extern markets, very hard to sell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is the most contemptible kind of sabotage, because, of course, it is true that when people hear Deputy Allen, Deputy Walsh and Deputy Corry saying that kind of thing, some of them will believe it and they will shrug their shoulders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The plain fact is that money is to be made out of the production of pigs at that price.  The plain fact is that if farmers will collaborate with the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Commission in getting the right type of sow, if they will consult their agricultural instructor as to the best method of feeding their pigs and will ration the pigs within the last month or six weeks before they bring them to the factory to a maximum of 6 to 6½ lb. of meal and sufficient skim milk, the <Col N="104" /> percentage of grade A pigs they produce will steadily rise.</P>
      <P>I met a man quite recently who complained bitterly that the bonham he had got had graded C and when I asked him how he fed it, in perfect good faith, he said he rationed it until six weeks before he brought it to the factory and then fed it all it would eat. Of course, that man had just got the whole business upside down.  He had just thrown his money away, because whatever strain or quality of pig he had, if he rationed it for the first five weeks and then overfed it for the last five weeks, he was bound to get a grade C pig or worse.  If he had reversed the process, the possibility of his getting a grade A pig would have been increased substantially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would greatly help if both of us were telling them the same thing.  I know it is in the power of Fianna Fáil to hinder this effort to produce more pigs, but it is a criminally irresponsible thing for them to do. They know that while they were in office they never attempted to do what Deputy Walsh now advocates.  They know that while they were in office the <Col N="105" /> pig population practically disappeared and that it came back again under the pigs and bacon agreement we made.  I despair of getting from Fianna Fáil any constructive help in expanding agricultural production, because I believe they much prefer to play politics. I do not believe, however, that the people will believe them, that the people are so innocent as to swallow the rubbish about the price of pollard.</P>
      <P>The acid test as to whether the price of pollard and mill offals is equitable is the fact that they would be imported freely by people, if they could buy them cheaper anywhere else in the world at the present time; the acid test is that the price of grade A pigs is ranging between 250/- and 260/- per cwt.  The purpose of this scheme is not to fix the price, but to assure the producers that, whatever way the market goes, the price they will receive for grade A bacon will not fall below 235/-.  The acid test is that the price of our feeding stuffs is £3 per ton below the world price which is likely to go up still further before it comes down again.</P>

      <P>Many shopkeepers know that if they stock stout bacon they will not be able to sell it because the people want lean bacon.  If you offer them fat bacon at any discount, people will not buy it, except in the West where there is a taste for hard cured bacon, which is on sale at a price substantially below that ruling for the mild cured or smoked bacon.</P>
      <P>The last thing I want to mention is Deputy Allen's query as to why grading should be introduced before there was an exportable surplus.  The answer to that is that it had to be because the pig and bacon industry will not survive, except on grading, and the sooner we make it clear that the pig and bacon industry will not survive unless we come to the position in which we have grade A pigs in the vast majority, a relative sprinkling of grade B and no grade C&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Col N="106" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the better for the industry. That must be the indissoluble basis associated with the future of the industry.  It is rendering a grave disservice to the farmer of this country to tell him there is any future for the pig industry except on that basis.  The reason I introduced grading was that I knew we must raise the standard of the pig produced in this country if we are to maintain an export trade, much less expand it.  It would be impossible for us to hold our position in the British market, except on the basis of the grade A pig.  We must bear that in mind.  The Danes are a different kind of people from us.  They are quite prepared to eat grade B and grade C and to send all their grade A bacon to Britain.  Our people will not.  I have often been reminded how much more efficient and how wiser the Danes are. I am not so sure they are; I am not so sure our people are not right.</P>
      <P>The Danes, however, are disciplined into this way.  From the point of view of national economics, that may be a good proposition, but it must be borne in mind that the same people eat margarine and export their butter. Our people will not do that; our people eat their butter and only when they have eaten all the butter they want, and all the Irish butter at that, will they allow the balance to be exported. Remember what we are competing against.  The Danish people export their butter and eat margarine; our people not only insist on consuming butter but demand that they be afforded a full supply of Irish butter. It is costing us £250,000 a year in order to indulge the desire of our people to eat Irish butter.  If, in years of plenty, we exported our surplus butter and, in years of scarcity, imported New Zealand butter, we would be avoiding storage charges and I believe it would mean a saving to us of £250,000.  That may be self-indulgence to the point of extravagance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Many rational beings say that we pay £250,000 a year on the storage of butter, in order to ensure not only that we have butter, but that <Col N="107" /> we will have Irish butter during the 12 months of the year, instead of selling our butter during the season of plenty and purchasing it from New Zealand in the season of scarcity.  Our people will not accept that proposition.  The Danes export all their grade A bacon and eat grades B and C.  We have got to face that and our objective must lead to the elimination of grade C and other grades and to maximise the output of grade A and B, aiming ultimately at eliminating grade B.  I do not deny that is an objective which, we must realise, is relatively remote.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham asked if there would be any restriction on the export of live pigs.  None, except this: our live pigs going into Great Britain do not qualify for the price bounty which is available to British producers, but I do not want to mislead the House&mdash;I do not think at the present time that the prospects of live pig exports are very good, but I think it is reasonable to suggest that that possibility should have a stabilising influence on the market as a whole. I do not altogether despair of the situation arising in which pigs of grades B and C might find&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just a sidewind by Deputy T. Lynch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very ignorant interruption.  It is possible that might develop into an export trade, as in the years gone by, but as we have not had exports of live pigs since 1939 or earlier, the question is whether or not the market for these grades survives.  If it does, I believe that those who deal in live pigs will find it, but I do not want to hold out any prospects, from the information available to me, of that being very valuable, at least in our present circumstances.  I am quite certain, if there is a trade to be found there, those long associated with the live pig export trade will find it, and <Col N="108" /> if they do&mdash;if they are able to find it&mdash; they will be doing a very great service to the pig producers of this country and they have my best wishes for success in any efforts they make.</P>
      <P>I believe this scheme holds good promise of removing from the whole pig production industry the great hazard that heretofore has habitually hampered it in its development by removing absolutely the possibility of any collapse in price.  And I do not think we should underestimate one other thing which it does and to which I wish to direct the attention of Deputies who may desire to see this trade expand: it provides, for the first time, a buffer grade.  I do not deny I have always felt it a hardship on a man who brought in a pig which was in every respect grade A, except in that one respect that it exceeded the maximum weight prescribed by 1 lb. or 2 lb., and who found himself cut 10/- or 15/- per cwt.  To meet that situation, we have created a new buffer grade called grade B (1), so that the man who has a grade A pig which exceeds the maximum of 1 cwt. 2 qrs., but does not exceed that maximum by more than 7 lb., will be cut no more than about 5/- per cwt. in the price of his pig.  I think that will help very greatly those who are honestly trying to produce the right grade of pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I believe this scheme will commend itself on its own merits to the people, but I would welcome the assistance of all those who are prepared to help on every side of the House in telling those with whom their opinion carries weight that it is worth while feeding pigs now on barley and skimmed milk, and that those who will make most out of this plan will be the pig producers who grow their own barley and have their own skimmed milk.  If those who have not these commodities will buy the barley from their neighbours and grind it themselves, they will be one degree better off than the man who buys expensive compound feeding stuffs.  I would recommend them to aim at increased production on barley and skimmed milk&mdash;barley, preferably of their own production, but if not, purchased from their neighbours, <Col N="109" /> directly if possible, and then ground in their local mill or in their own farmyard by grinder or hammer-mill, if they have rural electrification&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If neither of these two courses is available, they should depend on pure barley meal rather than compound foods which, I think, with skimmed milk are unnecessary. It is certainly true that, where skimmed milk is not available, protein feeding stuffs must be supplemented, and in those circumstances it may be best for a farmer to depend on a reliable type of compound-feeding, lest his own efforts to combine minerals and proteins with barley might prove inadequate.  But for the generality, I would ask them to use barley meal supplemented with one lb. of salt per cwt. of barley, and the skimmed milk available from their own creameries.  I would ask them to expand pig production indefinitely, in the certainty that there is no possibility of a collapse in the price from this time forward.  I would ask them to do it in the knowledge that they are benefiting themselves&mdash;which is all important&mdash;and in this particular case, they will be doing the additional valuable work of helping the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Vote previously, I tried to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that, under the sub-head dealing with minor relief schemes and rural improvement schemes, the memoranda he published did not really reflect any increase.  I tried to point out that the increase shown was more or less <Col N="110" /> absorbed in salary increases, and that is something that we all deplore very much, because this rural improvement scheme which makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers, such as small drainage schemes, bridges, and the construction or repair of accommodation roads to farm houses, lands or bogs, has been of great value and great help in every part of the country, irrespective of the employment position.  We know that State grants varying from 75 per cent. of the cost, in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of £18 and over, to 95 per cent., in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of below £6, are available, subject to the balance of the cost being met by the benefiting land holders.</P>
      <P>That is indeed a most popular scheme and a scheme that has given great service and great accommodation for farmers, especially in the mountainy areas, but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is well aware that that type of scheme is most successful, if you like, from the point of view of people who are looking for the development of bog roads or accommodation roads. The safest guarantee they have is that rural improvement scheme.  Going back for many years, we had minor relief schemes, but that type of work is being somewhat retarded, because we understand grants are made available on the strength or incidence of unemployment in the division or rural district where such a minor scheme is needed.  The people who are keenly interested have, to some extent, satisfied themselves that if they want to go ahead and get suitable accommodation roads through their lands or holdings, the most effective way of doing it is through the rural improvement schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that other speakers raised a point which is very important, and the officials in the Office of Public Works are fully conversant with the position.  It is necessary to have the consent of all landowners through whose lands the particular road is being made.  In some instances you might have a group of four or five farmers living on an accommodation road sorely in need of repair.  You might also have one or two living on <Col N="111" /> the outer edge nearest to the county road or main road who would not think they would get much benefit by the making of a new accommodation road.</P>
    <P>In County Limerick schemes, for which grants are available by the Office of Public Works, are being operated through our county engineer and deputy engineers.  I understand it is different in Galway, Kerry and elsewhere. We find that, when the deputy engineer comes out with this form he has to get signed by all the farmers, in some cases we have this type of fellow to whom I refer.  I think &ldquo;Roddy the Rover&rdquo; once described him as an &ldquo;aingiseór&rdquo;.  Notwithstanding the fact that he is not being asked to contribute one iota towards the grant being made available, be it a 95 per cent. or 75 per cent. grant, he refuses to sign, and there and then the whole work is held up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>We have our own particular name for him, too, in the County Limerick.  He acts the dog in the manger.  He is not being asked to contribute anything towards the particular road and is only being asked for his consent which, in some cases, might mean that a foot and a half would be taken off his ditch for widening purposes in order to make the road to the prescribed specification laid down by the Parliamentary Secretary's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too bad that such a thing can happen.  We all recognise that individuals have their rights under the Constitution but I think it is an abuse of those rights that a man in any particular area can refuse to put his name to the document and so prevent his neighbours further in receiving any benefits which might be made available. I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell me if it is possible that that regulation could be waived or changed in his Department, and that, where a number of people contribute towards the amount allocated for a rural improvements scheme, any such person will not be allowed to obstruct or interfere.  He would be doing a great service to the people throughout the country if that regulation <Col N="112" /> could be waived, so preventing this person at the outer edge of the road, who may be jealous or selfish in regard to the improvements being made further down the road, from holding up the scheme and preventing his neighbours from availing of the grants which are made available.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when this Vote was being discussed.  I want to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that we are not at all pleased with the stand of his Office in this case.  As I mentioned, speaking on this Vote on Thursday last, we are not getting any increase for that type of work in rural areas.  Those of us who come from such areas, where you have considerable density of small farmers and where possibly in some instances the land has only been reclaimed, are aware that accommodation roads are sorely needed and that, if those roads are not made available, many farmers cannot avail of the grants offering under the land project scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I would say that I am disappointed that more money was not provided, notwithstanding the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary is a rural Deputy himself and knows how vital it is, especially to small farmers, that at least, after 36 odd years of freedom, they should have decent roads into their farmsteads.  I do not know exactly what the position is but I am of opinion that many of the schemes we put up from West Limerick will probably have to be deferred.  I do not know how the schemes are allocated <Col N="113" /> or if the decision is made in the order of need, irrespective of the county areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to deal on this Vote with only one particular matter. It is a very important matter and was the subject of a question I asked the Parliamentary Secretary last week in connection with the rural improvements schemes.  Under the minor employment schemes, the local authority and the Board of Works can come together to do a job; but under the rural improvement schemes that cannot be done.  I do not know what the regulation is but we have found for the past number of years in County Cork, if the county surveyor makes any attempt to devote money towards helping out farmers in the 25 per cent. they have to pay, that we cannot do it. This problem has become more and more urgent according as mechanisation is being introduced on our land.</P>
      <P>The day of the boreen has gone. The man living down the boreen at the present time has no hope of getting his combine harvester or any machinery on to his land.  From that particular aspect, the problem is becoming daily more and more urgent.  Had we any co-operation between the Office of Public Works, the Department of Local Government and the local authority concerned the present difficulty could be very easily overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> A letter has been sent to the Parliamentary Secretary asking him to send down an official from his Office.  A letter has also been sent to the Minister for Local Government, despite the fact that he said no representations had been made to him.  Two letters left the offices of the county council on the one day.  One was sent to the Minister for Local Government.  Surely one official out of the Office of Public Works could be spared for a day, or even a couple of hours, to attend a road meeting of the Cork County Council in order to go into this matter and have it straightened out.  Under the system we have in Cork of private members' proposals, a certain amount of money is set aside each year for work of this description.</P>
    <P>We have got some assistance from the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am grateful for it, in order to help us to get over the difficulty in relation to one road this year, a road which has been a problem for us for a number of years, namely, the Ballywilliam road. The Parliamentary Secretary was kind enough to give a grant of £1,000 for it, but it took £1,450 out of the private members' proposals.  We are now going ahead with the work.  If that job were done under a rural improvement scheme, the Parliamentary Secretary would have paid £1,875 instead of £1,000.  There are three farmers living on the road and, therefore, the grant was 75 per cent.  The farmers concerned will have to contribute £625. There is the snag.  Had we been able to do that work under a rural improvements scheme we would have been able to give a portion of that £625 from the county council as a grant and thereby save the unfortunate farmers to some extent.  As things are at present, this problem will go on <i>in sæcula sæculorum.</i>  If my suggestion were adopted, instead of being able to do only one road, we would be able to do five.</P>
    <P>These unfortunate farmers are in the position that they have been contributing for the past 50 or 60 years for everyone else's road.  They have been contributing to the tarred road over which the motorist drives.  Yet, when they want the combine harvester or other machinery on their farms, they <Col N="115" /> are told that it cannot be brought in because of the state of the road.  The suburbs of Cork, as we know, are spreading out every year and quite a number of these roads are now being turned over to the county council for upkeep and repair.  The farmers have to pay for these roads, roads used by a section of our community which has only become ratepayers over the last few years.  The farmers have to pay for these roads and continue to suffer the disability themselves of not being able to mechanise their farms or use modern machinery on them.  I will see that at our next meeting of the county council another request is sent to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Minister for Local Government.  Let us get together then to solve the problem. All that is needed is what is preached here morning, noon and night &mdash;a little co-operation between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Are there any minor employment schemes available for the Aghada district in Cork?  Because of what has happened in connection with the oil refinery, there is a great deal of unemployment there at the moment.  Now unemployment is something to which that portion of the county has not been accustomed.  The majority of the unemployed are good farm labourers who were engaged on the land and who now find themselves out of employment because the land has been taken over for the oil refinery.  At the time they thought that this would only last for a month or two and that they would then get work in the refinery.  Now they find the refinery is as far away as ever.  The land has been let to the farmers on the 11-months system.  If there are any employment schemes in the Minister's office for that area, I would appeal to him to speed them up. If there are not any available, I will see that he is provided with some.  The position is a sorrowful one.  The problem is an urgent one.  These men are not accustomed to unemployment.  They have always been good workers and hard workers and their present position should be eased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy J.J. Collins dealt with the point in relation to objectors.  I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that we had one case recently in the Cahirciveen district where one man objected unless the grant was allocated in a certain way.  Four other people residing further along the roadway tried to avail of the scheme, and this man, who had some differences with those people, would not give his consent, unless the work stopped just at the end of his holding.  Even though that case was pointed out to his Office, they still sanctioned the carrying through of the work.  If the men living further in apply for a grant, which they will later, this man will not consent.  They cannot get out because his holding is between the end of their area and the main road.  That certainly is a hardship.</P>
      <P>I know what the Office will say about it.  They will say: &ldquo;This may end in legal proceedings and is a matter in which we will not interfere.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I submit that, in the first instance the Parliamentary Secretary's Office should not have given sanction to any grant until the position was clarified, because the people inside this man are isolated for all time. Through his hatred or ill-feeling for them he will not allow an extension of this work.  Therefore, I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that in all cases in future, the background of the proposal should be thoroughly examined before sanction is given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They were prepared to contribute.  The area is close to Cahirlenihan, Cahirciveen, and it is a serious matter for the other people, because two of them have received sanction from the Department of Agriculture for draining their holdings, <Col N="117" /> but there is no outlet and they cannot avail of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Going back to the other point, I shall be very brief.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what will happen, in regard to the turf generating station in Cahirciveen, about the repair of bog roads in the district.  I should like to have that position clarified once and for all.  In reply to a question of mine, the Parliamentary Secretary informed me that the matter was under consideration, but I am now informed that it is a matter for the E.S.B.  I should like to know is it altogether a matter for the E.S.B., or will the Office of Public Works provide any of the expenditure, or what will be the arrangements. The case I should like to make is that bog road development and bog drainage will be very important to the people down there in so far as the production of turf for the generating station is concerned.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary and his Office, in the ordinary course of events, not have to allocate moneys for bog drainage and bog road repairs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that at the outset, but the point I am trying to make is this: will the Parliamentary Secretary's Office at any stage contribute to that type of work? Supposing that the Department of Industry and Commerce and the E.S.B. decide to put certain development works there, will the net result be that they will ask the Office of Public Works to put up a proportion of the money, or is it a question that the Parliamentary Secretary at this stage could inform me that it is altogether a matter for the E.S.B. and the Department of Industry and Commerce? I am asking that now for my <Col N="118" /> own information and for the benefit of the people who are requesting me and other representatives to find out, and to make the case for the development of the roads in question, so that we will know where we are.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Office will be as sympathetic as they can in the circumstances.  If it is a matter for other Departments, I am satisfied, but I am not quite clear on it at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to let the occasion pass without saying something on this Estimate, which is very near to the hearts of all rural Deputies, particularly those from the western seaboard.  First, I want to complain with regard to the amount allocated to this important Estimate. I have not the Book of Estimates before me, but I understand that it is exactly the same amount as last year, which is totally inadequate to cope with even a fraction of the useful proposals being put forward.  When we take into account increases in wages granted since last year, we find that the amount in actual work represents a considerable decrease.  It will be capable of covering only a section of the proposals dealt with last year for the same amount of money, because of the increase in wages to the workers and in the salaries of the personnel administering this important Estimate. I think the total amount granted for this year could be absorbed by proposals from West Donegal alone, and yet not a single unnecessary proposal would be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should at this stage pay tribute to the various officials at No. 30 Earlsfort Terrace, who have, to my mind, a most difficult task and always show the greatest possible courtesy towards those of us who frequently inflict ourselves upon them in endeavouring to snatch out of the bag one or two of the many proposals which are lodged there time and again.  It is quite correct to say that it is a major portion of a rural Deputy's work nowadays to look after the roads which are, we may say, nobody's business&mdash;roads for which the county council will not accept responsibility and yet are important accommodation roads, which will remain <Col N="119" /> unattended to, unless we can provide some extra money under this heading in future.  We have literally thousands of miles of such roads in Donegal alone, and, although recent legislation permits local bodies to take over such roads, the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that no local authority is anxious to take on extra commitments at the moment, particularly in relation to roads.</P>
    <P>These roads, I am afraid, must remain the responsibility of the Special Employment Schemes Office. If anything I could say here in support of what has been said by other Deputies by way of appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to try by some means or other to extract some money from the Department of Finance under this heading will have a beneficial effect, then the time devoted to speaking on this Estimate will not be wasted.  Otherwise there is very little use in dealing with details or with what could be or should be done in relation to the Estimate under discussion.</P>
    <P>I think the rural improvements scheme is one of the best schemes that has ever been undertaken in this country.  The contribution which is asked from the interested parties is sufficient to prove the <i>bona fides</i> of the proposal.  It is sufficient to prove the earnestness of the people who are looking to have the work carried out and, at the same time, it takes a certain amount of weight off the Exchequer.  I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would endeavour to provide more moneys under this heading in future.  A short while ago we received some information which was not good in relation to expenditure on roads in the future.  We have learned that the Road Fund, as such, will be raided.</P>

      <P>The gloomy outlook for road workers generally, the depression that has set in in the rural areas, the problem of steep emigration and, particularly, the main issue of the vast amount of road mileage which must remain unattended to unless the Special Employment Schemes Office undertake responsibility for the work &mdash;surely all these matters deserve special consideration.  Before I pass on to the subject of special employment schemes I should like to suggest, with regard to rural improvement schemes, that&mdash;even if new legislation were necessary&mdash;it is very desirable that local bodies should be allowed to contribute to such schemes.  There are many instances where the county council would be prepared and could be expected to bear responsibility for the local contribution but I understand that, legally, it is not permissible.  In my view, that is an anomaly which could be remedied, even if it meant the introduction of amending legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wanted to make was that the list in regard to rural improvement schemes is issued sufficiently early to have the work commenced before the Christmas season. Why is there delay in getting the work going?  It very often happens that the time fizzles out before some of these schemes are carried out.  The principal purpose of the minor employment schemes is to give employment at lean times to those people who require it most.  I object to the system obtaining in some areas whereby the schemes are actually held over to supplement the work of regular county council workers who could quite easily pass over that lean period by drawing on their insurance contributions.  The schemes are held over for an unduly long time.  There is reason to complain about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another complaint I want to make is that the labour content of these schemes is very often curtailed by reason of expensive county council material being drawn to the job.  That material has already provided employment for council workers.  Machinery in the haulage of that material is brought to the minor employment scheme in question with the result that at least 75 per cent. of the cost of the scheme&mdash;and sometimes, to my personal knowledge, the percentage is higher&mdash;goes on the material and haulage with only a 25 per cent. labour content in the scheme which was originally designed for the purpose of giving employment.  I do not think that is fair.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if that aspect of the minor employment scheme grants could be investigated in the coming season. <Col N="123" /> He will find that the complaints I make are genuine.  The labour content is seriously curtailed by the use of machinery, haulage and the provision of county council material&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that, in some counties, we are taking it over ourselves and working as best we can. Several counties have been taken over &mdash;and I hope Donegal will be one in the near future&mdash;for the simple reason, as Deputy Brennan says, we had to send down the money to the county council, who carried out the work and had nothing else to do at the end of the year.  In the counties we have taken over, and I hope Galway will be taken over, too, we are carrying out our own schemes with our own workers at the most suitable time, independently of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would certainly get over the difficulty about which I was complaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Deputy was in the House in 1949 when I started that for that very purpose, and from that side of the House and from that Party, I was scurrilously attacked for doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They probably had good reason, too.  If there was a shortage of engineers it could hold up the work.  Unless engineers are to be more readily available from the Board of Works for this work than they are for other work which the Board is carrying out, there are going to be delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to refer is the construction of bridges. The construction of bridges under this scheme is taboo, because the labour content is low.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider that question, because sometimes the construction of a bridge can be of such utility as to far outweigh any expenditure or any shortage of labour content <Col N="124" /> which may impair the chance of the scheme being taken up.  There are many cases where villages and townlands are completely isolated just because they have not had the necessary moneys to provide a bridge across the stream or the river which maroons them from the main road and, in some cases, from civilisation.  We have had many cases where children have to risk their lives crossing unsuitable bridges over flooded streams and rivers in order to get to school.  Frequently, I have had the stereotyped reply, pointing out that the cost of this work would be out of proportion to the benefit, because the labour content would be so low that the carrying out of the job would not be warranted.  I know that is one of the things which prevent work on bridges from being carried out, but perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could undertake to reconsider that regulation in future and allow bridges to be undertaken in greater numbers and allow many of the proposals turned down in the past to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The question of bog development under minor employment schemes is sometimes fairly difficult to understand. I never could fully appreciate where the Land Commission leaves off responsibility and the Board of Works takes it up.  At one time, I believed that new roads through bogs were entirely the responsibility of the Land Commission and that the repair of them was left to the mercy of the Minor Employment Schemes Office. Now I find that it is possible for the Minor Employment Schemes Office to carry out the construction of roads, as well as drainage, and that this work can be carried out at any time of the year.  I think I am right in saying that the amount of money allocated for that portion of the Vote&mdash;bog development &mdash;is infinitesimally small, at least so far as I am aware in regard to my own county.  The proportion of the money expended on bog development there must be a very small fraction of the whole.  One would expect a much greater Vote for that heading alone.</P>
    <P>Some of the speakers referred to the difficulty of getting rural improvement schemes proposals going, where one or <Col N="125" /> two of the interested parties are not willing to contribute or to sign for the work.  I think every Deputy has had that experience.  If it can be overcome without unnecessarily interfering with the rights of any individual, I think it would be a step in the right direction. Sometimes a person will object to a job being carried out for no other reason other than it is going to benefit some of his neighbours more than it does himself, or because he does not like to see somebody getting employment or for some other petty reason.  We should be able to override these objections, which frequently result in the work being held up and in many cases not being carried out at all.  If we could have greater power for the carrying out of rural improvement schemes, it would have the support of every Deputy in the House.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in regard to rural improvement schemes, particularly in the congested areas.  I think it is only fair that there should be a stipulation that those contributing will get preference in the employment available in carrying out the work.  I think a liberal view should be taken and, if it is at a time when unemployment is not so high in the area, all other things being equal, the local engineer should give preference, and is usually prone to give preference, to those who contribute towards the scheme.  I think that should be stipulated as a condition.  It would certainly help in many of the poorer areas in getting people to subscribe, if they felt they were likely to earn back in employment the moneys which they contributed towards the scheme.  They would be more willing and more disposed to contribute towards the scheme.</P>
    <P>I think that in some cases labour is actually accepted in lieu of the subscription. That is a very desirable thing.  The Parliamentary Secretary is shaking his head, but I thought there were cases where persons who could not contribute were allowed to give their contribution in work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be one <Col N="126" /> very good way out, and would meet the case of the man who could not actually afford to pay his share of the contribution; and that would be meeting exactly the same point as I made with regard to giving preference in employment.  If he were allowed to contribute a week or a fortnight in work, instead of the actual cash, it would be an easy way towards having some of the work carried out.</P>
      <P>The principal thing I wish to say is that the Parliamentary Secretary will justify his existence in this important office by extracting from the Department of Finance about three times the amount of money for the Vote in order to do something worth while on what I consider the most important type of work that his Office can undertake, from every point of view, from the point of view of utility, service to the people and the employment it provides; and also because it steps in when no other local body or no other section is responsible.  In fact, it is the only means by which these jobs may be carried out, and it must be agreed by all to be a most necessary work.  The only fault one can find with it now is the inadequacy of the moneys provided for carrying it on.  I strongly urge that the House be provided with a much more generous Estimate in future, in order to maintain and put into usable condition the thousands of miles of accommodation roads which otherwise will remain unusable or derelict.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary intervened in the debate to which Deputy Brennan was making his contribution, he indicated that in certain counties the administration of this Vote <Col N="127" /> for employment and emergency schemes was being carried out direct by his office.  I am just asking myself is the game worth the candle?  Does the amount of money being expended justify a direct service from the central Government?  I contend it does not.  The amount of money is the same this year as it was last year.  The amount of money provided in the Book of Estimates is the same as it was in 1955-56 and in that time there has been a considerable increase in the wages of the men employed on these schemes.  Therefore, the amount of work that will be done for the rural areas will be much less.</P>
    <P>In his speech introducing this Vote, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the need for the Vote for the purpose of relieving rural unemployment. This Vote does more than that and should do more than that.  It adds to the much needed amenities of the rural population.  It makes their homes accessible for themselves and for visitors there and it does not do it rapidly enough from my point of view, and from the point of view of the majority of people in this House.  Consequently, the idea of administering this scheme from the central authority is altogether wrong when it is not done in a big, national way.  The amount of money involved here out of the total receipts is very small indeed and the number of weeks' work that will be given to the unemployed in rural Ireland will be much less in this financial year than it was last year.  I do not think the game is worth the candle. This idea of employing a staff to administer a part-time scheme in the country is wrong, and, for economy's sake, it should be administered through the county council.</P>
    <P>That raises another point.  A number of these men who will be employed on these schemes and who are employed on these schemes, if my information is right, have got part-time work with the county council, and if they have a sufficient number of weeks in the year with the county council, they get holidays with pay, but, so far as I know, if they have eight or ten weeks' work under these <Col N="128" /> schemes administered by the county council for the Parliamentary Secretary's Office, these eight or ten weeks are not taken into account for holidays. That is completely wrong and should be remedied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully contend that it is a matter for him and he should bring it to the attention of his Minister and have it rectified.  I came across the case of a man the other day who worked practically the whole year past and he got holidays with pay, because he was on this kind of scheme which our county council administered for the Parliamentary Secretary's Office.  There is an increase all right of £6,183 in the Vote, but that has all gone on salaries.  We must ask ourselves in the running of this country, whether the overheads and the administration of an amount of money like this would be justified in a business concern.  I do not think they would, and if the Minister is going to build up a machine for direct administration in every county, as I believe happens in Galway and is going to happen in Donegal, then it would be unjustifiable, unless that Vote is increased four times what it is for the giving of work to the unemployed and, at the same time, doing these very necessary schemes under the minor employment schemes and the rural improvements schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan has referred to the good purpose which the rural improvements schemes serve.  I want to endorse what he says because I believe they make life worth while in the rural parts.  There are boreens in the Midlands&mdash;and I agree here and now that they are nothing in length compared with, say, those in Connemara, Donegal or Kerry&mdash;which are bad enough to justify more and more money being spent.  The child going to school in a city or town steps on to a tarmacadam or cement road, but the child in rural Ireland steps into puddles for six months of the year. The speed at which we are rectifying this situation will never overtake the problem in a century and hence we <Col N="129" /> have the flight from the land.  Let me instance the case of a boreen in Westmeath.  There are ten families down that boreen.  If the two families at the end of the boreen want to sell their land, they suffer from the disadvantage that, even though their land may be better than that of the people at the top of the boreen, they will get far less for it because the way into it is bad.</P>
    <P>I want to endorse what Deputy Brennan said about permitting the county council to contribute to these schemes.  Very often, the beginning of a boreen is very bad and leads to bad land and uneconomic holdings; if the boreen is very long, the cost of the road is dearer and the contribution asked from these poor people is more than they can bear.  In a case like that, the county council would be prepared to contribute and I want to endorse what my colleague, Deputy Brennan, says, that permission should be given to the county council to contribute to these schemes.</P>
    <P>The principal point I stood up to make, having answered the interjection by the Parliamentary Secretary, was in regard to the pension rights of the rural employees who work on these schemes.  I believe the principle that applies to holiday pay should also apply to their pension rights under the county council.  It is a matter that is worthy of examination, because, in future, when the road grants run out, they will have nothing but these schemes, and if the employees have not worked 200 days in the year, their pension rights will be gone completely. There will be a gap.  It would be worth while examining the principle that applies to holidays with pay and workers' pension rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take on myself the task that the Parliamentary Secretary will have of replying to the debate, but I should like, with your permission, Sir, to refer to one or two of the matters which Deputy Kennedy has mentioned. I know that most of his remarks about rural Ireland, and Westmeath in particular, apply with equal force to my constituency, but I am afraid he was rather off-beam when talking about <Col N="130" /> the pension rights of the people employed on rural improvement schemes and their entitlement to holidays with pay.</P>
      <P>If somebody is employed on a special employment or rural improvement scheme and if he has completed 30 days, representing 150 hours of work, he is entitled to one day's holiday pay, which should be collected from the rural improvements scheme people before the job is finished.  In many cases, the trouble is that these people do not collect and no attempt is made to pay them.  That is where the trouble that Deputy Kennedy referred to arises.  When they go back to the county council, they find at the end of the year that there is a disparity between what they get and what they should get.  My advice to them would be to join a good trade union to ensure that they would get what they are entitled to when the job is finished.</P>
      <P>In connection with the superannuation scheme, the position is simply this, that if somebody is sent in an advisory capacity to a special employment scheme, or is taken on from employment with the county council, for some special reason, perhaps because of the nature of the job he is doing, he carries his pension rights with him and the days he works on the rural improvement scheme will count the same as days worked with the county council, but if the person is taken from the employment exchange, the days do not count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is merely a question of relieving unemployment, the days do not count.  That is the position.  In regard to the whole question of the work carried out under special employment schemes, while a great job has been done throughout the country, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Kennedy that there is not enough being done for certain types of people.  For instance, in rural districts, very often, one finds people living along very bad laneways or boreens.  Because of the length of the boreen, and because there may be only three or four people living along the <Col N="131" /> boreen, they find it impossible to put up their share of the money.  Last year, in County Meath, provision was made in order to try to help these people.  The county council took over a big number of boreens and borrowed £30,000 for the purpose of repairing them.  Some people considered that that was a very foolish thing to do, because they were then placed in the position that from that day forward, they were obliged to maintain those roads as public roads.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Kennedy's suggestion that the Special Employment Schemes Office should be able to assist the county councils. In co-operation, the county councils and the Special Employment Schemes Office could carry out the repairs on these boreens.  It is not fair that all the responsibility should fall on the county council, as happened in County Meath.  If the other way were tried, if the county council were to make a contribution and the Special Employment Schemes Office were to make their contribution, the problem might be solved.  I am afraid that, unless there is a very much bigger amount of money made available in the years to come, we will still find the position that school children will be walking up to their knees in mud along these boreens and having to stay in school all day with wet feet.  In some cases at present, that is unavoidable, unless somebody carries them.  I see that happening in some places in my constituency and I know it happens all over rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Something should be done about this matter.  It is not a political matter and all Parties in the House are agreed on the necessity for doing something about it.  If there were a proper approach, something could be done to try to solve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this work.  When a job is being done, the tendency is to give the appearance of finishing the job with the smallest possible expenditure.  I know that in a number of cases over the past few years, while the engineer in charge and the people carrying out the work made the best possible use of the money <Col N="132" /> available, the job was very poor because there was not enough money available.  There is no point in throwing a couple of inches of gravel on a lane which has not been repaired for years and expecting that that will keep the lane in good repair for the next generation.  It simply will not do it. It is not wise expenditure.  It would be much better if the Special Employment Schemes Office expended a little more money and did a better job.  In very many cases, the lanes have not been repaired for 20 to 25 years; a few hundred pounds is spent on them and they are left until they are almost as bad as they were originally.</P>
    <P>The question of providing employment in the rural areas should not be overlooked by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I think the matter is being approached from the wrong angle by the people in authority.  On a certain date in every year, the register of unemployed in each area is taken and it is according to the number of people unemployed on that date that the entitlement to grant for the year is based.  I should like, if possible, the scheme to be much more flexible, so that if, as very often happens, there are 20, 30 or 40 men&mdash;very often, married men with families&mdash;thrown out of employment with the local authority at any time during the year and if there is a job under the Special Employment Schemes Office that can be done, the Office should be in a position to have the work carried out then and there, when the men are available and when they most need the wages.  If that were the position, one problem would be solved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the question of increased wages.  It is true that over the years, particularly the past couple of years, there have been substantial increases in wages, but it is rather unfortunate that that should be held up as one of the reasons why so much work cannot be done.  When the Parliamentary Secretary was making provision for increased salaries, he could very usefully have included increased wages, if he had not already done so, and I cannot find it in his Estimate.  He could have included increased wages, so that there would <Col N="133" /> be no loss of work as a result of extra wages.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary cut in at the end to point out something which I think is not correct. On drainage schemes we are looking for a certain rate of wages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Estimate is examined, it will be found it is for the same amount as last year.  I feel the Parliamentary Secretary should have brought to the House a much bigger Estimate to cover this type of work because I feel that there will be a reduction in the number of schemes available for the western seaboard&mdash; Galway, West Donegal, Cork and other places.  Most of the schemes done under this Vote consist of roads varying in length from 25 to 50 yards, each scheme on which costs between £50 and £100.  I should like to see these roads two or three years after they have been done, examined again and kept up to a proper standard.  I feel sure the House would approve of such a practice.  I could point out to the Parliamentary Secretary a number of roads repaired under these schemes during the past couple of years which are now impassable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of roads suffer each winter through the overflowing of rivers and streams.  I feel the Parliamentary Secretary should be allowed to have special grants made available for the repair of that type of road.  I believe that all these schemes should be started at least a month earlier.  At <Col N="134" /> the moment, most of these schemes begin in November and continue until the following February.  In West Galway it would suit the farmers and the labourers much better if the schemes were begun a month earlier in order to provide for the ordinary work on the farms the following spring. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, will have something to say about the making of roads into bogs.  The people who save turf, to cater for the new turf-burning station in Galway, should have proper roads into the bogs so as to give them a chance to provide the maximum amount of turf for use in the power station.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kennedy maintained correctly that there will be less money available this year under this sub-head.  The workers themselves will pay dearly for the increase in wages because there will be less work available. I want to nail the type of propaganda put forward by Deputy James Tully.  The labour and the service content of sub-head J will be considerably reduced.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his introductory statement explained that the provision for rural improvement schemes is the same as last year at £197,000 and he said the gross provision included the National Development Fund grant.  In 1955-56, this was £264,000 and 931 new schemes, costing £263,986, were authorised for execution.  The Parliamentary Secretary also said that we are starting out with commitments of £134,000 under this sub-head. Accordingly, the amount which I reckon will be available will in reality be £63,000 under this sub-head, and if you add the unspent balance, which works out at £38,740, you get the sum of £101,740.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> I can see the farmers and the workers paying dearly under this sub-head for the mismanagement of the Government during last year and the year before.  Each county suffers; each gets a smaller allocation under this sub-head so that instead of expanding we are contracting.  With the increase of mechanisation on farms it is natural to expect that farmers will demand better services.  However, under this sub-head, it appears they will get worse services.  The employment content will be less.  What will the trade unions have to say to that?</P>

      <P>I am fair.  I like to tell the truth.  I do not get up under a smoke screen.  I feel rather sorry that there is this supposed saving or reduction in this sub-head.  Costs have gone up in every direction and it is no lie to say that on an expenditure of £500 costs would account for about £80 over those of 1954.  The money is eaten up in costs so that the labour content and the service content is cut down.  If that is the attitude of the Government, the rural community cannot expect much progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking about rural improvement schemes and local contributions, I think it is very unjust that there should be any local contribution at all.  We have the case of people living on culs-de-sac in areas where there is no unemployment and a rural improvement scheme applies, but the people living on these roads may be very large ratepayers who have already contributed their full share to the rates in the same way as those living on county or main roads.  I think it is the responsibility of the State to see that the roads to their houses are repaired and kept in repair out of State money.  Otherwise, the system is entirely unjust and that is why there are so many refusals to avail of rural improvement schemes throughout the country.  A refusal can be justified in that way, and I would respectfully suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should abolish the local contribution, <Col N="136" /> or alternatively, raise the State grant so that the contribution locally will be very small.</P>
      <P>We have what we call link roads, roads that are not on the council schedule for maintenance, and numbers of families live on those roads which are also used extensively by the general public.  The council will not repair these roads and the people have to fall back on rural improvement schemes, if they are prepared to contribute 25 per cent.  Again, those people will not pay that contribution, because they rightly maintain they are entitled to have their roads maintained and repaired out of State funds, just as are those people living on main and county roads.  Many of those people are hampered because they cannot work their land to the full extent, due to the roads being so bad and so narrow and because they cannot get big machinery into their fields.  Some of the farmers living on those roads, if they have tillage or corn, are very often forced to cart it to the main road, because the mills cannot get into these places.  That is a deplorable state of affairs, and now, when there is an appeal to farmers to till more and produce more from the land, it is up to the State to come to their assistance and help those unfortunates living in such circumstances on such roads.</P>
      <P>I also want to refer to the minor relief schemes.  They are very good schemes.  In some cases, they certainly carry full cost grants, but, in other cases, the schemes singled out are not of a really productive nature, but are rather designed to give employment. The productive nature of the scheme is not taken into consideration.  That should not be so.  The State money that is being put into these schemes should result in revenue to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy on the opposite side&mdash; I think it was Deputy Brennan&mdash;spoke about bridges, and bridges constitute a burning question in the county from which I come.  Where rural improvement schemes are availed of, such as schemes for cleaning rivers, there is no provision for the erection of bridges, and, as I have already said, it frequently happens that a number of <Col N="137" /> families are marooned when these rivers are in flood and cannot get in or out from their homes.  They have difficulty in getting young children to school.  Some provision should be made under the rural improvement schemes or minor relief schemes to set aside money for building bridges over those rivers.  They are absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>It has also been mentioned that if the local contribution is to continue, the beneficiaries of those schemes, those who subscribe, should get portion of the work on those schemes.  In fact, I would suggest if we could find one of their number who would be intelligent enough to act as danger, he should be employed, and in that way we would get the money properly spent and the work properly done.  As a western Deputy the Parliamentary Secretary knows that culs-de-sac are a burning question in the West.  I think there are more culs-de-sac in the West than in any other part of Ireland and he should see that sufficient money is allocated to make these roads passable and to put them into proper repair.</P>
    <P>The development of bogs, drainage and the making of roads in bogs, should be expedited on a very large scale at the moment.  We know that the price of fuel&mdash;coal in particular&mdash; has gone beyond the reach of the ordinary man, but we have a number of bogs where fuel could be produced, if they were drained and proper roads made through them.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, who knows that is so in the West, that he should see that bog drainage and bog road-making are expedited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the voices of other Deputies who have expressed disappointment at the fact that there has been no increase in the money made available for minor relief schemes or rural improvement schemes or bog development schemes this year.  I want to say it must be understood by everybody that the amount of work that will be done this year will be much less than has been done in either of the past two years. Wages have increased, and as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out a few moments ago, the rate of wages <Col N="138" /> works out in accordance with farm labourers' wages and, of course, their wages have increased in the past fortnight. So also have county council workers' wages, and all that tends to have less work done.</P>
      <P>I think that a very special case could have been made this year to have the amount of money allocated increased considerably.  In my constituency, as indeed is the case in most of the West of Ireland, unemployment, I think, was never as bad as it is at the moment.  There were never as many people unemployed as there are at the moment and I certainly do not think as many people ever left the town beside which I live as have left it for England since last January.  There is little hope or prospect of anything for them at the moment, and I had hoped that a special case might be made by the Parliamentary Secretary for an increase in the sum of money the Minister was making available, in view of the hardship that is inflicted as a result of the unemployment existing in the West of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Very great work has been done under the rural improvement schemes.  Some Deputies do not seem to understand that, if county councils so desire, they may contribute to those rural improvement schemes, but the position the county councils are in is that if they contribute to them they also have to take them over and maintain them afterwards, and that is where the snag comes in.  I think it is a pity that some arrangements could not be made between the Department of Local Government and the Office of Public Works to try and have the matter worked out a little better.  It is a shame to see a good road made under a rural improvement scheme grant and then left to deteriorate into a worse condition than it ever was before. Some effort should be made to see if the two Departments could not arrange matters in a better fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter with which I wish to deal applies particularly to bog development schemes.  I have seen where a number of grants were given for the development of bog roads and fairly good jobs of work were done, but, unfortunately, the Office of Public <Col N="139" /> Works do not seem to realise that the traffic over those bog roads has changed considerably in recent years. Some time ago we saw a donkey and cart or a horse and cart travelling over them.  That has disappeared now, and to-day one sees a ten-ton truck or a tractor and trailer hauling turf out of the bog.  And, of course, the timber kish, as we used call it&mdash;the bridge that is constructed of timber&mdash;is not able to hold up the weight of those things. I think it is a waste of money to put down any more timber bridges.  I think a concrete bridge should be erected on all those roads.  It is most important that that should be done.</P>
    <P>I know a number of schemes that were done in recent years and now, although the road is still in fairly good repair, the bridges have broken down. The timber has given way under the weight of heavy traffic on it and, of course, as soon as the bridge breaks down, the next thing you have is a flood alongside the road, and as soon as it comes, it is &ldquo;all up&rdquo; with the unfortunate road and it is back into a worse state than before.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department will take a note of this and give it special attention.  The day of the wooden bridge, or the kish, as we used to call it in the West, is gone forever.  It is not able to carry the traffic, and the result is that it causes hardship all round.  That was the principal point I wanted to make and I trust it will receive attention from the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Estimate much good money is being spent in many backward areas and I am supporting it because the backward areas are the areas where the money should be spent.  I am satisfied that, although we are spending much money and spending it well, unless we follow that up by repairing those boreens and lanes, much of that money will be wasted.  That is the snag we see over the last three, four or five years.  If that work is not followed up those lanes and boreens are just as bad as ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as my own county is concerned, <Col N="140" /> it has embarked on a big and ambitious scheme in connection with the repair of these lanes.  I think we are the only county in Ireland to embark on a scheme for the taking over of lanes where there is a population of from 20 to 25 people.  We are going to take them over and put them into good repair but we are in the position that we cannot get rural improvement scheme money.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government to see to it that we should get our share of that money. We are spending a vast amount of money in the taking over of those lanes.  Over the last 20 years migration from other counties has increased our road mileage by hundreds of miles, and a vast amount of new roads has been made into Land Commission houses. If those roads, which were made reasonably well, are not kept in repair, they will turn into quagmires in no time.  Those people are fairly large ratepayers and are as much entitled to the amenities of life as those living on the high roads.  That is why we are facing up to our responsibilities in seeing that these people get adequate roads.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to realise that, when a county embarks on a scheme like that and spends the ratepayers' money in this manner, he ought to see that we at least would get our share of the rural improvement schemes grants.  I think it is only reasonable because, after all, our county has added more mileage in the last 15 or 20 years than any other county in Ireland.  Otherwise, these roads will be allowed to deteriorate over the years because you cannot get all the ratepayers to see eye to eye. You just will not do it in parts of rural Ireland.  If you could do it, perhaps you would be able to keep those lanes in proper repair.  Many of those lanes will not be repaired, however, unless there is a fair amount of unemployment in the area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it that, as we have embarked on this scheme which, when completed, will have cost the ratepayers the sum of £300,000, which is no small sum, he and the Minister for <Col N="141" /> Local Government will come to our aid.  We know we must face up to our responsibilities.  The people living in the backward areas of Ireland are the people we want to facilitate, but it will take a fair amount of money to do that.  The council are unanimous in saying that this should be done, but if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government do not come to our aid we will be in a serious position.  I expect that other counties will embark on the same type of scheme as we have embarked on because it is sound national work.  We want to try and keep the people there and to give them the same amenities in the matter of roads as the people on the high roads have.</P>
    <P>We are coming to the aid of the Land Commission in seeing that the roads they put there are kept in good repair.  I would ask that the Government would come to our aid in seeing to it that the share of money under the rural improvement scheme that would come in the ordinary way, if that work were done by private individuals, would be given to us.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate the whole position and to see by what means he could give to the Meath County Council their share of these moneys for the repair of these roads.</P>
    <P>This work will mean a good deal for the people living in the rural areas.  I am quite satisfied that many of the people living up these old lanes, with the price of land at the present moment, will sell out and go away.  We do not want that to happen.  Year in, year out, they and their children are walking to the church or to the school in a quagmire.  It is only right that the money of the State should be spent in giving those people the same amenities as those who live on the tar-macadam road.  I hope that the Minister in his wisdom will ensure that, in so far as these schemes upon which we have embarked are concerned, the amount of money that should come to the county, were these schemes done by private enterprise, will come to the county.  I know that that can be worked out between the Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary.  We have a good case. <Col N="142" /> We believe the money will come our way.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate the position and see that the good work is not stopped.  Those living in the rural areas are just as much entitled to modern facilities and amenities as those living in the urban areas and it is only right that they should get them.</P>
    <P>Much money has been spent, and is being spent, under this Estimate and it is only right that there should be a follow-up since, otherwise, the money will be lost.  No boreen will last over four or five years.  A few wet winters and modern transport will make the last state worse than the first and, whether we like it or not, we must put a tar-macadam surface on.  Farmers living on these boreens cannot bring in machinery on their farms for land reclamation work.  They cannot avail of combine harvesters.  Money spent on the improvement and upkeep of these roads is money well spent.  If we got some of the millions that are spent on roads in the urban areas we would have the finest roads in our county to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I shall quote from Deputy Beegan, Volume 156 of the Official Report, column 1446:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I refer, in particular, to development work on bogs and rural improvement schemes.  Considerably more money could be expended.  I know that a great deal of very good work has been done.  I am very interested in both schemes.  In a great many places, there is a crying need for the improvement of bogs, drainage and road repairs.</P>
      <P>There could not be any better form of national development than the repair of roads into bogs and bog drainage, because of the importance of the bogs in the West of Ireland, and those places where people depend on the bogs for their domestic fuel and because of the relation of this work to agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, right through the subsequent debate, every speaker followed along the same lines.  Possibly I would not be in as good a position to-night had <Col N="143" /> the debate concluded last Thursday evening.  It is a remarkable thing to hear the criticism levelled and the cry for more and more money.  I agree that money must be spent.  I also agree that the money must be found. To-day an attempt was made to get more money and many of the people on the other side of the House, who were shouting last week and again this evening for more and more money, were the very people who, earlier to-day, walked into the Division Lobby to prevent my getting any more money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, they cannot have it both ways.  There is an old adage: &ldquo;You cannot have your cake and eat it.&rdquo;  That seems to be the position with the present Opposition. The Government cannot spend money if it cannot find the money.  I have to go to the Minister for Finance and ask for money.  He can now say to me: &ldquo;The Dáil would not vote any more money.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suppose all rural Deputies on both sides of this House appreciate the position in which those people find themselves in relation to bog development schemes, rural improvements schemes and minor employment schemes.  Nevertheless, they seem to think it more important now that petrol should be a penny or twopence a gallon cheaper and the packet of cigarettes should be a couple of halfpennies cheaper; but, at the same time, they seem to think we should have money for bog roads and so forth.</P>
      <P>The Government cannot spend money until it has found the money, and the Government can raise money only from the people.  An attempt was made to get that money to-day and we know how some people reacted towards that attempt.</P>

      <P>Again, Deputy Beegan at column 1448 had this to say <Col N="144" />&mdash;and this note was also struck right through the debate by subsequent speakers:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was very glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary state that a number of inspectors had their salaries increased, but they are still unestablished apparently.  That is having a very bad effect.  A number of them have been established in recent years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We hear about the delay in inspecting these schemes.  I want to be quite honest with the House and, if Deputy Beegan were here, he would certainly stand by me in this.  I wish some of the Deputies who criticised, such as Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, could be for one year in charge of the Office of Public Works.  It would teach them a good deal.  Deputy Beegan was quite right: we are backward in our schemes, very backward even in inspection. I am sorry to say we are nearly 12 months behind.  Why?  Because we cannot get the staff.  That is the answer.  Deputy Beegan was quite right when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was very glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary state that a number of inspectors had their salaries increased, but that they are still unestablished apparently.  That is having a bad effect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is having a bad effect.  In 1949, the Office of Public Works hung between heaven and earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not come down to earth yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Engineers were recruited and they were not long in the office when they found they could get better positions outside.  They left immediately.  Interviews were held for as many as ten inspectors and, by the time they were called, nine had taken up appointments elsewhere.  Then we hear Deputies complain about delays, such as Deputy M.P. Murphy, who said: &ldquo;It might be no harm to leave them as they are.&rdquo;  Does anybody think we can accept a situation in which the staff is paid less well than in other walks of life?  If he does, all I can tell him is that he will not have <Col N="145" /> a staff to carry out the work which must be done under this Estimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy said there should be no contribution at all.  We have three types of schemes.  We have, first of all, the bog development scheme where roads are made into bogs that accommodate a certain number of people for turf production for their own use or for sale.  They get a full cost grant for that, provided the scheme is worth it.  The rural improvements scheme, as Deputies know, is a scheme where the people are asked to contribute. There is no use in Deputy Corry or any other Deputy telling me that the county council should contribute.  The people who benefit are the people who contribute, according to the Act, and they alone.</P>
      <P>That is a really good scheme, because in many cases, where people are very poor and there are very low valuations, they got a contribution of 95 per cent. towards the cost of the work.  The average last year, I think, worked out between 11 and 12 per cent. Where there are people with high valuations, over £18, in a position to contribute, surely it is not too much to ask them to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost.  If they have a high valuation, as high as £500, provided they contribute 25 per cent. of the cost the State contributes 75 per cent.; but in the case of low valuation, as I have explained, they get up to 95 per cent. of a grant.</P>
      <P>Surely the people do not want, as they say in the West of Ireland, the bread buttered on each side for them. That is what it amounts to.  Not alone that, but, as is right&mdash;though people here said it was not&mdash;they get preference. Contributors get preference at the work, because in 90 per cent. of those areas, at least, where you carry out a rural improvement scheme it is an area that does not qualify for minor employment schemes&mdash;that is to say, an area that does not qualify for full cost grant because they have not enough of U.A. men.  Ninety per cent. of these rural improvement schemes are in areas where you have no unemployed at all, and preference is always given to people who contribute.  That is only right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> The recruitment of labour came up again, not so much to-day as on the last evening.  That is a job for the ganger in charge and for the engineer in charge.  The appointment of gangers came up to-day.  That is a job for the engineer in charge.  There is no good in saying that such and such a man should go on as a ganger in any scheme.  The engineer is the man responsible to the office, and the ganger is the man responsible to the engineer. I am quite sure that there is no Deputy but will agree that not every man is capable of being a ganger.  You must get a man who knows the job and has some experience, who has previously worked on it, and promote him. Probably amongst the contributors&mdash; there may be two, three or ten&mdash;you may not get one who is capable of being a ganger.  My view always is that it is better to have a man as ganger who is a stranger.  He gets more work from the people working under him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins and others referred to the people who object to a scheme. Very often an objection comes to us and we overrule it and go on with the road, or with the drainage scheme, as the case may be, without interference from that person at all.  We ignore him and go on with the work, but there are cases when you interfere with a man's rights.  He may be a contrary individual.  You may find him in places other than the West of Ireland or Donegal.  People may not like their neighbour, there may be some family dispute, and surely our office is not the body to interfere between them.  By letting the thing hang on for a little while eventually these things are fixed up.  Last year less than 1 per cent. of our works did not go on or were stopped through this interference and objections.  As you know, neighbours eventually make it up and there is no more trouble about it.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy, Deputy O'Hara, referred to the fact that we should put these schemes up for tender and get them done cheaper that way.  Deputies must realise that those works are primarily for giving employment, and we cannot have such a system as that. As regards county councils, I explained <Col N="147" /> before that county councils are entitled to contribute in two cases only, that is, if the road being made is to labourers' cottages or if the road being made is to a graveyard.  Only in those two cases do we accept contributions from the county council.  In every other case as the form is being sent out they can see paragraph 9, which says that the people to benefit are the people to contribute, and no others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy's reference to the Office of Public Works amounted to saying, &ldquo;Abolish it&rdquo;.  In Westmeath, it probably is not such an advantage as it is to other parts of Ireland.  I am sure that the Minister on my right, the Minister on my left, or representatives of constituencies in Galway, Kerry, Mayo North or several other areas, would be long sorry to have this office abolished, because it is as big an advantage as any other office in the Government.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy urged that we should maintain these jobs.  Surely when you make a road into a village, a minor employment scheme, giving them a full cost grant, or a road into a bog with a full cost grant, or a road where they contribute 5 per cent. and you give them 95 per cent., it is not too much to ask them once a year to take a cart along, fill it with sand, and fill up the few little pot-holes there after the year's travelling.  That is the least we expect them to do.  I want to give the warning that in cases where people who have got big grants of up to 95 per cent. under rural improvements schemes come back after a few years and ask: &ldquo;Give us another 95 per cent. grant and for every £95 you give us, we will contribute £5&rdquo;&mdash;so well they could, since they are earning £100&mdash;they are going to be put on a black list while there are people looking for schemes that have not been done, who will get preference.  Those people who come along again, who are too lazy to bring out a cart of sand once a year and repair the road, cannot have extra grants.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Carter and a few others too.  What edge have Fianna Fáil against the worker getting an increase in wages?  We hear all this <Col N="148" /> about there not being enough money, because wages are going up.  What objection have the Fianna Fáil Party to the labourer, the lowest paid man in this State, getting increased wages?</P>

      <P>I think it was Deputy Tully who raised the point that we should take a census of unemployed three or four times a year.  This census is taken in the second or third week in January.  Could you take the census at any time of the year when you could expect to have more unemployed than then?  At that time, you have the maximum number of unemployed in this country.  It was Deputy Brennan of Donegal who said that these schemes should be started earlier in the year.  Generally they are selected in the end of September or early October.  They are primarily for the relief of unemployment.  Surely you do not want us to carry out those schemes in July, August or September? They are fitted in to suit that time of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted with Deputy Brennan's speech.  Surely he would have supported me if he had been here in 1949 when I stated in this House that it was the intention of the office to take over certain counties.  It is a pity Deputy Brennan was not here then to back me up in that.  I remember the taking over of Mayo, Kerry, Galway and Tipperary.  I am glad to inform Deputy Brennan that we have on hands at the moment the taking over of Donegal and a few other counties as well.  The very reason Deputy Brennan gave here to-night is the <Col N="149" /> reason for our taking them over.  I will tell the House why.  Previous to that, the officials inspected a scheme, estimated a certain amount of money for it and the Order and the money were sent down to the local county council.  As Deputy Brennan pointed out&mdash;I suppose this happens in Donegal at the present time but, please God, it will not happen for long&mdash; these schemes are not looked after. They are carried out at the end of the year.  When the county engineer has finished his own work he shoves out his county council workers on the job in the winter months round Christmas time.  Surely I was right in my outlook in 1949.  I assure Deputy Brennan that the scheme is in hands.  We are preparing it.  We hope that in the near future Donegal will be listed in the same way as Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Clare, Tipperary and other counties which we are taking over.  We will do the work directly ourselves from the office under our own inspector in the county, under our own ganger, appointed by our inspector, and with our own labourers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan made a great case for me to-night.  It is a pity he was not here in 1949 to listen to what Fianna Fáil Deputies said about me. They said: &ldquo;Listen to him.  This is political business.  He wants the appointment of gangers who will be against Fianna Fáil.  He wants the recruitment of labourers who will be against Fianna Fáil.  He wants the appointment of engineers who will be against Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  I know well there are Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches who heard those statements. It is well to have Deputy Brennan now to defend me after all those years.</P>
    <P>Criticism is good.  I thank every Deputy who spoke, with the exception of one, Deputy M.P. Murphy of West Cork.  I shall quote from the Official Report of the 3rd May, 1956, columns 1464 and 1465.  I cannot allow the statement he made to go unchallenged. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were told by the office of the Parliamentary Secretary that work was made available to those on the employment exchange register and that the man in receipt of the <Col N="150" /> highest amount of unemployment assistance should get first preference, when work is available.  That seemed a very reasonable attitude, but when I went into West Cork, I found on an island scheme which was a minor employment scheme that the man with the lesser amount of unemployment benefit was working there, while two men in receipt of higher benefits were getting no employment whatever.  I called to the exchange to make sure that my facts were correct, and, when I found they were, I asked why that man should get work in preference to the other two. I was told that the matter would be investigated and later I was informed that the reason this man was taken on was that he has some special knowledge of the work.</P>
    <P>I know all these people concerned and I know that the man who got the job had no special knowledge whatever, and the only special thing he had was &ldquo;pull&rdquo;.  That &ldquo;pull&rdquo; obtains in West Cork in the matter of getting employment from this office.  We cannot have it both ways. This is State employment given by State moneys and we should see to it that the money is expended on the people who need it.  The Parliamentary Secretary should see to it that the money provided under this Vote is used impartially and fairly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to tell every Deputy in this House that there is no &ldquo;pull&rdquo; whatsoever, to use Deputy M.P. Murphy's expression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I will reply to it.  I wish every Deputy, including Deputy M.P. Murphy, could spend, say, a year in the Special Employment Schemes Office as Parliamentary Secretary, and then he would know there is no such thing there as &ldquo;pull&rdquo;.  Every case is investigated impartially and I challenge any Deputy to prove there is not fair play.  I could not let Deputy M.P. Murphy's statement go unchallenged. The Deputy did not give particulars of the work on the island <Col N="151" /> although the details of the work were communicated to him in a letter from the Special Employment Schemes Office.  This was not ordinary road work at all.  It related to the construction of a retaining wall and repairs to an existing section of a wall on the island shore&mdash;actually, the building of a concrete wall.  What our inspector would do in the usual way would be to take a trained man from the mainland to do the work but, instead, he got this chap I referred to, who is a handyman, and, under the supervision of our inspector, this man was able to do the work.  The men Deputy M.P. Murphy talks about could not put two sods of turf on top of one another, not to mind that kind of work.</P>

      <P>Yes.  He was an unemployed man.  Without a doubt he did.  Deputy M.P. Murphy was unreasonable. We wrote to Deputy Murphy.  He made inquiries at the office.  I shall quote from the letter we sent him.  We said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The reason why... were employed on the scheme was because of their experience and skill in the work required to be done.  You will see from the description that two of the three schemes are not in the ordinary run of road repairs.  The work is of a nature that requires special aptitude and it was in those circumstances that Mr. ...was employed. In respect of the other, the inspector's decision in this case has my full approval and you will appreciate that it was the common-sense thing to do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hate to hear the word &ldquo;pull&rdquo;. There is no such thing in the office. I regret Deputy M.P. Murphy brought the word into this debate.  The position was fully explained in the office and he got a letter about it.  Either he knows those people or he does not know them.  My opinion is that he does not know them at all.  His criticism was very unfair to the officials who are working hard in the office. They are working very hard in, I think, the most thankless Government <Col N="152" /> office in which they could work. Nevertheless, they were congratulated on their work during this debate.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies who spoke on the Estimate and for their criticism but in my view criticism of the type which was voiced by Deputy M.P. Murphy is bad and unfair.  I thank all other Deputies for their criticism and for mentioning many of the things about which they spoke.  I could not go over all of them now.  I shall get my officials to look after them and each Deputy will get a solid reply to every matter raised here.  We shall do our best about all that.  Deputies may say we have not enough money.  We have all we can get at the present time.  I hope that next year, after a good return in the Budget, and prosperity, I shall be in a position to come in here with twice as much money, despite the vote of Fianna Fáil to-day in order to prevent it.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,911,970 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to local authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing and miscellaneous grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount which the House is now being asked to provide together with <Col N="153" /> the amount of the Vote on Account aggregate a net sum of £4,721,970 involving a net increase of £16,516 on the amount provided for the service of my Department in the last financial year.</P>
    <P>The sum of £100,000 provided last year in Sub-head 1 (4) in respect of grants for housing schemes from the Transition Development Fund is replaced this year by a token provision of £5.  Grants from the Transition Development Fund are no longer allocated to new housing schemes which rank for subsidy on the higher limits which were brought into operation in 1953 and no further specific liabilities under this head in respect of older schemes are anticipated.  As against that saving, the contributions towards housing loan charges of local authorities involve an increase of £90,000 and the subsidy of sanitary services loan charges involves an increase of £45,000.  There is no other variation in the Estimate which calls for special mention.</P>
    <P>The number of dwellings completed by housing authorities in the year 1955-56 was 4,011.  The total number of completions in the preceding year was 5,267.  At the 1st April last, work was in progress on 6,017 dwellings as compared with 5,572 on the 1st April, 1955. The number of dwellings in tender on 1st April, 1956, was also higher than the corresponding number on the 1st April, 1955, the figures being 3,214 and 3,029 respectively.  The overall picture of local authority housing activity is, therefore, that while the total number of dwellings completed in the last financial year was less than in the preceding year, the number of dwellings in course of erection or at tender in the current season is 9,231 as compared with 8,601 in the corresponding period last year.  The volume of work actually in progress is higher now than in April, 1955, and the volume of employment has risen by about 200 men.</P>
    <P>A decline in the overall volume of local authority housing work may be expected according as the arrears of housing needs of the country are met. We have already reached the position where the 1947 estimates of needs have been satisfied in full or are rapidly <Col N="154" /> approaching satisfaction in about 20 county health districts and 24 urban districts.  Further building is being undertaken in these areas only where it is established that further needs have arisen since 1947 or that the original estimates were inadequate.</P>
    <P>One thousand three hundred and eleven houses were erected by the Dublin Corporation in the last financial year and last month 2,045 further dwellings were in course of erection and the dwellings in tender amounted to 815.  Here, as in the overall national picture, the extent of work in progress is in excess of that in progress in the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>When introducing my Estimate to the House last June, I expressed the belief that the average figure of housing output over the last six or seven years approaching 2,000 dwellings would be maintained in the City of Dublin, but I also pointed out that, for some years to come at least, no extraordinary acceleration of housing progress corresponding to that reached in 1950 and 1951 seemed likely. As I indicated on that occasion, there are limits on the corporation's activities because the city sewerage system has been loaded to capacity and that in turn has limited the scope of the areas available for development.  In view of these considerations the current rate of corporation building is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The number of houses completed by the Cork Corporation in 1955-56 was 365 and satisfactory progress has been made as regards dwellings in tender and planning of additional schemes. The corporation has now a record of cumulative improvement in its housing output since 1953 and I wish to commend that body for its efforts and to congratulate it on its success.</P>
    <P>The levels of building costs as reflected in local authority schemes are being kept under active survey and, as I informed the House last year, the practice of rejecting tenders which appear to be excessive has usually enabled more reasonable prices to be obtained.</P>
    <P>Out of a total of 6,017 houses in progress on the 1st April, 1956, 916 were being undertaken by direct labour. <Col N="155" /> About half of these related to schemes in the Cities of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>In the course of last year I established a committee to consider methods of simplifying the procedure in regard to the submission of housing plans by local authorities and their examination in the Department.  I understand that the report of the committee will reach me shortly.  Meanwhile, in July last, I informed local authorities that it would not be necessary for county councils to submit for my prior consideration proposals for the acquisition of sites for unserviced rural cottages where the number involved on any particular site did not exceed six, provided that the sites were certified by the local medical and technical advisers to be suitable or to be the best available and that grouped cottages should have a minimum curtilage of half an acre each.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the number of new houses erected by private persons and public utility societies in the year 1955-56 was 5,370 and the number of reconstructions by private persons 6,160.  Both these figures were in excess of the corresponding figures for the previous financial year to the extent of about 500 new houses and 500 reconstructed houses.  These figures, particularly those for reconstruction, are very encouraging.  We have no detailed particulars of the age distribution of dwellings in the country but ordinary observation suggests that a high proportion of our dwellings are old and in need of repair or improvement to bring them up to modern standards.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have adequate power to secure the repair of unsatisfactory dwellings and are required to survey their districts to ascertain what dwellings are unsatisfactory.  Practical encouragement is provided in the form of State and local grants for reconstruction, repair or improvement works, including the conversion of houses into separate dwellings and the extension of houses to relieve prospective or actual overcrowding.  It is my aim to encourage every effort at conservation of the stock of houses, both those of local authorities and of private persons, and I have taken <Col N="156" /> every step which presented itself of voicing this encouragement.  As part of my policy in this regard I am encouraging local authorities to arrange appropriate terms for the purchase of their dwellings by the tenants.  Since 1953 sale schemes covering about 6,400 dwellings have been approved in urban areas but the tenants are slow to avail themselves of the terms, attractive though they seem.  In the rural areas the tenants seem to be somewhat more willing to purchase and up to the present about one quarter of the total number of cottages included in purchase schemes have been vested in the tenants.</P>
    <P>The number of town planning appeals received during 1955-56 was 263 as compared with 228 in the previous year. A number of these were settled by agreement between the appellants and the planning authorities, a practice which I encourage as an alternative to the exercise of my statutory powers of deciding appeals.  About half the decided appeals were allowed with or without conditions and in the remainder the decisions of the planning authorities were upheld.  It will be seen that the number of unsuccessful appeals is moderate in relation to the amount of building construction in which the local authorities deal with applications for permission.</P>
    <P>Progress with water and sewerage schemes was maintained during the past year.  Work on about 70 new schemes was commenced in the period and the number of schemes in course of construction at the end of the financial year was 128.  The final stage of the North Dublin drainage scheme&mdash; the outfall works at Howth&mdash;came in course of construction during the year. If work proceeds for the remainder of its duration as smoothly as it has gone up to now, the scheme may be ready for operation by the summer of 1957. The North Dublin regional water supply has also made satisfactory progress. Several areas are already served by the pipe lines.  The difficulty of acquiring a suitable site for the reservoir to serve Malahide has now been overcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural water supplies, I communicated with county councils <Col N="157" /> during the year asking them to give closer attention to their programmes of pumps and small water supplies and pointed out that the spread of rural electrification offered in many cases a ready means of improving the rural water supplies position both speedily and economically.</P>
    <P>The fire fighting services have now been reorganised on a county basis in 22 of the counties and chief fire officers have been appointed in 19 counties.</P>
    <P>The number of bathing accidents which occurred last year caused much concern.  The successive tragedies which occurred last summer underlined the need to intensify the efforts of public authorities to avert as far as possible the recurrence of fatalities of this kind.  Discussions were initiated with the Irish Red Cross Society with a view to improving the sanitary authorities' collaboration with the society's water safety campaign. Agreement was reached with the society as to the steps to be taken and a circular letter was then addressed to the sanitary authorities according sanction to a contribution by each authority to the society and bringing to their notice the willingness of the society to train people in rescue and resuscitation techniques and to organise groups known as water safety corps to provide a voluntary service at beaches, also their willingness to train life-guards for employment by local authorities and to advise local authorities as to the suitability, placing and care of life-saving equipment. As we are now at the onset of another summer season, I wish to appeal for every possible co-operation by official and voluntary bodies in this most important and laudable campaign for water safety.</P>
    <P>Road Fund income from motor taxation, etc., was £5,085,600 in 1955-56 as compared with £4,771,400 for the previous year.  The number of vehicles of all classes under current licence in August, 1955, was 226,998 as compared with 204,032 in August, 1954.  Last year I announced an increase in the grant for county road improvement by £500,000 from £1,700,000 to £2,200,000. <Col N="158" /> The figure for county roads has been increased again for the current year to £2,400,000 and the main road improvement grant has been reduced from £1,200,000 to £1,000,000.  The grants to the county boroughs and Dún Laoghaire have been maintained at the same figure&mdash;£150,000, also the grants for small bridges, etc., for which the figure is also £150,000.</P>
    <P>The only development arising out of these figures to which I need refer is the increase in the grant for county road improvement.  This is an implementation of accepted Government policy to apply the major portion of the increase in Road Fund revenue towards the financing of a larger county road improvement programme.</P>
    <P>Revised regulations on traffic signs pursuant to the powers conferred by the Local Government Act, 1955, are being prepared.  The work so far as my Department is concerned is nearing completion.  The regulations will, however, contain various drawings illustrative of the signs proposed and the printing will take some time.  It is hoped that the regulations will be ready for publication in a few months. The preparation of amending bylaws is being undertaken by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and it is expected that they will be ready at the same time as the traffic sign regulations.  At the same time as the new regulations come into force, I hope to have a new edition of the Department's Road Safety booklet published, incorporating the new road traffic signs.  Deputies will observe that the existing statutory provisions are sufficient to enable us to make the regulations and bylaws to which I have referred and that they do not depend on an amendment of the existing road traffic legislation and that is something that should be noted.</P>
    <P>A Road Traffic Bill is in course of preparation and will give Deputies an opportunity in due course of expressing their views on this important subject. I think it only right to mention, however, that, in my opinion, the paramount necessity is for the education of the educable in caution, courtesy and capability, whether they are pedestrians or drivers of vehicles.  As to that element which does not respond <Col N="159" /> to ordinary training or good counsel, I am being forced to the view that more stringent action is required in regard to them.</P>
    <P>During the year under review I signed an agreement with the Motor Insurers' Bureau for the initiation of a scheme whereby claims for compensation against uninsured drivers will, in certain circumstances, be met by the bureau, without prejudice to the liability of the offending motor vehicle user.  The scheme came into operation on the 1st January last.</P>
    <P>I come now to my survey of the general financial position of local bodies.  Excluding vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities, local revenue was £47.8 million in the past financial year and for the current year it has been estimated at £51.7 million. Of these amounts the State contributed about £21.4 million in 1955-56 and will be paying about £22.3 million in 1956-57.  When income from other sources is taken into account the net amount falling on local rates for the past year was about £17.9 million (less than 37½ per cent. of the total expenditure) and is estimated at £19.4 million in the present financial year. Criticism of local expenditure and the increases in rate poundages has been fairly widespread in recent months.  In so far as they represent pleas for economy in methods of work and conscientious conservation in administration I would add my voice to those pleas.  Methods of rationalising work and procedure are under review by several committees on which officers of my Department and local officials are represented.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by some of my colleagues as well as by myself a considerable proportion of the current increases in rates is referable to factors arising out of international economic movements having an impact on our national economy.  The balance is due to the development of social services and other planned programmes which are gradually coming into full effect. As I have already remarked, the State is bearing a very substantial share of the increased expenditure.  A casual <Col N="160" /> glance at returns of rates made by county councils for the year 1939-40 will show that there has been an increase to about three times the poundage then struck.  When one takes into account the additional and improved services that have evolved since 1939 and adverts to the change in the value of money which international strife and international inflation have created in the same period, it will be evident that rises in local rates are not out of proportion to general alterations in the economic structure.</P>
    <P>During the year under review, the recommendations made to me by an Chomhairle Leabharlanna in regard to the future of the county library services have been published.  All those concerned with the welfare of these services are, therefore, in a position to see and discuss the recommendations and furnish their views before any decisive action is taken on them.  A second series of recommendations will be made to me in due course in regard to the municipal library services.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the enactment of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, I gave effect to my promise that when the Act became law I would make the elected members of local authorities fully aware of their powers under the County Management Acts.  I had prepared for their guidance a booklet which gives briefly and in simple terms an account of the powers which the Acts confer on the elected representatives and of the methods by which these powers may be exercised.  Copies of the booklet were circulated to all elected members.</P>
    <P>In the administration of the combined purchasing organisation, we have experienced a notable improvement in the supply position of most commodities in the past year.  I was particularly impressed by the marked advances in quality and in volume of output of home manufactured articles. The list of commodities for which contractors are appointed has been further expanded so that local authorities should now be in a position to obtain the bulk of their normal requirements from the official contractors.  The number of provincial contractors shows a further increase this year and <Col N="161" /> practically every county in the State is now represented in the official list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Before I get down to very important aspects of local government and the effect of the Minister's actions on local authorities, I shall deal with the Minister's opening statement.  In the second paragraph of the first page of the Minister's speech it is pointed out that there is an increased expenditure of £16,516 in his Department this year as compared with last year.  Would the Minister not have told us how much of that or how much more than that is related to increased salaries rather than to increased service to local authorities by way of grant or otherwise?</P>
      <P>The Minister points out that there are increases in loan charges, in one case £90,000 and in the other case, £45,000.  Would the Minister not have thought fit to tell the House to what extent these increases are due to increased rates of interest, of which the Minister's Department pays its proportions? As it is put to the House in the Minister's statement, one would imagine that these figures were proof of increased loans and, consequently, increased loan charges to the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us quite a long list of figures relating to the building of houses under normal housing schemes of local authorities and under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  The Minister has avoided a particular subject with which I will deal at greater length later on.  We are not concerned simply with a report of past activities.  We are concerned about the future position.  We are confronted with a situation which, to say the least, is very doubtful.</P>
      <P>The Minister made some reference to the north city sewerage scheme. One would imagine that the Minister was responsible for the smooth operation of that scheme and that the possibility of its completion in 1957 was due to him.  May I put on record that this sewerage scheme would have been completed many years ago if it had not been held up by the Department?</P>

      <P>It was held up by the Department.  Otherwise, it would have been finished a long time ago. That has not in any way seriously affected the building of houses there. In fact, houses were built and a temporary method of dealing with the effluent was utilised.  It was kept in mind that at a certain time connection could be made with the main drainage. I do not know why the Minister has introduced that subject.</P>
      <P>As the Minister paid a tribute to Cork Corporation, he might have thought fit to pay a tribute, if not to the Dublin Corporation, at least to its officials for the magnificent job that has been done, and is being done, in connection with the sewerage scheme, a scheme that they themselves designed and which, after examination by several experts, was judged to be a proper scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister says, at page 5 of his statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is estimated that the number of new houses erected by private persons and public utility societies in the year 1955-56 was 5,370, and the number of reconstructions by private persons 6,160.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has not told us what will happen in regard to that type of work in the coming financial year.  The Minister has made no reference whatever to the conference which he is to call between building societies, insurance companies and representatives of local authorities with a view to considering whether the building of houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act can be continued at the rate that has obtained.  I thought the Minister would make some announcement on that matter and indicate that some progress has been made.</P>

      <P>The Minister bluffed a great deal a couple of weeks ago.  I shall come to that.  When a deputation called on the Minister, he made a definite promise that, in order to try to overcome the difficulties that had arisen as a result of the impossibility of securing finances for this type of work, as done hitherto, he would use his influence and his good offices to bring together building societies, insurance companies and the local authority with a view to seeing if some way could be devised whereby the money would be made available from these lending bodies rather than that the corporation should have to raise it. The Minister indicated at the time that he would introduce legislation almost immediately to enable the Government and the local authority to participate in a form of guarantee to these lending authorities where they would give an advance against a house greater than they normally would give in ordinary business transactions.</P>

Did the Minister for Finance here to-day not indicate that there was a general falling away of capital moneys available for capital development purposes?

The Minister will not deny it.  With the best will in the world, the corporation went along to do the housing.  The Minister for Local Government did something else.  He appointed a housing director to the Dublin Corporation to be directly responsible to him.  There was no suggestion of dallying by any particular group of the Dublin Corporation themselves.  That housing director still exists.  The finding of the money was the responsibility of the Government.</P>

      <P>Pre-1948, at the end of the war, when it was possible to begin again with the housing programme, the then Government took the same line and the same attitude so that there is no precedent whatever for what happened last year.  The Dublin Corporation have always suggested that it would be far better for the Government to give the money to the corporation out of the local loans fund, as they do to all other local authorities except Cork City, and have always pointed out the stupidity of a local authority competing with the Government in the market for money&mdash;two applicants, each putting up the price of money against the other.  We have now reached the stage, through this bungling and this lack of appreciation of a situation, where every local authority in Ireland is competing against one another for the securing of the few pounds that they need, putting up the interest rate on one another because there is no money in the Local Loans Fund.  That is a stupid business, bungling.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with an interjection by the Parliamentary Secretary, who apparently needs to be fully informed.  We have been told we may borrow.  We prepared a list of some 50 names of insurance companies and big businesses and we wrote to all of them to know if they had any money available or were likely to have any available within the coming financial year.  We received back one offer of £500,000 from the Insurance Corporation of Ireland at 5½ per cent. and we are awaiting sanction from the Minister to complete that transaction because we have approved of it.</P>

The Minister has responsibility to-day for his policy for the coming year and part of his policy should be to see that the building of small dwelling loan houses will not cease.  Is that admitted? In connection with that, the only instrument that he is able to prepare, to help it continue even in a reduced form, is to bring in legislation to enable the local authorities to join with the Government in giving guarantees to these lending bodies where they lend money to applicants in excess of the percentage they usually give.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the most astounding nonsense.  I am asking the Minister, if he has not said it already, will he make a note of what he proposes to do?  A conference was to be called.  The Minister says we are making great progress, but I was in the process of pointing out that we had contacted about 50 institutions and so far we have received an offer, which we have accepted, of an advance of £500,000 for the coming 12 months at 5½ per cent. which is awaiting the sanction of the Minister.  We also received another offer of £250,000, but at 6 per cent., and that was the only other offer we got.  For fear I might sabotage the first offer at 5½ per cent., we decided to accept it at 5½ per cent., but not to pay 6 per cent. because the other people might have withdrawn and said: &ldquo;If you are paying So-and-So 6 per cent., you will have to pay us 6 per cent.&rdquo;  So we took the offer at 5½ per cent.  In the case of the other offer, we are now negotiating to see if we can get it at less than 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>What I want to emphasise is that the £250,000 will soon be gone, as far as we are concerned.  The Limerick Corporation applied for a loan of £49,000 from the Local Loans Fund at 5¼ per cent., the established rate, but they did not get a &ldquo;bob&rdquo;.  So they went to this institution and they got their £49,000 at 5½ per cent.  That means there is a little less in the kitty now for us.  The Dún Laoghaire Corporation have been expecting week after week to get £200,000 for small dwellings loans to which they are committed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
