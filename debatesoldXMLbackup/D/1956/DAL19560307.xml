Representatives of the local interests have been interviewed by officers of my Department and by the Industrial Development Authority; and they have been given information and guidance likely to be of assistance to them in formulating a specific industrial proposal.  The Deputy will appreciate that the starting of an industry in any area is primarily a matter for private enterprise and initiative but if local interests succeed in formulating any sound industrial project for Enniscorthy I will do everything in my power to assist in bringing it to fruition.</P>

      <P>The total amount of premiums collected here in 1954 by non-Irish owned insurance companies and by syndicates of Lloyd's underwriters was £10,033,703.  This figure relates only to insurance business particulars of which are required to be furnished under the Insurance Acts of 1909 and 1936 and does not, therefore, include marine, aviation and transit business to which the Acts do not refer and for which returns are not required to be made by the companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising my supplementary question on this point. In view of the fact that a number of retired bus drivers fear their particular claim may not have received the consideration it deserved, they have asked me to inquire from the Minister if he is aware that many of these drivers who retired after giving 35 to 37 years' exemplary service to C.I.E. were getting pensions of 37/6 a week if married, plus a national health allowance of 36/- a week but that when they reached the age of 70 the pensions were reduced from 37/6 a week to 6/- and the national health allowance of 36/- ceased, so that the total allowance left to those men at the age of 70 was 30/- a week&mdash;a drop from £3 13s. 6d. a <Col N="8" /> week to 30/-.  Will the Minister ensure that in the new scheme now being contemplated, due regard will be taken of the circumstances in the cases concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, the facts are as stated by the Deputy.  It is because of the fact that the pension scheme was so unsatisfactory that the Government, at my request, directed C.I.E. to submit proposals for the provision of reasonable pension conditions. It was because of the fact that the union concerned and the other unions associated with them felt that the scheme was not being submitted with sufficient promptitude that last week's difficulties arose.  I think however that the settlement of the matter in regard to the amended pensions scheme will see the light of day before any abnormal period of time is allowed to elapse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question. I want to ask the Minister whether the case submitted on behalf of the bus drivers by Deputy McQuillan could not be submitted with equal force on behalf of plate-layers and workers in various other categories employed by C.I.E. and is it not a fact that their pensions are subject to the same reductions when they leave after over 70 years?</P>

      <P>I was already aware of that fact and if I had not been aware of it, it was certainly brought to my notice during 16 hours of constant negotiation last week-end.  I can assure the Deputy that, while Deputy McQuillan mentions only bus drivers, the claim made by the organisations concerned affects approximately 12,000 to 14,000 workers many of whom are <Col N="9" /> not bus drivers but are attached to other grades.</P>

      <P>There has been no delay in connection with the payment of the £5 grant in respect of children in Gaeltacht areas.  In fact, due to the introduction, in respect of the school-year 1954-55, of a new procedure in connection with applications for this bonus, payment has already been made in respect of over 75 per cent. of the total number of children qualifying for the bonus in the previous school-year, whereas on the corresponding date in 1955 payment had been made in the case of less than 50 per cent. of these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The non-payment of the bonus in the remaining cases is due to the necessity of having investigations carried out locally in each case in regard to one or both of the two essential conditions <Col N="10" /> which must be fulfilled before payment may be allowed, namely, (i) that Irish is the language of the child's home and (ii) that the child has attended school regularly during the school-year in respect of which the grant is being sought.</P>
    <P>These investigations are being made with all possible expedition and it is hoped that in the great majority of cases, payment will have been made before the end of the present month in respect of those qualifying for the bonus in question.</P>

Consequently, the points I wished to make to him need not necessarily be made now; in any event I have already communicated with him about the points I had in mind and I understand they will be satisfactorily dealt with.  I am sorry the Taoiseach has left because I wanted to remind him that when the National Development Fund was first introduced, the Taoiseach, in addition to the other comments to which I referred last week, pointed out to this House with a certain amount of contempt the type of work that the special works department of the Dublin Corporation were carrying out with the money supplied from this fund.  In particular, he made reference to the work being carried out on the River Dodder.  I wonder is the Taoiseach of the same opinion to-day as he was when he gave expression to that contemptuous remark originally? I understand the Minister for Local Government himself inspected the works and the improvements done on the River Dodder and found himself in complete accord with the type of work that is being done.  He expressed satisfaction at the great improvements from every point of view that have taken place there and said that this money is well spent.</P>

Deputy O'Donovan does not even know the expenditure on what he is complaining about.  Every single pound that is spent must be approved and sanctioned by two Departments.  On one occasion one of our plans was held up because the Department of Finance was not satisfied that the labour content was high enough and they figured out that there was only something like a 20 per cent. labour content.  When it was re-examined, as in accordance with all the operations under this scheme, it was found that the average labour content from the point of view of the money spent was somewhere around 50 per cent.  In some cases it is as high as 70 per cent.  The purpose of the National Development Fund is to give employment to as many as possible of our unemployed people.  We heard in answer to a question to-day that there are on the live register in the City of Dublin 30,000 unemployed at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out with reference to the Dodder, the Parliamentary Secretary did not know what he was talking about.  He could see what the expenditure was in an afternoon's walk.  He is not able to tell us what is the employment content of that expenditure nor has he stood up here to say that he has found fault with the work other than that he thinks it cost too much.  We are dealing with a Vote here that was originally introduced for the purpose of bringing relief to the unemployed people, to give them work so that they would have a week's wages coming in for a number of weeks of the year.  We have employed that money to the extent that it is being made available.  As I said last Thursday to the Minister, as far as Dublin Corporation is concerned, in connection with the administration from his Department's point of view in the giving of certain money, we have no grievance. We have been treated fairly.  Our schemes have been examined with promptness and have been sanctioned without delay.  Money has been made available to us in advance of our requiring it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> What I did say on last Thursday, and what I wish to repeat with emphasis, is that the Minister might recognise that we are on the eve of additional unemployment in greater numbers and, while we have a Department now in operation, dealing with a programme of work for 350 men per week under the scheme, we could easily employ 1,200 men.  I have asked the Minister to keep in mind the advisability of making available larger sums of money in the near future when this unemployment crisis which I see coming will be upon us, so that we will not be faced with an outcry from the people as a result of this not being available.</P>
    <P>This slush fund, as it was called when first introduced, has now become&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Father Christmas fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was called a Father Christmas fund and I take it the Parliamentary Secretary wants to grow a beard and become Father Christmas now.  This fund is being continued.  If it was as bad as it was suggested it was, why is it being continued?  It is more necessary to-day than when it was introduced.  It was introduced because people saw in advance what was coming.</P>
      <P>When I addressed the Minister, through the Chair, on Thursday last, I asked him to recognise that we are reaching in our operation of this particular section of the Dublin Corporation the planning of long-term schemes, schemes which require more technical examination and design than some of the preliminary smaller operations with which we began.  We want to have in the pigeon-holes of the office of that Department schemes already designed and, possibly approved, to be put into operation without delay when it is felt that that has become necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who do not take a serious view of this matter, who hold in ridicule the operations of the local authority concerned and the granting of this money, should try to find out more about it.  I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government to a tour, <Col N="33" /> either in his own car or in one of our engineers' cars, to examine all the work we have done under the scheme. It may take him a few afternoons.  We will have with us particulars of the cost of each particular operation. When he has done that, let him come back here and tell us that it is a wilful waste of State money.  Does not he know very well that there is a fine comb put through all these things in the Department of Finance and in the Department of Local Government? Does not he know that our engineers have to submit their suggestions to scrutiny by departmental engineers and that our finance officers have to submit their estimates to scrutiny and examination by the officers or representatives of the Department of Finance? Judging by the way the Parliamentary Secretary looks on this, one would imagine that the Minister for Finance blandly throws us £500,000 and says, &ldquo;Have a go&rdquo;, and, like Wilfred Pickles, says, &ldquo;Give him the money&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance does not operate in that way.  No Minister for Finance operates in that way. The financial wizard thinks he does.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to get up here, examine the economics of this matter, relate it to the humanitarian aspect and tell us where this is wasteful expenditure.  We are not taking the smell out of the river Dodder.  We have made a very substantial improvement.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will get up in this debate and give us the benefit of this secret knowledge which he has so successfully withheld from us since he came into this House.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary cannot get away with cross-road speeches that cannot be easily dealt with.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to consider this matter seriously.  I want him to say that, now that this National Development Fund has come to stay, so long as we have uncertainty in the matter of constant and full employment, the fund can and will be added to as occasion arises.  I want him also to say that, from the information made available to him as to how the money was expended, he is satisfied it was spent in the best possible way under all the circumstances.  I believe the Minister would be the first to refuse to give sanction to any scheme if he thought it was not in the best interests.

I want to learn.  If we are making mistakes in the administration of this fund, I want to be told it because, if we made fewer mistakes &mdash;if we are making mistakes at all&mdash;the easier it will be to get more money from his colleague, the Minister for Finance.

      <P>I want to speak only for a moment.  In answer to Deputy Briscoe, I want to say that there is a scheme which I think should have been included in the work which was done by the Dublin Corporation. There is a road in Sandymount leading to Guildford Terrace in which there is a large number of houses.  The appearance and condition of that road are a disgrace to Dublin Corporation.  I understand that was excluded from this scheme and other scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I should like to say that I was very interested in the discussion that took place between the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Briscoe. It indicates clearly to me, as a Deputy from a remote part of this country, that the bulk of the money in the National Development Fund is expended in or around Dublin.  That is well borne out by the fact that we are witnessing this struggle between the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Briscoe as to the amount of money that was thrown around.  Into the bargain, Deputy Briscoe was able to tell us that both the Departments of Finance and Local Government have no obstacles at all to put in the way of any of the schemes which Dublin Corporation submits to the Department.  So we are told by Deputy Briscoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That was about as accurate as the rest of his observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that was the impression that I got&mdash;that this money is very flúirseach and that it is thrown around in a flathamhaileach <Col N="37" /> manner so far as Dublin Corporation is concerned.  The only thing I should like to say about the National Development Fund is that I think we should remove the word &ldquo;national&rdquo;, because it is not operating on a national basis.  I would like the present Minister for Finance to bear that fact in mind and to administer this fund on a national basis in accordance with its title.</P>
      <P>Each of us knows that Dublin is the capital of Ireland, a big city and entitled, if you like, to special treatment from the Government, but Dublin is a part of Ireland where we all claim there is too much centralisation and, as compared with the rest of the country, it is top heavy.  We have factories of all descriptions, giving employment particularly in the industrial field and, I think, taking everything into account, the position so far as the rest of the country is concerned, could be said to be comparatively good.  Here, on the 29th February, we got a statement as to how some of this money has been expended and I am making the case that so far as the constituency I represent&mdash;West Cork&mdash;is concerned, none of the money ever finds its way down there.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that we have to live just as the people in Dublin City have to live, and I claim, as a representative of that area, that we are not getting the share of public funds to which we are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made many references to unemployed people in and around Dublin.  We have unemployed people down in Cork, particularly in the western portion of that county, and, unfortunately, over all the years we have substantial pockets of unemployment. I thought one of the aims of this National Development Fund was to give grants for suitable works in any area where a definite pocket of unemployment existed.  I want to know from the Minister when he is replying if I, or any other Deputy representing a rural constituency, submit facts and figures to him as to the number of unemployed in that particular district coupled with suitable schemes that could be put into operation, will not these submissions be examined under <Col N="38" /> the National Development Fund?  Is there a likelihood of getting money from this fund to carry out these works and give much-needed employment?</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay this House and my main purpose in intervening in this debate was to protest strongly at the manner in which the fund is being administered.  To my mind the expenditure out of this fund is mainly confined to populous centres in the country&mdash;Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Dublin City.  I feel quite sure that the areas around the west coast would be in the same position as West Cork. All these places are forgotten.  I want to tell the Minister and the Government that we, as rural Deputies, are not going to come to Dublin a couple of hundred miles and sit silently in these benches while we believe, and can support our contentions, that these areas are not getting fair play.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the whole question of the distribution of the National Development Fund.  Let him forget Dublin; the Dublin people are very close to his Department and can be in and out every day of the week with their submissions and grievances, imaginary or otherwise.  The people who are more than 200 miles removed from Dublin cannot walk into the Department and seldom or ever do they come to Dublin.  They expect their representatives to do the job for them, and one of these jobs that I have to do is to see that we will get a fair share of that money.  I, therefore, ask that this whole question be re-examined and I hope that when this measure comes before the House again in 12 months' time I will not have to make the same submission as I, unfortunately, had to make to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is most essential that this fund should be subsidised even more than it is because, at the moment, we have quite a number of people unemployed and, as far as my information goes, more people are losing their employment.  In all countries of the world when unemployment becomes bad from time to time, the first step is to try to give employment through a department of <Col N="39" /> public works.  I am led to believe that, during the past year, the provision of moneys through the National Development Fund, which I and other Deputies here interested in the welfare of all sections welcomed at that period, was very skimpy.  I believe there is still a lot to be done in the administration of that fund.  I have been trying to get some works carried out in my own constituency, some in Dublin Corporation area and some in Dublin County Council area, and there is a slowing up in making available money for these necessary works. I feel this slowing down is a retrograde step and that at least this very necessary work should be carried on through the National Development Fund.</P>
      <P>There is no use saying here or elsewhere that the spending of a certain amount of money on such works is a loss of public money.  I hold that while there are thousands unemployed in the country such expenditure is not a loss, if it helps to relieve unemployment to a certain extent and if it assists a man to keep his wife and family in a reasonable degree of comfort. Sometimes we hear people saying we should tighten up and not spend money in the way we intended to spend it out of this fund.  That may be so.  I believe in economy to a degree but I say that the purpose of this fund was to try and relieve unemployment and for that purpose I believe the fund should be more highly subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our circumstances here cause more and more emigration as time goes on and I think that, to the utmost of our ability, we should try to use funds of this kind to stem that emigration. This is a national necessity.  No words of mine could adequately illustrate how serious this tide of emigration is. What is going to be the end of this country?  Surely we should try to adopt the methods employed in other countries to eradicate unemployment and accordingly to stem emigration.  In other countries, a considerable amount of work was undertaken through public work departments in order to relieve unemployment.  Of course we have the Board of Works here and I should like <Col N="40" /> to see its activities more and more highly extended.  I do not want to repeat myself but I would urge on the Minister to bring this fund to his assistance in his efforts to relieve unemployment and emigration.  From a small portion of my own constituency there is growing emigration; people are going from there by the score and their numbers have increased considerably in recent months.  Because of all these considerations, I ask the Minister to see that this is a substantially endowed fund to relieve this state of affairs.</P>

      <P>This debate seems to give an opportunity to the Deputies opposite to shed crocodile tears over unemployment and emigration.  It is a well-known fact that, at the present time, there is less unemployment and less emigration than there has been for some years past; in fact, I cannot see at all how the questions of emigration and unemployment should be connected with this Vote.  Deputy Briscoe when speaking referred to this National Development Fund as something set up for a real national purpose.  The setting up of the National Development Fund was really a humbug and a hoax; it was set up after the introduction of the 1952 Budget, the provisions of which caused a considerable increase in unemployment in this country.</P>
      <P>The fund was set up in order to give the Fianna Fáil Government of the time something to show that they were doing something for the people.  In fact, I believe there was never any money in this fund at all because after all the money is voted to the various Departments for certain purposes.  This fund is supposed to be controlled by the Minister for Finance and, I suppose, by the Minister for Local Government. But the works carried out through it could really be undertaken by the Office of Public Works, by the Department of Local Government, by the Department of Lands and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe challenged the Minister to repeal this Act but I think if he did so it would make no difference at all because money could still be made available by the Government for the different purposes for which it can <Col N="41" /> be allocated under this fund.  While Deputy Briscoe seemed to insinuate that the money should be principally devoted to Dublin, I agree with Deputy M.P. Murphy that there is an inclination, perhaps, to forget there is such a thing as the undeveloped areas and the Gaeltacht, districts far distant from Dublin.</P>
    <P>In 1954 when the present Minister came into office he allocated to my constituency the sum of £10,000 for the improvement of a road in regard to which we had been agitating for a very long time.  I ask him again, if there is still money in the fund, to take note of the fact that we still have some roads in the Gaeltacht that have been submitted either to his Department or to the Department of Local Government for improvement by way of steam-rolling and so on, and I hope that, when money is allocated in the near future, he will remember South Kerry and our requirements there.  In fact, that is really what I stood up to speak about.  I know full well that the Minister will be sympathetic and practical and, through his sympathy, I hope to see South Kerry and other such areas getting their fair shares of the moneys allocated out of the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know which voice of the Fianna Fail Party is their official voice. I suppose one may take it, from the order in which speeches were made, that it must be the voice expressed in the speeches made by deputies Walsh and Derrig rather than that heard in the speech made by Deputy Briscoe. Deputies Walsh and Derrig attacked me because I did not utilise this fund more for production and because I allocated too much of the moneys from the fund towards projects that were going to give employment.  As the members of the House listening to him heard, Deputy Briscoe said that the sole purpose of the fund was to ensure there would be employment.  I think quite frankly that none of the Deputies concerned can have heard what I said when opening the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said then, and I want to repeat now, that as far as the allocations I will make from this fund are concerned, the first test that will be made is that <Col N="42" /> of assisting production.  We are in a situation in which our anxiety must be directed to ensuring that production is permanently increased and any project that will aim at a real increase in production will have very sympathetic consideration from me when it comes before me, but it must be in circumstances in which it is clear that there is a real productive appeal, if I may use the word, in respect of the project.  This &mdash; when our balance of payments is adverse &mdash; is not the time to utilise this fund for expansion in directions other than those which our balance of payments circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>I was taken to task a couple of times during the course of the debate because I was continuing the fund at all.  When speaking on this Estimate last year, I said two courses were open to me&mdash; that I could either have thrown the whole idea overboard or taken the weapon, so to speak, as forged by the previous Government even though I did not think it was the most likely way.  I chose the second course.  I do not think it is desirable that immediately there is a change in administration there should at once be the wiping out of all the arrangements made by the previous Administration.  While, if I had the handling of this matter in the beginning, I might have moved in a different way, I felt last year and I still feel that I should implement this Act to the best of my ability.</P>
    <P>Deputies used this debate to advocate schemes in their different constituencies on an individual and detailed basis rather than to deal with the handling of the money in the fund as a whole.  It would be difficult for me to follow each Deputy down his own particular lane in his own particular constituency, but I would like to refer to a few of the projects mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen, Deputy James Tully and others referred to the question of coast erosion and they spoke of what was done in Bray with regard to coast erosion.  In Bray there was a specific bit of storm damage in respect of property which was already subject to maintenance.  Every Deputy in the House will agree with me in that the real essential thing in any approach to <Col N="43" /> the question of coast erosion is to provide adequate arrangements for maintenance.</P>
    <P>There never have been any arrangements about maintenance in regard to coast erosion before and there have not been any arrangements to ensure that work done to prevent coast erosion will be maintained.  I will be producing proposals to this House at an early date to indicate, for the first time, the measures the Government proposes to take to assist local authorities to avoid the damage that coast erosion causes.  I would ask the Deputies concerned to await that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass opened by a reference to a provision of £200,000 for the building of roads for the hand-won turf stations.  The history of those stations is not a very happy one, I am afraid. I do not know whether this is the right Estimate in which to go into that question but when the day does come fully to discuss the matter Deputy Lemass, I think, will find that his part in that transaction does not do him any credit. I understood his remarks to mean that there ought to be a special provision made for the production of turf for these stations.  If I correctly understood him, I want to make it clear that that statement is in direct contradiction to the instructions he gave the E.S.B. in relation to this matter.  The position in respect of these small hand-won turf stations is that two will be completed this year and two more next year.  Whether there will be any turf for them is another matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara referred to the unpleasant experiences some of his constituents are having at Lacken Strand, Ballina.  He suggested that this fund might provide an appropriate method of dealing with the problem.  The Deputy has been very persistent in bringing this matter to the notice of various Ministers and Departments in the interests of his constituents but I would be less than frank if I did not make it quite clear that this is not a productive scheme of the kind I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to the Gaeltacht allocation.  The expenditure to <Col N="44" /> date is £111,000.  There are other projects at present under examination for allocation.  That £111,000 is part of the total of £250,000 that is referred to in the reply to the question put down by Deputy Aiken last week in which I gave full details of the amounts allocated prior to the 2nd June, 1954 and the amounts allocated since.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh, in the course of a fairly long speech, made reference to many items and plans which, he said, were there and could be dealt with at once.  I do not propose to go into the long list he read out, but I would, perhaps, test his accuracy on one item alone.  When he was speaking he gave us a long dissertation on the wonderful plans and projects which he had left behind him for providing interest free money and money at reduced interest rates for farmers, for fertilisers in particular.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh must think that everybody else, his colleagues as well as the people on this side of the House who have recourse to Government files, are complete fools.  Deputy Walsh, when Minister for Agriculture, did bring a project like that to the Government of the day in December, 1953, but the Deputy should not have the audacity to speak of plans he left behind him without telling the House also that those plans, submitted to the Government on the 5th and 18th January, 1954, were rejected by the Government of which he was a member.  Far from being accepted by the previous Government what that Government did in fact decide to do on the 26th January, 1954, was to charge 5 per cent. interest.  I find it quite impossible to regard Deputy Walsh's contribution to this debate with any sincerity when I know what occurred in respect of that particular item of which I happened to have some knowledge before.</P>
    <P>The actual reference by the Deputy was this: &ldquo;For that scheme it was suggested that interest-free loans should be issued to farmers or loans at 2 per cent. interest at the most.&rdquo; That is a quotation from Deputy Walsh at the beginning of last Thursday's debate.  The Deputy was Minister for Agriculture in a Government which decided that that proposal was to be <Col N="45" /> thrown overboard and that the advances were to bear interest at 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Is it possible to have any regard for the speech of an ex-Minister who deliberately distorts, for political parposes, the actions of the Government of which he was a member?  I could go down the various lists of allocations and show the House how they were made.  Let me just content myself with saying that since June, 1954, the test that I have applied to the new allocations that came before me was the test of whether they would bring productive results.</P>
    <P>In certain cases there were already existing commitments which I felt it my duty to carry on.  One of those was an allocation to the Road Fund. Deputy Childers speaking this time last year praised allocations from the National Development Fund to the Road Fund.  Deputy Derrig took a different line the other day.  Now I agree with the line taken by Deputy Derrig, not with that taken by Deputy Childers, because I want the allocations from this fund to show really productive results and not the results that mere road works would produce.  I must consider allocations from the fund in a general way and not by reference to any particular part of the country.</P>
    <P>It is grossly untrue for Deputy Briscoe, or anyone else, to suggest that the allocations are made solely, or mainly, to Dublin or in the Dublin area.  That is certainly not true.  A look at the list of the various projects should, I think, satisfy anybody in that respect.  I think Deputy Briscoe was only trying to emphasise the importance of the committee to which he referred; but I warn Deputies that national economic circumstances in which expansionist programmes from the National Development Fund can be undertaken in respect of schemes that will not be fully self-financing and schemes that will not be fully productive are entirely different now when, remember, the balance of payments is running adversely against us than they would be when we have a satisfactory external trade position.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The House may remember that early last year when speaking on the Vote for my Department for the current financial year, I mentioned that I had had discussions with the Industrial Development Authority on the question of visiting countries abroad with the object of interesting foreign industrialists in establishing industries in this country.  As a result of these discussions, two members of the Industrial Development Authority visited Sweden in March last and were received most cordially.  The results of that visit were so encouraging that I arranged that similar visits would be made to Western Germany, Belgium, the United States and possibly to some other countries.</P>
      <P>A further visit was made to Sweden in October last by a member of the authority, and in November visits were made by two members of the authority and my economic adviser to Germany and Belgium.  Discussions took place with 40 concerns in Sweden, 30 in Germany and 18 in Belgium. These figures do not include discussions with banks, local chambers of commerce, Government Departments and the like.  I have been advised that out of these contacts a number of proposals have emerged that show reasonable prospects.  The Industrial Development Authority are now pursuing the various proposals and it is hoped that, as in the case of Sweden, where two definite schemes have reached an advanced stage, further progress in the industrial development of our country will result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have now arranged that, following my recent visit to the United States <Col N="47" /> where, in industrial circles, I found a lively interest in this country, a delegation similar to that which visited Germany and Belgium will visit the United States for three weeks or so.  I have every hope from the reception I received and the interest that was shown in my mission to that country that the outcome of the delegation's visit will be fruitful.</P>
    <P>The expenditure involved by these visits and by the publication of attractive brochures setting out the advantages Ireland has to offer foreign industrialists was not anticipated when the original Estimate was being framed.  It is necessary for me, therefore, to seek the Dáil's approval of an estimated additional expenditure of £5,000 on sub-head P (1), to cover the cost of travelling and incidental expenditure of the members of the Industrial Development Authority, including the cost of publication and distribution of the brochure; £5,000 on sub-head P (2) to meet the cost of additional staff assigned to the authority, and £2,000 on sub-head P (3) to meet the extra travelling and incidental expenses of the staff assisting the authority in their various missions abroad.  As, however, the total additional expenditure of £12,000 can be met out of savings on other sub-heads of the Vote, I am asking for a token Supplementary Vote of £10 to enable the saving to be utilised to defray the extra expenditure involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible to have a very prolonged discussion on the question of the work of the Industrial Development Authority but, while we, on this side of the House, are quite prepared to sanction a vote for money for the Industrial Development Authority in a general way, bearing in mind the need for more industries and growth in our exports, I think it should be stated that in the course of the last few months the Minister has, by his various declarations, given the people the idea that he looks forward to foreign capital investment as a major contribution to further industrial effort here.  From that standpoint, I think we can only adopt a highly critical attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> In our view, the whole economic climate has changed since 1947 in a very fundamental way.  The loss by the British people of their foreign investments, the adoption of a full employment policy and the collaboration between the English and American nations in capital development projects abroad has resulted in a demand for labour in Great Britain which, in turn, along with other influences, has stimulated emigration to a point where, I think, we have to alter our attitude towards the whole problem of industrial development here.  As the Minister knows, our external trade is now vital to our existence to an even greater extent than heretofore; and the Minister is aware that, when a native industry starts, or any kind of industry, unless there is a very considerable labour content in that industry, the effect on the balance of payments, on our general trade position and our capacity to maintain our standard of living may be absolutely negligible.  The Minister has, no doubt, been given information by his officials that the position in that regard has changed very considerably and that, while it is an excellent thing to provide employment, if the effect of any new industrial endeavour, taking it by and large, is that people are unable to buy the necessary imports which they require and if it does not increase their purchasing power abroad, then, however desirable such a project may be, it may not in the long run afford the worker the security which he or she needs for his or her future livelihood. In other words, the very employment given may tend to create a new problem which would be to the disadvantage of the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>We feel that the Government as a whole have not studied with sufficient care or emphasis all the possible measures that could be devised for stimulating home investment, home industries, or encouraging the business community here to seek foreign technical aid, foreign know-how, foreign techniques and to apply those to the manufacture of articles or commodities which, under our present circumstances, should relate to a considerable degree to exports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> That leads, in turn, to the whole problem of the low investment rate in this country.  As the Minister knows, the rate of investment has decreased considerably since 1953.  The rate of saving has decreased in real terms and we have lost since 1948 some £186,000,000 of our foreign savings, the vast proportion of which should have been invested in home industries and home agriculture.  The Minister's colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, themselves have been given very definite warnings about the present financial state of the country, about the adverse balance of payments and the fact that many of the apparently good characteristics of our economy at the moment are themselves of a purely fugitive character.</P>
    <P>There is not sufficient home capital investment and any Government in office will have to face the difficulties that have arisen and which partly relate to the British economic scene and partly to the fact that we have never yet, on either side of the House, persuaded the private interests in this country to devote a sufficient proportion of their savings to new industries. With the exception of the Finance Bill associated with the new mining project, in which some definite incentive was offered to those who would take part in certain types of mining projects of a very limited character, nothing substantial has been done since 1954 to stimulate home investment.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of these problems related to taxation for enterprises in their first and subsequent initial years of operation and in relation to depreciation allowance and taxation on profits of new export industries.  There are all sorts of propositions which the Minister could consider in this regard.  Although we welcome any effort made to improve industry here, we hope the Minister is considering, for example, ways and means of providing still further technical information for would-be industrialists who would like to export and whether, for example, the resources of Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, are sufficient to enable that work to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find that there is universal agreement on a great deal of <Col N="50" /> these matters.  Our difficulty is to find a consistent attitude as among the various members of the present Government as to any courageous positive policies.  He will find there is, for the first time since 1947, an admission by both the present Government and the Opposition as to the serious economic position of the country, and a universally accepted warning has been given that there must be an expansion of our exports.  As the Minister will find out from O.E.E.C., the investment of private resources here is less than that of most European countries as a percentage of national production or as a percentage of our national resources. We wish to emphasise that everything must be done to persuade all the business interests here concerned that there must be an all-out effort at increased production and an all-out effort at exporting commodities for which we can find markets.</P>
    <P>Related to that there must be an all-out effort at improved management by the investigation of management methods to bring down the home price of our commodities so as to encourage, in turn, greater exports.  The Minister could do a great deal of good if he would stimulate by every means the greater efficiency of our existing industries so as to enable them to find foreign markets.  We would be very glad to see a small supplementary sum made available for that purpose in this Estimate.  The necessity of making home industries more efficient and doing everything to stimulate exports would seem to have at least as great an importance as the attraction of foreign capital to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to confine my remarks to pointing out that we are aware of the good work that is being done by the Industrial Development Authority, and that we take a reserved, but interested, attitude in the seeking of foreign capital abroad. We would like to press upon the Minister, however, the desirability of stimulating investment here and of enabling Irishmen who are in association <Col N="51" /> with foreign interests or otherwise to stimulate production.  Apart from that, I might mention that a number of the Minister's speeches have been reported in newspapers here from sources abroad and I think it is quite possible that the country as a whole has had a wrong impression on occasions of the extent to which the Minister has, in fact, been encouraging foreign companies here.  Although the Minister has at various times corrected certain impressions he has received, I think the time has come when the Minister should make a more succinct and detailed statement as to the type of foreign interest which he would like to come here, that he should indicate more specifically the type of products which he would like them to manufacture, the type of products which he would consider they should largely export, the type of products which he considers foreign interests could be permitted to manufacture largely for home consumption, and the extent to which he will at least insist that there should be an Irish shareholding in particular concerns or the association of Irish directors, of Irish capital interests.</P>
      <P>From reading some of the Minister's speeches &mdash; I want to be quite fair to the Minister; it may be due to the way he was reported to some extent &mdash; the country has got the impression that the invitation is very widespread.  In view of the fact that in connection with capital investments from abroad, exported interests and profits on them are of no benefit to us in our efforts to pay for imports, in view of the fact that certain types of capital investments here are likely to be of a fugitive character and that it is unlikely that anyone would invest money here with a patriotic motive so far as this country is concerned, we think it is opportune for the Minister at some convenient moment to restate in a very definite way the principles upon which his campaign is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fully recognise that, with certain types of manufacture, he may have to go beyond what has been the custom up to now, namely, a combination of Irish and foreign enterprise, a combination <Col N="52" /> of Irish and foreign capital, in some cases a wholly foreign enterprise. We realise that, in seeking to expand our industries, changes have been necessary.  In fact, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce himself in speaking some years ago, agreed that the technique of Government assistance would obviously have to alter.  At the same time, we should like the Minister to state for the benefit of the House, as specifically as he can, the principles he has adopted in this matter and the limitations in regard to the types of the product and the extent to which there can be no participation of Irish capital or of Irish interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <P>I want briefly to say that the people, particularly the business people, do feel that the departure that this Vote signifies is the kind of activity that is very welcome and that should be productive of very satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers' rather pious and academic contribution should not divert us from thinking about the detail of what we are doing now, the expenditure of money in sending people abroad to establish normal, businesslike contacts with business people abroad.  Outside any discussion on the economics or on the trend of our policies here, I think that kind of activity must be good and I am very hopeful that results will come.  The Vote is small and the people will be very pleased to hear that that expenditure has been found out of savings in the Department.</P>
      <P>I want to pay a brief tribute to the Minister whose name, I think, must be associated with this new departure.  I want, particularly, to thank him for the physical energy and effort that he put into his recent very arduous tour of the United States.  The people want that said.  People have said it to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote is very necessary.  I should like to see even more money provided for this purpose. It is very essential that we should make contacts with other countries.  The previous Government went a long way in encouraging manufacturers to set up industries.  The Tánaiste should have a stock-taking of the number of factories <Col N="53" /> in this country with a view to finding markets for our surplus products.  A number of our factories are on short time.  That trend is continuing.  Manufacturers in other countries have enjoyed freedom for hundreds of years and they are endeavouring to create goodwill in other countries in order to secure markets for their products. Successive Ministers here have tried to find foreign markets and I hope they will continue to do so.  That is very essential.</P>
      <P>The House discussed on many occasions the possibility of improving our export trade.  People from foreign countries have been encouraged to invest their money in this country with a view to national development.  We have a long way to go before we are on equal terms with countries that have enjoyed freedom for hundreds of years. I am anxious, and the Fianna Fáil Party are anxious, from the national point of view, to support any practical suggestion put forward by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the creation of export markets and the development of our national resources.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that more contacts should be made, not only through the Department but through our trade representatives abroad.  There is a big field to be developed.  That can be done only by personal contacts.  A number of manufacturers have undertaken foreign trade on their own initiative.  Certain other manufacturers have not taken the initiative.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could form a body of manufacturers with surplus products whose duty it would be to develop foreign markets for those products, with the aid of our trade representatives abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>While on general lines welcoming anything that may be done to stimulate the establishment of industries and industrial production in this country, we must have regard to the fact that there is a danger at the moment of looking too far afield for aid and neglecting our home resources and the inspiration that should be given to home effort to develop parts of our country where the establishment of industries is absolutely necessary for the <Col N="54" /> economic life of the people.  In certain areas over the past 20 or 30 years the position has fundamentally changed since the British occupation was removed. In the fight for national freedom, when the people looked for support from abroad, our effort never had the measure of success that it achieved when we relied on our own resources, built them up first and then welcomed whatever support we could get for them.</P>
      <P>I would say that our Industrial Development Authority at the present time is too conservative in its approach to these matters.  I know the authority has to be very careful about advancing moneys for the establishment of industries but it sometimes happens that when local industries, backed with technical knowledge and even having foreign markets, look for money for the purpose of expansion, they are disappointed. I do not say that happens very often but in some cases that have come to my knowledge they have failed to get from the Industrial Development Authority additional capital for the expansion of their business and the purchase of materials to fill orders already available in continental markets.</P>
      <P>We ought to be very careful in our approach to that matter.  We ought not to turn the minds of the people from the obvious fact that it is fundamental, in the national interests, to make local effort, to get, as far as is possible, technical knowledge and to encourage factories, where that technical knowledge is available, by financial assistance and otherwise.  Efforts at home and abroad should be co-ordinated in such a way as to give to all our people the necessary impetus and encouragement, and also to encourage whatever help from abroad would enable us to supply the needs which we cannot fill from our own efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the approach to this whole question of inviting foreign technical know-how in the further industrialisation of the country has on the whole been well received, not merely by the political Parties within the State but by the general public as a whole.  Quite frankly, I think it is <Col N="55" /> essential that the possibilities of establishing new industries by this means should be explored.  It may well be that our hopes will be disappointed; it could very well happen that we could get considerable gratification from our successful pioneering efforts in this field, but, at all events, this channel ought to be explored to see what are the possibilities in this direction.  If there are no possibilities, then it is clear to each and every one of us that the further development must come from our own efforts and, if we fail by our own efforts to achieve the necessary further development, then we are going to have with us as long as we live the chronic economic problems which have defied solution over the past 34 years.</P>
      <P>Let us face the facts &mdash; the cruel economic facts of life this world and in this country.  We are perched here on a rock off the coast of western Europe.  That is our position.  Life here is the life that we make it, and the standard of life here will be the standard of living which we will weave for ourselves.  That standard, which we with our own brains and working with our own hands make, is the only standard of life we can enjoy.  The extent to which we exercise our ingenuity will play a bigger part in earning a standard of living here than anything else.  This country is not rich &mdash;we must face facts&mdash;in some of the basic materials that have made other countries rich in spite of themselves. This country has so far not discovered oil or has not so far discovered coal in the quantities that have made other countries great.  This country has been deficient in other basic raw materials and it is because of these facts, facts which cannot be gainsaid, facts which cannot be ignored, that there is imposed on us the still heavier-than-normal burden of trying so to organise our economy that, recognising our deficiencies in the economic field, we can nevertheless make up for these deficiencies by fabricating articles from imported raw materials, and by attaining a standard of excellence in workmanship so as to be able to distribute these in an economically rewarding way throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> There is nobody in the world waiting to-day for any raw materials we have, if indeed we have any raw materials about which the world is excited or interested.  We have no store-house here on which the world casts envious eyes, and our problem is to try to sell the limited quantity we have for export in markets which are highly competitive, in markets in which we can only retain our foothold by our ability to sell there at the keenest possible prices.  If we are to maintain that foothold in these markets, maintain our position in these markets &mdash; substantial in one case, relatively small in most other cases &mdash; we can only do so by the exercise of economic ingenuity and the technical skill possessed by our own people.</P>
    <P>Over the last 30 years various Governments in this country have sought in every way to strengthen in accordance with the dictum of Arthur Griffith, &ldquo;our secondary arm,&rdquo; and during that long period, various Governments, the Opposition as well as this Government, sought in every way to strengthen the economic fabric of the nation along those lines and develop our secondary industries.</P>
    <P>I give credit to all these Governments. Let us recognise this fact.  We gain nothing either nationally or economically by trying to say: &ldquo;We did so-and-so while you only did so-and-so.&rdquo; That is relatively unimportant compared with the problem facing us to-day. The problem facing us to-day, the problem of the disequilibrium in our balance of payments, the problem of of under investment, the problem of unemployment and the economic problem which induces thousands of our people to leave this country every year to make elsewhere commodities which ought to be made here &mdash; these are problems so great in magnitude as to dwarf any of these petty, puny considerations of who did this or who did that.</P>
    <P>What does it matter to the Irish lad working in Birmingham or London who did this or that?  What does it matter to the Irish boy or girl who has had to go to Canada for a living who did this or that?  Is the main problem not to provide them with the answer to <Col N="57" /> the question: &ldquo;Where can I get a decent living?&rdquo;  We can only do that if we all recognise that no matter what Government is in power there is an obligation on all Governments to continue the drive until such time as we can build here an economy which will eliminate many of the evils which are with us to-day.  They were with us 34 years ago and have so far defied solution.</P>
    <P>I considered it would be worth while investigating the possibilities of seeing whether we could develop more industries with outside technical assistance. If there is any industrialist in this country who has even the glimmer of an idea of starting a new industry to produce something which is not at present manufactured here and if there is anything I can do for him, anything my Department can do for him, or the Government can do for him, within the limits of existing legislation, I now publicly invite him to come to the Department of Industry and Commerce and he will get every possible assistance to blow up his ideas in any direction he wishes until such time as we can get from him some concrete project which could be developed to fruition.</P>
    <P>That policy is being tried, and has been tried, by various Governments but, notwithstanding all the efforts and notwithstanding some distinct successes, we still have a situation in which we import a very considerable quantity of goods and, in respect of a substantial proportion of these goods, it may be said it ought to be possible to produce them in Ireland.  I want, first of all, to get Irish industrialists to produce the goods.  I would sooner see these goods produced by Irish industrialists, by Irish firms with Irish capital.</P>
    <P>We have tried to do that over the past 34 years and still we have this vast vacuum in our economy notwithstanding all our efforts.  I still appeal to the Irish industrialists to go out after the establishment of new industries. Every possible assistance will be given to the Irish industrialist to do that, but if we cannot do it in those fields in which we are not noted for our technical ability to do these things, I feel we should tap the possibilities of <Col N="58" /> inviting foreign technical assistance to come in here.  If we are not making a variety of goods to-day because we have not got the requisite technical knowledge, then it seems to me we have got to get the requisite technical knowledge.  If the Irish industrialist will get that technical knowledge and exploit it we will give him every possible help.  But if it cannot be found we cannot sit down and permit our present difficulties to continue either because we are too conservative or too lazy to test out new ideas.</P>
    <P>I want to see these new ideas tested out, to see if there is any possibility of getting from the people who have technical knowledge an interest in investing in Ireland for the purpose of supplying to our people goods which are at present imported, for the purpose of providing employment for our people and for the purpose of enabling us with the goods produced here and perhaps exported from here to pay for the other commodities which we must necessarily import if we are going to maintain the present or indeed a civilised standard of life.  Look at the facts.  In the 12 months of last year we imported £204,000,000 of goods&mdash; physical imports.  We exported in physical exports £110,000,000 worth of goods.  We may fill in the gap by invisible exports in the form of emigrants' remittances, dividends on equity shares and tourism.</P>
    <P>But in the end we are still left with a balance of payments and quite clearly it is an undesirable position that we should have to balance our payments by reliance on such sources of income as emigrants' remittances and the continuance of the tourist industry.  It would be much better from our point of view if we could cut down our imports by inducing our people where possible to buy Irish manufactured goods.  In the £204,000,000 worth of goods which came in last year, and which have been coming in greater or lesser volume every year, there is a substantial quantity of goods for which there are substitute materials here.  If we could induce our people to recognise that every time they bought goods from abroad when the same goods could be bought in Ireland, they were <Col N="59" /> helping to make economic difficulties for the country and economic problems for the people, then we might get down to approaching this problem with an adjusted mentality and we might be able to get into our people's minds a greater consciousness of what is expected of them in so far as their duty to their own country is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are people still tattooed with the idea that if a thing is foreign &mdash; if it is British, American or German &mdash; it must be good.  They probably make a case against the Irish manufacture and say that if it is Irish it is no good because we still have not got the art of making such goods.  Yet every shop window in this city and every factory in the country is a living example of the untruthfulness of such statements. Excellent goods are being made here and exported from here, but unfortunately we still have the mentality which believes that if the same goods are bought outside the country they must be good.</P>
    <P>It is not just my task to kill that idea.  It is the task of the Opposition, of ever man and woman who believe in Ireland, to kill that false economic philosophy.  Whatever our difficulties are, we must get together in killing that notion and in replacing it with the idea that as good articles are manufactured here as are available elsewhere. I have called attention to the fact that our physical exports last year were £110,000,000 and that our imports were £204,000,000.  It is because we have a situation of that kind that we have a balance of payments problem and it is because of that problem that this Government will be compelled to take steps that may have to be stern steps, disagreeable steps, but whether they are stern or disagreeable they must be taken if we are to protect our whole economy against a continuance of a state of affairs which would run down, in the interest of the importation of consumption goods, assets which are very valuable to us from a national viewpoint, from an economic viewpoint and from a political viewpoint.</P>

      <P>Does that figure of <Col N="60" /> £204,000,000 worth of imports include all physical imports and does the figure of £110,000,000 for exports include all physical exports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy will get full information on page 11 of the Trade Statistics of Ireland for 1955 and the month of December of 1955.  It is because of this proportion in our imports as compared with our exports that we must concern ourselves with the problem of exploring every possibility of establishing industries.  I hope the visit of the Industrial Development Authority to certain countries, the visits they are now paying to America and the visits I hope they will pay to other countries will lead to some manifestation in a tangible way of interest by industrialists in those countries in establishing industries in Ireland.  If these people have the technical know-how and if they are willing to bring that technical know-how to Ireland to produce goods for the Irish market and to export these goods, it is good from the point of view that our people will be provided with employment in the making of these goods here instead of being compelled to emigrate and find employment in making them elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be good from the point of view that exports of that kind of commodity will help to pay for our imports.  It will be good from the point of view that commodities imported now will be made in Irish factories and thus will help to reduce the volume of our imports and perhaps enable us to export an increased volume of Irish manufactured goods. This proposition, therefore, has everything to commend it so long as we continue to import that vast quantity of goods, a substantial proportion of which, and this should be underlined, are industrial goods.  I would prefer to see Irish industrialists undertaking this expansion but if that is not possible, I think we must then endeavour to get the technical assistance from any source we can in order to produce these commodities in Ireland. I would prefer that the non-Irish industrialist, and I emphasised this in any talks I had on the subject, would arrange to marry his interest with <Col N="61" /> Irish capital so that you could have Irish money and foreign money invested in an Irish enterprise.</P>
    <P>In other words, you might have enterprise in which the technical know-how was brought in from outside and was bound up with Irish money.  We have many of these industries in the country at the moment where a majority of the shareholders are non-Irish and a very substantial number of new manufacturing licences were issued to such people over the past 20 years to enable them to establish themselves here, even though the capital structure of such companies shows that the Irish shareholders did not have the requisite financial holding to comply with the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>That was done by the last Government in order to get the industries established.  To my mind that was good policy and I have done and will continue to do the same thing in order to encourage the establishment of industries here.  If we cannot get the Irish national to develop and expand industry himself, if we fail to marry the foreign technical know-how with the Irish capital and if we can get the industry established only by giving a new manufacturer's licence to an extern firm, I do not see anything wrong in doing it.  New manufacture licences of that kind have been given by my predecessor on several occasions. I shall do so where it is necessary, but I would impose this one condition &mdash;I have not been prepared, and I am not prepared, to invite foreign capital to come in here and engage in cut-throat competition with an Irish industry which has been established, which is making satisfactory products, and which is paying decent wages and observing decent conditions.  I am not prepared to encourage foreign industries to come in here and compete with Irish industries which have done a good job and are doing a good job and where an invitation to a foreign industrialist could only result in cut-throat competition which is not only economically but nationally destructive.</P>
    <P>I would like to say this, that any foreign industrialists that I met were not simple people and I may say that <Col N="62" /> one of the first questions they asked was: &ldquo;Who is supplying the market at the moment?&rdquo;  They were not interested in coming in here if the market was being supplied at the moment.  Their main interest is to see if there is an opening in the market. The view they would take of an opening is a different view to the one they would take if the market were saturated because of products from Irish sources.  American, German or Swedish industrialists are not interested and have no desire to come in here and produce goods in a market which the Irish firms are operating successfully.</P>
    <P>In case anybody should think that there was an invitation given to foreign industrialists to come in and supply the Irish market which is being supplied from Irish sources, I give Irish industrialists this assurance.  It is not only against my policy to invite foreign industrialists to come here and compete with Irish industrialists, but I shall do everything in my power to ensure that cut-throat competition of that kind will not be permitted or encouraged.  There are gaps in our economy in which we need the technical know-how.  I want to fill these gaps and will do everything possible to see that there will not be such gaps in our economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers raised the question of endeavouring to get foreign technical aid.  I would like to see Irish industrialists take more interest in the possibility of obtaining technical aid. Such technical aid can be found in Europe and I would be prepared to give a substantial contribution to the expenses of existing industries in any effort they may make to secure such technical assistance.  If they have any proposition to put to the Department of Industry and Commerce in that matter such proposition will be examined with the utmost consideration. There are funds available to enable Irish industrialists to send their own technicians to other parts to see how commodities are produced and to secure the needed technical knowledge. A goodly number of grants have been made in such cases.  Grants are still available to assist Irish industrialists <Col N="63" /> to send their own technicians abroad to acquire necessary technical knowledge. Anyone who wants to avail of them is quite welcome to avail of the facilities offered by the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers expressed some concern at some reports in the papers of a speech I made in the United States. I made a speech at the National Press Club in Washington which is probably regarded as one of the best forums in the United States for putting out a point of view.  I was invited to speak there at a luncheon and there were about 600, 700, or 800 journalists present, from editors down to the man on the job writing the actual news.  I made a speech under the little of &ldquo;Ireland's Economic and Social Progress&rdquo;. One portion of that speech contained this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Numerous industries have been set up and expanded and are operating at a high level of efficiency, producing a diversity of goods to supply the needs of the Irish market and, in many cases, competing successfully in export markets with the manufactured products of other nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would not be possible, in a short address of this kind, to detail the list of such industries, but the following may be mentioned by way of illustration: leather and leather goods, sugar and sugar products, cement, textiles and wearing apparel, ropes and twines, paper and paper products, flour and flour confectionery, furniture, motor vehicles assembly, rubber products, foundry products, cutlery and hardware goods, earthenware and tableware, glass and glass products, beer and spirits, biscuits, bacon, meat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A copy of that speech was handed to every journalist reporting the function. A report of that speech was cabled from Washington to Dublin.  It was received by the Irish News Agency. The reported version of that speech contained that list of industries, which, as you can see from the context of the speech, are industries which I claim have been established here, but the American reporter said that I was inviting people to Ireland to establish <Col N="64" /> these industries.  Subsequently the actual copy of this document was also sent from America on the same day and went into the Irish News Agency. Thirdly, another copy of this actual speech was released from the Government Information Bureau as soon as it had been confirmed that I had spoken and used the speech.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that I had at least a two-to-one chance of getting the right speech reported.  What happened? The wrong speech was sent out.  I do not know to how many Irish newspapers it was sent, but it appeared in one daily newspaper that I was inviting Americans to come in here to make this list of commodities when, in fact, what I said was that these were commodities which we ourselves were making here at present and that the manufacture of them was evidence of Ireland's economic progress.  That is the kind of torture that one has to face in circumstances of this kind and, as I have not had a suitable opportunity up to the present of correcting that mis-statement, I want to put these facts on record now, assuring Irish industrialists that the garbled report which was sent from the United States as to the type of industries I wanted to establish here was the product of somebody's crazed imagination and does not represent anything that I said on that occasion.  I have a copy of the speech; here it is.  The journalists had this in their hands and a copy was also supplied to the Irish News Agency when it had been confirmed. The strange thing is that, although three copies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised.  Perhaps I had better advert to one particular matter.  Some Fianna Fáil speaker the other day &mdash; I think I know his name but, lest I am incorrect, I do not want to quote a name &mdash; said on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party that, if any of these foreign industries came in here and were permitted to export their dividends, that was no good to Ireland; that was a bad scheme, and I was blamed for permitting them to export their dividends.  I am in goodly company if I have sinned.  Speaking at the New York Commerce and Industry Association on 5th October, 1953, Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The payment of interest and dividends on external investment is freely permitted and capital gains may also be repatriated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass in 1953 was saying substantially the same thing as I have been saying here.  Somebody in the Fianna Fáil Party ought to stop people from saying that what he said, which I think is right, and what I said, which I am sure is right, is wrong; somebody ought to ensure that a colleague does not get the wrong slant, which the particular Deputy was endeavouring to put on this matter.</P>
      <P>While we are on the subject of foreign investment let me quote what Deputy Lemass said at the Ottawa and Canadian Club on 25th September, 1953; critics of inviting foreign investment here may ponder on these words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Canadian economy is expanding so rapidly that it is probable that all Canadian resources, financial and technical, are fully occupied in Canada, but if, in the future, any Canadian business interests should consider that in Ireland, because of any special condition prevailing there or because of its geographical position in relation to European markets, there is scope for Canadian enterprise, they may feel certain they will be warmly welcomed in the expectation that closer commercial <Col N="66" /> relations between the two countries will be mutually beneficial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Lemass, speaking at the New York Commerce and Industry Association on 5th October, 1953, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The expansion of the Irish economy has in the main been financed from Irish resources.  We consider that the time has come, however, when its further progress can be advanced by permitting a limited investment of external capital, provided it is directed to types of development which will increase Irish production capacity or bring with it new techniques which we need.  It is realised that the habit of external investment on private account is not very strong amongst Americans&mdash; notwithstanding their country's strong creditor position &mdash; but it is likely to grow and there are many reasons why it may be attracted to Ireland.  Our geographical position offers easy access to most European markets.  We have a trading position and existing trade agreements which facilitate access to these markets. There is an adequate supply of labour which is highly adaptable to modern industrial methods and capable of very good work.  The payment of interest and dividends on external investments is freely permitted and capital gains may also be repatriated.  Subject to approval in advance of the character of the investment, the total withdrawal of the investment is also permitted. A recently concluded double-taxation agreement protects American investors in Irish industry against an undue tax burden.  There is in the area under the jurisdiction of the Irish State a political situation which can be fairly said to be the most stable in the world.  The principles on which the Irish State is founded and which are expressed in its Constitution, are those which Americans understand and accept. Investment in Ireland is as secure from violent political and social upheavals as in the United States.  We believe that it should be attractive to Americans seeking new outlets for their resources, and they may be <Col N="67" /> assured that if they come to Ireland to participate in Irish industrial expansion they will be heartily welcomed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are the sentiments of Deputy Lemass in 1953.  They were sound.  I think they will stand the test of the next 20 years just as my endeavours in the same field will stand a similar test.  May I make one appeal in conclusion: before Fianna Fáil Deputies speak on this, will they read these two speeches of Deputy Lemass again and thereby save themselves a tremendous amount of embarrassment?</P>

      <P>I did not say that the further development of Irish industry depends exclusively on Irish promotion. I said the opposite.  I said if it were to depend on that, as it has depended in substantial measure up to the present, the outlook would be pretty grim.  It is because I think some of the present gaps can only be filled in by getting foreign technical assistance that I have done what Deputy Lemass did, namely, invited the Americans and the Canadians to come in here to produce the goods we do not at present manufacture ourselves; and it is better that they <Col N="68" /> should be produced here &mdash; in Galway, if necessary, rather than have our Galway boys and girls trying to find jobs in England.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £344,700 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping) Acts, <Col N="69" /> 1894 to 1952, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933); for certain Protective Equipment for Ships; for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate of £500,000 for the State's share of the G.N.R. revenue losses and capital expenditure has proved insufficient to meet the Board's requirements up to the 31st March, 1956.  It is necessary to provide a further sum of £396,398 by way of Supplementary Estimate bringing the total provision for the Board to £896,398 for the year.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate included provision for £350,000 to cover our share of the Board's revenue losses.  Detailed estimates recently furnished by the Board indicate that a further sum of £297,429 will be required to meet revenue losses up to the 31st March making a total provision of over £647,000 for the year.  This, however, is not a true measure of our share of the Board's losses within the financial year.  In the past the procedure was that so far as our share of the losses was concerned the Board operated on temporary bank borrowing against their own securities and a State guarantee of £200,000 and applied for advances only when these resources were nearing exhaustion.  Previous estimates of the Board's losses were framed therefore on the basis of meeting the Board's requirements substantially in arrear.  It is now, however, proposed to provide for the Board's full requirements up to the 31st March and in future to make more frequent advances to the Board so as to reduce the extent of their temporary borrowing. The present total provision for the financial year, therefore, contains an element for paying off the Board's overdraft.</P>
    <P>The Board's accounting year ends on the 30th September.  The accounts for the year ended 30th September, 1955, have not yet been published.  They were due for submission to me by the 31st December but I have authorised an extension to 31st March.  Because of the detailed apportionment of receipts <Col N="70" /> and expenditure between the two areas provided for in the scheme of apportionment drawn up under the Great Northern Railway Acts the preparation of the accounts requires more time than would normally be the case especially in the first few years' operation of the Board.  It is understood that our share of their losses for the year was in the region of £360,000 including interest payable on the acquisition price of the undertaking and subsequent Government advances, as compared with the corresponding figure of £207,598 for the Board's first accounting period of 13 months ended 30th September, 1954.  The present indications are that for the year ending 30th September, 1956, the loss will be still greater.  These heavy losses are to be deplored and if there were no hopes of reversing the present trend and eliminating the need for subsidy the outlook would be very grim indeed. But the G.N.R. Board, after an investigation of the position, has made proposals to both Governments for the reorganisation of the railway involving conversion to diesel traction and the renewal and modernisation of rolling stock.  Having regard to the experience of C.I.E. I believe that the dieselisation of the railway would put a very different complexion on the problem and would hold out good hopes of putting the railway on a self supporting basis within a reasonable period.  For that reason I am prepared to approve in principle of the Board's proposals.  As Deputies will be aware, however, the Six-County Government has proposed the closing of three cross-border lines and statements made in the Six-County Parliament yesterday suggest that further pruning of the railway system in the Six Counties now under consideration may include the line from Portadown to Derry.  If the Six-County Government have made up their minds irrevocably to close these lines and, in effect, to confine the G.N.R. system in the Six Counties to the main Dublin-Belfast line, then the Government here will have to reexamine the whole matter very carefully.</P>
    <P>The estimate of £150,000 for the State's share of the capital expenditure <Col N="71" /> of the board for the current financial year has also proved inadequate and an additional sum of £97,000 is required to meet the board's requirements. Since the original Estimate was framed further capital projects by the board were approved.  The additional sum will enable the board to discharge fully their commitments on capital account up to the 31st March, 1956.</P>
    <P>In addition a sum of £1,985 is due to the board in respect of expenses incurred in connection with Greenore Hotel.  This property has now been disposed of to an industrial firm.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to provide for a sum due to C.I.E. in respect of an overhaul of the <i>Dún Aengus</i> carried out in 1952.  The operation of the Galway/ Aran service was taken over by C.I.E. in 1951, but legal transfer of the <i>Dún Aengus</i> to C.I.E. was not effected until October, 1952.  In the meantime a sum of £23,302 was incurred on an overhaul of the vessel and this sum falls to be recouped to C.I.E.  The C.I.E. claim for recoupment of this sum was not made until September last as claims made on the insurance company and underwriters were not finalised until then.</P>
    <P>The total of the additional sum which it is necessary to provide for the G.N.R. Board together with the sum necessary to recoup C.I.E. the cost of the overhaul of the <i>Dún Aengus</i> amounts to £419,700.  Against this sum may be offset a saving of £65,000 arising on sub-head B of the Vote (Grants for Harbours).  In addition Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote (sub-head O) are expected to realise approximately £10,000 more than was estimated for due to a payment of interest by the G.N.R. Board being made in the present financial year instead of in the previous financial year.  The net excess of the Vote is, therefore, £344,700 and a Vote for this amount is now required.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Estimate, I think everybody feels very distressed that the progress we had hoped would be made under the new administration, in 1953, has not been realised and, as I understand it, <Col N="72" /> the total losses incurred by the G.N.R. and the Ulster Transport Authority system, taken together, since that time, amounted to several million pounds.</P>
      <P>In the first report of the G.N.R. Authority, issued in September, 1954, the directors seemed to express hope that there would be considerable savings through the purchase of rail cars, through the purchase of hydraulic diesel engines and through the scrapping of old equipment and its replacement by new equipment.  It was also considered necessary at that time to close certain branch lines and to ensure further co-ordination or, rather, the avoidance of overlapping with road transport and there seemed to be some hope that the deficit would be at least contained.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already alluded to the statements that were made yesterday by the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance but I think he gave them insufficient emphasis.  We should like to know from the Minister whether any advance information was given to him of this proposed action and, in particular, the decision taken for the first time, to act ruthlessly to eliminate a very great part of the entire railway system, at least in Northern Ireland. I should like to ask the Minister whether the economies that were supposed to be realised through the purchase of rail cars and diesel engines had in fact been realised or whether the G.N.R. Authority have had sufficient experience with rail cars on various parts of the system since the new authority came into being and whether they purchased a sufficient number of diesel engines of the hydraulic variety to be quite certain that they need to act, in their own words, so ruthlessly towards a great part of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister will be aware, ruthless pruning of the system in the Six Counties will have inevitable and unfortunate effect on the numbers of persons employed in the Dundalk workshop and, if it is really true that a considerable part of the railway system will be scrapped without delay, which is an abbreviation of what the Minister said, then there would be adverse reactions and a considerable <Col N="73" /> increase of unemployment in Dundalk where the rolling stock, the engines, and so forth, are maintained, serviced and reconstructed.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether, during the past 12 months, he has been made aware of any change in the general viewpoint of the G.N.R. Authority and whether this increased subvention, which will bear hardly on the taxpayer, is due to some sudden change in the number of passengers carried in the last year, the amount of freight carried or to what he can ascribe this disimprovement in the general position.</P>
    <P>I am quite aware that on all sides of the House there has been a totally unrealistic attitude towards very minor branch lines and the use of railways in this country and I am perfectly certain that within the next ten or 15 years there are likely to be substantial changes in the attitude of all parts of the House towards this problem but, nevertheless, we were given to believe that the use of diesel oil and the general reshaping of the organisation of both the main railway concerns would enable us to make transport pay and, for that reason, although we are bound to support this Estimate, we can only deplore the increase in the amount of the deficit.</P>

      <P>As everybody knows, the position at the moment in the railway sphere is very parlous.  I, coming from Dundalk, speak on behalf of the employees in the Dundalk works.  It is good to see that our Minister for Industry and Commerce has a certain amount of faith in the eventual success of the modernisation programme that has been drawn up with regard to the dieselisation of the system but, unfortunately, his counterpart in the North does not share the same optimism and it is significant that the Northern Minister is not very keen to continue the implementation of this modernisation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the papers recently we see that meetings have been held here, there and everywhere protesting against the proposed closing of any of these branch lines and the unavoidable unemployment that would ensue.  I <Col N="74" /> should like to know from the Minister whether there is any likelihood of a further meeting being arranged with the Northern Minister for Commerce. When this new board was set up it was confidently expected that things would change for the better, but we all must admit that, instead, things are going from bad to worse.  The crux seems to arise in the northern part of the country and, on behalf of the workers in Dundalk, I should like to voice sincere appreciation of the efforts of our Minister for Industry and Commerce to keep things going on the railway.  I should like to ask him now whether he considers it advantageous or not to meet the Northern Minister once again and to try to evolve some system whereby the least damage will be done as regards the employment of these railwaymen.</P>

      <P>Personally, I believe, taking the long term view, it would be tragic for this part of Ireland to follow the line that it is proposed to take in the North of Ireland, to scrap the railways. It may sound very attractive, from the point of view of cost in the immediate future, to lay emphasis on the advantages of road transport, but, without dealing in any detail with it, I want to emphasise the dangerous situation that could be created here in Ireland if we were totally dependent on road transport in time of emergency. We had during the last war the position here that our transport system, slow and inefficient though it may have been, did a tremendous job and gave great service to the community through the utilisation of our native fuel resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On to-day's papers there was a bombshell in connection with the railway system in the Six Counties and I do not know whether the Government was given prior information as to the announcement or decision taken in the Six Counties, but it has been evident for some time past &mdash; not within the last 12 months &mdash; that there has been a very strong movement built up to eliminate the railway system there.  We have only to look at the expenditure in the Six Counties on roads, secondary and third class roads, over the last couple of years to realise that the stage was being set for the announcement that was made yesterday.</P>
      <P>The situation becomes still more serious &mdash; I am sure it is the case &mdash; that the Government here had no prior indication that this drastic action was being envisaged by the Government in the Six Counties.  Unquestionably, this decision is going to have tremendous repercussions not alone in the Six Counties, but also in the Twenty-Six Counties.  No matter whether this House disowns, or suggests it has no responsibility for, what may take place in regard to the railway system in the North, that decision will have a bearing on the situation here in future years.  I do not know whether it has struck members of the House that it is absolutely essential that this Government should make the strongest possible protest against the decision that has been conveyed to us in connection with the railway system in the North. What will be the ultimate result of this?  It will mean that the people in the Six Counties who want to see Partition cemented have now one of the greatest weapons at their disposal to ensure that Partition is a matter that will last for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the railway system is scrapped in the Six Counties, it means that the Six Counties become completely dependent on the importation of foreign fuels for the transport system and we know that in the road transport system there is nothing available in Ireland, either in the Six Counties <Col N="76" /> or Twenty-Six Counties, in the way of raw materials necessary for road transport.  The rubber, the machinery and everything is imported; the energy necessary to drive these vehicles whether it is through diesels, oil or petrol or in any other form is an imported commodity.  If this decision is final, it means in five years' time, the Six-County Government can say: &ldquo;We must stay close to Britain because if we do not we will be left on our own and our transport arrangements will cease to operate because we have no raw materials in the Six Counties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the strongest possible argument that can be made for the cementing of Partition under present-day circumstances.  It is an extraordinary situation that in Britain so much more is contemplated and no matter whether these people in the Six Counties like it or not, their legislation is based on British legislation, and it is a rather sinister matter to find that the British Government is prepared to allow the Six-County Government to take a decision that will have vital consequences on the future &mdash; unless, of course, we find that the British Government has taken into consideration that the removal of the railways in the Six Counties will mean that the Six Counties will come more closely within the British control.</P>
    <P>I did not hear fully what Deputy Childers had to say on this matter, but I want to ask the Minister whether the Government has had previous knowledge or information given to them by the Six-County Government, on the announcement that was made in to-day's papers by that Government, and if so, did this Government make any protest or discuss the matter with the Six-County Government, and if they &mdash; I believe myself the Six-County Government did not notify our Government here of this drastic and inexcusable decision &mdash; did not do so, does this Government now intend to request the Six-County Government to meet them so that a discussion can take place with regard to the issues involved both North and South concerning transport arrangements for the future?</P>
    <P>I think no time should be lost by the <Col N="77" /> Government in requesting the Six County Government to meet them and discuss the whole problem.  I hope that the Minister will inform us to that effect when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures given by the Minister for losses were rather startling.  We note a very serious increase, and what makes matters worse is the fact that he holds out no hope that there will be any improvement in the year ahead.  That is one headache with which the Minister is faced, and with which the country is faced, but over and above that there is the more serious problem of the future of the G.N.R. in the Six Counties. Those of us who travel in the North could see, as Deputy McQuillan has said, the build-up leading to to-day's announcement in the papers.</P>
      <P>We could see that representations were made, or are being made, in the Six Counties for a complete change over from rail to road.  If we take for example the main road from Belfast, leading through Armagh and Omagh on to Strabane and Derry, we will see that millions of pounds are being poured into it to widen bends, to level bumps and to improve the road generally. That road runs for a good part of the distance along the G.N.R. route and it is because it was decided some time ago by the Government up there to close down the stretch from Portadown to Derry that this huge sum was poured into that particular road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the time has come when the Minister should seek clarification of the whole position, when he should seek a meeting at top level with his opposite number in Stormont.  I am afraid that the board which was set up as a result of the purchase of the railway is not being consulted by the Minister up North; I am afraid that decisions are being taken without any advice from or consultation with the G.N.R. Board.  I believe that eventually we will find ourselves faced with a close down in the Six Counties of not alone the branch lines but of some sections &mdash; fairly large sections at that &mdash; of the main lines.  It was rumoured about six months ago that the Portadown-Derry main line was to be closed down. Judging by recent statements that <Col N="78" /> seems to be an accomplished fact and it is time that we did something concrete about it.  I would urge very strongly that the Minister would have a conference with the Minister for Commerce in Belfast on this whole question. In his reply I hope the Minister will indicate if that is his intention and what the result of any preliminary talks have been.</P>
    <P>Any drastic changes such as those feared and rumoured would have serious effects on the whole transport system not alone of the Six Counties, but of the other three Ulster counties, and of Louth and other neighbouring counties like Sligo.  There would be a serious transport problem to be solved there if a breakdown of relations took place between the Department here and the Department in Belfast.  It would be very wise for the Minister to have some alternative in mind in case such a deadlock would occur.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if such a state of affairs does crop up, transport problems galore will arise along the Border. It will affect all counties from Donegal to Louth and some alternative arrangement should at least be considered now so that we would not be faced later with a crisis.  The best way to deal with it is to make sure, if possible, that such a close down will not take place.  I know there are difficulties in that, but the fact that we have a financial interest in the G.N.R. with the Six Counties Government does strengthen our hands.  If we did reach a stage where we would have to operate the G.N.R. as it exists now, it would be a rather heavy task.  It is something that will have to be considered and if that is not possible, then some alternative transport system to meet such a situation should be considered.</P>
    <P>County Donegal especially will be very seriously hit if these proposals materialise.  It will mean we will be entirely dependent on road transport and even as it is, with the services now provided by G.N.R., the position is not too satisfactory.  We have had several complaints in the past that the transport provided was not anything like what could be expected although it was thought that there would be many <Col N="79" /> improvements when the railway was taken over by the new board.</P>
    <P>It was hoped that these improvements would include a better service to the North generally and to Donegal especially, but it does not appear now as if our hopes will be realised.  I think that even since the new G.N.R. Board was set up, difficulties have been put in our way in the Six Counties. You have buses leaving at the exact times that the trains leave and you have lorries competing with the G.N.R. system.  You had, as I already mentioned, roads put into such a state of repair that we anticipated at the time the idea was to get rid of rail transport in the North.</P>
    <P>Of course, as Deputy McQuillan pointed out, there is the political aspect of this.  I do not want to make things more difficult for the Minister. He will, in the time ahead, have to take steps to deal with the situation which is showing itself at the moment and he will have to negotiate some agreement or at least to try and get some agreement.  Definitely the political situation is cropping up.  This will mean a complete cutting off of the North from the rest of the country as far as rail transport is concerned. There is another matter to which I should like to refer and that is the proposed closing down of the Bundoran line.  Representations have been made to have this line kept open because it is a line which certainly pays its way and carries a great deal of tourist traffic.  That line carries a considerable number of passengers and should be kept open.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset the Minister has a very big problem here.  It is one which will require serious thought and effort.  I know the Minister will do his best but he should take immediate action and the least that should be done is to have representations made immediately to the Minister's opposite number in Belfast to ensure that nothing will be done without the Minister's consent and his knowledge and agreement.  I would advise him strongly to keep in mind, in any negotiations he has, the fact that the G.N.R. main lines especially, and some of the important branch lines as well, would <Col N="80" /> be kept open to serve not alone the Six Counties but some of the Twenty-Six Counties along the Border.  It would be a very serious problem if this rail system were closed down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene only for a short while in this debate.  The suggestion just made by Deputy McQuillan is not only thoroughly unsound but it is particularly unhelpful as well.  He has suggested that recent events in Northern Ireland indicate a general policy of changing the whole transport of that part of the country from rail to road.  I do not know whether that suggestion is sound or not.  The Deputy mentioned that one indication was the tremendous road widening and improvements going on in the North.  That would not, of itself, seem to be absolute proof.  Anyone travelling the first 20 to 25 miles of the Cork road might be led to believe that we were abandoning the whole southern railway system.</P>
      <P>It may be that there is a tendency in the Six Counties to move from road to rail but the fantastic suggestion has been made by Deputy McQuillan that that is being done in order to solidify Partition.  The reason given is that if you have a road system of transport in the Six Counties it would be dependent for its fuel supply and equipment on sources outside the Six Counties.  That suggestion does not seem to me to bear any examination at all.  We ourselves are dieselising our whole railway system.  I do not believe that since the time of the emergency any railway system in this country, North or South, has found its fuel in Ireland.  Whether you are trying to buy oil from America or the Middle East to run buses or lorries, or coal from England to run trains, the fuel is still coming from outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that a change from rail to road in the Six Counties would have the effect of making these Six Counties dependent on outside sources of fuel does not seem to me to bear any examination.  It would be an unwise and unhelpful attitude for us to take up.  The whole business of the Great Northern Railway is one of the, unfortunately, few matters in which we <Col N="81" /> are able to get together with the Government of the Six Counties to consider matters which affect both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>If we start to make that arrangement a sounding board for political arguments about Partition it will make all future economic collaboration extremely difficult.  If we are going to approach this problem of the changing policy of the Six Counties with regard to transport, it is essential that we should consider it as an economic problem and concern ourselves simply and solely with how any such action on the part of the Six-Counties Government is going to affect this part of the country economically.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who spoke last dealt with the matter in a reasonable manner when he spoke of the concern of the other three Ulster counties. That speech was a sensible one but to suggest that this is the first stage of some move on the part of the Six Counties for some political purpose is not only unsound but most unwise as well.  I can see that there would be a justifiable reaction on the part of the Six-County Government if matters concerning the G.N.R. are going to be approached in that way.  I can foresee a very justifiable feeling that no further collaboration should take place. That is the only reason for my intervention in this debate, to suggest to the House that the suggestion made is unwise and calculated to do considerable mischief as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without assuring the Minister that there is grave concern in the counties of Fermanagh and Donegal in regard to the closing down of the branch lines.  This concern has reached a climax with yesterday's pronouncement from Stormont.  It is not confined to any particular section of the community.  People of every creed and class in Fermanagh and Donegal are determined to do everything in their power, by protest or otherwise, to assist the Minister in any action which he may take or to continue any action which he has already taken to prevent the closing of their life-line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main line via Clones and Enniskillen to Bundoran is the life-line of <Col N="82" /> Donegal.  If we are to have any future development of industry in Donegal, that line will be absolutely essential. In fact it is essential in so far as we are engaging in the decentralisation of industry in Donegal at the moment. We could hardly hope to hold out any inducement to any industrial concern to come to Donegal if we did not have that good broad gauge line.</P>
    <P>With the formation of the Great Northern Railway Board, we in Donegal and Fermanagh looked forward to an improvement in our services.  We did not think that the action now proposed would be taken by any one Government without thorough consideration and consultation.  I am in agreement with the other Deputies who expressed doubts as to whether that consultation has taken place.  I would like to assure the Minister that he has the support of everybody concerned in these two counties in any action he may take to prevent the closing of this branch line.  I wonder if he has followed up the action he has already taken by constant liaison and consultation with his counterpart in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree that this thing should not be put on any political basis. There is no political issue involved.  All sections in the counties concerned, Fermanagh and Donegal, irrespective of political or sectarian affiliations, have joined in protest to prevent the closing of this line which to them is the vital life-line for the existence of their towns and villages and for the future development of Fermanagh and Donegal as well as other areas.</P>
    <P>We cannot hope for the development to which we look forward in the matter of the decentralisation of industry, if we start off by closing down the life-line of our county.  To the people of Bundoran, as has already been mentioned, this would be a serious blow. The line to Bundoran has brought tourists in their thousands.  We hope it will bring them in increasing numbers in the years to come.  To close this line would deal a death blow to that important resort, to say nothing of the neighbouring towns of Ballyshannon and Pettigo.  I hope &mdash; I am sure I am not hoping in vain &mdash; the Minister fully realises the seriousness <Col N="83" /> of the position in so far as an isolated county like Donegal is concerned.  If these arteries of communication are to be severed, we shall find ourselves even more isolated in the future.</P>
    <P>I have not yet heard even those who try to make a case for the severance of these lines, not even the dry-as-dust economists in the Stormont Government, who can justify the proposed action by pointing to the losses, because they failed to point out that the thousands which have to be paid at the moment in subsidy in order to maintain those lines may in the future have to be paid to maintain the roads necessary to carry the transport diverted to them.  There is nothing to justify the closing of these lines.  I am opposed to the closing of any railway lines, even the narrow gauge lines leading into the heart of the county.  The railways have brought civilisation to many areas.  They are as important to-day as they were when they were first laid even though communications and transport have advanced beyond the dreams of those who engineered railways in places like the Rocky Mountains.  The closing of railway lines is always a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>We have a special reason for concern. Donegal is cut off from the rest of the Twenty-Six Counties and it has been rightly described as the &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; county.  If these two main arteries of communication are severed we will be left in the position where our main worry will be transport to carry the people who are emigrating. I appeal to the Minister &mdash; I am sure I am not appealing to one who will turn a deaf ear &mdash; to consider our special circumstances. We are seriously perturbed and we are prepared to give him every support and assistance in order to avert this disaster to our future economy.  The mere mention of this being some political subterfuge does not in any way help the situation.  That has nothing whatever to do with it. This is purely and simply a case of dry-as-dust economics without the necessary foresight on behalf of, or the necessary consideration for, others. Getting the G.N.R. to show a profit, or break even, is not nearly so important as the future economy of the counties <Col N="84" /> concerned.  I hope the Minister will bring home these facts and persistently pursue every channel of exploration before this precipitate action is taken.</P>
    <P>We are determined to give all the assistance possible by way of co-operating with all concerned to prevent the closing down of these lines.  The people of Fermanagh are equally concerned. They are gravely perturbed.  They can see the economic life of many of their towns threatened as a result of the proposed action.  That is not confined to any particular section and they can rest assured that we in Donegal, in the Donegal County Council, the Bundoran Urban Council and other public bodies will give all the co-operation and assistance necessary even at the eleventh hour to avert the closing down of these branch lines.  The closing down of these lines will have a contrary effect from that suggested in some quarters; this proposal has cemented together people in Fermanagh who have not seen eye-to-eye in the past.  They are determined to fight as one in support of the retention of these lines despite sectarian or Party affiliation. Public bodies have passed resolutions expressing appreciation of the stand the Minister has taken.  I hope the Minister's mind has not changed and that he will, as I have said, persistently pursue every possible channel to ensure this closing down does not take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene briefly on this very important Estimate and to endorse what has been said by the other Donegal representatives, Deputies Cunningham and J. Brennan. The announcement yesterday by the Six County Government that the closing down of three cross-Border lines was in the offing came as a bombshell, not alone to my county of Donegal but to the people in the towns and villages in many parts of the Six Counties &mdash; to the people of Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane and to the people in other towns and villages in these areas.  It came as a bombshell because we were hoping that, as a result of the deliberations of the G.N.R. Board, something effective would be done to keep that important artery open between Dublin and Derry City and, incidentally, between Dublin and Donegal.  It is surprising <Col N="85" /> that, when the G.N.R. Board, which, I am sure, went into every point and took every point into consideration and recommended the reorganisation of the railway in question, a reorganisation which would involve conversion to diesel traction and the renewal and modernisation of the rolling stock, such a recommendation should now be made.  One would imagine that the Six County Government would take that advice to heart and do something to make the line prosperous.  I know this line very well because I have travelled it twice weekly during the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>On another occasion in this House I took the opportunity of pointing out to the Minister that no effort was being made so far as the line from Portadown to Strabane and Derry was concerned to improve matters.  I pointed out, too, that after 20 to 30 years, it took longer for a passenger to come from Derry City to Dublin to-day than it did in those far-off days.  In those days it was possible to complete the journey in four hours.  Now one is lucky if a train comes in anywhere within five-and-a-half hours from the time it leaves Derry City.  I feel that those tactics could only have one result, and that has been the steady deterioration of the G.N.R. lines over the years.  What has been accomplished by the good business methods of the dieselisation of the C.I.E. could equally be accomplished in the Six County area if the authorities there took the matter seriously.  But, as I said, no effort has been made and we are faced with this situation to-day.</P>
      <P>We often hear mention of the hard-headed businessmen of the North, but when one contemplates the position that will prevail when this line and the other lines that have been mentioned are closed down.  I am afraid we can look forward to nothing but chaos in the transport industry in the Six County area.  It certainly does not speak well for these hard-headed businessmen of the North, about whom we hear so much from one end of the year to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect on our principal industry in Donegal, namely, the tourist industry, if this line and the other lines mentioned <Col N="86" /> close down, will be disastrous. We in Donegal, unfortunately, have not very many large industries, industries capable of employing from 400 to 500 people at a time but one of our industries &mdash; and it has been a growing one during the last 20 to 30 years &mdash; namely, the tourist industry, certainly provides employment in most villages and towns. It will be a serious thing for the county and tourist development generally if the railways are allowed to close.  It will mean more unemployment and emigration from a county that has, God knows, already too much of those two serious ills.  As other Deputies pointed out, I also can assure the Tánaiste that he will have the support, not alone of everybody in Donegal but also of the people in Derry City, Dungannon, Omagh, and all the other towns in any effort he makes to keep open our principal life-line between Dublin and the isolated county of Donegal.</P>
    <P>The proposed closing of the Bundoran line also came as a shock to the people at that end of the county.  Bundoran, as the Minister is well aware, is one of our principal tourist towns not alone in Donegal but in Ireland.  On Sundays during the holiday season into that town come perhaps 20, 30 or perhaps 40 special trains.  How are the tourists to be catered for if the railway is allowed to close?  Can anyone imagine the number of buses that would be required to take those tourists in and out of Bundoran?  So far as Bundoran, Ballyshannon and Pettigo are concerned, if the railway is allowed to close it will mean the closing down of the fine industry that they themselves built out of their own resources before there was any Government assistance of any kind. Again, it will lead to more unemployment at that end of the county.  I do not need to refer to the effect it will have on Ireland's national pilgrimage to Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will keep all these things in mind &mdash; I know he has the welfare of that area at heart in so far as their system of transport is concerned&mdash;and that he will be able to prevail on the Six-County Government to change their views.  I hope also that the last word on this serious matters has not been said and that we <Col N="87" /> will shortly have an announcement that these life-lines that have been mentioned here will remain open to help in the building up of one of our finest industries &mdash; the tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first duty of every speaker on this measure must be, I think, to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the stand he has taken and the overtures he has made to the rulers of another part of Ireland to keep these lines open.  We in the South are united in this regard.  As the previous speaker said, this is not a political measure. Everybody stands behind the Minister in his efforts to keep these lines open, to keep the rolling stock moving and we wish him well in his efforts.  Let him proceed in the knowledge that we are all to a man behind him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan said that nobody but the dry-as-dust economists of Stormont's Parliament would want the lines closed.  Here I want to take issue, not with the speaker but with the opinions expressed because, in fairness and in truth, the dry-as-dust economists in any part of Ireland should want to have those lines kept open.  In the course of business I have occasion to keep a few lorries myself and I pay what seems to me as I pay it quite a large road tax.  But I do admit, and it is obvious to the meanest observer, that if I were to pay the proportionate cost of what it were costing to keep the roads open for those lorries, in fact I would be availing at present rates of the railway services that are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest argument that can be adduced for the keeping open of these lines &mdash; and I speak now from a 32-County aspect &mdash; is the fact that they probably constitute the most economic method of moving goods.  If we approach this problem from the point of view of last year's Book of Estimates or any year's Book of Estimates over the last ten years, we find that the road tax collected on vehicles has not kept the roads going.  A very large grant from Government funds has been necessary to keep the roads even in the rather mediocre condition <Col N="88" /> they are in to-day.  When one approaches the finances of C.I.E., one finds that included in those finances is the total cost of the upkeep of the permanent way.  That is the salient point of argument in the whole matter, the fact that included in those accounts is the cost of the upkeep of the permanent way.</P>
    <P>Must not the dry-as-dust economist balance the cost of upkeep of the permanent way against the cost of upkeep of the roads?  It is a fact that the most economic haulage of goods can be effected by cohesion between road and rail services, the goods going a certain distance to the railhead and being hauled by lorry to the business house, say, a few miles distant therefrom. That is the natural conception of business as it should be.  But I have not the slightest objection to admitting that if, as a lorry owner, I have to pay the total cost of keeping the roads open so that I can move my goods in one movement, without double handling, it would be completely uneconomic.  We must face this problem from the point of view as to whether or not all transport of goods is uneconomic at present rates in this country.  In order to succeed in the export drive, it behoves us as a Government and it behoves the Stormont Government, if they only knew, to keep these lines open at present rates for movement of goods.</P>
    <P>That is my line in regard to this matter.  It may be a voice in the wilderness.  If the figures are examined &mdash;I shall not go so far as to produce them to-night&mdash;it will be found that in a country with such a small population per square mile as we have and, therefore, such a small consumption of goods per square mile as we have, all transport shall be, must be and will be uneconomic until we have achieved a greater measure of industrialisation and a greater measure of productivity in agriculture.  If you paint with a tar brush the Department of Local Government, which provides the roads, it is only fair to paint the other and to say that we must accept a loss. Therefore, we must wish the Minister well in his efforts with the Stormont Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Personally, I should like the Minister to make every effort and not to deviate from his present goal, if at all possible, for the simple reason that we hope at some future time to have a 32-County Parliament and that it is necessary to set up industries in the rural areas. That has been the concept of Governments over the last 15 years.  Both major Parties and, I think, the Labour Party have been as one voice in their efforts to set up industries west of the Shannon.  Why then, if we can avoid it, cut off an area completely from communication?  What are the hopes of an industry being set up, even with a Government grant, if there is no railhead within 15 or 20 miles of the proposed factory?  We must face this as a very serious situation and do our utmost.  I have the utmost confidence that the Minister will do all in his power to avoid the closing of the lines concerned.</P>
    <P>Bluntly speaking, it is only fair to say that the Minister has the worst end of the stick.  Perhaps it is only fair to say that, I suppose, in the opinion of all of us, if the Great Northern Railway works were on the other side of the Border, perhaps Stormont would not be just so keen to close these branch lines in Dundalk.  The main male labour potential in that town is provided by the Great Northern Railway works and any curtailment of lines in any part of Ireland must of necessity affect that potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister must weigh in the balance whether or not certain sacrifices shall be made to keep these lines open.  The railway works in Dundalk are a most economic unit and are doing their best to keep the railways running.  They are providing the main male labour potential for a town which is generally accepted as one of the most progressive provincial industrial towns in our country.  I ask the Minister to consider the industry in Dundalk when he comes to make a final decision, if such decision rests with him.</P>
    <P>As one who has very great regard for the County Donegal and its people, I should like to join with those Deputies from Donegal who spoke here to-night.  In this respect I suppose we can think, not of a 32-County Ireland <Col N="90" /> but, selfishly, of a Twenty-Six County Ireland.  I should not like to see Donegal cut off from its main line to Dublin.  Donegal is one of our major tourist counties.  In Donegal there is a great potential for industrial expansion. In Donegal there is a tweed industry; there is one of the finest oatmeal industries in this country. Often, when industries are old their use tends to be minimised.  Donegal produces probably 50 per cent of the flake oatmeal that is produced in Ireland. There is a very great industry there in the production of potato-oats. To cut off the potato growers of Donegal from Dublin City would be a major catastrophe.  Let us do all we can to avert that.</P>
    <P>With regard to Lough Derg, I do not mind admitting that I went there once, but I do not think I will ever work up the religious enthusiasm to go again, but I would ask the Minister to consider what the effect of closing the line will be on pilgrimages to Lough Derg. We hope the Minister will succeed in his endeavour and we congratulate him on his efforts to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

      <P>The Minister is asking for £23,000 in respect of certain repairs to the S.S. <i>Dún Aengus</i> in connection with its handing over to C.I.E. from the private company who formerly operated it.  He made some reference to insurance.  I should like him to explain whether the sum of £23,000 represents merely the share of the cost which is borne by public funds.  If that is so, would he say what the total cost of the repairs to which he has referred has been?  Perhaps I may also, with relevance, inquire as to the amount which was paid to the former owners of this boat for their interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, like other Deputies, am interested in the main question which has been discussed, but it is not easy to follow exactly how the curtailment of railway services in the North is connected with the inflation of the demands which are being made on the Minister to honour his obligations under the agreement which he made in the Transport Act, which places responsibility on him and his opposite number in the North for the G.N.R. services.  The Minister has pointed out that there has been a considerable <Col N="91" /> increase in the demand.  He has not stated what curtailment of railway services took place concurrently with the growth of the demand or whether the present demand would be greatly increased in the near future unless, in fact, the further curtailments which have been protested against here this evening take place.  I would like to add my voice to those of Deputies who deprecated making a political issue of this question.  Deputies on both sides of the House appealed that that should not be done as it would only bedevil the whole question.  At least one Deputy on the far side, the last Deputy who spoke, seemed to ignore those appeals and did introduce a political element by saying that if the Dundalk works were on the other side of the Border possibly this action would not be taken.</P>
    <P>We have had examples here in the Twenty-Six Counties of the damage&mdash; and also of the futility &mdash; of the damage that can be done by making questions of this kind political questions.  I remember when the G.S.R. decided to close about 150 miles of line between Clonsilla and Clifden and 120 miles of that were closed before the change of Government in 1932.  There was no political row about the closing of the 120 miles, but there was a terrific row about the closing of the other 30.  The general question of transport arrangements was not made any easier of settlement, particularly in the western part, by the political row raised.  I know that the railway authorities of the time were very anxious to keep the western part open and when appealed to and asked if they got a capital sum would it help them to solve the problem, they said it would not, that it was traffic they wanted and not subsidies.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly whether the railways mentioned here by Deputies to-night are in a similar situation; I do think the Donegal Deputies have made a very fine case for the maintenance of these lines as links.  If there must be further curtailment of the services, perhaps the mistake made, or at least what is now being declared to be a <Col N="92" /> mistake when any reference is made to it, should not be repeated in regard to these lines, and that is, that if there must be complete curtailment of services over a period, the lines themselves should not be removed.  I do not know what implications would be created by retaining those lines even where services are completely abolished, but it would assuage public concern and indignation when services are abolished if the lines were not forthwith removed.  It seems to be a burning of boats, so to speak, which prevents any reconsideration of decisions subsequently being made.  I do know that the occasion which I have in mind and which impels me to speak on this northern question is possibly not quite analogous to the circumstances with which we are now dealing.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the lines I am referring to ran through an unpopulated area and that the people of the populated places would have considerable journeys to make to connect with the lines.  Even dieselisation or reduction of running costs would not solve the question, but the Minister did seem to indicate in relation to these particular lines now that the G.N.R. Board has hopes that dieselisation may solve the problem and may, in fact &mdash; if it does not bring about a reduction in the demand on public purses both North and South&mdash;contain these demands within their present limits.  It is a pity if that is so, that dieselisation was not proceeded with when it was first proposed. We would have gained a great deal of experience and would possibly have saved a great deal of money if it had not then been interfered with for what appeared to be political reasons. That is a further reason which induces me to rise to support Deputies on both sides even at this late stage who deprecate making this a political issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan's case in respect of the political significance of the change does not hold water, as has been pointed out by Deputy Finlay.  Deputy McQuillan seemed to think that this decision would eventually render public transport in the Six Counties entirely dependent on Britain and British resources. That can be a double-edged weapon and I would suggest that <Col N="93" /> Deputy McQuillan and others who are inclined to be attracted by that argument and to make a political issue out of this, should visualise the political situation in which the resources upon which they think Northern transport will be compelled to rely should fail, that is, in the case of another world war.  Will not the shoe be completely on the other foot and will there not be such a degree of resentment against having put them into that unenviable and irremediable position that the political consequences would be very favourable to us down here?</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything to be gained, in any event, by trying to give this situation any political significance. I think it is inadvisable.  Even if one could make a fairly plausible case, taking the long view, I think it would be most inadvisable to do that.  We have had sad experience of the yielding to temptation to make political issues of other situations here among ourselves from 1932 on.  I do not want to introduce any political contention into this matter by naming the matters&mdash;they come to mind quite readily in the case of anybody who has been acquainted with political life here for the last 20 years.  I do feel that the appeal to the Minister particularly by the Donegal Deputies is well based; their case is a very strong one and Deputy Donegan's case for subsidies even to a much greater extent than is now demanded, is reasonable in view of the Donegal position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan &mdash; I do not know whether he was ingenuous or ingenious &mdash;certainly was a bit disarming in his line of reasoning.  He pointed out that he himself was a lorry owner and that all lorry owners are using road transport in preference to railways because it is more economic, because it reduces handling.  He does, however, admit that users of these lorries are not paying a fair amount of the cost of road improvement and maintenance, and that being so, he criticises the system of accounting which includes the maintenance of permanent ways as a burden on the railways; he suggests that the public purse should come in here and maintain these lines and that after that, if the operation of the <Col N="94" /> railways proved uneconomic, the accountant's case is quite sound.</P>
    <P>I do not know what one should say to that type of argument.  I think the general approach would be that if the railways are maintained and that if there is a possibility of their becoming an economic proposition in the future, say in 20 or 30 years' time, one could follow Deputy Donegan's line of reasoning.  We could also have that attitude in relation to the Post Office services and possibly one could make a case for it in relation to the railways particularly where the railways can be visualised as being main arteries either for passenger or goods traffic in the foreseeable future.  But you cannot make that case for lines which are stop end and which do not serve dense populations. I think the two cases mentioned here to-night do not come within that particular category.  I believe that the closing down of railroads is one of the most serious decisions with which the Minister's Department is concerned and because of the nature of the road over which trains travel, a decision to curtail the service and follow that up by the lifting of the line is one that calls for the greatest consideration the Minister can give.  A decision to expend public money to stave off the lifting of the line as long as possible is one which will have general support. Looking at the question from that general viewpoint I have great pleasure in supporting the appeals from all Deputies that no wrong or irremediable decision would be taken in this particular matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the representatives of County Monaghan, I should like to add my voice to those of the other Deputies who have spoken so strongly in this matter of the closing down of the G.N.R. lines.  There is no county in the North which will suffer more by the close down than will Monaghan and its very progressive towns.  The lines run entirely through the county and their closing down will be a severe blow.  The matter came up for discussion at a meeting of my county council last week and while there were many voices there ready to make political capital out of it I am very pleased to say on the whole that <Col N="95" /> there was great appreciation for the Minister's efforts to keep the lines alive.  The people of the northern counties are fully alive to the efforts of the Minister in that direction and I think that the people who get up in this House or in any other assembly in Ireland &mdash; in county councils, urban councils or rural councils &mdash; and introduce a political tinge into the argument are doing a considerable amount of harm.</P>
      <P>This is a matter over and above politics and I do not agree with speakers who talk about the people in the North taking a different view of things if the railway works in Dundalk were on the other side of the Border. I do not think the people of the North have come down to that.  They are practical people.  They have always met us in a very liberal way and I know, living very near them, that any representations I made to the people in authority in Belfast about employment I get the greatest consideration. There is no political ill-feeling there. They are helpful in every way.  There is nothing I wish to add to what has been said about the merits of this other than to emphasise that we in Monaghan are very much concerned about the closing down of this branch line. I hope it does not happen.  I support the appeals made by the Donegal men and whether I am right or wrong I feel a special word of praise is due to the Minister for the firm stand he has taken in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the House for the understanding way in which it has approached this whole problem of the position of the cross border railways.  It is quite clear that the House appreciated there are very serious difficulties ahead.  It was anxious in an understanding way to see if any steps could be taken to avoid what must mean for many people in many areas and particularly Donegal, a very serious difficulty.  May I take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy Kelly on his reasoned statement in what I think was his maiden speech? If it was not his maiden speech I, nevertheless, congratulate him on its substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> I think the House should get a picture of the whole business.  The G.N.R. Board, about 1954 I think, were anxious they should get the green light from the northern Government and from the Government here for a policy of re-equipping and dieselising the G.N.R. system.  There was some delay, not on our part, in clearing the issues involved.  The northern Government felt, apparently, that it was necessary to give the matter some prolonged and detailed consideration. The G.N.R. Company then felt they would soon want to go ahead and incur some capital expenditure unless they were stopped from doing so.  I was not prepared to stop them because I took the view that dieselisation and re-equipment were the only hope of putting the undertaking on a sound financial footing.  Even then that could not be done immediately, but one had to approach the problem with a feeling of understanding and be satisfied if reasonably substantial strides were taken to bring the undertaking from utter insolvency back to solvency.</P>
    <P>As a result of the talk which I then had with Lord Glentoran, the Minister of Commerce in the North, arrangements were made whereby the G.N.R. Company would be given an advance for the purchase of 24 diesel railway cars.  Tenders for these were invited and I am not quite sure at the moment whether all of these railcars are in service.  At all events, that portion of the problem was cleared.  Then the whole question of further reorganisation of the service and the dieselisation and re-equipment of the lines was further considered.  I understand that the directors of the G.N.R. Company set up a sub-committee to consider the problem and to ascertain what was the best remedy for the financial difficulties surrounding the company at the time.</P>
    <P>I understand further that that sub-committee recommended that the undertakings should be dieselised and that no branch line should be closed down until the dieselisation policy was in operation and given a chance to prove its merits.  I think that that sub-committee of the directors of the G.N.R. submitted their report to the board of directors and that the board of directors accepted the report of the <Col N="97" /> sub-committee as the best means of dealing with the problem of the cross-border railways.</P>
    <P>Last October Lord Glentoran asked me to meet him in Belfast for discussion of these problems.  The previous meetings had been held in Dublin and the arrangement was that the meetings would alternate between Dublin and Belfast.  At that meeting in October last the position of the cross-Border railways was discussed.  It was then intimated by Lord Glentoran, the Minister of Commerce, that the Six County Government had come to the conclusion that they would abandon all branches of the G.N.R. within the Six County area; that they had made up their minds that there was no future in these branch lines; that they were uneconomic and that suitable alternative transport could be supplied by means of road services.</P>
    <P>There were, however, cross-Border services.  Those are the services known as common services, services common to both areas, and in the case of these the Minister of Commerce in Belfast is obliged to consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce here with a view to ascertaining what the point of view of both Ministers is with regard to these.  When I met Lord Glentoran then he told me that the Six County Government proposed to close the branch lines which are common to the two areas.  These are the ones from Portadown to Armagh and Tynan, another to Enniskillen and Omagh and the third from Bundoran to Belleek. He asked me would I consent to the proposal to close these three lines and I said that I was not prepared to consent to any proposal to close them, that I felt that the sub-committee of the board of directors and the G.N.R. Board, many of whom are practical railway people and transport experts, were right in taking the view that dieselisation ought to get a chance to prove itself before we took the irrevocable step of closing down a railway line and finally abandoning an undertaking.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that down here we had taken the view with C.I.E. that dieselisation held out a prospect of success and that C.I.E., in common <Col N="98" /> with the Government, had decided that they would not close down any further branch lines until such time as they had given dieselisation an opportunity of succeeding.  I pointed out that even in cases where C.I.E. had got authority to close branch lines they had decided not to close them until such time as dieselisation had got a chance.</P>
    <P>I intimated to the Minister of Commerce that I was not prepared to join an agreement with him to close three-cross-Border services.  That position having been reached, therefore, the position under the Great Northern Railway Act is that the matter at issue, the closing down of the three cross-Border branches, must be referred to the chairmen of the transport tribunals in the two areas, for joint advice and report.  I understand that the matter has been referred to the chairmen of both tribunals and that they propose to hold a public inquiry in the matter.  Notice to that effect appeared in the public Press of the 3rd February inviting parties wishing to make representations to submit particulars of their representations to either tribunal before the 5th March.</P>
    <P>The Great Northern Railway Act provides that, if after considering the report of the chairman, one Minister decides to terminate the service and the other Minister decides that the board should continue the service, the dissenting Minister should be liable for the loss sustained by the board in the continuation of the service.  It is quite clear now that the Six County Government are anxious to close these three lines.  I have said to the Minister of Commerce in the Six Counties that I think we should give dieselisation a chance before we close the lines.  Not withstanding that, the Minister of Commerce in Belfast might decide that he will close these lines.  In other words, he may either accept or reject the recommendation of the chairmen of the tribunals but, if he finally comes to the conclusion that these lines will be closed, then we can keep them going.  We can keep them going on the understanding that we will pay the losses involved in the continued operation of these lines even though <Col N="99" /> these lines will not be in our own territory.</P>
    <P>In other words, if the branch line is closed, we can continue to operate our own portion of the line even if the Six County Government wishes to close their portion of it.  The other portion is in their territory.  If the portion in their territory was to be kept going, we would be required to pay whatever loss was involved in the continued operation of that portion.</P>
    <P>That brings up a number of problems all of which I am not prepared to discuss here and now, nor am I prepared, having seen only a newspaper report of the statement in Stormont, to discuss the matter at any length.  If words mean anything it is clear now that the Six County Government is going to close these three lines.  It does not matter what the report of the chairman of the tribunals may be.  It is not going to affect the policy or decision of the Six County Government because the Minister for Finance in the Six County Government yesterday stated that the Government was determined to act swiftly, strongly and ruthlessly in so far as the closing of these lines is concerned.  That means, I take it, that so far as the Six County Government is concerned they are not going to give dieselisation a chance on the three lines which have been referred to the tribunal.  They have apparently complied with the formality of referring the matter to a tribunal but the Six County Minister for Finance says, tribunal notwithstanding, the Government is determined to act swiftly, strongly and ruthlessly.  I think, therefore, we may take it that so far as these three branch lines are concerned the Government in the Six Counties is determined to close them so far as lies within their power; and I take it that that means that they have rejected a policy of dieselisation as a means of reducing and ultimately eliminating loss.</P>
    <P>Another problem is thrown up by what the Six County Minister of Finance said yesterday.  He is reported as saying that there are two lines running between Belfast and Derry&mdash; taking different directions of course&mdash; and that one of these lines must go. <Col N="100" /> One of these lines is that which runs from Belfast up through the County Antrim and along the coastline to Derry.  The other runs from Belfast to Portadown, in Six County territory, through Dungannon, in Six County territory, through Omagh, in Six County territory, through Strabane, in Six County territory, and into Derry.  One of these lines, according to the Northern Minister for Finance, is to go.  Apparently the Northern Government is not prepared to continue both of them.  What the House has to think about now is whether they consider it good policy and within our financial capacity to underwrite every penny of loss which arises on a transport system on a branch line &mdash; it may, indeed, be a main line railway &mdash; which operates entirely through Six County territory, running from the City of Belfast, to Portadown, Dungannon, Omagh, Strabane and Derry.</P>

We are not subsidising transport down here. C.I.E. is not now subsidised.  It has to make good its deficit by short term borrowing.  Therefore, the House and the Government will have to make up its mind as to whether or not it will subsidise Six County transport.</P>

      <P>One cannot be sure. There may be other considerations involved. At all events this is a problem thrown up now for solution down here and we have to discuss the matter in the light of yesterday's statement. I assume from what has been said that it does not matter what the chairmen of the tribunal say: the Six County Government will endeavour to close down these lines and, in so far as Deputies think we should keep open the cross-Border services&mdash;that is the common service&mdash;they should understand that if we want to do that, after the Six County Government has decided to close, we will have to pay the entire operating cost in the area where the line is not closed.  Deputies ought to think on that, and it is only after it has been thoroughly surveyed that we ought to have comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> The question has been raised as to what caused the serious deterioration in the position of the G.N.R. I understand that the deterioration is due in the main to the railway section.  There they have had not only a general increase in operating costs but a fall in traffic as well and at the moment the end of either of these difficulties is not yet in sight and we may have to contemplate the continuance of a situation in which until there is dieselisation, one may find the losses not merely being maintained but increasing beyond their present figure.</P>
    <P>I had hoped in the discussion I had with Lord Glentoran that it would be possible for us to get agreement on a line of policy of giving dieselisation a chance.  I still think the operation of these branch lines by means of diesel railcars, by means of using a much lighter locomotive, by substantial economies in fuel and by a concentrated campaign to induce the people to use the railways in order to save the railways from extinction, it should be possible to continue to operate these branch lines.  Apparently the Six County Government do not share that view and are determined, in their own area at all events, to discontinue the services which they operate.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which affects not merely our people down here from the standpoint referred to by the northern Deputies, particularly the Donegal Deputies, but it affects the people in the Six Counties as well.  What steps they will take is of course a matter for themselves.  All I would like to say is that so far as I am concerned and so far as the Government is concerned we are prepared to enter into any discussions with the Six County Government or with the Minister of Commerce in Belfast to try to evolve some system, as economic as possible, which will keep the branch lines open and obviate the very severe hardship which will be visited on large sections of our own people and on large sections of the people of the Six Counties if the Six County Government proceeds with its proposal to close these cross-border services.  I am prepared to go into these discussions with a completely open mind so long as the objective is <Col N="103" /> to try to save the branch lines from extinction in the case of these common services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £20,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st of March, 1956, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including Housing Grants.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate has been found necessary to meet increased expenditure on housing grants.  The amount provided in the original Estimate for these grants was £80,000 and it is now evident that the total sum required will be approximately £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a remarkable increase in the building and improvement <Col N="104" /> of dwelling-houses in the Gaeltacht areas over the past two years. At the beginning of the current financial year the number of these cases being dealt with was 989 and at the end of January last it had risen to 1,269 although 338 cases had been completed in the meantime.  In addition to that, the amending Act of 1953 provided for grants for special extensions to dwelling-houses and for the provision of piped water and sewerage. The number of cases where a water and sewerage system was being installed increased from 102 at the beginning of the year to 147 at the end of January, 1956, with 37 cases completed in the meantime, while the special extensions increased from 16 to 29 with five cases completed.  At the end of January, 1956, the total number of cases being dealt with was 1,445, involving grant payments amounting to £165,680.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to give definite reasons for this increase in housing activities since the rate of progress depends to a large extent on the grantees themselves who are paid instalments of the grants according as the work progresses. It is reasonable to assume, however, that the increased improving grants and the provision for sanitation and special extension grants in the 1953 Amending Act, the provision in the General Housing Act of 1952 for the making of supplementary grants by local authorities to grantees under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, and the very fine summer of 1955 have all made their contribution to the stimulation of housing activities in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I am quite gratified to seek these extra funds and I feel that the House will welcome my asking them for such laudable purposes.</P>

      <P>Is comhartha maith é go bhfuil breis airgid á chur ar fáil ag an Aire chun na tithe so Ghaeltacht do mhéadú agus chun iad do d'fheabhsú.  Tá súil agam go rachaidh an caiteachas seo i méid leis na blianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very heartening thought and a heartening fact that the amount of moneys being expended under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts has been increased in the past year.  It is very significant that the Minister, having budgeted <Col N="105" /> for an expenditure of £80,000, now has to come and ask the House to sanction expenditure in the current year of £100,000.  For many years past we have been listening to <i>olagóns</i> about conditions in the Gaeltacht but at last we can see here a ray of hope that there has been some stimulus given to the people living in the Gaeltacht to help to improve their housing conditions.  The Minister has acknowledged the fact that the 1953 Gaeltacht Housing (Amendment) Act has contributed its share to this increase in expenditure, and when the Act was being put through this House in the form of a Bill the Minister, I think, readily acknowledged that it would have this effect.</P>
    <P>The position about Gaeltacht Housing is rather a difficult one and it has some very big snags that the Minister did not advert to in introducing this Supplementary Estimate.  I do not think he was called upon to do so but nevertheless when that last Bill was going through the House much comment was made on some alleged defects in the existing code.  The main comment was that in order to qualify for a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Act one must already have a house, a house that would be replaced by a new house.  It was urged on both sides of the House on that occasion that that obligation should no longer be persisted in, that it would tend towards the better population of the Gaeltacht areas.  On the other hand, the official attitude had to be pointed out, that the giving of the benefit of Gaeltacht housing grants to people who did not already have a house would tend to accentuate the congestion problem that undoubtedly exists in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>In introducing that Bill I admitted as candidly as I could that at that stage I could not make up my mind whether that obligation should be removed or not.  But having regard to the fact that, in some areas at least, increased employment might be given by new industrial activities, little though they might be, perhaps when such a time comes there would be no further need for the obligation of being the owner of an existing house in order to qualify to receive a Gaeltacht <Col N="106" /> housing grant to build a new one.  I do not know whether the problem has become more acute in the past two years or not, but, if it has, I am sure the Minister will readily face up to the problem of discharging this obligation and permitting people who would otherwise qualify for a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts to receive a grant even though they were not the occupiers of a house already.</P>
    <P>There is, possibly, at the present time rather an anomaly in that the scheduled areas under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts embrace counties as far removed from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht as Louth and Cavan.  These people, under existing legislation, can qualify for the extra benefits that are given under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts provided only that the inspectors are satisfied that Irish is the normal spoken language in the household.  The ordinary Housing Act grants are attractive enough for people who are living in areas far removed from the Gaeltacht to encourage them either to reconstruct their existing houses where they need reconstruction or to build new ones and all the money that is being provided in this Estimate and that will be provided in subsequent years by this House on the Estimates for this service should be canalised as much as possible to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas in the West.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that canalisation of itself will not facilitate to a very large extent the building of more houses or the reconstruction of more houses in the Gaeltacht areas, but I feel the time has come when the area of administration, so to speak, of these Acts should be recast so as to ensure that the maximum benefit will be given to the areas for which they were originally designed, that is, Gaeltacht areas and to the houses in these areas in which the Irish language is spoken as the ordinary daily language.</P>
    <P>These are the two main bones of contention, when one comes to speak of Gaeltacht Acts, but it is particularly gratifying that some of the provisions that were introduced in the 1953 Amendment Bill, such as the grants for the provision of piped water and the grants for the provision of extra accommodation for visitors in Gaeltacht <Col N="107" /> areas, have been availed of to a large extent.  It was one of the problems that I saw when I had responsibility for Gaeltacht areas in inducing young people from city and urban areas to spend their holidays in the Gaeltacht for the purpose of learning the language that accommodation was often very limited and some of the limited accommodation was not up to the standard one would desire.  I hope the progress that has been made in this aspect, first in providing extra accommodation for young people going to the Gaeltacht to learn the language and, secondly, in the installation of water systems in Gaeltacht houses will be maintained and continued and that the holiday in the Gaeltacht, apart from achieving its fundamental objective of promoting the language, will also have the effect of encouraging these people to return and enjoy further holidays in the same surroundings and atmosphere.</P>
    <P>It is of doubtful value if young people, having gone one year, as a result of receiving a scholarship from a vocational committee or county board of the G.A.A. and spending a month or so in the Gaeltacht for the purpose of learning the language and having enjoyed a good time, forget not only the fact that they had the holiday but also the language as it was spoken in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>If this amendment has the effect of encouraging more young people and facilitating more young people to go to the Gaeltacht areas to learn the language and to repeat their visits in adolescence, and perhaps adult years, it will have served a more than useful purpose and will have realised its objective possibly far in excess of what was conceived.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister has had occasion to come to the House to ask for £20,000 extra expenditure for the current year and, having regard to this experience, that the provision he will have to make in future years will be ever-increasing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on the progress that has been made in the acceleration of improvements in the Gaeltacht housing sphere <Col N="108" /> and I trust that that acceleration will continue until such time as we can be satisfied that people who live in the Gaeltacht and speak our own language there will have as good living accommodation as is being provided in the larger towns and cities.</P>

I, too, would like to comment on certain aspects of the Minister's request for increased moneys for a very good purpose, increased house building in the Gaeltacht areas.  I should like to comment briefly on the need for further extension of water supplies in the Gaeltacht.  An attempt has been made recently to bring the supply to Aran Islands. Unfortunately, in one case the water was brought to the end of a village and no further.  I should like the Minister to note that case because Aran is a tourist centre and in a tourist centre water supply is very necessary.</P>
      <P>I should also like to draw the attention of the Minister to the need for additional staff at the Custom House in Galway with a view to expediting the payments of grants.  Tribute, indeed, is due to the small staff that are there for the manner in which they handle the work.</P>

    <P>Chuir mé féin síos air anuiridh nuair bhí Meastachán Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta os comhair na Dála agus thagair mé do cheist na dtithe agus dúirt mé go raibh contúirt ann gur gearr go gcuirfeadh Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe deireadh le deontais fhorlíontacha. Ar ndóigh, tugadh fógra go hoifigiúil i nGaillimh go mb'fhéidir go dtarlódh sé sin agus scaipmuid féin, Teachtaí Dála agus Comhairleoirí Conndae, scaipmuid an scéal ar fud na gcontaethe i measc na ndaoine a bhí ag braith ar chur isteach ar dheontais tithe agus spreagadh iad faoi dhul ar aghaidh leis na h-iarratais.  Bhí faitíos orthu go stopfaí na deontais fhorlíontacha agus chuireadar deis orthu féin dul ar aghaidh leis an obair a bhí fágtha ar an méar fhada acu le tamall roimhe sin agus sin cúis anspeisialta ar fad le go raibh tuille daoine ag cur isteach ar na deontais seo le tamall anuas.</P>
    <P>Do rinneadh tagairt faoi an Acht Leasuithe, 1953, chun deontas a thabhairt do dhaoine sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht le haghaidh seomra sa bhreis ar chur lena dtithe.  Bhí rud den tsaghas sin san chéad Acht Cuartaíochta a tháinig i bhfeidhm roimh an cogadh ach níos tugadh chun críche ariamh é.  Ní dhearna an Bord Cuartaíochta rud ar bith faoi agus bhíomar ag súil go dtiocfadh sé i bhfeidhm i bhfad roimhe seo.  Slí mhaith chun airgead a thabhairt isteach sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht a bhí ins na hiarrachtai chun cuairteoirí a mhealladh isteach ann sa samhradh. Deanann sé sin dhá rud&mdash;tugann sé tuilleadh daoine ag scaipead airgid sa Ghaeltacht agus ag foghluim teangan. Le gairid do léigh mé scéal i gceann de na páipéirí Gaeilge ag tabhairt tuairisc faoi léacht a thug duine as an bhFíor-Ghaeltacht.  Dubhairt an fear sin gur féidir i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh ar an gcaoi seo do leas a Gaeltachta agus ceapaimse go bhfuil a lán den fhírinne aige.</P>
    <P>Is mór an truaigh nár ghlac an tAire leis an gcomhairle a tugadh dó sa Teach seo chun deontais a thabhairt le <Col N="110" /> tithe do dhéanamh ar ghabhaltais nach bhfuil aon sórt tí orra cheana. Do rinne an Teachta Seán Ó Loingsigh tagairt don rud céana, i dtaobh cás an fhir a bhfuil gabháltas talún aige gan aon teach sa Gaeltacht&mdash;gur chóir go mbeadh deontas ar fáil ag an bhfear sin chun teach a chur suas.  Do rinne mé féin tagairt don rud céanna nuair a tháinig an tAire isteach anseo don chéad uair mar Aire.  Do mhínigh mé dó an uair sin cás amháin a cuireadh os mo chomhair.  Do chuir an tAire ceist orm faoi agus dúairt sé go raibh na daoine i gceist i dteideal deontas tí a fháil.  Dúairt mise nach raibh an cás amhlaidh mar nach raibh sean-teach ar an ngabháltas ach d'fhreagair an tAire go mbreathnódh sé isteach sa gceist ach na miontuairiscí a bheith os a chomhair.  Dúairt sé go raibh an duine sin i dteideal deontas do réir an dlí mar bhí sé.</P>
    <P>Níl mé ag caint tré mo hata anois mar tá an scéal sin breactha síos i dTuairiscí an Tí seo, agus taispeanann sé gur féidir le Aire Rialtais botún a dhéanamh nuair atá sé ag caint faoi nithe a bhaineas lena Roinn féin.  Bhí orm an uair sin glacadh leis na rudaí a dúairt an tAire mar b'aige a bhí an chumhacht.  Gan leasuithe san Acht, ní bheadh aon duine nach raibh sean-teach aige i dteideal deontas.  Ceapaimse gur rud amaideach é sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh cuidiú agus cabhair le fáil ag duine a dheannódh gabháltas talún sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil sean-teach air cheana nó a dhéanfadh gabhaltas ar Phortach nó criathrach le allus a ghruadh.  Is é mo thuairimse go mba cheart deontas a chur ar fáil do dhuine mar sin chun teach nua a chur suas.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil muid ag tabhairt don Aire anois ach £20,000 agus caithfidh mé buíochas a ghlacadh leat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, mar gheall ar an gcead a thug tú dhom an aguisín seo a thabhairt isteach.

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's <Col N="111" /> proposal to extend the Housing Acts in the Gaeltacht.  I am interested in the remarks in regard to water supply schemes in Gaeltacht districts and I would like to get further information if it is possible.  Would the schemes envisaged by the Minister be independent schemes carried on through grants made available direct from the Department or would the Minister's Department co-operate with the local authorities in operating water supply schemes in Gaeltacht districts? I have in mind areas in south Kerry where Kerry County Council are contemplating carrying out schemes in these Gaeltacht districts but I am aware also that we would require assistance from the Department. Would it be possible in connection with these schemes that the Department could co-operate with the local bodies and arrange <i>pro rata</i> for the cost of the schemes?  It would be an ideal system if the County Council and the Minister's Department could, through their joint efforts, initiate the schemes I have referred to and put them into operation in the Gaeltacht districts.</P>
      <P>I mention that because even with the best intentions the local authority would not be able, over a period of years, to cope with all the requirements of the Gaeltacht with regard to water supply schemes, but if the Department could co-operate and make it possible to supplement the moneys available to the local authority for that type of work I think it would be a great step forward.  If the Minister could see his way to meet the people in that way I would be glad if he would elaborate on the point when replying.</P>

Mar adúirt mé cheana, sílim go bhfuil tuilte ag na daoine atá ina gcónaí sa Gaelthacht gach rud is féidir leis an dTeach seo a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
      <P>I am glad indeed to hear that Deputies on both sides are of one mind on this subject.  The people who live in the Gaeltacht areas in the main are far removed from the city and from many amenities that people in other areas enjoy.  They have preserved the Gaelic language and the Gaelic culture and they are entitled to any special consideration that this House might afford to them.  It is pleasing, therefore, that the Minister has come along this evening and has asked for an additional £20,000 for housing purposes.</P>
      <P>I would like to offer this particular little bit of criticism with regard to the erection of houses in Gaeltacht areas.  Generally speaking, we find that most of the houses that are erected in the Gaeltacht are, shall I say, stereotyped and mainly of the one pattern.  If people who are erecting houses or proposing to erect houses could be encouraged to vary the type of house in that area I think it would be very desirable.  It is a well-known fact that many tourists from abroad visit these areas as a matter of interest and I think it would be most desirable as I said already, if the style of house could be varied somewhat.  I think the housing officers could play a big part in that regard but the lead should come from the top, I think, from the Minister's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, on the question of the provision of water and other amenities, I would like to say these should be encouraged all round.  I think most people in the Gaeltacht areas have already made provision for water to their homes&mdash;I think the Department is very insistent on that.  As I said at the outset, it is due to those people to consider the many difficulties they have to contend with because of their small, uneconomic holdings and to consider, as Deputy Bartley said, that these people have to reclaim land to try to eke out a livelihood on poor holdings and many of them have to emigrate to England and America.  I <Col N="113" /> think it is only right and proper that every encouragement that could be offered should be offered to them.  I am glad that the Minister felt prevailed on to come into this House with this Estimate.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal mainly with the portion of the last Act which compels the applicant for a grant under Gaeltacht Services to have an existing house in the Gaeltacht.  That was referred to by Deputy Jack Lynch at the time the legislation was going through the House as being a moot point but I do not think that any doubt exists now in the minds of Deputies but that that position should be remedied.  I have in mind people who live in the Gaeltacht and look for a Gaeltacht grant and are refused because they cannot show that they are replacing an existing hovel.  However, they can apply for a local government grant and be successful in getting it but they are then penalised by the amount of the difference between the two grants.  I think that Deputies from all sides of the House would support the Minister in any amendments he may introduce to ensure that that anomaly is removed.</P>
      <P>I may say that this regulation has not been very rigidly enforced but I have seen cases of people born and reared in the Gaeltacht who subsequently found employment elsewhere and when they retired and desired to come back and live in their retirement in their native district and applied for the Gaeltacht grant to provide themselves with a little bungalow they were refused.  They had to go for the local government grant which is much less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also the case, referred to by Deputy Bartley, of a man whose son wished to settle down in the Gaeltacht but who wished for the time being to leave the house to his parents. To my own knowledge cases of that kind have succeeded in getting the grant but I also know of cases which <Col N="114" /> have been turned down and that proves that all is not well with the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Everybody will be in agreement that more money has to be provided for this most useful service.  It is a most useful service for the people in the Gaeltacht and its usefulness is proved by the fact that it is being availed of to a great extent.</P>
    <P>The installation of water is a very commendable scheme which might be further developed.  Most Gaeltacht areas are blessed with scenic beauties and the people who come there to study the language could combine their visits with a holiday if suitable accommodation were available in the vicinity of the colleges.  Perhaps the new Minister for the Gaeltacht will find that a suitable line to pursue if grants are more readily available.  I think it is not completely out of order to suggest that the success of that scheme is an indication that it is the right direction in which to move.  I have mentioned the case in which many people could combine their language studies with a real summer holiday in the midst of the scenic beauties which lie to a large extent along the coast.  These places are very suitable for summer holidays but for the fact that the proper accommodation is not available.  One of the things that prevent people from taking that type of holiday is that they are working all the year round and they do not feel equal to going to the Gaeltacht to study the language on their holidays.  If the proper accommodation were available they could combine their studies and their holidays.</P>
    <P>Those are the two points I wish to mention.  While we all welcome the fact that it is necessary to provide extra money as a result of more applications being made, I think the obstacle which prevents many people from taking advantage of the Gaeltacht grants is the fact that an old house must be replaced by a new building.  I do not think it should be open to everybody to get a Gaeltacht grant in order to build a house at the seaside but we could have legislation drafted to provide for those who have their roots in the Gaeltacht areas, <Col N="115" /> people who were born there and whose parents were born there.  Any provision for that type of person would have the full support of the House and would find no obstacle in going through.</P>

      <P>Just 15 months ago when the Estimate was being prepared we thought that £80,000 under subhead F was quite sufficient to meet the demands for new housing grants and improvement grants.  In fact that figure of £80,000 has fallen very short, so much so that the £20,000 I am asking the House for now will be fully expended by the end of this month.  It is, as all the Deputies who have spoken said, a pleasant thing to spend money for the Gaeltacht at any time.  It is the one particular area for which the Dáil has never cavilled at the expenditure of money.  All the speakers in the debate made particular reference to the fact that, under a provision of the earliest Gaeltacht Housing Act an applicant in order to qualify for a grant must replace an old house by a new one.  For the information of Deputies that goes back to Section 3 of the 1929 Act, the original Act.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, in the opinion of the Minister, a dwelling-house in the Gaeltacht is wholly unsuitable for the proper and healthy accommodation of the occupier thereof and his family, the Minister may, subject to the provisions of this Act and regulations made by the Minister thereunder, make to the occupier of such dwelling-house a grant ... towards the erection, on the site of such dwelling-house or on another site, of a new dwelling-house in substitution for such first-mentioned dwelling-house.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strange thing is that while there was a number of amending Acts passed since, one in 1931, one in 1934, one in 1939, one in 1949, and again in 1953&mdash;none of them repealed that section. I fully agree with the Deputies who said that whatever danger there may have been in 1929, that danger is now passed.  While I am not promising <Col N="116" /> to bring in amending legislation in ease of the provisions of that section I can assure the Deputies, particularly those who are interested in the Gaeltacht, that that provision will be stretched to the very limit as far as I am concerned, even to the point of breaking the law.  I fully agree with the Deputies who said that the provisions of that section are a little bit too stringent.  It is too stringent and the danger the Minister of the day saw when he put in that provision is now past.  If the farmer's son that Deputy Bartley mentioned gets married&mdash;he being an Irish speaker&mdash; to an Irish-speaking wife, I think it is a pity he should not get a little bit of encouragement by way of grants under the Gaeltacht Housing Act to help him settle down in the Gaeltacht.  I do not think that would create a slum. Indeed, there is such a flight from the land the danger is that the Gaeltacht will become depopulated.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies mentioned water.  I think Deputy Flynn, of Kerry, confused public water supply with the fact that there is a grant of £50 available to anybody building a new house or reconditioning an old one for water and sanitation.  I think that has been confused with the work that normally falls to local authorities in providing water supplies for towns and villages. We do not do that and I do not hold out any hope that the Gaeltacht Services Division of the Department of Lands will ever engage in that work. It is outside their sphere.  It comes more properly under the jurisdiction of the particular local authority.  The provision of water in towns and villages is a matter for the local authority and we will leave it to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara referred to the fact that the houses in the Gaeltacht are a little bit stereotyped.  That is true, but we have no objection to a little variety being provided.  As a matter of fact, I would welcome a little bit of variety in houses in the Gaeltacht areas.  If people come along with an improved plan or one for a more picturesque dwelling-house, we will welcome it.  The fact that we give a grant towards the house does not mean that we insist on a particular type of house. If anyone building a house goes to the <Col N="117" /> trouble of getting a better plan, or an improved plan, we will be only too glad to sanction it.  I wish to thank the Deputies who have spoken so nicely on this Estimate.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>16.  Before sub-section (5) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5) The board may require the club to contribute towards the general expenses of the board to assist it in fulfilling its functions under this Act such proportion of the net revenue of the club as in the opinion of the board is reasonable. &mdash;(Deputy O'Malley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion when we were discussing this amendment it was pointed out that the Irish Coursing Club, referred to here as the club, because of all the operations for which it would be responsible and having regard to the fact that there will be a variety of fees accruing, the board should have the right in the course of its operations to secure from the club a contribution towards its financial requirements in the same way as the board under the Bill will be able to get fees from the public through the bookmakers.  It can get fees from the racetracks.  It will in time have a profit from the totalisator but, notwithstanding these particular incomes, it may still require an additional income; and, rather than put it in the position of having to vary upwards the fees from the other groups concerned, it should be entitled to inquire from time to time into the financial position of the club and ask the club to make a contribution towards the board's general expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not say here that the board &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  In other cases there is a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in it.  The bookmakers will have to collect from the public, under what one may describe as a statutory <Col N="118" /> obligation, fees called &ldquo;levies&rdquo; towards the board's requirements.  The racetracks will have to pay.  There will be a percentage from the tote.</P>
    <P>In two cases the public is affected. I do not know all the sources of revenue the club will have.  I understand, as far as I can understand the Bill, they will continue to operate their sports paper.  That will probably show a profit.  I think it is the only paper of its kind circulated amongst those who are interested in greyhounds, in breeding and ownership, to say nothing of those who have litters for sale.  All these have to pay for advertising space in relation to what they have for sale or service.</P>
    <P>Greyhound owners have to register their dogs with this club and pay a fee. Every single regulation laid down for the bringing about of absolute control and protection, if you like, for the public generally with regard to breeding, ownership and the running of dogs &mdash;all of these things come within the ambit of the operations of the club and from every one of these activities, licensing and so on, there is a fee. Consequently, I think the Minister might agree that this amendment is a reasonable one and one that should be accepted by him.  I cannot quite remember what the Minister's argument against it was on the last occasion, but he did indicate that he was not favourably disposed towards this particular introduction into the Bill.  I do not know on what grounds, however, and consequently I feel that there should be some more discussion on it instead of lightly passing it over. It is of vital importance to the success of the board, seeing that the board has to provide a substantial amount of money for its own operations and for the payment of its officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise as the mover of this amendment.  Unfortunately, I was unable to be present and Deputy Briscoe very kindly moved it on my behalf.  The previous speakers on this side of the House have carried out my task in a far more able manner than I would have, and I have just a few points to add.  Deputy Briscoe mentioned that he could not recall offhand <Col N="119" /> what exactly the Minister's objections to this amendment were on the last occasion.  The first objection the Minister had was that it was unconstitutional, but I think that point has been dealt with and it does not arise further.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when replying later on to the debate, said he would not accept the amendment and that he had nothing to add to what Deputy Finlay had said because he had covered all the points which the Minister would make.  Deputy Finlay had the wrong end of the stick altogether.  He seems to be under the impression that we wish, through this amendment, to have a levy imposed yearly on the Irish Coursing Club.  That is not so, and the amendment makes it very clear that it is only in certain circumstances that the board shall have the right to seek a contribution.  They may never seek it but we wish through this amendment that they should have the right in certain circumstances. That is why the words &ldquo;may ... contribute&rdquo; are in the amendment, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board may require the club to contribute towards the general expenses of the board to assist it in fulfilling its functions under this Act such proportion of the net revenue of the club as, in the opinion of the board, is reasonable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I say, Deputy Finlay had the wrong end of the stick.  We are not advocating a levy, as Deputy MacEntee said. It is a most reasonable amendment. It is an amendment which, in the course of time, the nucleus of the board might be very glad was inserted if the Minister even at this late stage would consider accepting it or bringing in his own amendment on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time could come when, for instance, the Irish Coursing Club could have very great assets.  Their income might increase by a very large amount. I agree that the trend in the past number of years would not give that indication.  In fact, the revenue of the Irish Coursing Club is on the downgrade.  However, with coursing <Col N="120" /> put, as the Minister himself said, on a sound financial and proper footing, the greyhound industry will benefit considerably and become a major industry. It follows, therefore, that the Irish Coursing Club will obtain very much increased revenue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay, the Minister said, covered to his satisfaction the points which he would have made.  Supposing for the sake of argument that the <i>Sporting Press</i> and the other subsidiaries of the Irish Coursing Club continue to flourish, that they double the amount of revenue which they are earning and which is pretty substantial at the present time, the possibility is that this surplus will not be put to the best use to which it could be.  Under this Bill the Irish Coursing Club take control of the assets of the Irish Coursing Club, the <i>Sporting Press</i> and Powerstown Park, Ltd., and trustees are appointed to see that that is administered in a proper manner.  At paragraph 8 of the Schedule there is a provision as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(i) There shall be a sub-committee of the executive committee (in this constitution referred to as the finance sub-committee) with responsibility for keeping under review the financial affairs of the club and its subsidiary interests (including Powerstown Park, Ltd. and the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Ltd.) and for making reports and recommendations thereon to the executive committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 13 of the Schedule says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The property and assets of the club and its subsidiary interests (including Powerstown Park, Ltd. and the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Ltd.) shall be vested in trustees appointed by the club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I want to know is where will the money go that the Irish Coursing Club will undoubtedly accumulate as a result of the passing of this Bill?  The greyhound industry is going to be put on a proper basis.  To what purpose is this increased revenue to be devoted?  I agree they have their own expenses which are pretty high but not withstanding that fact, the Minister himself <Col N="121" /> on the last occasion when the Bill was being debated drew attention to the matter when he told Deputy MacEntee to read on in regard to the payment of income-tax of nearly £5,000.</P>
    <P>When it suits the Minister and his advisers the report of the advisory committee is quoted, adopted and incorporated in this Bill.  There was a specific recommendation by the advisory committee that the Irish Coursing Club should contribute to the board.  The Minister was very happy to quote me on a previous occasion on this Bill.  He flattered me in relation to a remark I made that any fool could get up here and criticise but that it took a good man to say what should be done.  One of the problems the Minister was faced with in this Bill and in setting up the board was to find the wherewithal by which the board could operate.  That is the reason for the imposition of the levy on the bookmakers and the reason why the totalisator was introduced under this Bill.  These are the two major sources of revenue.  The Minister wants the funds.  Without those two sources, the board could not possibly operate.</P>
    <P>While I agree that the contribution of the Irish Coursing Club from their profits might be only a drop in the ocean, nevertheless, I think it is a very reasonable amendment whereby the board may require them to pay in a certain year a specific amount from that profit.  It might not happen next year; it may not happen in ten years' time; it might never happen but the time could come when the board might be very anxious and very glad to have the powers which this amendment would give them.</P>
    <P>The more revenue obtained by the board, the lesser the levy on bookmakers, which, in fact, is indirectly a levy on the punter, and the lesser will be the burden borne by the public.</P>
    <P>While I agree that under the Bill the board has power to make contributions to racetracks, nevertheless there is a very strict limit to their powers. For the sake of argument, if the Irish Coursing Club in a certain year have a net profit of £10,000, to what purpose is that £10,000 to be devoted?  Is it to <Col N="122" /> be put aside for a lean year?  As far as I can see, the lean years are over. Under the Bill a proper balance sheet has to be prepared from now on.  The board, having examined the balance sheet, could say: &ldquo;The Irish Coursing Club can very well afford to contribute £x to us, the board, and, as a result of that, we can give certain alleviation to the general public attending greyhound tracks or we can assist the owners by giving increased stake money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must not forget that, notwithstanding any amendment to this Bill, the Irish Coursing Club will still be, under this Bill, the controlling body, with four out of seven members and surely these four out of seven will have control.  If the Minister accepts this amendment, they, as members of the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;and if they are not on the executive committee they cannot be on the board&mdash;will not do anything which would be to the detriment of the club, that is, the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the advisory committee&mdash;Deputy MacEntee went into more detail than I&mdash;were very concerned and very definite that the club should contribute to the board.  It is a vicious circle.  On every amendment and at every stage of the Bill the cant of the Minister will be, &ldquo;If I do not get the money, the whole thing will collapse.&rdquo;  I am giving him a certain source from which he might get the money if he were put to the pin of his collar.  It is a very lenient amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Deputy Finlay was his mouthpiece and expressed the thoughts and the words of the Minister as if he himself were speaking.  Deputy Finlay was of the opinion that this amendment and the people who spoke for it on this side of the House sought a levy and an annual charge.  That is not the case.  It is a very simple and reasonable amendment, the first line of which says, &ldquo;The board may require the club to contribute towards the expenses...&rdquo;&mdash;nothing less and nothing more.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to Deputy O'Malley for his intervention.  I thought at the beginning he was inclined to say that his amendment envisaged empowering the board to receive gifts from the Irish Coursing Club.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, no reason why the Irish Coursing Club should not contribute to the board at any time it pleases them but the distinction made by Deputy O'Malley between a levy and a compulsory contribution is too fine for me to understand and I cannot see any justification for giving the board power to levy on the funds of the Irish Coursing Club. I think the Deputy will agree with me that unless the other sources of revenue for the board prove sufficient to carry out the improvements we all have in mind, the prospect of their being able to levy on the assets of the Irish Coursing Club a sum sufficient to achieve our purpose is remote indeed and I can see no merit in the proposal that the board should have that right to levy on the income or revenue of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
      <P>The matter has been discussed at considerable length but I should like to try to deal specifically with the case made by Deputy O'Malley.  I think his proposal is a levy inasmuch as it gives power to the board to require a contribution to be made as often as they want.  I do not see how he can say that this is an eminently desirable thing when he goes on to say that there is a majority drawn from the members of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club on the board and, therefore, he says, the board will not levy on the Irish Coursing Club if the Irish Coursing Club do not want them to levy but, if that is so, cannot he leave it to the Irish Coursing Club voluntarily to contribute?</P>

I do not think there is substance in his belief that a situation could arise in which any levy could be made upon the Irish Coursing Club which would be <Col N="124" /> sufficient for the purposes of the board and if he envisages a situation in which the board was put to the pin of its collar and turned as a last resort to a levy on the Irish Coursing Club, I believe that would be a wholly ineffective procedure because the levy they could conceivably make, having regard to the assets of the Irish Coursing Club, or their possible assets, could not conceivably materially affect the resources which the board will require if they are successfully to operate this legislation.</P>

I see no justification for the proposal to give the board statutory power to impose a levy as on the Irish Coursing Club, and I am afraid I must refuse to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I said, the reply given by the Minister for Agriculture, when I called his attention to this last week, was that the Irish farmer had the opportunity of having access to <Col N="126" /> wheaten offals from any part of the world where they could be most cheaply bought, free of duty.  That was his statement, but in looking up the trade returns I find that the average price of offals imported into this country during the past 12 months was £24 10s. per ton.  The price of home offals, if we take it in August of 1954, was £20 per ton.  I take it that was the economic price of home offals at that period.  Due to the activities of the present Government by a reduction in the price of wheat by £5 per ton those offals should be available to the farmers to-day at £18 per ton.  If the price of imported offals was £24 10s. one would expect, if the Minister was doing his job or if he was not anxious to collar this money from the pig producers, that he would say: &ldquo;We have one lot at £24 10s. and another lot at £18.  We will level up and sell them at £22.&rdquo; Instead of that I find that the prices of wheaten offals were, in February, 1955, £27 10s.; March, 1955, £27 10s.  There was a drop in May, 1955, to £26 10s. and the price continued around £26 10s. until January, 1956, when it went to £25 10s.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture also informed me that the price of pig ration was reduced.  In September, 1954, pig ration was sold at £30 per ton and it continued at £30 per ton up to January, 1955.  It increased to £31 in February; in March to £32; and in April, 1955, to £32 10s.  It dropped, then, to £31, and then up to £30 10s. at present.  That is 10/- higher than it was in September, 1954.  There is no reduction in that, but when the Minister for Agriculture was putting an enforced reduction on the barley growers of this country, his cry was that he had to consider the man feeders.  &ldquo;I have to consider the man feeding the pigs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;therefore, I will not fix any price higher than 40/- per barrel for feeding barley.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He took £4 per ton off the barley growers of this country by that enforced reduction.  He used that cheaper barley for the purpose of extracting at the other end money to pay for the flour subsidy.  That is the way the Minister worked his manæuvres.  Now <Col N="127" /> we have cries from everybody in the House from the Taoiseach down for increased agricultural production.  Why, they ask, does the farmer not produce more?  They say that the only hope for this country is an increased agricultural production.</P>

      <P>The activities of this Government in that line in particular are shown here in the trade statistics returns.  They are a very pretty lesson as regards agricultural production in this country.  I am confining myself in this instance to the particular purposes for which those offals are used.  The number of sows for breeding purposes from 1954 to 1955 has dropped by 19,757.  The total number of pigs has dropped by 159,476.  You have practically a 20 per cent. reduction in the number of sows and 16.6 per cent. reduction in the total number of pigs. The Minister for Agriculture, again in reply to me&mdash;I had better not misquote him&mdash;as reported at column 964 of Volume 154 of the Official Report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The fall in pig production has resulted from a reduction in the price for pigment exports to Britain following the reduction during the past two years of 31/- per cwt. deadweight in the guaranteed price for British home produced pigs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One would think that if the Minister for Agriculture had the slightest interest in pig production, or in the protection of the people who are producing pigs, he would say to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce: &ldquo;Now look, you must stop robbing the pig producer; you cannot continue increasing the price of the pig producer's offals artificially.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is now sitting as mute as a mouse while the pig producers of this country are being robbed of £617,000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might take a bit of interest in the matter for the sake of the pig producers in his constituency. Those are facts which can be found in the Minister's own statement in this House.  His statement was that the receipts of the flour millers have been increased by £617,000 by increasing the price of home offals to the level of imported offals.  Surely, if the Minister for Agriculture has any further interest in the unfortunate agricultural community that he is supposed to represent in this House, he would take some steps to prevent his colleague from carrying on this kind of game.  The Minister for Agriculture admitted here that there was depression in the pig industry.  He gave as the reason for the 20 per cent. decrease in the number of sows in 12 months the reduction in the price of pigs.</P>
      <P>One would think that if there was a reduction in the price of pigs there would follow a reduction in the price of pig ration, which could have been decreased by £6 a ton without any loss. It was not reduced.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce continued to extract his pound of flesh apparently with the full approval of the guardian of agriculture.  That is the position of affairs here.  Were the Parties opposite joking and was the Taoiseach joking when he appealed to the agricultural community to increase production? The Minister for Agriculture himself tells us here that he wants more pigs and more pig production so that, I suppose, he could sell more offals at a profit of £6 a ton to the Exchequer. Is that not where the money is going? I want to be clear on one thing.  This money, got in increased receipts by flour millers through the simple expedient of increasing the price of home offals to that of foreign offals, is going to the flour millers.  It is used by the Government to maintain the reduced subsidy on flour.  It helps to save the Exchequer the money it would have to pay otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> In plain language, flour is being subsidised to-day, not by the Department but by the pig breeder of this country, by the man who produces the pig and fattens it.  He is the man who is subsidising the flour.  If you have any doubt about that you can see the Minister's own statement in the House on the matter.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated in this House on the 23rd March, 1955, that it was originally calculated that the reduction in the prices of flour and bread from the 1st May, 1954, would be approximately £900,000.  In actual fact the reduction was to cost £927,000 against which could be offset items amounting to £550,000, leaving £372,000 to be provided under this sub-head. The chief offsetting item is receipts by flour millers from the sale of wheat and offals, over and above the amount originally estimated.</P>

      <P>The price increased to £26 a ton in February this year so that <Col N="130" /> a further £170,000 resulted from increased sales by the millers.  That amount went to offset the £927,000 that we were to find for the flour subsidy.  When I anxious to find the total amount collected in this way, I put down a question a fortnight ago and then on the Adjournment I got the probable amount of the subsidy payable for the financial year to August, 1955, as £431,000 and from September, 1955, to the 1st February, 1956, as another £186,000.  So that, out of the total of £927,000, £617,000 is being contributed by the pig breeders of this country.</P>
      <P>I have often heard my colleague, Deputy MacEntee, and other city Deputies wondering how they would get income-tax out of a farmer, but Deputy Norton has found a way to get income-tax out of the pig breeder that he will never forget.  This is income-tax, surtax and all the other taxes on top of them, so much so that he has driven the pig breeder out of production and lost to this nation in 12 months over £3,000,000 worth of pigs. I wonder, Sir, did this matter ever come up before the Executive Council and did the gentleman paid to act as guardian of agricultural interests in this State make any protest in regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister who is supposed to be the guardian of agricultural interests in this State, ever make any protest to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in this matter?  This matter evidently has continued up to the 1st February this year and, from the reports I have got from the merchants and the millers, the increases have continued since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My argument is that, even if they were so caught out for cash that they had to make a dive into the pockets of the pig breeders, one would think that when they found out the result of it, when they found out that the pig breeder had given up keeping pigs, that they would have made some effort to put a stop to it by the simple expedient of reducing the £26 per ton <Col N="131" /> which they are charging the pig breeder to £3.</P>
    <P>There is another very extraordinary thing about these offals which I cannot understand.  We were told that the price of wheat was reduced on account of the cheapness of foreign wheat coming in.  If foreign wheat can come in so much cheaper, how is it that the skin of the wheat cannot come in cheaply as well?  How is it that I have to pay from £24 10s. to £26 a ton for foreign offals, for what is left after the flour is extracted from the wheat?  We would not have to pay that to the foreigner if the 159,000 acres of wheat which were driven out of production in this country last year were allowed to be grown here.  There would be no need then to import offals at £24 10s. a ton.</P>
    <P>More is being paid for the offals than is being paid the farmer for his wheat. Of course, that is economics, as practised by the mixum-gatherum across the floor.  Had I got any kind of assurance, as I expected to get an assurance, from the Minister that this robbery would cease when I put down the question, I would have been satisfied.  I would have been satisfied, for instance, if I found that they did this only for a few months in order to help the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind.  It is not worrying me.  But there is the result of it.  If there was ever a tale of woe written on increased production here it was written by the Central Statistics Office when dealing with the activities in agriculture of the Government opposite.  I would advise the Cabinet to go down and read that document and study it.  If the Ministers are blameless and if they are not carrying <Col N="132" /> out a definite policy to reduce production rather than to increase production they will change their tune. Nobody but a madman would carry on the activity that has been carried on in Industry and Commerce in relation to this particular item.  Nobody with any brains would do what has been done.</P>
      <P>It has been insinuated by the Minister that this had been done before ever he had responsibility.  Mark you, when the number of pigs was 958,321 in 1954 the Irish farmer was getting 82/6 per barrel of wheat and 48/- per barrel for his barley.  I happen to have had the misfortune of being on two deputations to the present Minister in connection with the price of barley.  On each occasion he held up his hands in holy horror and said: &ldquo;I have to think of the small farmer with the 15 acres and the five children&rdquo;&mdash; those were his words&mdash;&ldquo;who is depending on the fattening of his pigs for a livelihood.&rdquo;  That was the stick used by the Minister for Agriculture to depress the price of the farmers' barley by £4 per ton.</P>
      <P>Having depressed the price of barley by £4 per ton, he then gave a tip to his brother-in-arms, the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, how to find a very easy £500,000, and the £4 per ton that was taken off the farmer, instead of being transferred to the poor farmer with the 15 acres, the wife and five children, was transferred to the Exchequer to reduce the flour subsidy.  That is where the money went.  Where then was the Minister's sympathy and his deep interest in the poor farmer with the 15 acres and the five children? Where was his interest then?  What did he do to protect that farmer and his livelihood when the price of his pig was reduced, in his own words, by 31/6 per cwt.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did he do to protect the farmer?  Even though the Minister for Industry and Commerce may have silenced him and made him mute as a mouse, surely there was some court of appeal.  He could have appealed to the Taoiseach to stop the daftness, as he would term it, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Why did he not do so?  Why did he leave this unfortunate <Col N="133" /> small farmer with the 15 acres and the five children thrown off the pig's back and under the sow's belly?  That is what he did with him. Why did he sacrifice him?  He sacrificed him because the Minister for Finance wanted money.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any justification for what has been done in this case.  It was the most scandalous procedure ever adopted.  I would say only one thing to the Minister for Agriculture in relation to it: If he had any decency he would get out, instead of living as a silenced priest in the tabernacle of the inter-Party régime.  He would get out before letting down the people for whom he sheds salt tears, the people of my area who live by tillage, the people who live in an intensive grain-growing area.  These people come looking for an economic price for their produce to find themselves skinned so that the Government may adopt this method of getting funds.  Surely they could find someone better off from whom to extract money instead of extracting it from the small farmer with the wife and five children to support. He is the man they robbed. They did not rob the big farmer in relation to this; they robbed him in the price of barley; they robbed the small man in the price they charged for the pig ration.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pursue this matter further.  I have put the case as fairly as I can and I would like to hear the reason why from someone over there. I do not want to occupy all the time of the House and I will give the people on the other side all the time they want to answer.</P>

One would imagine that the pig was almost extinct in Ireland, but from my own figures there are now 739,000 pigs in the country.  When Deputy Corry's Party left office after 17 glorious years there were 457,000 pigs.  In other words notwithstanding the unfortunate drop in the pig population to which he <Col N="134" /> referred, we are still 282,000 better off than we were when Deputy Corry's Party was in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just in case Deputies might believe the war had something to do with it, let me remind them that the war was over for two years.  In 1945, the number of pigs was 426,000 and in 1948, when Fianna Fáil left office they had succeeded in raising that a mere 30,000.  The second point about it, and a very important point, is that if Deputy Corry went to the Dáil Library and looked up the departmental Orders he would discover that neither the Department of Industry and Commerce nor the Department of Agriculture fixes the price of milling offals and that these milling offals are sold for whatever the miller can get for them.  They are sold in competition with the price in England and in Europe generally.  In other words our farmer, has as good a chance of getting home produced or imported offals at a cheap price as has the Dane, the Dutchman, the Englishman or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general situation, Deputy Corry covered in his motion everything from wheat to pigs.  There is not the slightest doubt that they are interrelated.  As my friend on the far side reminds us, it is very interesting to see what did happen during the war. It is most interesting to observe the Emergency Powers Orders that were passed from 1942 onwards to look after the pig producer and the wheat grower.  It has been proved since that wheat to our total requirements will be grown in this country so long as you pay the farmers.  But during that period, when there was a scarcity of various things, including wheat, the price of wheat and the price of barley &mdash;and barley is the raw material for the pig industry&mdash;was fixed, but for the first time ever since an Irish Government sat in Dáil Éireann&mdash;there was put on the Irish farmers' produce, not a minimum but a maximum price. The maximum price for Irish barley in 1942 was 35/- a barrel, so that you could buy your wheat, and your oats along with it, at 50/- a barrel when <Col N="135" /> there were no fertilisers, no combine drills, no combined harvesters, and when the farmer had to go to C.I.E. and the G.N.R. to have it brought in for him.  The Emergency Powers Order which I quote is No.274 of the 1943 Statutory Rules and Orders.</P>
    <P>In 1944 the same figures continued. The yield in money to the Irish farmer for wheat per statute acre, according to the average price, was £9 15s. and the miximum price for barley was 35/-. As a result the wheat was grown in the worst land.  One did not know where to put it and it was put in the wrong place by price.  Barley was not grown at all and the number of pigs went down from 434,000 in 1943 to 380,000 in 1944, and in 1945 there were only 426,000 pigs.  In 1945 also 55/- was paid for wheat.  Fianna Fáil made quite sure it would be grown and they said they would make the farmers grow it. They made quite sure the farmer would not get the opportunity of making a profit by again putting a maximum price on his barley of 35/- per barrel.</P>
    <P>In 1946, with the war over and the ports open, Fianna Fáil gave 55/- for wheat and a maximum price of 35/- on barley.  In 1947 they gave 55/- for wheat and raised the maximum price on barley to 40/.  Remember, it was a penal offence to pay 41/- a barrel for Irish barley and as a result the pig population in 1947 was 456,000.  In February, 1948, the present Minister for Agriculture came into office and he did two things.  In the first place he removed the maximum price on barley so that it found its natural price. Secondly, he broke the milling ring and made it a fact that any farmer who wished&mdash;of course not many avail of it but it is always there if they want it&mdash; can buy six tons of maize delivered to the nearest railway station at the same price as Banks can buy it.  He broke the ring and made it possible for every farmer in the country to get the raw material for his pig industry at the same price that his counterpart in Denmark, in Holland or in England could get it.</P>
    <P>As a result of that, coupled with the fact that the home-produced offals were supplied at the same price as they <Col N="136" /> could be obtained from abroad, our pig population rose from 456,973 in 1947 to a total in the year 1954, as quoted by Deputy Corry, of 998,000, an estimated figure not yet confirmed.  It is the greatest contribution that has been made to our pig industry.  There has been a recession but that recession has had its effect not only in Ireland but in Great Britain.  The reason for that recession is perfectly obvious, and it is specialisation.  The day of the man with the three pigs and the five pigs is becoming daily more difficult.  That is because with modern pens, with modern feeding techniques and with improved knowledge it is possible for one man to look after many hundreds of pigs penned in the proper way.  As everybody, including Deputy Corry, knows you can get three lots of pigs out each year from the bonham stage if the job is done properly.  The position may be different in Denmark, in Holland and in Britain where the profit may be as low as 10/- a pig.  Our farmers have not become skilled to that extent and our pig production is suffering because our profits are not proportionately large enough to merit the keeping of five, three or two pigs.  That recession, I am certain will end.  I have the utmost confidence in the Irish farmer and I believe he will improve his methods and arrive at the stage when he can compete with the Dane, the Dutchman and the Englishman.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry must thank the Minister, who is the guardian of the farmers of Ireland, in that he very wisely related our pig agreement to the prices paid to the British farmer because that means that for the next three years we can put our pigs into London, Birmingham or anywhere we like as well as, and at as good a rate as, the British farmer and that the Dane is excluded.  There is a 10 per cent. embargo placed on the Dane.  He must pay 10 per cent. duty before he puts his pigs or pigmeat on the British market.  Why was this duty imposed by the British Government?  Because specialisation on the Continent of Europe has brought matters to the stage where, in fact, the Britisher could not compete for his own market and therefore, he also was suffering a recession in his pig trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> With regard to whether or not it is a fact that more was being charged for our offals here than the price at which they could be obtained abroad, I have not got a great number of figures.  I have one.  It is the price of brans and pollards as quoted in the current trade journal.  This, of course, refers to large shipments, c.i.f. at the port of Liverpool, on 8th December, 1955.  These were in shiploads, before they came off the boat, before they were bagged, wholesaled and before they reached the farmer: Argentine pollards, £23, 17s. 6d.; North African pollards, £23 15s.; South African pollards, £25 15s.  In the same month we are supplying our pollards to any farmer who wants them, who calls on any Irish market, at £24 10s.  Why? Because, obviously, the man who wants to buy pollard can buy it better at £24 10s. at the Dublin port or any other mill than he can import it at the price quoted c.i.f. Liverpool.</P>
    <P>If we have our milling offals at the same price as the Englishman, the Dutchman and the Dane, what more can we get?  What did Fianna Fáil ever give?  What did Fine Gael ever give?  We come right back to the infamous procedure in 1952.  In 1952, Deputy Walsh, who, unfortunately, is absent to-night, guaranteed a price of 48/- per barrel for feeding barley.  I would like to see the price guaranteed at 68/- for feeding barley, if such were possible without detriment to any other section of the farming community. Deputy Walsh, in his innocence&mdash;he is a very honest man; I do not want in any way to take from his character or his effort&mdash;went to the millers, employed them and paid them commissions to try and store and to put up all the feeding barley on offer. When the harvest was over and the stocks had been accumulated some test stocks were weighed and it was discovered that all the dried barley there was in that harvest had been used for their own purposes by the millers, to supplant maize in their pig and fowl rations and for milling in their general compounding and that all the wet barley had been sent to the Government, metaphorically, but put into store in the millers' premises at 48/-. In fact, Deputy Walsh had succeeded <Col N="138" /> in losing&mdash;and again I quote the actual figures&mdash;on 36,000 tons of Irish feeding barley, a figure of somewhere between £225,000 and £250,000.</P>
    <P>Here is the salient point.  It comes right back to the question as to whether or not we subsidise pig feed. Having lost that money, I assume he had to go to the Cabinet, of which Deputy MacEntee was a member, and ask for a subsidy on it because the money had to come from somewhere. It had cost, in relation to its equivalent weight of maize, from £225,000 to £250,000 more than an equal quantity of maize.  What happened?  He was told to go and get it off the farmers to whom he gave it.  Instead of getting it from the particular farmers to whom he gave it, all he could do to produce £250,000 was to put a levy on every ton of maize and every ton of barley sold in this country for 18 months, so that every woman who went to the shop and bought a stone of layer's mash and every man who went to the shop and bought a hundredweight of maize paid his levy until Deputy Walsh had recovered the £250,000 with which he had thought to buy the votes of the corngrowers. He is not fooling anybody.</P>
    <P>Is it the fairer thing for the present Minister for Agriculture to say: &ldquo;I will stop all imports of maize?&rdquo; He did stop all imports of maize to the three ports in Cork and Waterford at one stage when the millers in that area were not paying a sufficient price for feeding barley.  Is it the fairer thing for him to say &ldquo;I will stop it?  Do not sell your barley unless you get your price for it and I think it will make more but, if you are stuck with it, I promise you that the worst thing that can happen to you&mdash;and mark you it is a floor, not a price&mdash;is that I will give you £2 a barrel for it.&rdquo;  Is that not the fairer way to do it?  He succeeded in making as much as 45/-.  The miller who paid that had to use it instead of maize and any loss that accrued, accrued to the miller.  The miller had to pay it because he was selling his compounds per week and had to get barley to supplant maize and the present Minister would not allow him to import the maize.  Is that not the fairer situation?  I think it is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> I have mentioned the fact that specialisation abroad has been a factor in this whole situation.  It is relevant to ask what has the present Minister done to help the pig feeder.  I will tell you.  He has instituted pig progeny testing.  While he waits for his pig progency testing station, which cannot be built in a day, he has instituted a pig progency testing section in the Department of Agriculture and reference to last year's Estimate will show that in a small lot of pigs in this country better or as good results have been obtained as have been obtained with the Danish landrace.  Allied with that, he has seen to it that these offals are produced and given to the farmer at an equal price to what the Dane, the Britisher and everybody else are paying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very same argument used by that entire Party. With regard to the price of the rasher of bacon, if the price goes up, there is a shout; if the price goes down, they keep it very quiet.  If the price of offals goes up in the normal way, when the Britisher, the Dane and the Dutchman are paying more, there is one hell of a shout but when the price of offals fluctuates seasonally on the corn markets of Europe and comes down, will Deputy Corry come in then with a motion?  I do not think he will.  As a matter of fact, I am prepared to bet anything in the world that he will not. He will not come in with a motion that will be politically inexpedient.  That is the position.  No other situation can be envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish again briefly to refer to this series of Emergency Powers Orders. Notwithstanding an important recession, there are 280,000 more pigs in this country than there were when Fianna Fáil left office.  The reason for that is that Fianna Fáil deliberately <Col N="140" /> depressed the price of barley during the entire war.  That was done deliberately by Fianna Fáil so that they could get wheat at 50/- and 55/-, which was the price at which they felt they could buy votes.  Deputy Corry would buy a vote with a barrel of wheat all round the country to-day if he got a chance but he will not get it because the truth will precede him.</P>
    <P>That is all I desire to say on the motion except to add that I have the utmost confidence in the farmers of Ireland that they will come from behind&mdash;undoubtedly from behind&mdash;and compete with the Danes, the Dutch and the British in their own field of pig feeding.  So long as the Minister, during the season and after the season, excludes maize from the market and allows the Irish feeding barley to be bought at fair prices and drafted into the pig feeding industry; so long as he allows milling offals to be sold as cheaply here as they are available anywhere in Europe, I have the utmost confidence in the Irish farmers.  I wonder whether Deputy Corry has that confidence or not.  I certainly have it and I believe they will not fail us.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down would, I suppose, claim to represent agricultural interests in this House.  He has just suggested that the Irish farmer should do the same as the Danes are doing and be prepared to take 5/- or 10/- profit on a pig.  But he did not tell the House that the Danes are getting the offals at the price at which they are produced in Denmark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not tell the House that this benevolent Government and this Minister for Industry and Commerce see fit and well to charge the Irish farmer £6 per ton more for wheat offals&mdash;a profit to the Government of £6 per ton.  Wheat offals are costing this country or the millers or the Government, £6 per ton less than the price at which they are being sold back to the farmer.  The farmers of this country and the pig producers are entitled to get those offals at the cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> In September or August of 1954, an extraordinary attitude was taken up by the present Government three months after they had taken office.  The present Taoiseach during the election campaign of 1954 guaranteed to the farmers that commitments in respect of wheat prices by the Fianna Fáil Government would be honoured.  They honoured them in a peculiar way, by cutting the price of wheat by 12/6 per barrel to the farmers.  Following on that announcement the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the connivance, I am sure, of the Minister for Agriculture, decided that the farmers were getting wheat offals too cheaply and that he would charge them £6 per ton more than they were costing, that is for offals from wheat at the reduced price.</P>
    <P>Not satisfied with that, by an Emergeny Powers Order the price of bacon was reduced by the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At the same time, the price of offals went up by £6 per ton, and although in the last 18 months the price of bacon, by Order of the Minister, has been varied at least a half-dozen times, not once in that period did he change the price charged for offals.  The pig producers are entitled to get those offals for what they cost, for what the farmer producing the wheat is paid for them and what it costs the miller to produce them, not at the price at which wheat offals can be imported from the Argentine or any other country.  Consumers of potatoes are entitled to get them at the market price here; similarly people who feed pigs are entitled to get the offals.  There was no authority from this House allowing the Government to charge up to £30 per ton for wheat offals.  It was extraordinary that we had a campaign in 1954 and 1955 suggesting that the price fixed by the Fianna Fáil Government of £32 per ton for wheat was too high, that the country could not afford it, and that wheat was reduced to £28 per ton and then the farmer was charged £26 for the offals coming from that wheat.  We are paying, I understand, up to £30 per ton for imported offals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Emergency Powers Orders were used to reduce the price of bacon to consumers and that was one of the ways in which the cost of living was reduced by the Coalition Government, thereby depressing the price of pigs to the pig producers. When pigs fell by 31/- per cwt., there was no bacon for export.  We are now able to consume all the bacon we produce and the pig prices to producers here are reduced to the prices they pay for subsidised bacon in England. I dare say that could be claimed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that he reduced the price of bacon&mdash;and increased the price of offals at the same time.  Is it any wonder that the number of pigs have fallen in the past 18 months by 159,000?</P>

      <P>That is the luck of the game.  This motion is an important one for the agricultural community; it is an important motion for the nation because the plea has been made to increase production.  Surely the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot claim he has given any aid to increasing agricultural production.  He lent his hand as a member of the Government on reducing the price of wheat and therefore in decreasing the output of that product.  He made special Orders decreasing the price of bacon, thereby decreasing the price paid for pigs to the producers, at the same time he made special Orders increasing the price of offals.  He succeeded in one year in getting over £600,000 into the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I have often heard it said by people who are not farmers that the farmers should be made pay income-tax.  Everyone realises, I feel sure, that there is not a lot of brains or ability among the Coalition Government but I will give them credit for the fact that they can devise ways and means of extracting income-tax from the farmers in such ways as by reducing the price of wheat to the tune of £3,000,000 and by increasing the price of offals by £600,000.  I have not calculated what the reduction of 31/- per cwt. in the price of bacon has cost the farmers.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the farmers of this country who are carrying the biggest burden on their backs under a very hostile Government and a hostile Minister for Industry and Commerce will have been asked to shoulder still more.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce comes in here, proud that he is able to give the people he represents cheaper bacon on their breakfast tables.  He contributed something to the cost-of-living reduction at the expense of the farmers and at the expense of agricultural production.  In a time of normal conditions, he has succeeded in retarding pig production by 19 per cent.  He should be quite proud of his achievement.  The boots must have been changed in the Front Benches of the Government because when they sat there before as a Coalition in 1948, the Minister for Agriculture said that Labour were as mute as mice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was said by the selfsame Minister for Agriculture who is now himself as mute as a mouse.  When the Taoiseach goes down the country appealing for increased agricultural production he should appeal to his second in command to take his hands off one section of the agricultural community&mdash;the small farmers with the 15 acres and the big families who are now producing most of the pigs in the country.  Most of our pig production now is being accomplished in ones, twos and threes by cottiers and agricultural labourers.  The big commercial fattening concerns are gone because they realised that not alone was there no profit for them but that there were big losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have an extraordinary condition for which the Minister is probably <Col N="145" /> not responsible.  We have four grades of pigs going into the factory and only one grade coming out.  I met a woman in a market town who had gone into a large grocery shop looking for grade B bacon.  Her husband had sold a couple of pigs which had been graded B and for which he was paid a price 25/- a cwt. below what he might otherwise have got.  The grocer had told her that he had never heard of the grade.  There is no doubt about it&mdash;and the Minister should appreciate it&mdash;that since he started tinkering with the industry, the bacon factories have made colossal fortunes.</P>

      <P>Perhaps not, but it is relevant to the fact that there has been a 19 per cent. reduction in pig production in 18 months, due to the benevolent Government.  I do not know what answer the Minister can make, apart from the stock one used by Deputy Donegan that the Minister is entitled to adjust the price of offals produced here to that charged for foreign offals. When Deputy Walsh was Minister he arranged that, if the price of home offals was £23 a ton and the price of the foreign commodity was £26, that the farmers would get offals at £24 10s. a ton.</P>

The Government does not get £600,000 out of it but because a section of the farming community, which is producing bacon, is comprised of small farmers they must be penalised.  The farmers are being penalised by the cutting of the price of an important cereal which they grow and for which Fianna Fáil paid £32 a ton.  We did not think there was anything wrong in paying £32 a ton for full wheat but this Government cut it down to the price which you have to pay for pollard from the Argentine.  That is all that the farmer in this country is allowed for wheat. He was growing too much of it. Thousands of tons of maize, pollard and bran are coming into this country and no one can deny that whole wheat would have made as good a pig feed as pollard or bran from the Argentine.  It is better worth £32 a ton for feeding to pigs than pollard from the Argentine at £26 a ton.  Can Deputy Donegan deny that?</P>

He asserted that for the next three years we will get the same price for our pigs as the British farmers get for theirs.  He asks: &ldquo;What else do we want?&rdquo;  What else do we want but the same price for the pigs that the British farmers are getting and that the Danes and Poles are not getting? The Minister for Agriculture knows that the Danes, who are exporting bacon to the British market, are getting their offals in Denmark at whatever price these offals are produced in Denmark.  The Danish Government is more concerned about its farmers than in the collection for the Exchequer of about £600,000 a year at the pig producers' expense.  It is no wonder that agricultural production is falling in this country.  The Minister has had to fall back on the Emergency Powers Regulations that I have heard him condemn time and time again.
